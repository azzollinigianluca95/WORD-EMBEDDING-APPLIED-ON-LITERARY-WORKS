 first book

 the argument
 god sends his angel to tortosa down
 godfrey unites the christian peers and knights
 and all the lords and princes of renown
 choose him their duke to rule the wares and fights
 he mustereth all his host whose number known
 he sends them to the fort that sion hights
 the aged tyrant juda's land that guides
 in fear and trouble to resist provides


 i
 the sacred armies and the godly knight
 that the great sepulchre of christ did free
 i sing much wrought his valor and foresight
 and in that glorious war much suffered he
 in vain 'gainst him did hell oppose her might
 in vain the turks and morians armed be
 his soldiers wild to brawls and mutinies prest
 reduced he to peace so heaven him blest

 ii
 o heavenly muse that not with fading bays
 deckest thy brow by the heliconian spring
 but sittest crowned with stars' immortal rays
 in heaven where legions of bright angels sing
 inspire life in my wit my thoughts upraise
 my verse ennoble and forgive the thing
 if fictions light i mix with truth divine
 and fill these lines with other praise than thine

 iii
 thither thou know'st the world is best inclined
 where luring parnass most his sweet imparts
 and truth conveyed in verse of gentle kind
 to read perhaps will move the dullest hearts
 so we if children young diseased we find
 anoint with sweets the vessel's foremost parts
 to make them taste the potions sharp we give
 they drink deceived and so deceived they live

 iv
 ye noble princes that protect and save
 the pilgrim muses and their ship defend
 from rock of ignorance and error's wave
 your gracious eyes upon this labor bend
 to you these tales of love and conquest brave
 i dedicate to you this work i send
 my muse hereafter shall perhaps unfold
 your fights your battles and your combats bold

 v
 for if the christian princes ever strive
 to win fair greece out of the tyrants' hands
 and those usurping ismaelites deprive
 of woful thrace which now captived stands
 you must from realms and seas the turks forth drive
 as godfrey chased them from juda's lands
 and in this legend all that glorious deed
 read whilst you arm you arm you whilst you read

 vi
 six years were run since first in martial guise
 the christian lords warraid the eastern land
 nice by assault and antioch by surprise
 both fair both rich both won both conquered stand
 and this defended they in noblest wise
 'gainst persian knights and many a valiant band
 tortosa won lest winter might them shend
 they drew to holds and coming spring attend

 vii
 the sullen season now was come and gone
 that forced them late cease from their noble war
 when god almighty form his lofty throne
 set in those parts of heaven that purest are
 as far above the clear stars every one
 as it is hence up to the highest star
 looked down and all at once this world beheld
 each land each city country town and field

 viii
 all things he viewed at last in syria stayed
 upon the christian lords his gracious eye
 that wondrous look wherewith he oft surveyed
 men's secret thoughts that most concealed lie
 he cast on puissant godfrey that assayed
 to drive the turks from sion's bulwarks high
 and full of zeal and faith esteemed light
 all worldly honor empire treasure might

 ix
 in baldwin next he spied another thought
 whom spirits proud to vain ambition move
 tancred he saw his life's joy set at naught
 so woebegone was he with pains of love
 boemond the conquered folk of antioch brought
 the gentle yoke of christian rule to prove
 he taught them laws statutes and customs new
 arts crafts obedience and religion true

 x
 and with such care his busy work he plied
 that to naught else his acting thoughts he bent
 in young rinaldo fierce desires he spied
 and noble heart of rest impatient
 to wealth or sovereign power he naught applied
 his wits but all to virtue excellent
 patterns and rules of skill and courage bold
 he took from guelpho and his fathers old

 xi
 thus when the lord discovered had and seen
 the hidden secrets of each worthy's breast
 out of the hierarchies of angels sheen
 the gentle gabriel called he from the rest
 'twixt god and souls of men that righteous been
 ambassador is he forever blest
 the just commands of heaven's eternal king
 'twixt skies and earth he up and down doth bring

 xii
 to whom the lord thus spake "godfredo find
 and in my name ask him why doth he rest
 why be his arms to ease and peace resigned
 why frees he not jerusalem distrest
 his peers to counsel call each baser mind
 let him stir up for chieftain of the rest
 i choose him here the earth shall him allow
 his fellows late shall be his subjects now"

 xiii
 this said the angel swift himself prepared
 to execute the charge imposed aright
 in form of airy members fair imbared
 his spirits pure were subject to our sight
 like to a man in show and shape he fared
 but full of heavenly majesty and might
 a stripling seemed he thrive five winters old
 and radiant beams adorned his locks of gold

 xiv
 of silver wings he took a shining pair
 fringed with gold unwearied nimble swift
 with these he parts the winds the clouds the air
 and over seas and earth himself doth lift
 thus clad he cut the spheres and circles fair
 and the pure skies with sacred feathers clift
 on libanon at first his foot he set
 and shook his wings with rory may dews wet

 xv
 then to tortosa's confines swiftly sped
 the sacred messenger with headlong flight
 above the eastern wave appeared red
 the rising sun yet scantly half in sight
 godfrey e'en then his morndevotions said
 as was his custom when with titan bright
 appeared the angel in his shape divine
 whose glory far obscured phoebus' shine

 xvi
 "godfrey" quoth he "behold the season fit
 to war for which thou waited hast so long
 now serves the time if thou o'erslip not it
 to free jerusalem from thrall and wrong
 thou with thy lords in council quickly sit
 comfort the feeble and confirm the strong
 the lord of hosts their general doth make thee
 and for their chieftain they shall gladly take thee

 xvii
 "i messenger from everlasting jove
 in his great name thus his behests do tell
 oh what sure hope of conquest ought thee move
 what zeal what love should in thy bosom dwell"
 this said he vanished to those seats above
 in height and clearness which the rest excel
 down fell the duke his joints dissolved asunder
 blind with the light and strucken dead with wonder

 xviii
 but when recovered he considered more
 the man his manner and his message said
 if erst he wished now he longed sore
 to end that war whereof he lord was made
 nor swelled his breast with uncouth pride therefore
 that heaven on him above this charge had laid
 but for his great creator would the same
 his will increased so fire augmenteth flame

 xix
 the captains called forthwith from every tent
 unto the rendezvous he them invites
 letter on letter post on post he sent
 entreatance fair with counsel he unites
 all what a noble courage could augment
 the sleeping spark of valor what incites
 he used that all their thoughts to honor raised
 some praised some paid some counselled all pleased

 xx
 the captains soldiers all save boemond came
 and pitched their tents some in the fields without
 some of green boughs their slender cabins frame
 some lodged were tortosa's streets about
 of all the host the chief of worth and name
 assembled been a senate grave and stout
 then godfrey after silence kept a space
 lift up his voice and spake with princely grace

 xxi
 "warriors whom god himself elected hath
 his worship true in sion to restore
 and still preserved from danger harm and scath
 by many a sea and many an unknown shore
 you have subjected lately to his faith
 some provinces rebellious long before
 and after conquests great have in the same
 erected trophies to his cross and name

 xxii
 "but not for this our homes we first forsook
 and from our native soil have marched so far
 nor us to dangerous seas have we betook
 exposed to hazard of so far sought war
 of glory vain to gain an idle smook
 and lands possess that wild and barbarous are
 that for our conquests were too mean a prey
 to shed our bloods to work our souls' decay

 xxiii
 "but this the scope was of our former thought
 of sion's fort to scale the noble wall
 the christian folk from bondage to have brought
 wherein alas they long have lived thrall
 in palestine an empire to have wrought
 where godliness might reign perpetual
 and none be left that pilgrims might denay
 to see christ's tomb and promised vows to pay

 xxiv
 "what to this hour successively is done
 was full of peril to our honor small
 naught to our first designment if we shun
 the purposed end or here lie fixed all
 what boots it us there wares to have begun
 or europe raised to make proud asia thrall
 if our beginnings have this ending known
 not kingdoms raised but armies overthrown

 xxv
 "not as we list erect we empires new
 on frail foundations laid in earthly mould
 where of our faith and country be but few
 among the thousands stout of pagans bold
 where naught behoves us trust to greece untrue
 and western aid we far removed behold
 who buildeth thus methinks so buildeth he
 as if his work should his sepulchre be

 xxvi
 "turks persians conquered antiochia won
 be glorious acts and full of glorious praise
 by heaven's mere grace not by our prowess done
 those conquests were achieved by wondrous ways
 if now from that directed course we run
 the god of battles thus before us lays
 his loving kindness shall we lose i doubt
 and be a byword to the lands about

 xxvii
 "let not these blessings then sent from above
 abused be or split in profane wise
 but let the issue correspondent prove
 to good beginnings of each enterprise
 the gentle season might our courage move
 now every passage plain and open lies
 what lets us then the great jerusalem
 with valiant squadrons round about to hem

 xxviii
 "lords i protest and hearken all to it
 ye times and ages future present past
 hear all ye blessed in the heavens that sit
 the time for this achievement hasteneth fast
 the longer rest worse will the season fit
 our sureties shall with doubt be overcast
 if we forslow the siege i well foresee
 from egypt will the pagans succored be"

 xxix
 this said the hermit peter rose and spake
 who sate in counsel those great lords among
 "at my request this war was undertake
 in private cell who erst lived closed long
 what godfrey wills of that no question make
 there cast no doubts where truth is plain and strong
 your acts i trust will correspond his speech
 yet one thing more i would you gladly teach

 xxx
 "these strifes unless i far mistake the thing
 and discords raised oft in disordered sort
 your disobedience and ill managing
 of actions lost for want of due support
 refer i justly to a further spring
 spring of sedition strife oppression tort
 i mean commanding power to sundry given
 in thought opinion worth estate uneven

 xxxi
 "where divers lords divided empire hold
 where causes be by gifts not justice tried
 where offices be falsely bought and sold
 needs must the lordship there from virtue slide
 of friendly parts one body then uphold
 create one head the rest to rule and guide
 to one the regal power and sceptre give
 that henceforth may your king and sovereign live"

 xxxii
 and therewith stayed his speech o gracious muse
 what kindling motions in their breasts do fry
 with grace divine the hermit's talk infuse
 that in their hearts his words may fructify
 by this a virtuous concord they did choose
 and all contentions then began to die
 the princes with the multitude agree
 that godfrey ruler of those wars should be

 xxxiii
 this power they gave him by his princely right
 all to command to judge all good and ill
 laws to impose to lands subdued by might
 to maken war both when and where he will
 to hold in due subjection every wight
 their valors to be guided by his skill
 this done report displays her telltale wings
 and to each ear the news and tidings brings

 xxxiv
 she told the soldiers who allowed him meet
 and well deserving of that sovereign place
 their first salutes and acclamations sweet
 received he with love and gentle grace
 after their reverence done with kind regreet
 requited was with mild and cheerful face
 he bids his armies should the following day
 on those fair plains their standards proud display

 xxxv
 the golden sun rose from the silver wave
 and with his beams enamelled every green
 when up arose each warrior bold and brave
 glistering in filed steel and armor sheen
 with jolly plumes their crests adorned they have
 and all tofore their chieftain mustered been
 he from a mountain cast his curious sight
 on every footman and on every knight

 xxxvi
 my mind time's enemy oblivion's foe
 disposer true of each noteworthy thing
 oh let thy virtuous might avail me so
 that i each troop and captain great may sing
 that in this glorious war did famous grow
 forgot till now by time's evil handling
 this work derived from my treasures dear
 let all times hearken never age outwear

 xxxvii
 the french came foremost battailous and bold
 late led by hugo brother to their king
 from france the isle that rivers four infold
 with rolling streams descending from their spring
 but hugo dead the lily fair of gold
 their wonted ensign they tofore them bring
 under clotharius great a captain good
 and hardy knight ysprong of princes' blood

 xxxviii
 a thousand were they in strong armors clad
 next whom there marched forth another band
 that number nature and instruction had
 like them to fight far off or charge at hand
 all valiant normans by lord robert lad
 the native duke of that renowned land
 two bishops next their standards proud upbare
 called reverend william and good ademare

 xxxix
 their jolly notes they chanted loud and clear
 on merry mornings at the mass divine
 and horrid helms high on their heads they bear
 when their fierce courage they to war incline
 the first four hundred horsemen gathered near
 to orange town and lands that it confine
 but ademare the poggian youth brought out
 in number like in hard assays as stout

 xl
 baldwin his ensign fair did next dispread
 among his bulloigners of noble fame
 his brother gave him all his troops to lead
 when he commander of the field became
 the count carinto did him straight succeed
 grave in advice well skilled in mars his game
 four hundred brought he but so many thrice
 led baldwin clad in gilden arms of price

 xli
 guelpho next them the land and place possest
 whose fortunes good with his great acts agree
 by his italian sire fro the house of est
 well could he bring his noble pedigree
 a german born with rich possessions blest
 a worthy branch sprung from the guelphian tree
 'twixt rhene and danubie the land contained
 he ruled where swaves and rhetians whilom reigned

 xlii
 his mother's heritage was this and right
 to which he added more by conquest got
 from thence approved men of passing might
 he brought that death or danger feared not
 it was their wont in feasts to spend the night
 and pass cold days in baths and houses hot
 five thousand late of which now scantly are
 the third part left such is the chance of war

 xliii
 the nation then with crisped locks and fair
 that dwell between the seas and arden wood
 where mosel streams and rhene the meadows wear
 a battel soil for grain for pasture good
 their islanders with them who oft repair
 their earthen bulwarks 'gainst the ocean flood
 the flood elsewhere that ships and barks devours
 but there drowns cities countries towns and towers

 xliv
 both in one troop and but a thousand all
 under another robert fierce they run
 then the english squadron soldiers stout and tall
 by william led their sovereign's younger son
 these archers be and with them come withal
 a people near the northern pole that wone
 whom ireland sent from loughs and forests hoar
 divided far by sea from europe's shore

 xlv
 tancredi next nor 'mongst them all was one
 rinald except a prince of greater might
 with majesty his noble countenance shone
 high were his thoughts his heart was bold in fight
 no shameful vice his worth had overgone
 his fault was love by unadvised sight
 bred in the dangers of adventurous arms
 and nursed with griefs with sorrows woes and harms

 xlvi
 fame tells that on that everblessed day
 when christian swords with persian blood were dyed
 the furious prince tancredi from that fray
 his coward foes chased through forests wide
 till tired with the fight the heat the way
 he sought some place to rest his wearied side
 and drew him near a silver stream that played
 among wild herbs under the greenwood shade

 xlvii
 a pagan damsel there unwares he met
 in shining steel all save her visage fair
 her hair unbound she made a wanton net
 to catch sweet breathing from the cooling air
 on her at gaze his longing looks he set
 sight wonder wonder love love bred his care
 o love o wonder love new born new bred
 now groan now armed this champion captive led

 xlviii
 her helm the virgin donned and but some wight
 she feared might come to aid him as they fought
 her courage earned to have assailed the knight
 yet thence she fled uncompanied unsought
 and left her image in his heart ypight
 her sweet idea wandered through his thought
 her shape her gesture and her place in mind
 he kept and blew love's fire with that wind

 xlix
 well might you read his sickness in his eyes
 their banks were full their tide was at the flow
 his help far off his hurt within him lies
 his hopes unstrung his cares were fit to mow
 eight hundred horse from champain came he guies
 champain a land where wealth ease pleasure grow
 rich nature's pomp and pride the tirrhene main
 there woos the hills hills woo the valleys plain

 l
 two hundred greeks came next in fight well tried
 not surely armed in steel or iron strong
 but each a glaive had pendant by his side
 their bows and quivers at their shoulders hung
 their horses well inured to chase and ride
 in diet spare untired with labor long
 ready to charge and to retire at will
 though broken scattered fled they skirmish still

 li
 tatine their guide and except tatine none
 of all the greeks went with the christian host
 o sin o shame o greece accurst alone
 did not this fatal war affront thy coast
 yet safest thou an idle lookeron
 and glad attendest which side won or lost
 now if thou be a bondslave vile become
 no wrong is that but god's most righteous doom

 lii
 in order last but first in worth and fame
 unfeared in fight untired with hurt or wound
 the noble squadron of adventurers came
 terrors to all that tread on asian ground
 cease orpheus of thy minois arthur shame
 to boast of lancelot or thy table round
 for these whom antique times with laurel drest
 these far exceed them thee and all the rest

 liii
 dudon of consa was their guide and lord
 and for of worth and birth alike they been
 they chose him captain by their free accord
 for he most acts had done most battles seen
 grave was the man in years in looks in word
 his locks were gray yet was his courage green
 of worth and might the noble badge he bore
 old scars of grievous wounds received of yore
 liv
 after came eustace well esteemed man
 for godfrey's sake his brother and his own
 the king of norway's heir gernando than
 proud of his father's title sceptre crown
 roger of balnavill and engerlan
 for hardy knights approved were and known
 besides were numbered in that warlike train
 rambald gentonio and the gerrards twain

 lv
 ubaldo then and puissant rosimond
 of lancaster the heir in rank succeed
 let none forget obizo of tuscain land
 well worthy praise for many a worthy deed
 nor those three brethren lombards fierce and yond
 achilles sforza and stern palamede
 nor otton's shield he conquered in those stowres
 in which a snake a naked child devours

 lvi
 guascher and raiphe in valor like there was
 the one and other guido famous both
 germer and eberard to overpass
 in foul oblivion would my muse be loth
 with his gildippes dear edward alas
 a loving pair to war among them go'th
 in bond of virtuous love together tied
 together served they and together died

 lvii
 in school of love are all things taught we see
 there learned this maid of arms the ireful guise
 still by his side a faithful guard went she
 one truelove knot their lives together ties
 no would to one alone could dangerous be
 but each the smart of other's anguish tries
 if one were hurt the other felt the sore
 she lost her blood he spent his life therefore

 lviii
 but these and all rinaldo far exceeds
 star of his sphere the diamond of this ring
 the nest where courage with sweet mercy breeds
 a comet worthy each eye's wondering
 his years are fewer than his noble deeds
 his fruit is ripe soon as his blossoms spring
 armed a mars might coyest venus move
 and if disarmed then god himself of love

 lix
 sophia by adige's flowery bank him bore
 sophia the fair spouse to bertoldo great
 fit mother for that pearl and before
 the tender imp was weaned from the teat
 the princess maud him took in virtue's lore
 she brought him up fit for each worthy feat
 till of these wares the golden trump he hears
 that soundeth glory fame praise in his ears

 lx
 and then though scantly three times five years old
 he fled alone by many an unknown coast
 o'er aegean seas by many a greekish hold
 till he arrived at the christian host
 a noble flight adventurous brave and bold
 whereon a valiant prince might justly boast
 three years he served in field when scant begin
 few golden hairs to deck his ivory chin

 lxi
 the horsemen past their voidleft stations fill
 the bands on foot and reymond them beforn
 of tholouse lord from lands near piraene hill
 by garound streams and salt sea billows worn
 four thousand foot he brought well armed and skill
 had they all pains and travels to have borne
 stout men of arms and with their guide of power
 like troy's old town defenced with ilion's tower

 lxii
 next stephen of amboise did five thousand lead
 the men he prest from tours and blois but late
 to hard assays unfit unsure at need
 yet armed to point in wellattempted plate
 the land did like itself the people breed
 the soil is gentle smooth soft delicate
 boldly they charge but soon retire for doubt
 like fire of straw soon kindled soon burnt out

 lxiii
 the third alcasto marched and with him
 the boaster brought six thousand switzers bold
 audacious were their looks their faces grim
 strong castles on the alpine clifts they hold
 their shares and coulters broke to armors trim
 they change that metal cast in warlike mould
 and with this band late herds and flocks that guide
 now kings and realms he threatened and defied

 lxiv
 the glorious standard last to heaven they sprad
 with peter's keys ennobled and his crown
 with it seven thousand stout camillo had
 embattailed in walls of iron brown
 in this adventure and occasion glad
 so to revive the romans' old renown
 or prove at least to all of wiser thought
 their hearts were fertile land although unwrought

 lxv
 but now was passed every regiment
 each band each troop each person worth regard
 when godfrey with his lords to counsel went
 and thus the duke his princely will declared
 "i will when day next clears the firmament
 our ready host in haste be all prepared
 closely to march to sion's noble wall
 unseen unheard or undescried at all

 lxvi
 "prepare you then for travel strong and light
 fierce to the combat glad to victory"
 and with that word and warning soon was dight
 each soldier longing for near coming glory
 impatient be they of the morning bright
 of honor so them pricked the memory
 but yet their chieftain had conceived a fear
 within his heart but kept it secret there

 lxvii
 for he by faithful spial was assured
 that egypt's king was forward on his way
 and to arrive at gaza old procured
 a fort that on the syrian frontiers lay
 nor thinks he that a man to wars inured
 will aught forslow or in his journey stay
 for well he knew him for a dangerous foe
 an herald called he then and spake him so

 lxviii
 "a pinnace take thee swift as shaft from bow
 and speed thee henry to the greekish main
 there should arrive as i by letters know
 from one that never aught reports in vain
 a valiant youth in whom all virtues flow
 to help us this great conquest to obtain
 the prince of danes he is and brings to war
 a troop with him from under the arctic star

 lxix
 "and for i doubt the greekish monarch sly
 will use with him some of his wonted craft
 to stay his passage or divert awry
 elsewhere his forces his first journey laft
 my herald good and messenger well try
 see that these succors be not us beraft
 but send him thence with such convenient speed
 as with his honor stands and with our need

 lxx
 "return not thou but legier stay behind
 and move the greekish prince to send us aid
 tell him his kingly promise doth him bind
 to give us succors by his covenant made"
 this said and thus instruct his letters signed
 the trusty herald took nor longer stayed
 but sped him thence to done his lord's behest
 and thus the duke reduced his thoughts to rest

 lxxi
 aurora bright her crystal gates unbarred
 and bridegroomlike forth stept the glorious sun
 when trumpets loud and clarions shrill were heard
 and every one to rouse him fierce begun
 sweet music to each heart for war prepared
 the soldiers glad by heaps to harness run
 so if with drought endangered be their grain
 poor ploughmen joy when thunders promise rain

 lxxii
 some shirts of mail some coats of plate put on
 some donned a cuirass some a corslet bright
 and halbert some and some a habergeon
 so every one in arms was quickly dight
 his wonted guide each soldier tends upon
 loose in the wind waved their banners light
 their standard royal toward heaven they spread
 the cross triumphant on the pagans dead

 lxxiii
 meanwhile the car that bears the lightning brand
 upon the eastern hill was mounted high
 and smote the glistering armies as they stand
 with quivering beams which dazed the wondering eye
 that phaetonlike it fired sea and land
 the sparkles seemed up to the skies to fly
 the horses' neigh and clattering armors' sound
 pursue the echo over dale and down

 lxxiv
 their general did with due care provide
 to save his men from ambush and from train
 some troops of horse that lightly armed ride
 he sent to scour the woods and forests main
 his pioneers their busy work applied
 to even the paths and make the highways plain
 they filled the pits and smoothed the rougher ground
 and opened every strait they closed found

 lxxv
 they meet no forces gathered by their foe
 no towers defenced with rampire moat or wall
 no stream no wood no mountain could forslow
 their hasty pace or stop their march at all
 so when his banks the prince of rivers po
 doth overswell he breaks with hideous fall
 the mossy rocks and trees o'ergrown with age
 nor aught withstands his fury and his rage

 lxxvi
 the king of tripoli in every hold
 shut up his men munition and his treasure
 the straggling troops sometimes assail he would
 save that he durst not move them to displeasure
 he stayed their rage with presents gifts and gold
 and led them through his land at ease and leisure
 to keep his realm in peace and rest he chose
 with what conditions godfrey list impose

 lxxvii
 those of mount seir that neighboreth by east
 the holy city faithful folk each one
 down from the hill descended most and least
 and to the christian duke by heaps they gone
 and welcome him and his with joy and feast
 on him they smile on him they gaze alone
 and were his guides as faithful from that day
 as hesperus that leads the sun his way

 lxxviii
 along the sands his armies safe they guide
 by ways secure to them well known before
 upon the tumbling billows fraughted ride
 the armed ships coasting along the shore
 which for the camp might every day provide
 to bring munition good and victuals store
 the isles of greece sent in provision meet
 and store of wine from scios came and crete

 lxxix
 great neptune grieved underneath the load
 of ships hulks galleys barks and brigantines
 in all the midearth seas was left no road
 wherein the pagan his bold sails untwines
 spread was the huge armado wide and broad
 from venice genes and towns which them confines
 from holland england france and sicil sent
 and all for juda ready bound and bent

 lxxx
 all these together were combined and knit
 with surest bonds of love and friendship strong
 together sailed they fraught with all things fit
 to service done by land that might belong
 and when occasion served disbarked it
 then sailed the asian coasts and isles along
 thither with speed their hasty course they plied
 where christ the lord for our offences died

 lxxxi
 the brazen trump of ironwinged fame
 that mingleth faithful troth with forged lies
 foretold the heathen how the christians came
 how thitherward the conquering army hies
 of every knight it sounds the worth and name
 each troop each band each squadron it descries
 and threat'neth death to those fire sword and slaughter
 who held captived israel's fairest daughter

 lxxxii
 the fear of ill exceeds the evil we fear
 for so our present harms still most annoy us
 each mind is prest and open every ear
 to hear new tidings though they no way joy us
 this secret rumor whispered everywhere
 about the town these christians will destroy us
 the aged king his coming evil that knew
 did cursed thoughts in his false heart renew

 lxxxiii
 this aged prince ycleped aladine
 ruled in care new sovereign of this state
 a tyrant erst but now his fell engine
 his graver are did somewhat mitigate
 he heard the western lords would undermine
 his city's wall and lay his towers prostrate
 to former fear he adds a newcome doubt
 treason he fears within and force without

 lxxxiv
 for nations twain inhabit there and dwell
 of sundry faith together in that town
 the lesser part on christ believed well
 on termagent the more and on mahown
 but when this king had made this conquest fell
 and brought that region subject to his crown
 of burdens all he set the paynims large
 and on poor christians laid the double charge

 lxxxv
 his native wrath revived with this new thought
 with age and years that weakened was of yore
 such madness in his cruel bosom wrought
 that now than ever blood he thirsteth more
 so stings a snake that to the fire is brought
 which harmless lay benumbed with cold before
 a lion so his rage renewed hath
 though fame before if he be moved to wrath

 lxxxvi
 "i see" quoth he "some expectation vain
 in these false christians and some new content
 our common loss they trust will be their gain
 they laugh we weep they joy while we lament
 and more perchance by treason or by train
 to murder us they secretly consent
 or otherwise to work us harm and woe
 to ope the gates and so let in our foe

 lxxxvii
 "but lest they should effect their cursed will
 let us destroy this serpent on his nest
 both young and old let us this people kill
 the tender infants at their mothers' breast
 their houses burn their holy temples fill
 with bodies slain of those that loved them best
 and on that tomb they hold so much in price
 let's offer up their priests in sacrifice"

 lxxxviii
 thus thought the tyrant in his traitorous mind
 but durst not follow what he had decreed
 yet if the innocents some mercy find
 from cowardice not truth did that proceed
 his noble foes durst not his craven kind
 exasperate by such a bloody deed
 for if he need what grace could then be got
 if thus of peace he broke or loosed the knot

 lxxxix
 his villain heart his cursed rage restrained
 to other thoughts he bent his fierce desire
 the suburbs first flat with the earth he plained
 and burnt their buildings with devouring fire
 loth was the wretch the frenchman should have gained
 or help or ease by finding aught entire
 cedron bethsaida and each watering else
 empoisoned he both fountains springs and wells

 xc
 so wary wise this child of darkness was
 the city's self he strongly fortifies

 second book

 the argument
 ismeno conjures but his charms are vain
 aladine will kill the christians in his ire
 sophronia and olindo would be slain
 to save the rest the king grants their desire
 clorinda hears their fact and fortunes plain
 their pardon gets and keeps them from the fire
 argantes when aletes' speeches are
 despised defies the duke to mortal war


 i
 while thus the tyrant bends his thoughts to arms
 ismeno gan tofore his sight appear
 ismen dead bones laid in cold graves that warms
 and makes them speak smell taste touch see and hear
 ismen with terror of his mighty charms
 that makes great dis in deepest hell to fear
 that binds and looses souls condemned to woe
 and sends the devils on errands to and fro

 ii
 a christian once macon he now adores
 nor could he quite his wonted faith forsake
 but in his wicked arts both oft implores
 help from the lord and aid from pluto black
 he from deep caves by acheron's dark shores
 where circles vain and spells he used to make
 to advise his king in these extremes is come
 achitophel so counselled absalom

 iii
 "my liege" he says "the camp fast hither moves
 the axe is laid unto this cedar's root
 but let us work as valiant men behoves
 for boldest hearts good fortune helpeth out
 your princely care your kingly wisdom proves
 well have you labored well foreseen about
 if each perform his charge and duty so
 nought but his grave here conquer shall your foe

 iv
 "from surest castle of my secret cell
 i come partaker of your good and ill
 what counsel sage or magic's sacred spell
 may profit us all that perform i will
 the sprites impure from bliss that whilom fell
 shall to your service bow constrained by skill
 but how we must begin this enterprise
 i will your highness thus in brief advise

 v
 "within the christian's church from light of skies
 an hidden alter stands far out of sight
 on which the image consecrated lies
 of christ's dear mother called a virgin bright
 an hundred lamps aye burn before her eyes
 she in a slender veil of tinsel dight
 on every side great plenty doth behold
 of offerings brought myrrh frankincense and gold

 vi
 "this idol would i have removed away
 from thence and by your princely hand transport
 in macon's sacred temple safe it lay
 which then i will enchant in wondrous sort
 that while the image in that church doth stay
 no strength of arms shall win this noble fort
 of shake this puissant wall such passing might
 have spells and charms if they be said aright"

 vii
 advised thus the king impatient
 flew in his fury to the house of god
 the image took with words unreverent
 abused the prelates who that deed forbode
 swift with his prey away the tyrant went
 of god's sharp justice naught he feared the rod
 but in his chapel vile the image laid
 on which the enchanter charms and witchcraft said

 viii
 when phoebus next unclosed his wakeful eye
 up rose the sexton of that place profane
 and missed the image where it used to lie
 each where he sough in grief in fear in vain
 then to the king his loss he gan descry
 who sore enraged killed him for his pain
 and straight conceived in his malicious wit
 some christian bade this great offence commit

 ix
 but whether this were act of mortal hand
 or else the prince of heaven's eternal pleasure
 that of his mercy would this wretch withstand
 nor let so vile a chest hold such a treasure
 as yet conjecture hath not fully scanned
 by godliness let us this action measure
 and truth of purest faith will fitly prove
 that this rare grace came down from heaven above

 x
 with busy search the tyrant gan to invade
 each house each hold each temple and each tent
 to them the fault or faulty one bewrayed
 or hid he promised gifts or punishment
 his idle charms the false enchanter said
 but in this maze still wandered and miswent
 for heaven decreed to conceal the same
 to make the miscreant more to feel his shame

 xi
 but when the angry king discovered not
 what guilty hand this sacrilege had wrought
 his ireful courage boiled in vengeance hot
 against the christians whom he faulters thought
 all ruth compassion mercy he forgot
 a staff to beat that dog he long had sought
 "let them all die" quoth he "kill great and small
 so shall the offender perish sure withal

 xii
 "to spill the wine with poison mixed with spares
 slay then the righteous with the faulty one
 destroy this field that yieldeth naught but tares
 with thorns this vineyard all is overgone
 among these wretches is not one that cares
 for us our laws or our religion
 up up dear subjects fire and weapon take
 burn murder kill these traitors for my sake"

 xiii
 this herod thus would bethlem's infants kill
 the christians soon this direful news receave
 the trump of death sounds in their hearing shrill
 their weapon faith their fortress was the grave
 they had no courage time device or will
 to fight to fly excuse or pardon crave
 but stood prepared to die yet help they find
 whence least they hope such knots can heaven unbind

 xiv
 among them dwelt her parents' joy and pleasure
 a maid whose fruit was ripe not overyeared
 her beauty was her not esteemed treasure
 the field of love with plough of virtue eared
 her labor goodness godliness her leisure
 her house the heaven by this full moon aye cleared
 for there from lovers' eyes withdrawn alone
 with virgin beams this spotless cynthia shone

 xv
 but what availed her resolution chaste
 whose soberest looks were whetstones to desire
 nor love consents that beauty's field lie waste
 her visage set olindo's heart on fire
 o subtle love a thousand wiles thou hast
 by humble suit by service or by hire
 to win a maiden's hold a thing soon done
 for nature framed all women to be won

 xvi
 sophronia she olindo hight the youth
 both or one town both in one faith were taught
 she fair he full of bashfulness and truth
 loved much hoped little and desired nought
 he durst not speak by suit to purchase ruth
 she saw not marked not wist not what he sought
 thus loved thus served he long but not regarded
 unseen unmarked unpitied unrewarded

 xvii
 to her came message of the murderment
 wherein her guiltless friends should hopeless starve
 she that was noble wise as fair and gent
 cast how she might their harmless lives preserve
 zeal was the spring whence flowed her hardiment
 from maiden shame yet was she loth to swerve
 yet had her courage ta'en so sure a hold
 that boldness shamefaced shame had made her bold

 xviii
 and forth she went a shop for merchandise
 full of rich stuff but none for sale exposed
 a veil obscured the sunshine of her eyes
 the rose within herself her sweetness closed
 each ornament about her seemly lies
 by curious chance or careless art composed
 for what the most neglects most curious prove
 so beauty's helped by nature heaven and love

 xix
 admired of all on went this noble maid
 until the presence of the king she gained
 nor for he swelled with ire was she afraid
 but his fierce wrath with fearless grace sustained
 "i come" quoth she "but be thine anger stayed
 and causeless rage 'gainst faultless souls restrained
 i come to show thee and to bring thee both
 the wight whose fact hath made thy heart so wroth"

 xx
 her molest boldness and that lightning ray
 which her sweet beauty streamed on his face
 had struck the prince with wonder and dismay
 changed his cheer and cleared his moody grace
 that had her eyes disposed their looks to play
 the king had snared been in love's strong lace
 but wayward beauty doth not fancy move
 a frown forbids a smile engendereth love

 xxi
 it was amazement wonder and delight
 although not love that moved his cruel sense
 "tell on" quoth he "unfold the chance aright
 thy people's lives i grant for recompense"
 then she "behold the faulter here in sight
 this hand committed that supposed offence
 i took the image mine that fault that fact
 mine be the glory of that virtuous act"

 xxii
 this spotless lamb thus offered up her blood
 to save the rest of christ's selected fold
 o noble lie was ever truth so good
 blest be the lips that such a leasing told
 thoughtful awhile remained the tyrant wood
 his native wrath he gan a space withhold
 and said "that thou discover soon i will
 what aid what counsel had'st thou in that ill"

 xxiii
 "my lofty thoughts" she answered him "envied
 another's hand should work my high desire
 the thirst of glory can no partner bide
 with mine own self i did alone conspire"
 "on thee alone" the tyrant then replied
 "shall fall the vengeance of my wrath and ire"
 "'tis just and right" quoth she "i yield consent
 mine be the honor mine the punishment"

 xxiv
 the wretch of new enraged at the same
 asked where she hid the image so conveyed
 "not hid" quoth she "but quite consumed with flame
 the idol is of that eternal maid
 for so at least i have preserved the same
 with hands profane from being eft betrayed
 my lord the thing thus stolen demand no more
 here see the thief that scorneth death therefor

 xxv
 "and yet no theft was this yours was the sin
 i brought again what you unjustly took"
 this heard the tyrant did for rage begin
 to whet his teeth and bend his frowning look
 no pity youth fairness no grace could win
 joy comfort hope the virgin all forsook
 wrath killed remorse vengeance stopped mercy's breath
 love's thrall to hate and beauty's slave to death

 xxvi
 ta'en was the damsel and without remorse
 the king condemned her guiltless to the fire
 her veil and mantle plucked they off by force
 and bound her tender arms in twisted wire
 dumb was the silver dove while from her corse
 these hungry kites plucked off her rich attire
 and for some deal perplexed was her sprite
 her damask late now changed to purest white

 xxvii
 the news of this mishap spread far and near
 the people ran both young and old to gaze
 olindo also ran and gan to fear
 his lady was some partner in this case
 but when he found her bound stript from her gear
 and vile tormentors ready saw in place
 he broke the throng and into presence brast
 and thus bespake the king in rage and haste

 xxxviii
 "not so not so this grief shall bear away
 from me the honor of so noble feat
 she durst not did not could not so convey
 the massy substance of that idol great
 what sleight had she the wardens to betray
 what strength to heave the goddess from her seat
 no no my lord she sails but with my wind"
 ah thus he loved yet was his love unkind

 xxix
 he added further "where the shining glass
 lets in the light amid your temple's side
 by broken byways did i inward pass
 and in that window made a postern wide
 nor shall therefore this illadvised lass
 usurp the glory should this fact betide
 mine be these bonds mine be these flames so pure
 o glorious death more glorious sepulture"

 xxx
 sophronia raised her modest looks from ground
 and on her lover bent her eyesight mild
 "tell me what fury what conceit unsound
 presenteth here to death so sweet a child
 is not in me sufficient courage found
 to bear the anger of this tyrant wild
 or hath fond love thy heart so overgone
 wouldst thou not live nor let me die alone"

 xxxi
 thus spake the nymph yet spake but to the wind
 she could not alter his wellsettled thought
 o miracle o strife of wondrous kind
 where love and virtue such contention wrought
 where death the victor had for meed assigned
 their own neglect each other's safety sought
 but thus the king was more provoked to ire
 their strife for bellows served to anger's fire

 xxxii
 he thinks such thoughts selfguiltiness finds out
 they scorned his power and therefore scorned the pain
 "nay nay" quoth he "let be your strife and doubt
 you both shall win and fit reward obtain"
 with that the sergeants hent the young man stout
 and bound him likewise in a worthless chain
 then back to back fast to a stake both ties
 two harmless turtles dight for sacrifice

 xxxiii
 about the pile of fagots sticks and hay
 the bellows raised the newlykindled flame
 when thus olindo in a doleful lay
 begun too late his bootless plaints to frame
 "be these the bonds is this the hopedfor day
 should join me to this longdesired dame
 is this the fire alike should burn our hearts
 ah hard reward for lovers' kind desarts

 xxxiv
 "far other flames and bonds kind lovers prove
 but thus our fortune casts the hapless die
 death hath exchanged again his shafts with love
 and cupid thus lets borrowed arrows fly
 o hymen say what fury doth thee move
 to lend thy lamps to light a tragedy
 yet this contents me that i die for thee
 thy flames not mine my death and torment be

 xxxv
 "yet happy were my death mine ending blest
 my torments easy full of sweet delight
 it this i could obtain that breast to breast
 thy bosom might receive my yielded sprite
 and thine with it in heaven's pure clothing drest
 through clearest skies might take united flight"
 thus he complained whom gently she reproved
 and sweetly spake him thus that so her loved

 xxxvi
 "far other plaints dear friend tears and laments
 the time the place and our estates require
 think on thy sins which man's old foe presents
 before that judge that quits each soul his hire
 for his name suffer for no pain torments
 him whose just prayers to his throne aspire
 behold the heavens thither thine eyesight bend
 thy looks sighs tears for intercessors send"

 xxxvii
 the pagans loud cried out to god and man
 the christians mourned in silent lamentation
 the tyrant's self a thing unused began
 to feel his heart relent with mere compassion
 but not disposed to ruth or mercy than
 he sped him thence home to his habitation
 sophronia stood not grieved nor discontented
 by all that saw her but herself lamented

 xxxviii
 the lovers standing in this doleful wise
 a warrior bold unwares approached near
 in uncouth arms yclad and strange disguise
 from countries far but new arrived there
 a savage tigress on her helmet lies
 the famous badge clorinda used to bear
 that wonts in every warlike stowre to win
 by which bright sign well known was that fair inn

 xxxix
 she scorned the arts these silly women use
 another thought her nobler humor fed
 her lofty hand would of itself refuse
 to touch the dainty needle or nice thread
 she hated chambers closets secret news
 and in broad fields preserved her maidenhead
 proud were her looks yet sweet though stern and stout
 her dam a dove thus brought an eagle out

 xl
 while she was young she used with tender hand
 the foaming steed with froary bit to steer
 to tilt and tourney wrestle in the sand
 to leave with speed atlanta swift arear
 through forests wild and unfrequented land
 to chase the lion boar or rugged bear
 the satyrs rough the fauns and fairies wild
 she chased oft oft took and oft beguiled

 xli
 this lusty lady came from persia late
 she with the christians had encountered eft
 and in their flesh had opened many a gate
 by which their faithful souls their bodies left
 her eye at first presented her the state
 of these poor souls of hope and help bereft
 greedy to know as is the mind of man
 their cause of death swift to the fire she ran

 xlii
 the people made her room and on them twain
 her piercing eyes their fiery weapons dart
 silent she saw the one the other 'plain
 the weaker body lodged the nobler heart
 yet him she saw lament as if his pain
 were grief and sorrow for another's smart
 and her keep silence so as if her eyes
 dumb orators were to entreat the skies

 xliii
 clorinda changed to ruth her warlike mood
 few silver drops her vermeil cheeks depaint
 her sorrow was for her that speechless stood
 her silence more prevailed than his complaint
 she asked an aged man seemed grave and good
 "come say me sir" quoth she "what hard constraint
 would murder here love's queen and beauty's king
 what fault or fare doth to this death them bring"

 xliv
 thus she inquired and answer short he gave
 but such as all the chance at large disclosed
 she wondered at the case the virgin brave
 that both were guiltless of the fault supposed
 her noble thought cast how she might them save
 the means on suit or battle she reposed
 quick to the fire she ran and quenched it out
 and thus bespake the sergeants and the rout

 xlv
 "be there not one among you all that dare
 in this your hateful office aught proceed
 till i return from court nor take you care
 to reap displeasure for not making speed"
 to do her will the men themselves prepare
 in their faint hearts her looks such terror breed
 to court she went their pardon would she get
 but on the way the courteous king she met

 xlvi
 "sir king" quoth she "my name clorinda hight
 my fame perchance has pierced your ears ere now
 i come to try my wonted power and might
 and will defend this land this town and you
 all hard assays esteem i eath and light
 great acts i reach to to small things i bow
 to fight in field or to defend this wall
 point what you list i naught refuse at all"

 xlvii
 to whom the king "what land so far remote
 from asia's coasts or phoebus' glistering rays
 o glorious virgin that recordeth not
 thy fame thine honor worth renown and praise
 since on my side i have thy succors got
 i need not fear in these my aged days
 for in thine aid more hope more trust i have
 than in whole armies of these soldiers brave

 xlviii
 "now godfrey stays too long he fears i ween
 thy courage great keeps all our foes in awe
 for thee all actions far unworthy been
 but such as greatest danger with them draw
 be you commandress therefore princess queen
 of all our forces be thy word a law"
 this said the virgin gan her beaver vail
 and thanked him first and thus began her tale

 xlix
 "a thing unused great monarch may it seem
 to ask reward for service yet to come
 but so your virtuous bounty i esteem
 that i presume for to intreat this groom
 and silly maid from danger to redeem
 condemned to burn by your unpartial doom
 i not excuse but pity much their youth
 and come to you for mercy and for ruth

 l
 "yet give me leave to tell your highness this
 you blame the christians them my thoughts acquite
 nor be displeased i say you judge amiss
 at every shot look not to hit the white
 all what the enchanter did persuade you is
 against the lore of macon's sacred rite
 for us commandeth mighty mahomet
 no idols in his temple pure to set

 li
 "to him therefore this wonder done refar
 give him the praise and honor of the thing
 of us the gods benign so careful are
 lest customs strange into their church we bring
 let ismen with his squares and trigons war
 his weapons be the staff the glass the ring
 but let us manage war with blows like knights
 our praise in arms our honor lies in fights"

 lii
 the virgin held her peace when this was said
 and though to pity he never framed his thought
 yet for the king admired the noble maid
 his purpose was not to deny her aught
 "i grant them life" quoth he "your promised aid
 against these frenchmen hath their pardon bought
 nor further seek what their offences be
 guiltless i quit guilty i set them free"

 liii
 thus were they loosed happiest of humankind
 olindo blessed be this act of thine
 true witness of thy great and heavenly mind
 where sun moon stars of love faith virtue shine
 so forth they went and left pale death behind
 to joy the bliss of marriage rites divine
 with her he would have died with him content
 was she to live that would with her have brent

 liv
 the king as wicked thoughts are most suspicious
 supposed too fast this tree of virtue grew
 o blessed lord why should this pharaoh vicious
 thus tyrannize upon thy hebrews true
 who to perform his will vile and malicious
 exiled these and all the faithful crew
 all that were strong of body stout of mind
 but kept their wives and children pledge behind

 lv
 a hard division when the harmless sheep
 must leave their lambs to hungry wolves in charge
 but labor's virtues watching ease her sleep
 trouble best wind that drives salvation's barge
 the christians fled whither they took no keep
 some strayed wild among the forests large
 some to emmaus to the christian host
 and conquer would again their houses lost

 lvi
 emmaus is a city small that lies
 from sion's walls distant a little way
 a man that early on the morn doth rise
 may thither walk ere third hour of the day
 oh when the christian lord this town espies
 how merry were their hearts how fresh how gay
 but for the sun inclined fast to west
 that night there would their chieftain take his rest

 lvii
 their canvas castles up they quickly rear
 and build a city in an hour's space
 when lo disguised in unusual gear
 two barons bold approachen gan the place
 their semblance kind and mild their gestures were
 peace in their hands and friendship in their face
 from egypt's king ambassadors they come
 them many a squire attends and many a groom

 lviii
 the first aletes born in lowly shed
 of parents base a rose sprung from a brier
 that now his branches over egypt spread
 no plant in pharaoh's garden prospered higher
 with pleasing tales his lord's vain ears he fed
 a flatterer a pickthank and a liar
 cursed be estate got with so many a crime
 yet this is oft the stair by which men climb

 lix
 argantes called is that other knight
 a stranger came he late to egypt land
 and there advanced was to honor's height
 for he was stout of courage strong of hand
 bold was his heart and restless was his sprite
 fierce stern outrageous keen as sharpened brand
 scorner of god scant to himself a friend
 and pricked his reason on his weapon's end

 lx
 these two entreatance made they might be heard
 nor was their just petition long denied
 the gallants quickly made their court of guard
 and brought them in where sate their famous guide
 whose kingly look his princely mind declared
 where noblesse virtue troth and valor bide
 a slender courtesy made argantes bold
 so as one prince salute another wold

 lxi
 aletes laid his right hand on his heart
 bent down his head and cast his eyes full low
 and reverence made with courtly grace and art
 for all that humble lore to him was know
 his sober lips then did he softly part
 whence of pure rhetoric whole streams outflow
 and thus he said while on the christian lords
 down fell the mildew of his sugared words

 lxii
 "o only worthy whom the earth all fears
 high god defend thee with his heavenly shield
 and humble so the hearts of all thy peers
 that their stiff necks to thy sweet yoke may yield
 these be the sheaves that honor's harvest bears
 the seed thy valiant acts the world the field
 egypt the headland is where heaped lies
 thy fame worth justice wisdom victories

 lxiii
 "these altogether doth our sovereign hide
 in secret storehouse of his princely thought
 and prays he may in long accordance bide
 with that great worthy which such wonders wrought
 nor that oppose against the coming tide
 of proffered love for that he is not taught
 your christian faith for though of divers kind
 the loving vine about her elm is twined

 lxiv
 "receive therefore in that unconquered hand
 the precious handle of this cup of love
 if not religion virtue be the band
 'twixt you to fasten friendship not to move
 but for our mighty king doth understand
 you mean your power 'gainst juda land to prove
 he would before this threatened tempest fell
 i should his mind and princely will first tell

 lxv
 "his mind is this he prays thee be contented
 to joy in peace the conquests thou hast got
 be not thy death or sion's fall lamented
 forbear this land judea trouble not
 things done in haste at leisure be repented
 withdraw thine arms trust not uncertain lot
 for oft to see what least we think betide
 he is thy friend 'gainst all the world beside

 lxvi
 "true labour in the vineyard of thy lord
 ere prime thou hast the imposed daywork done
 what armies conquered perished with thy sword
 what cities sacked what kingdoms hast thou won
 all ears are mazed while tongues thine acts record
 hands quake for fear all feet for dread do run
 and though no realms you may to thraldom bring
 no higher can your praise your glory spring

 lxvii
 "thy sign is in his apogaeon placed
 and when it moveth next must needs descend
 chance in uncertain fortune double faced
 smiling at first she frowneth in the end
 beware thine honor be not then disgraced
 take heed thou mar not when thou think'st to mend
 for this the folly is of fortune's play
 'gainst doubtful certain much 'gainst small to lay

 lxviii
 "yet still we sail while prosperous blows the wind
 till on some secret rock unwares we light
 the sea of glory hath no banks assigned
 they who are wont to win in every fight
 still feed the fire that so inflames thy mind
 to bring more nations subject to thy might
 this makes thee blessed peace so light to hold
 like summer's flies that fear not winter's cold

 lxix
 "they bid thee follow on the path now made
 so plain and easy enter fortune's gate
 nor in thy scabbard sheathe that famous blade
 till settled by thy kingdom and estate
 till macon's sacred doctrine fall and fade
 till woeful asia all lie desolate
 sweet words i grant baits and allurements sweet
 but greatest hopes oft greatest crosses meet

 lxx
 "for if thy courage do not blind thine eyes
 if clouds of fury hide not reason's beams
 then may'st thou see this desperate enterprise
 the field of death watered with danger's streams
 high state the bed is where misfortune lies
 mars most unfriendly when most kind he seems
 who climbeth high on earth he hardest lights
 and lowest falls attend the highest flights

 lxxi
 "tell me if great in counsel arms and gold
 the prince of egypt war 'gainst you prepare
 what if the valiant turks and persians bold
 unite their forces with cassanoe's heir
 oh then what marble pillar shall uphold
 the falling trophies of your conquest fair
 trust you the monarch of the greekish land
 that reed will break and breaking wound your hand

 lxxii
 "the greekish faith is like that halfcut tree
 by which men take wild elephants in inde
 a thousand times it hath beguiled thee
 as firm as waves in seas or leaves in wind
 will they who erst denied you passage free
 passage to all men free by use and kind
 fight for your sake or on them do you trust
 to spend their blood that could scarce spare their dust

 lxxiii
 "but all your hope and trust perchance is laid
 in these strong troops which thee environ round
 yet foes unite are not so soon dismayed
 as when their strength you erst divided found
 besides each hour thy bands are weaker made
 with hunger slaughter lodging on cold ground
 meanwhile the turks seek succors from our king
 thus fade thy helps and thus thy cumbers spring

 lxxiv
 "suppose no weapon can thy valor's pride
 subdue that by no force thou may'st be won
 admit no steel can hurt or wound thy side
 and be it heaven hath thee such favor done
 'gainst famine yet what shield canst thou provide
 what strength resist what sleight her wrath can shun
 go shake the spear and draw thy flaming blade
 and try if hunger so be weaker made

 lxxv
 "the inhabitants each pasture and each plain
 destroyed have each field to waste is laid
 in fenced towers bestowed is their grain
 before thou cam'st this kingdom to invade
 these horse and foot how canst them sustain
 whence comes thy store whence thy provision made
 thy ships to bring it are perchance assigned
 oh that you live so long as please the wind

 lxxvi
 "perhaps thy fortune doth control the wind
 doth loose or bind their blasts in secret cave
 the sea pardie cruel and deaf by kind
 will hear thy call and still her raging wave
 but if our armed galleys be assigned
 to aid those ships which turks and persians have
 say then what hope is left thy slender fleet
 dare flocks of crows a flight of eagles meet

 lxxvii
 "my lord a double conquest must you make
 if you achieve renown by this emprize
 for if our fleet your navy chase or take
 for want of victuals all your camp then dies
 of if by land the field you once forsake
 then vain by sea were hope of victories
 nor could your ships restore your lost estate
 for steed once stolen we shut the door too late

 lxxviii
 "in this estate if thou esteemest light
 the proffered kindness of the egyptian king
 then give me leave to say this oversight
 beseems thee not in whom such virtues spring
 but heavens vouchsafe to guide my mind aright
 to gentle thoughts that peace and quiet bring
 so that poor asia her complaints may cease
 and you enjoy your conquests got in peace

 lxxix
 "nor ye that part in these adventures have
 part in his glory partners in his harms
 let not blind fortune so your minds deceive
 to stir him more to try these fierce alarms
 but like the sailor 'scaped from the wave
 from further peril that his person arms
 by staying safe at home so stay you all
 better sit still men say than rise to fall"

 lxxx
 this said aletes and a murmur rose
 that showed dislike among the christian peers
 their angry gestures with mislike disclose
 how much his speech offends their noble ears
 lord godfrey's eye three times environ goes
 to view what countenance every warrior bears
 and lastly on the egyptian baron stayed
 to whom the duke thus for his answer said

 lxxxi
 "ambassador full both of threats and praise
 thy doubtful message hast thou wisely told
 and if thy sovereign love us as he says
 tell him he sows to reap an hundred fold
 but where thy talk the coming storm displays
 of threatened warfare from the pagans bold
 to that i answer as my cousin is
 in plainest phrase lest my intent thou miss

 lxxxii
 "know that till now we suffered have much pain
 by lands and seas where storms and tempests fall
 to make the passage easy safe and plain
 that leads us to this venerable wall
 that so we might reward from heaven obtain
 and free this town from being longer thrall
 nor is it grievous to so good an end
 our honors kingdoms lives and goods to spend

 lxxxiii
 "nor hope of praise nor thirst of worldly good
 enticed us to follow this emprise
 the heavenly father keep his sacred brood
 from foul infection of so great a vice
 but by our zeal aye be that plague withstood
 let not those pleasures us to sin entice
 his grace his mercy and his powerful hand
 will keep us safe from hurt by sea and land

 lxxxiv
 "this is the spur that makes our coursers run
 this is our harbor safe from danger's floods
 this is our bield the blustering winds to shun
 this is our guide through forests deserts woods
 this is our summer's shade our winter's sun
 this is our wealth our treasure and our goods
 this is our engine towers that overthrows
 our spear that hurts our sword that wounds our foes

 lxxxv
 "our courage hence our hope our valor springs
 not from the trust we have in shield or spear
 not from the succors france or grecia brings
 on such weak posts we list no buildings rear
 he can defend us from the power of kings
 from chance of war that makes weak hearts to fear
 he can these hungry troops with manna feed
 and make the seas land if we passage need

 lxxxvi
 "but if our sins us of his help deprive
 of his high justice let no mercy fall
 yet should our deaths us some contentment give
 to die where christ received his burial
 so might we die not envying them that live
 so would we die not unrevenged all
 nor turks nor christians if we perish such
 have cause to joy or to complain too much

 lxxxvii
 "think not that wars we love and strife affect
 or that we hate sweet peace or rest denay
 think not your sovereign's friendship we reject
 because we list not in our conquests stay
 but for it seems he would the jews protect
 pray him from us that thought aside to lay
 nor us forbid this town and realm to gain
 and he in peace rest joy long more may reign"

 lxxxviii
 this answer given argantes wild drew nar
 trembling for ire and waxing pale for rage
 nor could he hold his wrath increased so far
 but thus inflamed bespake the captain sage
 "who scorneth peace shall have his fill of war
 i thought my wisdom should thy fury 'suage
 but well you show what joy you take in fight
 which makes you prize our love and friendship light"

 lxxxix
 this said he took his mantle's foremost part
 and gan the same together fold and wrap
 then spake again with fell and spiteful heart
 so lions roar enclosed in train or trap
 "thou proud despiser of inconstant mart
 i bring thee war and peace closed in this lap
 take quickly one thou hast no time to muse
 if peace we rest we fight if war thou choose"

 xc
 his semblance fierce and speechless proud provoke
 the soldiers all "war war" at once to cry
 nor could they tarry till their chieftain spoke
 but for the knight was more inflamed hereby
 his lap he opened and spread forth his cloak
 "to mortal wars" he says "i you defy"
 and this he uttered with fell rage and hate
 and seemed of janus' church to undo the gate

 xci
 it seemed fury discord madness fell
 flew from his lap when he unfolds the same
 his glaring eyes with anger's venom swell
 and like the brand of foul alecto flame
 he looked like huge tiphoius loosed from hell
 again to shake heaven's everlasting frame
 or him that built the tower of shinaar
 which threat'neth battle 'gainst the morning star

 xcii
 godfredo then "depart and bid your king
 haste hitherward or else within short while
 for gladly we accept the war you bring
 let him expect us on the banks of nile"
 he entertained them then with banqueting
 and gifts presented to those pagans vile
 aletes had a helmet rich and gay
 late found at nice among the conquered prey

 xciii
 argant a sword whereof the web was steel
 pommel rich stone hilt gold approved by touch
 with rarest workmanship all forged weel
 the curious art excelled the substance much
 thus fair rich sharp to see to have to feel
 glad was the paynim to enjoy it such
 and said "how i this gift can use and wield
 soon shall you see when first we meet in field"

 xciv
 thus took they congee and the angry knight
 thus to his fellow parleyed on the way
 "go thou by day but let me walk by night
 go thou to egypt i at sion stay
 the answer given thou canst unfold aright
 no need of me what i can do or say
 among these arms i will go wreak my spite
 let paris court it hector loved to fight"

 xcv
 thus he who late arrived a messenger
 departs a foe in act in word in thought
 the law of nations or the lore of war
 if he transgresses or no he recketh naught
 thus parted they and ere he wandered far
 the friendly starlight to the walls him brought
 yet his fell heart thought long that little way
 grieved with each stop tormented with each stay

 xcvi
 now spread the night her spangled canopy
 and summoned every restless eye to sleep
 on beds of tender grass the beasts down lie
 the fishes slumbered in the silent deep
 unheard were serpent's hiss and dragon's cry
 birds left to sing and philomen to weep
 only that noise heaven's rolling circles kest
 sung lullaby to bring the world to rest

 xcvii
 yet neither sleep nor ease nor shadows dark
 could make the faithful camp or captain rest
 they longed to see the day to hear the lark
 record her hymns and chant her carols blest
 they yearned to view the walls the wished mark
 to which their journeys long they had addressed
 each heart attends each longing eye beholds
 what beam the eastern window first unfolds



 third book

 the argument
 the camp at great jerusalem arrives
 clorinda gives them battle in the breast
 of fair erminia tancred's love revives
 he jousts with her unknown whom he loved best
 argant th' adventurers of their guide deprives
 with stately pomp they lay their lord in chest
 godfrey commands to cut the forest down
 and make strong engines to assault the town


 i
 the purple morning left her crimson bed
 and donned her robes of pure vermilion hue
 her amber locks she crowned with roses red
 in eden's flowery gardens gathered new
 when through the camp a murmur shrill was spread
 arm arm they cried arm arm the trumpets blew
 their merry noise prevents the joyful blast
 so hum small bees before their swarms they cast

 ii
 their captain rules their courage guides their heat
 their forwardness he stayed with gentle rein
 and yet more easy haply were the feat
 to stop the current near charybdis main
 or calm the blustering winds on mountains great
 than fierce desires of warlike hearts restrain
 he rules them yet and ranks them in their haste
 for well he knows disordered speed makes waste

 iii
 feathered their thoughts their feet in wings were dight
 swiftly they marched yet were not tired thereby
 for willing minds make heaviest burdens light
 but when the gliding sun was mounted high
 jerusalem behold appeared in sight
 jerusalem they view they see they spy
 jerusalem with merry noise they greet
 with joyful shouts and acclamations sweet

 iv
 as when a troop of jolly sailors row
 some newfound land and country to descry
 through dangerous seas and under stars unknowe
 thrall to the faithless waves and trothless sky
 if once the wished shore begun to show
 they all salute it with a joyful cry
 and each to other show the land in haste
 forgetting quite their pains and perils past

 v
 to that delight which their first sight did breed
 that pleased so the secret of their thought
 a deep repentance did forthwith succeed
 that reverend fear and trembling with it brought
 scantly they durst their feeble eyes dispreed
 upon that town where christ was sold and bought
 where for our sins he faultless suffered pain
 there where he died and where he lived again

 vi
 soft words low speech deep sobs sweet sighs salt tears
 rose from their hearts with joy and pleasure mixed
 for thus fares he the lord aright that fears
 fear on devotion joy on faith is fixed
 such noise their passions make as when one hears
 the hoarse sea waves roar hollow rocks betwixt
 or as the wind in holts and shady greaves
 a murmur makes among the boughs and leaves

 vii
 their naked feet trod on the dusty way
 following the ensample of their zealous guide
 their scarfs their crests their plumes and feathers gay
 they quickly doffed and willing laid aside
 their molten hearts their wonted pride allay
 along their watery cheeks warm tears down slide
 and then such secret speech as this they used
 while to himself each one himself accused

 viii
 "flower of goodness root of lasting bliss
 thou well of life whose streams were purple blood
 that flowed here to cleanse the soul amiss
 of sinful men behold this brutish flood
 that from my melting heart distilled is
 receive in gree these tears o lord so good
 for never wretch with sin so overgone
 had fitter time or greater cause to moan"

 ix
 this while the wary watchman looked over
 from tops of sion's towers the hills and dales
 and saw the dust the fields and pastures cover
 as when thick mists arise from moory vales
 at last the sunbright shields he gan discover
 and glistering helms for violence none that fails
 the metal shone like lightning bright in skies
 and man and horse amid the dust descries

 x
 then loud he cries "o what a dust ariseth
 o how it shines with shields and targets clear
 up up to arms for valiant heart despiseth
 the threatened storm of death and danger near
 behold your foes" then further thus deviseth
 "haste haste for vain delay increaseth fear
 these horrid clouds of dust that yonder fly
 your coming foes does hide and hide the sky"

 xi
 the tender children and the fathers old
 the aged matrons and the virgin chaste
 that durst not shake the spear nor target hold
 themselves devoutly in their temples placed
 the rest of members strong and courage bold
 on hardy breasts their harness donned in haste
 some to the walls some to the gates them dight
 their king meanwhile directs them all aright

 xii
 all things well ordered he withdrew with speed
 up to a turret high two ports between
 that so he might be near at every need
 and overlook the lands and furrows green
 thither he did the sweet erminia lead
 that in his court had entertained been
 since christians antioch did to bondage bring
 and slew her father who thereof was king

 xiii
 against their foes clorinda sallied out
 and many a baron bold was by her side
 within the postern stood argantes stout
 to rescue her if ill mote her betide
 with speeches brave she cheered her warlike rout
 and with bold words them heartened as they ride
 "let us by some brave act" quoth she "this day
 of asia's hopes the groundwork found and lay"

 xiv
 while to her folk thus spake the virgin brave
 thereby behold forth passed a christian band
 toward the camp that herds of cattle drave
 for they that morn had forayed all the land
 the fierce virago would that booty save
 whom their commander singled hand for hand
 a mighty man at arms who guardo hight
 but far too weak to match with her in fight

 xv
 they met and low in dust was guardo laid
 'twixt either army from his sell down kest
 the pagans shout for joy and hopeful said
 those good beginnings would have endings blest
 against the rest on went the noble maid
 she broke the helm and pierced the armed breast
 her men the paths rode through made by her sword
 they pass the stream where she had found the ford

 xvi
 soon was the prey out of their hands recovered
 by step and step the frenchmen gan retire
 till on a little hill at last they hovered
 whose strength preserved them from clorinda's ire
 when as a tempest that hath long been covered
 in watery clouds breaks out with sparkling fire
 with his strong squadron lord tancredi came
 his heart with rage his eyes with courage flame

 xvii
 mast great the spear was which the gallant bore
 that in his warlike pride he made to shake
 as winds tall cedars toss on mountains hoar
 the king that wondered at his bravery spake
 to her that near him seated was before
 who felt her heart with love's hot fever quake
 "well shouldst thou know" quoth he "each christian knight
 by long acquaintance though in armor dight

 xviii
 "say who is he shows so great worthiness
 that rides so rank and bends his lance so fell"
 to this the princess said nor more nor less
 her heart with sighs her eyes with tears did swell
 but sighs and tears she wisely could suppress
 her love and passion she dissembled well
 and strove her love and hot desire to cover
 till heart with sighs and eyes with tears ran over

 xix
 at last she spoke and with a crafty sleight
 her secret love disguised in clothes of hate
 "alas too well" she says "i know that knight
 i saw his force and courage proved late
 too late i viewed him when his power and might
 shook down the pillar of cassanoe's state
 alas what wounds he gives how fierce how fell
 no physic helps them cure nor magic's spell

 xx
 "tancred he hight o macon would he wear
 my thrall ere fates him of this life deprive
 for to his hateful head such spite i bear
 i would him reave his cruel heart on live"
 thus said she they that her complainings hear
 in other sense her wishes credit give
 she sighed withal they construed all amiss
 and thought she wished to kill who longed to kiss

 xxi
 this while forth pricked clorinda from the throng
 and 'gainst tancredi set her spear in rest
 upon their helms they cracked their lances long
 and from her head her gilden casque he kest
 for every lace he broke and every thong
 and in the dust threw down her plumed crest
 about her shoulders shone her golden locks
 like sunny beams on alabaster rocks

 xxii
 her looks with fire her eyes with lightning blaze
 sweet was her wrath what then would be her smile
 tancred whereon think'st thou what dost thou gaze
 hast thou forgot her in so short a while
 the same is she the shape of whose sweet face
 the god of love did in thy heart compile
 the same that left thee by the cooling stream
 safe from sun's heat but scorched with beauty's beam

 xxiii
 the prince well knew her though her painted shield
 and golden helm he had not marked before
 she saved her head and with her axe well steeled
 assailed the knight but her the knight forbore
 'gainst other foes he proved him through the field
 yet she for that refrained ne'er the more
 but following "turn thee" cried in ireful wise
 and so at once she threats to kill him twice

 xxiv
 not once the baron lifts his armed hand
 to strike the maid but gazing on her eyes
 where lordly cupid seemed in arms to stand
 no way to ward or shun her blows he tries
 but softly says "no stroke of thy strong hand
 can vanquish tancred but thy conquest lies
 in those fair eyes which fiery weapons dart
 that find no lighting place except this heart"

 xxv
 at last resolved although he hoped small grace
 yet ere he did to tell how much he loved
 for pleasing words in women's ears find place
 and gentle hearts with humble suits are moved
 "o thou" quoth he "withhold thy wrath a space
 for if thou long to see my valor proved
 were it not better from this warlike rout
 withdrawn somewhere alone to fight it out

 xxvi
 "so singled may we both our courage try"
 clorinda to that motion yielded glad
 and helmless to the forestward gan hie
 whither the prince right pensive wend and sad
 and there the virgin gan him soon defy
 one blow she strucken and he warded had
 when he cried "hold and ere we prove our might
 first hear thou some conditions of the fight"

 xxvii
 she stayed and desperate love had made him bold
 "since from the fight thou wilt no respite give
 the covenants be" he said "that thou unfold
 this wretched bosom and my heart out rive
 given thee long since and if thou cruel would
 i should be dead let me no longer live
 but pierce this breast that all the world may say
 the eagle made the turtledove her prey

 xxviii
 "save with thy grace or let thine anger kill
 love hath disarmed my life of all defence
 an easy labor harmless blood to spill
 strike then and punish where is none offence"
 this said the prince and more perchance had will
 to have declared to move her cruel sense
 but in ill time of pagans thither came
 a troop and christians that pursued the same

 xxix
 the pagans fled before their valiant foes
 for dread or craft it skills not that we know
 a soldier wild careless to win or lose
 saw where her locks about the damsel flew
 and at her back he proffereth as he goes
 to strike where her he did disarmed view
 but tancred cried "oh stay thy cursed hand"
 and for to ward the blow lift up his brand

 xxx
 but yet the cutting steel arrived there
 where her fair neck adjoined her noble head
 light was the wound but through her amber hair
 the purple drops down railed bloody red
 so rubies set in flaming gold appear
 but lord tancredi pale with rage as lead
 flew on the villain who to flight him bound
 the smart was his though she received the wound

 xxxi
 the villain flies he full of rage and ire
 pursues she stood and wondered on them both
 but yet to follow them showed no desire
 to stray so far she would perchance be loth
 but quickly turned her fierce as flaming fire
 and on her foes wreaked her anger wroth
 on every side she kills them down amain
 and now she flies and now she turns again

 xxxii
 as the swift ure by volga's rolling flood
 chased through the plains the mastiff curs toforn
 flies to the succor of some neighbor wood
 and often turns again his dreadful horn
 against the dogs imbrued in sweat and blood
 that bite not till the beast to flight return
 or as the moors at their strange tennice run
 defenced the flying balls unhurt to shun

 xxxiii
 so ran clorinda so her foes pursued
 until they both approached the city's wall
 when lo the pagans their fierce wrath renewed
 cast in a ring about they wheeled all
 and 'gainst the christians' backs and sides they showed
 their courage fierce and to new combat fall
 when down the hill argantes came to fight
 like angry mars to aid the trojan knight

 xxxiv
 furious tofore the foremost of his rank
 in sturdy steel forth stept the warrior bold
 the first he smote down from his saddle sank
 the next under his steel lay on the mould
 under the saracen's spear the worthies shrank
 no breastplate could that cursed tree outhold
 when that was broke his precious sword he drew
 and whom he hit he felled hurt or slew

 xxxv
 clorinda slew ardelio aged knight
 whose graver years would for no labor yield
 his age was full of puissance and might
 two sons he had to guard his noble eild
 the first far from his father's care and sight
 called alicandro wounded lay in field
 and poliphern the younger by his side
 had he not nobly fought had surely died

 xxxvi
 tancred by this that strove to overtake
 the villain that had hurt his only dear
 from vain pursuit at last returned back
 and his brave troop discomfit saw well near
 thither he spurred and gan huge slaughter make
 his shock no steed his blow no knight could bear
 for dead he strikes him whom he lights upon
 so thunders break high trees on lebanon

 xxxvii
 dudon his squadron of adventurers brings
 to aid the worthy and his tired crew
 before the residue young rinaldo flings
 as swift as fiery lightning kindled new
 his argent eagle with her silver wings
 in field of azure fair erminia knew
 "see there sir king" she says "a knight as bold
 and brave as was the son of peleus old

 xxxviii
 "he wins the prize in joust and tournament
 his acts are numberless though few his years
 if europe six likes him to war had sent
 among these thousand strong of christian peers
 syria were lost lost were the orient
 and all the lands the southern ocean wears
 conquered were all hot afric's tawny kings
 and all that dwells by nilus' unknown springs

 xxxix
 "rinaldo is his name his armed fist
 breaks down stone walls when rams and engines fail
 but turn your eyes because i would you wist
 what lord that is in green and golden mail
 dudon he hight who guideth as him list
 the adventurers' troop whose prowess seld doth fail
 high birth grave years and practise long in war
 and fearless heart make him renowned far

 xl
 "see that big man that all in brown is bound
 gernando called the king of norway's son
 a prouder knight treads not on grass or ground
 his pride hath lost the praise his prowess won
 and that kind pair in white all armed round
 is edward and gildippes who begun
 through love the hazard of fierce war to prove
 famous for arms but famous more for love"

 xli
 while thus they tell their foemen's worthiness
 the slaughter rageth in the plain at large
 tancred and young rinaldo break the press
 they bruise the helm and press the sevenfold targe
 the troop by dudon led performed no less
 but in they come and give a furious charge
 argantes' self fell at one single blow
 inglorious bleeding lay on earth full low

 xlii
 nor had the boaster ever risen more
 but that rinaldo's horse e'en then down fell
 and with the fall his leg opprest so sore
 that for a space there must be algates dwell
 meanwhile the pagan troops were nigh forlore
 swiftly they fled glad they escaped so well
 argantes and with him clorinda stout
 for bank and bulwark served to save the rout

 xliii
 these fled the last and with their force sustained
 the christians' rage that followed them so near
 their scattered troops to safety well they trained
 and while the residue fled the brunt these bear
 dudon pursued the victory he gained
 and on tigranes nobly broke his spear
 then with his sword headless to ground him cast
 so gardeners branches lop that spring too fast

 xliv
 algazar's breastplate of fine temper made
 nor corban's helmet forged by magic art
 could save their owners for lord dudon's blade
 cleft corban's head and pierced algazar's heart
 and their proud souls down to the infernal shade
 from amurath and mahomet depart
 not strong argantes thought his life was sure
 he could not safely fly nor fight secure

 xlv
 the angry pagan bit his lips for teen
 he ran he stayed he fled he turned again
 until at last unmarked unviewed unseen
 when dudon had almansor newly slain
 within his side he sheathed his weapon keen
 down fell the worthy on the dusty plain
 and lifted up his feeble eyes uneath
 opprest with leaden sleep of iron death

 xlvi
 three times he strove to view heaven's golden ray
 and raised him on his feeble elbow thrice
 and thrice he tumbled on the lowly lay
 and three times closed again his dying eyes
 he speaks no word yet makes his signs to pray
 he sighs he faints he groans and then he dies
 argantes proud to spoil the corpse disdained
 but shook his sword with blood of dudon stained

 xlvii
 and turning to the christian knights he cried
 "lordlings behold this bloody reeking blade
 last night was given me by your noble guide
 tell him what proof thereof this day is made
 needs must this please him well that is betide
 that i so well can use this martial trade
 to whom so rare a gift he did present
 tell him the workman fits the instrument

 xlviii
 "if further proof thereof he long to see
 say it still thirsts and would his heartblood drink
 and if he haste not to encounter me
 say i will find him when he least doth think"
 the christians at his words enraged be
 but he to shun their ire doth safely shrink
 under the shelter of the neighbor wall
 well guarded with his troops and soldiers all

 xlix
 like storms of hail the stones fell down from high
 cast from their bulwarks flankers ports and towers
 the shafts and quarries from their engines fly
 as thick as falling drops in april showers
 the french withdrew they list not press too nigh
 the saracens escaped all the powers
 but now rinaldo from the earth upleapt
 where by the leg his steed had long him kept
 l
 he came and breathed vengeance from his breast
 'gainst him that noble dudon late had slain
 and being come thus spoke he to the rest
 "warriors why stand you gazing here in vain
 pale death our valiant leader had opprest
 come wreak his loss whom bootless you complain
 those walls are weak they keep but cowards out
 no rampier can withstand a courage stout

 li
 "of double iron brass or adamant
 or if this wall were built of flaming fire
 yet should the pagan vile a fortress want
 to shroud his coward head safe from mine ire
 come follow then and bid base fear avaunt
 the harder work deserves the greater hire"
 and with that word close to the walls he starts
 nor fears he arrows quarries stones or darts

 lii
 above the waves as neptune lift his eyes
 to chide the winds that trojan ships opprest
 and with his countenance calmed seas winds and skies
 so looked rinaldo when he shook his crest
 before those walls each pagan fears and flies
 his dreadful sight or trembling stayed at least
 such dread his awful visage on them cast
 so seem poor doves at goshawks' sight aghast

 liii
 the herald ligiere now from godfrey came
 to will them stay and calm their courage hot
 "retire" quoth he "godfrey commands the same
 to wreak your ire this season fitteth not"
 though loth rinaldo stayed and stopped the flame
 that boiled in his hardy stomach hot
 his bridled fury grew thereby more fell
 so rivers stopped above their banks do swell

 liv
 the hands retire not dangered by their foes
 in their retreat so wise were they and wary
 to murdered dudon each lamenting goes
 from wonted use of ruth they list not vary
 upon their friendly arms they soft impose
 the noble burden of his corpse to carry
 meanwhile godfredo from a mountain great
 beheld the sacred city and her seat

 lv
 hierusalem is seated on two hills
 of height unlike and turned side to side
 the space between a gentle valley fills
 from mount to mount expansed fair and wide
 three sides are sure imbarred with crags and hills
 the rest is easy scant to rise espied
 but mighty bulwarks fence that plainer part
 so art helps nature nature strengtheneth art

 lvi
 the town is stored of troughs and cisterns made
 to keep fresh water but the country seems
 devoid of grass unfit for ploughmen's trade
 not fertile moist with rivers wells and streams
 there grow few trees to make the summer's shade
 to shield the parched land from scorching beams
 save that a wood stands six miles from the town'
 with aged cedars dark and shadows brown

 lvii
 by east among the dusty valleys glide
 the silver streams of jordan's crystal flood
 by west the midland sea with bounders tied
 of sandy shores where joppa whilom stood
 by north samaria stands and on that side
 the golden calf was reared in bethel wood
 bethlem by south where christ incarnate was
 a pearl in steel a diamond set in brass

 lviii
 while thus the duke on every side descried
 the city's strength the walls and gates about
 and saw where least the same was fortified
 where weakest seemed the walls to keep him out
 ermina as he armed rode him spied
 and thus bespake the heathen tyrant stout
 "see godfrey there in purple clad and gold
 his stately port and princely look behold

 lix
 "well seems he born to be with honor crowned
 so well the lore he knows of regiment
 peerless in fight in counsel grave and sound
 the double gift of glory excellent
 among these armies is no warrior found
 graver in speech bolder in tournament
 raymond pardie in counsel match him might
 tancred and young rinaldo like in fight"

 lx
 to whom the king "he likes me well therefore
 i knew him whilom in the court of france
 when i from egypt went ambassador
 i saw him there break many a sturdy lance
 and yet his chin no sign of manhood bore
 his youth was forward but with governance
 his words his actions and his portance brave
 of future virtue timely tokens gave

 lxi
 "presages ah too true" with that a space
 he sighed for grief then said "fain would i know
 the man in red with such a knightly grace
 a worthy lord he seemeth by his show
 how like to godfrey looks he in the face
 how like in person but somedeal more low"
 "baldwin" quoth she "that noble baron hight
 by birth his brother and his match in might

 lxii
 "next look on him that seems for counsel fit
 whose silver locks betray his store of days
 raymond he hight a man of wondrous wit
 of toulouse lord his wisdom is his praise
 what he forethinks doth as he looks for hit
 his stratagems have good success always
 with gilded helm beyond him rides the mild
 and good prince william england's king's dear child

 lxiii
 "with him is guelpho as his noble mate
 in birth in acts in arms alike the rest
 i know him well since i beheld him late
 by his broad shoulders and his squared breast
 but my proud foe that quite hath ruinate
 my high estate and antioch opprest
 i see not boemond that to death did bring
 mine aged lord my father and my king"

 lxiv
 thus talked they meanwhile godfredo went
 down to the troops that in the valley stayed
 and for in vain he thought the labor spent
 to assail those parts that to the mountains laid
 against the northern gate his force he bent
 gainst it he camped gainst it his engines played
 all felt the fury of his angry power
 that from those gates lies to the corner tower

 lxv
 the town's third part was this or little less
 fore which the duke his glorious ensigns spread
 for so great compass had that forteress
 that round it could not be environed
 with narrow siegenor babel's king i guess
 that whilom took it such an army led
 but all the ways he kept by which his foe
 might to or from the city come or go

 lxvi
 his care was next to cast the trenches deep
 so to preserve his resting camp by night
 lest from the city while his soldiers sleep
 they might assail them with untimely flight
 this done he went where lords and princes weep
 with dire complaints about the murdered knight
 where dudon dead lay slaughtered on the ground
 and all the soldiers sat lamenting round

 lxvii
 his wailing friends adorned the mournful bier
 with woful pomp whereon his corpse they laid
 and when they saw the bulloigne prince draw near
 all felt new grief and each new sorrow made
 but he withouten show or change of cheer
 his springing tears within their fountains stayed
 his rueful looks upon the corpse he cast
 awhile and thus bespake the same at last

 lxviii
 "we need not mourn for thee here laid to rest
 earth is thy bed and not the grave the skies
 are for thy soul the cradle and the nest
 there live for here thy glory never dies
 for like a christian knight and champion blest
 thou didst both live and die now feed thine eyes
 with thy redeemer's sight where crowned with bliss
 thy faith zeal merit welldeserving is

 lxix
 "our loss not thine provokes these plaints and tears
 for when we lost thee then our ship her mast
 our chariot lost her wheels their points our spears
 the bird of conquest her chief feather cast
 but though thy death far from our army hears
 her chiefest earthly aid in heaven yet placed
 thou wilt procure its help divine so reaps
 he that sows godly sorrow joy by heaps

 lxx
 "for if our god the lord armipotent
 those armed angels in our aid down send
 that were at dothan to his prophet sent
 thou wilt come down with them and well defend
 our host and with thy sacred weapons bent
 gainst sion's fort these gates and bulwarks rend
 that so by hand may win this hold and we
 may in these temples praise our christ for thee"

 lxxi
 thus he complained but now the sable shade
 ycleped night had thick enveloped
 the sun in veil of double darkness made
 sleep eased care rest brought complaint to bed
 all night the wary duke devising laid
 how that high wall should best be battered
 how his strong engines he might aptly frame
 and whence get timber fit to build the same

 lxxii
 up with the lark the sorrowful duke arose
 a mourner chief at dudon's burial
 of cypress sad a pile his friends compose
 under a hill o'ergrown with cedars tall
 beside the hearse a fruitful palmtree grows
 ennobled since by this great funeral
 where dudon's corpse they softly laid in ground
 the priest sung hymns the soldiers wept around

 lxxiii
 among the boughs they here and there bestow
 ensigns and arms as witness of his praise
 which he from pagan lords that did them owe
 had won in prosperous fights and happy frays
 his shield they fixed on the hole below
 and there this distich underwrit which says
 "this palm with stretched arms doth overspread
 the champion dudon's glorious carcase dead"

 lxxiv
 this work performed with advisement good
 godfrey his carpenters and men of skill
 in all the camp sent to an aged wood
 with convoy meet to guard them safe from ill
 within a valley deep this forest stood
 to christian eyes unseen unknown until
 a syrian told the duke who thither sent
 those chosen workmen that for timber went

 lxxv
 and now the axe raged in the forest wild
 the echo sighed in the groves unseen
 the weeping nymphs fled from their bowers exiled
 down fell the shady tops of shaking treen
 down came the sacred palms the ashes wild
 the funeral cypress holly ever green
 the weeping fir thick beech and sailing pine
 the married elm fell with his fruitful vine

 lxxvi
 the shooter grew the broadleaved sycamore
 the barren plantain and the walnut sound
 the myrrh that her foul sin doth still deplore
 the alder owner of all waterish ground
 sweet juniper whose shadow hurteth sore
 proud cedar oak the king of forests crowned
 thus fell the trees with noise the deserts roar
 the beasts their caves the birds their nests forlore



 fourth book

 the argument
 satan his fiends and spirits assembleth all
 and sends them forth to work the christians woe
 false hidraort their aid from hell doth call
 and sends armida to entrap his foe
 she tells her birth her fortune and her fall
 asks aid allures and wins the worthies so
 that they consent her enterprise to prove
 she wins them with deceit craft beauty love


 i
 while thus their work went on with lucky speed
 and reared rams their horned fronts advance
 the ancient foe to man and mortal seed
 his wannish eyes upon them bent askance
 and when he saw their labors well succeed
 he wept for rage and threatened dire mischance
 he choked his curses to himself he spake
 such noise wild bulls that softly bellow make

 ii
 at last resolving in his damned thought
 to find some let to stop their warlike feat
 he gave command his princes should be brought
 before the throne of his infernal seat
 o fool as if it were a thing of naught
 god to resist or change his purpose great
 who on his foes doth thunder in his ire
 whose arrows hailstones he and coals of fire

 iii
 the dreary trumpet blew a dreadful blast
 and rumbled through the lands and kingdoms under
 through wasteness wide it roared and hollows vast
 and filled the deep with horror fear and wonder
 not half so dreadful noise the tempests cast
 that fall from skies with storms of hail and thunder
 not half so loud the whistling winds do sing
 broke from the earthen prisons of their king

 iv
 the peers of pluto's realm assembled been
 amid the palace of their angry king
 in hideous forms and shapes tofore unseen
 that fear death terror and amazement bring
 with ugly paws some trample on the green
 some gnaw the snakes that on their shoulders hing
 and some their forked tails stretch forth on high
 and tear the twinkling stars from trembling sky

 v
 there were silenus' foul and loathsome route
 there sphinxes centaurs there were gorgons fell
 there howling scillas yawling round about
 there serpents hiss there sevenmouthed hydras yell
 chimera there spues fire and brimstone out
 and polyphemus blind supporteth hell
 besides ten thousand monsters therein dwells
 misshaped unlike themselves and like naught else

 vi
 about their princes each took his wonted seat
 on thrones redhot ybuilt of burning brass
 pluto in middest heaved his trident great
 of rusty iron huge that forged was
 the rocks on which the salt sea billows beat
 and atlas' tops the clouds in height that pass
 compared to his huge person molehills be
 so his rough front his horns so lifted he

 vii
 the tyrant proud frowned from his lofty cell
 and with his looks made all his monsters tremble
 his eyes that full of rage and venom swell
 two beacons seem that men to arms assemble
 his feltered locks that on his bosom fell
 on rugged mountains briars and thorns resemble
 his yawning mouth that foamed clotted blood
 gaped like a whirlpool wide in stygian flood

 viii
 and as mount etna vomits sulphur out
 with cliffs of burning crags and fire and smoke
 so from his mouth flew kindled coals about
 hot sparks and smells that man and beast would choke
 the gnarring porter durst not whine for doubt
 still were the furies while their sovereign spoke
 and swift cocytus stayed his murmur shrill
 while thus the murderer thundered out his will

 ix
 "ye powers infernal worthier far to sit
 about the sun whence you your offspring take
 with me that whilom through the welkin flit
 down tumbled headlong to this empty lake
 our former glory still remember it
 our bold attempts and war we once did make
 gainst him that rules above the starry sphere
 for which like traitors we lie damned here

 x
 "and now instead of clear and gladsome sky
 of titan's brightness that so glorious is
 in this deep darkness lo we helpless lie
 hopeless again to joy our former bliss
 and more which makes my griefs to multiply
 that sinful creature man elected is
 and in our place the heavens possess he must
 vile man begot of clay and born of dust

 xi
 "nor this sufficed but that he also gave
 his only son his darling to be slain
 to conquer so hell death sin and the grave
 and man condemned to restore again
 he brake our prisons and would algates save
 the souls there here should dwell in woe and pain
 and now in heaven with him they live always
 with endless glory crowned and lasting praise

 xii
 "but why recount i thus our passed harms
 remembrance fresh makes weakened sorrows strong
 expulsed were we with injurious arms
 from those due honors us of right belong
 but let us leave to speak of these alarms
 and bend our forces gainst our present wrong
 ah see you not how he attempted hath
 to bring all lands all nations to his faith

 xiii
 "then let us careless spend the day and night
 without regard what haps what comes or goes
 let asia subject be to christians' might
 a prey he sion to her conquering foes
 let her adore again her christ aright
 who her before all nations whilom chose
 in brazen tables he his lore ywrit
 and let all tongues and lands acknowledge it

 xiv
 "so shall our sacred altars all be his
 our holy idols tumbled in the mould
 to him the wretched man that sinful is
 shall pray and offer incense myrrh and gold
 our temples shall their costly deckings miss
 with naked walls and pillars freezing cold
 tribute of souls shall end and our estate
 or pluto reign in kingdoms desolate

 xv
 "oh he not then the courage perished clean
 that whilom dwelt within your haughty thought
 when armed with shining fire and weapons keen
 against the angels of proud heaven we fought
 i grant we fell on the phlegrean green
 yet good our cause was though our fortune naught
 for chance assisteth oft the ignobler part
 we lost the field yet lost we not our heart

 xvi
 "go then my strength my hope my spirits go
 these western rebels with your power withstand
 pluck up these weeds before they overgrow
 the gentle garden of the hebrews' land
 quench out this spark before it kindles so
 that asia burn consumed with the brand
 use open force or secret guile unspied
 for craft is virtue gainst a foe defied

 xvii
 "among the knights and worthies of their train
 let some like outlaws wander uncouth ways
 let some be slain in field let some again
 make oracles of women's yeas and nays
 and pine in foolish love let some complain
 on godfrey's rule and mutinies gainst him raise
 turn each one's sword against his fellow's heart
 thus kill them all or spoil the greatest part"

 xviii
 before his words the tyrant ended had
 the lesser devils arose with ghastly roar
 and thronged forth about the world to gad
 each land they filled river stream and shore
 the goblins fairies fiends and furies mad
 ranged in flowery dales and mountains hoar
 and under every trembling leaf they sit
 between the solid earth and welkin flit

 xix
 about the world they spread forth far and wide
 filling the thoughts of each ungodly heart
 with secret mischief anger hate and pride
 wounding lost souls with sin's empoisoned dart
 but say my muse recount whence first they tried
 to hurt the christian lords and from what part
 thou knowest of things performed so long agone
 this latter age hears little truth or none

 xx
 the town damascus and the lands about
 ruled hidraort a wizard grave and sage
 acquainted well with all the damned rout
 of pluto's reign even from his tender age
 yet of this war he could not figure out
 the wished ending or success presage
 for neither stars above nor powers of hell
 nor skill nor art nor charm nor devil could tell

 xxi
 and yet he thoughtoh vain conceit of man
 which as thou wishest judgest things to come
 that the french host to sure destruction ran
 condemned quite by heaven's eternal doom
 he thinks no force withstand or vanquish can
 the egyptian strength and therefore would that some
 both of the prey and glory of the fight
 upon this syrian folk would haply light

 xxii
 but for he held the frenchmen's worth in prize
 and feared the doubtful gain of bloody war
 he that was closely false and slyly war
 cast how he might annoy them most from far
 and as he gan upon this point devise
 as counsellors in ill still nearest are
 at hand was satan ready ere men need
 if once they think to make them do the deed

 xxiii
 he counselled him how best to hunt his game
 what dart to cast what net what toil to pitch
 a niece he had a nice and tender dame
 peerless in wit in nature's blessings rich
 to all deceit she could her beauty frame
 false fair and young a virgin and a witch
 to her he told the sum of this emprise
 and praised her thus for she was fair and wise

 xxiv
 "my dear who underneath these locks of gold
 and native brightness of thy lovely hue
 hidest grave thoughts ripe wit and wisdom old
 more skill than i in all mine arts untrue
 to thee my purpose great i must unfold
 this enterprise thy cunning must pursue
 weave thou to end this web which i begin
 i will the distaff hold come thou and spin

 xxv
 "go to the christians' host and there assay
 all subtle sleights that women use in love
 shed brinish tears sob sigh entreat and pray
 wring thy fair hands cast up thine eyes above
 for mourning beauty hath much power men say
 the stubborn hearts with pity frail to move
 look pale for dread and blush sometime for shame
 in seeming truth thy lies will soonest frame

 xxvi
 "take with the bait lord godfrey if thou may'st
 frame snares of look strains of alluring speech
 for if he love the conquest then thou hast
 thus purposed war thou may'st with ease impeach
 else lead the other lords to deserts waste
 and hold them slaves far from their leader's reach"
 thus taught he her and for conclusion saith
 "all things are lawful for our lands and faith"

 xxvii
 the sweet armida took this charge on hand
 a tender piece for beauty sex and age
 the sun was sunken underneath the land
 when she began her wanton pilgrimage
 in silken weeds she trusteth to withstand
 and conquer knights in warlike equipage
 of their night ambling dame the syrians prated
 some good some bad as they her loved or hated

 xxviii
 within few days the nymph arrived there
 where puissant godfrey had his tents ypight
 upon her strange attire and visage clear
 gazed each soldier gazed every knight
 as when a comet doth in skies appear
 the people stand amazed at the light
 so wondered they and each at other sought
 what mister wight she was and whence ybrought

 xxix
 yet never eye to cupid's service vowed
 beheld a face of such a lovely pride
 a tinsel veil her amber locks did shroud
 that strove to cover what it could not hide
 the golden sun behind a silver cloud
 so streameth out his beams on every side
 the marble goddess set at cnidos naked
 she seemed were she unclothed or that awaked

 xxx
 the gamesome wind among her tresses plays
 and curleth up those growing riches short
 her spareful eye to spread his beams denays
 but keeps his shot where cupid keeps his fort
 the rose and lily on her cheek assays
 to paint true fairness out in bravest sort
 her lips where blooms naught but the single rose
 still blush for still they kiss while still they close

 xxxi
 her breasts two hills o'erspread with purest snow
 sweet smooth and supple soft and gently swelling
 between them lies a milken dale below
 where love youth gladness whiteness make their dwelling
 her breasts half hid and half were laid to show
 so was the wanton clad as if this much
 should please the eye the rest unseen the touch

 xxxii
 as when the sunbeams dive through tagus' wave
 to spy the storehouse of his springtime gold
 lovepiercing thought so through her mantle drave
 and in her gentle bosom wandered bold
 it viewed the wondrous beauty virgins have
 and all to fond desire with vantage told
 alas what hope is left to quench his fire
 that kindled is by sight blown by desire

 xxxiii
 thus passed she praised wished and wondered at
 among the troops who there encamped lay
 she smiled for joy but well dissembled that
 her greedy eye chose out her wished prey
 on all her gestures seeming virtue sat
 toward the imperial tent she asked the way
 with that she met a bold and lovesome knight
 lord godfrey's youngest brother eustace hight

 xxxiv
 this was the fowl that first fell in the snare
 he saw her fair and hoped to find her kind
 the throne of cupid had an easy stair
 his bark is fit to sail with every wind
 the breach he makes no wisdom can repair
 with reverence meet the baron low inclined
 and thus his purpose to the virgin told
 for youth use nature all had made him bold

 xxxv
 "lady if thee beseem a stile so low
 in whose sweet looks such sacred beauty shine
 for never yet did heaven such grace bestow
 on any daughter born of adam's line
 thy name let us though far unworthy know
 unfold thy will and whence thou art in fine
 lest my audacious boldness learn too late
 what honors due become thy high estate"

 xxxvi
 "sir knight" quoth she "your praises reach too high
 above her merit you commenden so
 a hapless maid i am both born to die
 and dead to joy that live in care and woe
 a virgin helpless fugitive pardie
 my native soil and kingdom thus forego
 to seek duke godfrey's aid such store men tell
 of virtuous ruth doth in his bosom dwell

 xxxvii
 "conduct me then that mighty duke before
 if you be courteous sir as well you seem"
 "content" quoth he "since of one womb ybore
 we brothers are your fortune good esteem
 to encounter me whose word prevaileth more
 in godfrey's hearing than you haply deem
 mine aid i grant and his i promise too
 all that his sceptre or my sword can do"

 xxxviii
 he led her easily forth when this was said
 where godfrey sat among his lords and peers
 she reverence did then blushed as one dismayed
 to speak for secret wants and inward fears
 it seemed a bashful shame her speeches stayed
 at last the courteous duke her gently cheers
 silence was made and she began her tale
 they sit to hear thus sung this nightingale

 xxxix
 "victorious prince whose honorable name
 is held so great among our pagan kings
 that to those lands thou dost by conquest tame
 that thou hast won them some content it brings
 well known to all is thy immortal fame
 the earth thy worth thy foe thy praises sings
 and paynims wronged come to seek thine aid
 so doth thy virtue so thy power persuade

 xl
 "and i though bred in macon's heathenish lore
 which thou oppressest with thy puissant might
 yet trust thou wilt an helpless maid restore
 and repossess her in her father's right
 others in their distress do aid implore
 of kin and friends but i in this sad plight
 invoke thy help my kingdom to invade
 so doth thy virtue so my need persuade

 xli
 "in thee i hope thy succors i invoke
 to win the crown whence i am dispossest
 for like renown awaiteth on the stroke
 to cast the haughty down or raise the opprest
 nor greater glory brings a sceptre broke
 than doth deliverance of a maid distrest
 and since thou canst at will perform the thing
 more is thy praise to make than kill a king

 xlii
 "but if thou would'st thy succors due excuse
 because in christ i have no hope nor trust
 ah yet for virtue's sake thy virtue use
 who scorneth gold because it lies in dust
 be witness heaven if thou to grant refuse
 thou dost forsake a maid in cause most just
 and for thou shalt at large my fortunes know
 i will my wrongs and their great treasons show

 xliii
 "prince arbilan that reigned in his life
 on fair damascus was my noble sire
 born of mean race he was yet got to wife
 the queen chariclia such was the fire
 of her hot love but soon the fatal knife
 had cut the thread that kept their joys entire
 for so mishap her cruel lot had cast
 my birth her death my first day was her last

 xliv
 "and ere five years were fully come and gone
 since his dear spouse to hasty death did yield
 my father also died consumed with moan
 and sought his love amid the elysian fields
 his crown and me poor orphan left alone
 mine uncle governed in my tender eild
 for well he thought if mortal men have faith
 in brother's breast true love his mansion hath

 xlv
 "he took the charge of me and of the crown
 and with kind shows of love so brought to pass
 that through damascus great report was blown
 how good how just how kind mine uncle was
 whether he kept his wicked hate unknown
 and hid the serpent in the flowering grass
 on that true faith did in his bosom won
 because he meant to match me with his son

 xlvi
 "which son within short while did undertake
 degree of knighthood as beseemed him well
 yet never durst he for his lady's sake
 break sword or lance advance in lofty sell
 as fair he was as citherea's make
 as proud as he that signoriseth hell
 in fashions wayward and in love unkind
 for cupid deigns not wound a currish mind

 xlvii
 "this paragon should queen armida wed
 a goodly swain to be a princess' fere
 a lovely partner of a lady's bed
 a noble head a golden crown to wear
 his glosing sire his errand daily said
 and sugared speeches whispered in mine ear
 to make me take this darling in mine arms
 but still the adder stopt her ears from charms

 xlviii
 "at last he left me with a troubled grace
 through which transparent was his inward spite
 methought i read the story in his face
 of these mishaps that on me since have light
 since that foul spirits haunt my restingplace
 and ghastly visions break any sleep by night
 grief horror fear my fainting soul did kill
 for so my mind foreshowed my coming ill

 xlix
 "three times the shape of my dear mother came
 pale sad dismayed to warn me in my dream
 alas how far transformed from the same
 whose eyes shone erst like titan's glorious beam
 'daughter' she says 'fly fly behold thy dame
 foreshows the treasons of thy wretched eame
 who poison gainst thy harmless life provides'
 this said to shapeless air unseen she glides

 l
 "but what avail high walls or bulwarks strong
 where fainting cowards have the piece to guard
 my sex too weak mine age was all to young
 to undertake alone a work so hard
 to wander wild the desert woods among
 a banished maid of wonted ease debarred
 so grievous seemed that liefer were my death
 and there to expire where first i drew my breath

 li
 "i feared deadly evil if long i stayed
 and yet to fly had neither will nor power
 nor durst my heart declare it waxed afraid
 lest so i hasten might my dying hour
 thus restless waited i unhappy maid
 what hand should first pluck up my springing flower
 even as the wretch condemned to lose his life
 awaits the falling of the murdering knife

 lii
 "in these extremes for so my fortune would
 perchance preserve me to my further ill
 one of my noble father's servants old
 that for his goodness bore his child good will
 with store of tears this treason gan unfold
 and said my guardian would his pupil kill
 and that himself if promise made be kept
 should give me poison dire ere next i slept

 liii
 "and further told me if i wished to live
 i must convey myself by secret flight
 and offered then all succours he could give
 to aid his mistress banished from her right
 his words of comfort fear to exile drive
 the dread of death made lesser dangers light
 so we concluded when the shadows dim
 obscured the earth i should depart with him

 liv
 "of close escapes the aged patroness
 blacker than erst her sable mantle spread
 when with two trusty maids in great distress
 both from mine uncle and my realm i fled
 oft looked i back but hardly could suppress
 those streams of tears mine eyes uncessant shed
 for when i looked on my kingdom lost
 it was a grief a death an hell almost

 lv
 "my steeds drew on the burden of my limbs
 but still my locks my thoughts drew back as fast
 so fare the men that from the heaven's brims
 far out to sea by sudden storm are cast
 swift o'er the grass the rolling chariot swims
 through ways unknown all night all day we haste
 at last nigh tired a castle strong we fand
 the utmost border of my native land

 lvi
 "the fort arontes was for so the knight
 was called that my deliverance thus had wrought
 but when the tyrant saw by mature flight
 i had escaped the treasons of his thought
 the rage increased in the cursed wight
 gainst me and him that me to safety brought
 and us accused we would have poisoned
 him but descried to save our lives we fled

 lvii
 "and that in lieu of his approved truth
 to poison him i hired had my guide
 that he despatched mine unbridled youth
 might rage at will in no subjection tied
 and that each night i slepto foul untruth
 mine honor lost by this arontes' side
 but heaven i pray send down revenging fire
 when so base love shall change my chaste desire

 lviii
 "not that he sitteth on my regal throne
 nor that he thirst to drink my lukewarm blood
 so grieveth me as this despite alone
 that my renown which ever blameless stood
 hath lost the light wherewith it always shone
 with forged lies he makes his tale so good
 and holds my subjects' hearts in such suspense
 that none take armor for their queen's defence

 lix
 "and though he do my regal throne possess
 clothed in purple crowned with burnished gold
 yet is his hate his rancor ne'er the less
 since naught assuageth malice when 'tis old
 he threats to burn arontes' forteress
 and murder him unless he yield the hold
 and me and mine threats not with war but death
 thus causeless hatred endless is uneath

 lx
 "and so he trusts to wash away the stain
 and hide his shameful fact with mine offence
 and saith he will restore the throne again
 to his late honor and due excellence
 and therefore would i should be algates slain
 for while i live his right is in suspense
 this is the cause my guiltless life is sought
 for on my ruin is his safety wrought

 lxi
 "and let the tyrant have his heart's desire
 let him perform the cruelty he meant
 my guiltless blood must quench the ceaseless fire
 on which my endless tears were bootless spent
 unless thou help to thee renowned sire
 i fly a virgin orphan innocent
 and let these tears that on thy feet distil
 redeem the drops of blood he thirsts to spill

 lxii
 "by these thy glorious feet that tread secure
 on necks of tyrants by thy conquests brave
 by that right hand and by those temples pure
 thou seek'st to free from macon's lore i crave
 help for this sickness none but thou canst cure
 my life and kingdom let thy mercy save
 from death and ruin but in vain i prove thee
 if right if truth if justice cannot move thee

 lxiii
 "thou who dost all thou wishest at thy will
 and never willest aught but what is right
 preserve this guiltless blood they seek to spill
 thine be my kingdom save it with thy might
 among these captains lords and knights of skill
 appoint me ten approved most in fight
 who with assistance of my friends and kin
 may serve my kingdom lost again to win

 lxiv
 "for lo a knight that had a gate to ward
 a man of chiefest trust about his king
 hath promised so to beguile the guard
 that me and mine he undertakes to bring
 safe where the tyrant haply sleepeth hard
 he counselled me to undertake this thing
 of these some little succor to intreat
 whose name alone accomplish can the feat"

 lxv
 this said his answer did the nymph attend
 her looks her sighs her gestures all did pray him
 but godfrey wisely did his grant suspend
 he doubts the worst and that awhile did stay him
 he knows who fears no god he loves no friend
 he fears the heathen false would thus betray him
 but yet such ruth dwelt in his princely mind
 that gainst his wisdom pity made him kind

 lxvi
 besides the kindness of his gentle thought
 ready to comfort each distressed wight
 the maiden's offer profit with it brought
 for if the syrian kingdom were her right
 that won the way were easy which he sought
 to bring all asia subject to his might
 there might he raise munition arms and treasure
 to work the egyptian king and his displeasure

 lxvii
 thus was his noble heart long time betwixt
 fear and remorse not granting nor denying
 upon his eyes the dame her lookings fixed
 as if her life and death lay on his saying
 some tears she shed with sighs and sobbings mixed
 as if her hopes were dead through his delaying
 at last her earnest suit the duke denayed
 but with sweet words thus would content the maid

 lxviii
 "if not in service of our god we fought
 in meaner quarrel if this sword were shaken
 well might thou gather in thy gentle thought
 so fair a princess should not be forsaken
 but since these armies from the world's end brought
 to free this sacred town have undertaken
 it were unfit we turned our strength away
 and victory even in her coming stay

 lxix
 "i promise thee and on my princely word
 the burden of thy wish and hope repose
 that when this chosen temple of the lord
 her holy doors shall to his saints unclose
 in rest and peace then this victorious sword
 shall execute due vengeance on thy foes
 but if for pity of a worldly dame
 i left this work such pity were my shame"

 lxx
 at this the princess bent her eyes to ground
 and stood unmoved though not unmarked a space
 the secret bleeding of her inward wound
 shed heavenly dew upon her angel's face
 "poor wretch" quoth she "in tears and sorrows drowned
 death be thy peace the grave thy restingplace
 since such thy hap that lest thou mercy find
 the gentlest heart on earth is proved unkind

 lxxi
 "where none attends what boots it to complain
 men's froward hearts are moved with women's tears
 as marble stones are pierced with drops of rain
 no plaints find passage through unwilling ears
 the tyrant haply would his wraith restrain
 heard he these prayers ruthless godfrey hears
 yet not thy fault is this my chance i see
 hath made even pity pitiless in thee

 lxxii
 "so both thy goodness and good hap denayed me
 grief sorrow mischief care hath overthrown me
 the star that ruled my birthday hath betrayed me
 my genius sees his charge but dares not own me
 of queenlike state my flight hath disarrayed me
 my father died ere he five years had known me
 my kingdom lost and lastly resteth now
 down with the tree sith broke is every bough

 lxxiii
 "and for the modest lore of maidenhood
 bids me not sojourn with these armed men
 o whither shall i fly what secret wood
 shall hide me from the tyrant or what den
 what rock what vault what cave can do me good
 no no where death is sure it resteth then
 to scorn his power and be it therefore seen
 armida lived and died both like a queen"

 lxxiv
 with that she looked as if a proud disdain
 kindled displeasure in her noble mind
 the way she came she turned her steps again
 with gesture sad but in disdainful kind
 a tempest railed down her cheeks amain
 with tears of woe and sighs of anger's wind
 the drops her footsteps wash whereon she treads
 and seems to step on pearls or crystal beads

 lxxv
 her cheeks on which this streaming nectar fell
 stilled through the limbeck of her diamond eyes
 the roses white and red resembled well
 whereon the rory maydew sprinkled lies
 when the fair morn first blusheth from her cell
 and breatheth balm from opened paradise
 thus sighed thus mourned thus wept this lovely queen
 and in each drop bathed a grace unseen

 lxxvi
 thrice twenty cupids unperceived flew
 to gather up this liquor ere it fall
 and of each drop an arrow forged new
 else as it came snatched up the crystal ball
 and at rebellious hearts for wildfire threw
 o wondrous love thou makest gain of all
 for if she weeping sit or smiling stand
 she bends thy bow or kindleth else thy brand

 lxxvii
 this forged plaint drew forth unfeigned tears
 from many eyes and pierced each worthy's heart
 each one condoleth with her that her hears
 and of her grief would help her bear the smart
 if godfrey aid her not not one but swears
 some tigress gave him suck on roughest part
 midst the rude crags on alpine cliffs aloft
 hard is that heart which beauty makes not soft

 lxxviii
 but jolly eustace in whose breast the brand
 of love and pity kindled had the flame
 while others softly whispered underhand
 before the duke with comely boldness came
 "brother and lord" quoth he "too long you stand
 in your first purpose yet vouchsafe to frame
 your thoughts to ours and lend this virgin aid
 thanks are half lost when good turns are delayed

 lxxix
 "and think not that eustace's talk assays
 to turn these forces from this present war
 or that i wish you should your armies raise
 from sion's walls my speech tends not so far
 but we that venture all for fame and praise
 that to no charge nor service bounden are
 forth of our troop may ten well spared be
 to succor her which naught can weaken thee

 lxxx
 "and know they shall in god's high service fight
 that virgins innocent save and defend
 dear will the spoils be in the heaven's sight
 that from a tyrant's hateful head we rend
 nor seemed i forward in this lady's right
 with hope of gain or profit in the end
 but for i know he arms unworthy bears
 to help a maiden's cause that shuns or fears

 lxxxi
 "ah be it not pardie declared in france
 or elsewhere told where courtesy is in prize
 that we forsook so fair a chevisance
 for doubt or fear that might from fight arise
 else here surrender i both sword and lance
 and swear no more to use this martial guise
 for ill deserves he to be termed a knight
 that bears a blunt sword in a lady's right"

 lxxxii
 thus parleyed he and with confused sound
 the rest approved what the gallant said
 their general their knights encompassed round
 with humble grace and earnest suit they prayed
 "i yield" quoth he "and it be happy found
 what i have granted let her have your aid
 yours be the thanks for yours the danger is
 if aught succeed as much i fear amiss

 lxxxiii
 "but if with you my words may credit find
 oh temper then this heat misguides you so"
 thus much he said but they with fancy blind
 accept his grant and let his counsel go
 what works not beauty man's relenting mind
 is eath to move with plaints and shows of woe
 her lips cast forth a chain of sugared words
 that captive led most of the christian lords

 lxxxiv
 eustace recalled her and bespake her thus
 "beauty's chief darling let those sorrows be
 for such assistance shall you find in us
 as with your need or will may best agree"
 with that she cheered her forehead dolorous
 and smiled for joy that phoebus blushed to see
 and had she deigned her veil for to remove
 the god himself once more had fallen in love

 lxxxv
 with that she broke the silence once again
 and gave the knight great thanks in little speech
 she said she would his handmaid poor remain
 so far as honor's laws received no breach
 her humble gestures made the residue plain
 dumb eloquence persuading more than speech
 thus women know and thus they use the guise
 to enchant the valiant and beguile the wise

 lxxxvi
 and when she saw her enterprise had got
 some wished mean of quick and good proceeding
 she thought to strike the iron that was hot
 for every action hath his hour of speeding
 medea or false circe changed not
 so far the shapes of men as her eyes spreading
 altered their hearts and with her syren's sound
 in lust their minds their hearts in love she drowned

 lxxxvii
 all wily sleights that subtle women know
 hourly she used to catch some lover new
 none kenned the bent of her unsteadfast bow
 for with the time her thoughts her looks renew
 from some she cast her modest eyes below
 at some her gazing glances roving flew
 and while she thus pursued her wanton sport
 she spurred the slow and reined the forward short

 lxxxviii
 if some as hopeless that she would be won
 forebore to love because they durst not move her
 on them her gentle looks to smile begun
 as who say she is kind if you dare prove her
 on every heart thus shone this lustful sun
 all strove to serve to please to woo to love her
 and in their hearts that chaste and bashful were
 her eye's hot glance dissolved the frost of fear

 lxxxix
 on them who durst with fingering bold assay
 to touch the softness of her tender skin
 she looked as coy as if she list not play
 and made as things of worth were hard to win
 yet tempered so her deignful looks alway
 that outward scorn showed store of grace within
 thus with false hope their longing hearts she fired
 for hardest gotten things are most desired

 xc
 alone sometimes she walked in secret where
 to ruminate upon her discontent
 within her eyelids sate the swelling tear
 not poured forth though sprung from sad lament
 and with this craft a thousand souls well near
 in snares of foolish ruth and love she hent
 and kept as slaves by which we fitly prove
 that witless pity breedeth fruitless love

 xci
 sometimes as if her hope unloosed had
 the chains of grief wherein her thoughts lay fettered
 upon her minions looked she blithe and glad
 in that deceitful lore so was she lettered
 not glorious titan in his brightness clad
 the sunshine of her face in lustre bettered
 for when she list to cheer her beauties so
 she smiled away the clouds of grief and woe

 xcii
 her double charm of smiles and sugared words
 lulled on sleep the virtue of their senses
 reason shall aid gainst those assaults affords
 wisdom no warrant from those sweet offences
 cupid's deep rivers have their shallow fords
 his griefs bring joys his losses recompenses
 he breeds the sore and cures us of the pain
 achilles' lance that wounds and heals again

 xciii
 while thus she them torments twixt frost and fire
 twixt joy and grief twixt hope and restless fear
 the sly enchantress felt her gain the nigher
 these were her flocks that golden fleeces bear
 but if someone durst utter his desire
 and by complaining make his griefs appear
 he labored hard rocks with plaints to move
 she had not learned the gamut then of love

 xciv
 for down she bet her bashful eyes to ground
 and donned the weed of women's modest grace
 down from her eyes welled the pearls round
 upon the bright enamel of her face
 such honey drops on springing flowers are found
 when phoebus holds the crimson morn in chase
 full seemed her looks of anger and of shame
 yet pity shone transparent through the same

 xcv
 if she perceived by his outward cheer
 that any would his love by talk bewray
 sometimes she heard him sometimes stopped her ear
 and played fast and loose the livelong day
 thus all her lovers kind deluded were
 their earnest suit got neither yea nor nay
 but like the sort of weary huntsmen fare
 that hunt all day and lose at night the hare

 xcvi
 these were the arts by which she captived
 a thousand souls of young and lusty knights
 these were the arms wherewith love conquered
 their feeble hearts subdued in wanton fights
 what wonder if achilles were misled
 of great alcides at their ladies' sights
 since these true champions of the lord above
 were thralls to beauty yielden slaves to lore



 fifth book

 the argument
 gernando scorns rinaldo should aspire
 to rule that charge for which he seeks and strives
 and slanders him so far that in his ire
 the wronged knight his foe of life deprives
 far from the camp the slayer doth retire
 nor lets himself be bound in chains or gyves
 armide departs content and from the seas
 godfrey hears news which him and his displease


 i
 while thus armida false the knights misled
 in wandering errors of deceitful love
 and thought besides the champions promised
 the other lordlings in her aid to move
 in godfrey's thought a strong contention bred
 who fittest were this hazard great to prove
 for all the worthies of the adventures' band
 were like in birth in power in strength of hand

 ii
 but first the prince by grave advice decreed
 they should some knight choose at their own election
 that in his charge lord dudon might succeed
 and of that glorious troop should take protection
 so none should grieve displeased with the deed
 nor blame the causer of their new subjection
 besides godfredo showed by this device
 how much he held that regiment in price

 iii
 he called the worthies then and spake them so
 "lordlings you know i yielded to your will
 and gave you license with this dame to go
 to win her kingdom and that tyrant kill
 but now again i let you further know
 in following her it may betide yon ill
 refrain therefore and change this forward thought
 for death unsent for danger comes unsought

 iv
 "but if to shun these perils sought so far
 may seem disgraceful to the place yon hold
 if grave advice and prudent counsel are
 esteemed detractors from your courage bold
 then know i none against his will debar
 nor what i granted erst i now withhold
 but he mine empire as it ought of right
 sweet easy pleasant gentle meek and light

 v
 "go then or tarry each as likes him best
 free power i grant you on this enterprise
 but first in dudon's place now laid in chest
 choose you some other captain stout and wise
 then ten appoint among the worthiest
 but let no more attempt this hard emprise
 in this my will content you that i have
 for power constrained is but a glorious slave"

 vi
 thus godfrey said and thus his brother spake
 and answered for himself and all his peers
 "my lord as well it fitteth thee to make
 these wise delays and cast these doubts and fears
 so 'tis our part at first to undertake
 courage and haste beseems our might and years
 and this proceeding with so grave advice
 wisdom in you in us were cowardice

 vii
 "since then the feat is easy danger none
 all set in battle and in hardy fight
 do thou permit the chosen ten to gone
 and aid the damsel" thus devised the knight
 to make men think the sun of honor shone
 there where the lamp of cupid gave the light
 the rest perceive his guile and it approve
 and call that knighthood which was childish love

 viii
 but loving eustace that with jealous eye
 beheld the worth of sophia's noble child
 and his fair shape did secretly envy
 besides the virtues in his breast compiled
 and for in love he would no company
 he stored his mouth with speeches smoothly filed
 drawing his rival to attend his word
 thus with fair sleight he laid the knight abord

 ix
 "of great bertoldo thou far greater heir
 thou star of knighthood flower of chivalry
 tell me who now shall lead this squadron fair
 since our late guide in marble cold doth lie
 i that with famous dudon might compare
 in all but years hoar locks and gravity
 to whom should i duke godfrey's brother yield
 unless to thee the christian army's shield

 x
 "thee whom high birth makes equal with the best
 thine acts prefer both me and all beforn
 nor that in fight thou both surpass the rest
 and godfrey's worthy self i hold in scorn
 thee to obey then am i only pressed
 before these worthies be thine eagle borne
 this honor haply thou esteemest light
 whose day of glory never yet found night

 xi
 "yet mayest thou further by this means display
 the spreading wings of thy immortal fame
 i will procure it if thou sayest not nay
 and all their wills to thine election frame
 but for i scantly am resolved which way
 to bend my force or where employ the same
 leave me i pray at my discretion free
 to help armida or serve here with thee"

 xii
 this last request for love is evil to hide
 empurpled both his cheeks with scarlet red
 rinaldo soon his passions had descried
 and gently smiling turned aside his head
 and for weak cupid was too feeble eyed
 to strike him sure the fire in him was dead
 so that of rivals was he naught afraid
 nor cared he for the journey or the maid

 xiii
 but in his noble thought revolved he oft
 dudon's high prowess death and burial
 and how argantes bore his plumes aloft
 praising his fortunes for that worthy's fall
 besides the knight's sweet words and praises soft
 to his due honor did him fitly call
 and made his heart rejoice for well he knew
 though much he praised him all his words were true

 xiv
 "degrees" quoth he "of honors high to hold
 i would them first deserve and the desire
 and were my valor such as you have told
 would i for that to higher place aspire
 but if to honors due raise me you would
 i will not of my works refuse the hire
 and much it glads me that my power and might
 ypraised is by such a valiant knight

 xv
 "i neither seek it nor refuse the place
 which if i get the praise and thanks be thine"
 eustace this spoken hied thence apace
 to know which way his fellows' hearts incline
 but prince gernando coveted the place
 whom though armida sought to undermine
 gainst him yet vain did all her engines prove
 his pride was such there was no place for love

 xvi
 gernando was the king of norway's son
 that many a realm and region had to guide
 and for his elders lands and crowns had won
 his heart was puffed up with endless pride
 the other boasts more what himself had done
 than all his ancestors' great acts beside
 yet his forefathers old before him were
 famous in war and peace five hundred years

 xvii
 this barbarous prince who only vainly thought
 that bliss in wealth and kingly power doth lie
 and in respect esteemed all virtue naught
 unless it were adorned with titles high
 could not endure that to the place he sought
 a simple knight should dare to press so nigh
 and in his breast so boiled fell despite
 that ire and wrath exiled reason quite

 xviii
 the hidden devil that lies in close await
 to win the fort of unbelieving man
 found entry there where ire undid the gate
 and in his bosom unperceived ran
 it filled his heart with malice strife and hate
 it made him rage blaspheme swear curse and ban
 invisible it still attends him near
 and thus each minute whispereth in his ear

 xix
 what shall rinaldo match thee dares he tell
 those idle names of his vain pedigree
 then let him say if thee he would excel
 what lands what realms his tributaries be
 if his forefathers in the graves that dwell
 were honored like thine that live let see
 oh how dares one so mean aspire so high
 born in that servile country italy

 xx
 now if he win or if he lose the day
 yet is his praise and glory hence derived
 for that the world will to his credit say
 lo this is he that with gernando strived
 the charge some deal thee haply honor may
 that noble dudon had while here he lived
 but laid on him he would the office shame
 let it suffice he durst desire the same

 xxi
 if when this breath from man's frail body flies
 the soul take keep or know the things done here
 oh how looks dudon from the glorious skies
 what wrath what anger in his face appear
 on this proud youngling while he bends his eyes
 marking how high he doth his feathers rear
 seeing his rash attempt how soon he dare
 though but a boy with his great worth compare

 xxii
 he dares not only but he strives and proves
 where chastisement were fit there wins he praise
 one counsels him his speech him forward moves
 another fool approveth all he says
 if godfrey favor him more than behoves
 why then he wrongeth thee an hundred ways
 nor let thy state so far disgraced be
 now what thou art and canst let godfrey see

 xxiii
 with such false words the kindled fire began
 to every vein his poisoned heart to reach
 it swelled his scornful heart and forth it ran
 at his proud looks and too audacious speech
 all that he thought blameworthy in the man
 to his disgrace that would be each where preach
 he termed him proud and vain his worth in fight
 he called foolhardise rashness madness right

 xxiv
 all that in him was rare or excellent
 all that was good all that was princely found
 with such sharp words as malice could invent
 he blamed such power has wicked tongue to wound
 the youth for everywhere those rumors went
 of these reproaches heard sometimes the sound
 nor did for that his tongue the fault amend
 until it brought him to his woful end

 xxv
 the cursed fiend that set his tongue at large
 still bred more fancies in his idle brain
 his heart with slanders new did overcharge
 and soothed him still in his angry vein
 amid the camp a place was broad and large
 where one fair regiment might easily train
 and there in tilt and harmless tournament
 their days of rest the youths and gallants spent

 xxvi
 there as his fortune would it should betide
 amid the press gernando gan retire
 to vomit out his venom unespied
 wherewith foul envy did his heart inspire
 rinaldo heard him as he stood beside
 and as he could not bridle wrath and ire
 "thou liest" cried he loud and with that word
 about his head he tossed his flaming sword

 xxvii
 thunder his voice and lightning seemed his brand
 so fell his look and furious was his cheer
 gernando trembled for he saw at hand
 pale death and neither help nor comfort near
 yet for the soldiers all to witness stand
 he made proud sign as though he naught did fear
 but bravely drew his littlehelping blade
 and valiant show of strong resistance made

 xxviii
 with that a thousand blades of burnished steel
 glistered on heaps like flames of fire in sight
 hundreds that knew not yet the quarrel weel
 ran thither some to gaze and some to fight
 the empty air a sound confused did feel
 of murmurs low and outcries loud on height
 like rolling waves and boreas' angry blasts
 when roaring seas against the rocks he casts

 xxix
 but not for this the wronged warrior stayed
 his just displeasure and incensed ire
 he cared not what the vulgar did or said
 to vengeance did his courage fierce aspire
 among the thickest weapons way he made
 his thundering sword made all on heaps retire
 so that of near a thousand stayed not one
 but prince gernando bore the brunt alone

 xxx
 his hand too quick to execute his wrath
 performed all as pleased his eye and heart
 at head and breast oft times he strucken hath
 now at the right now at the other part
 on every side thus did he harm and scath
 and oft beguile his sight with nimble art
 that no defence the prince of wounds acquits
 where least he thinks or fears there most he hits

 xxxi
 nor ceased be till in gernando's breast
 he sheathed once or twice his furious blade
 down fell the hapless prince with death oppressed
 a double way to his weak soul was made
 his bloody sword the victor wiped and dressed
 nor longer by the slaughtered body stayed
 but sped him thence and soon appeased hath
 his hate his ire his rancor and his wrath

 xxxii
 called by the tumult godfrey drew him near
 and there beheld a sad and rueful sight
 the signs of death upon his face appear
 with dust and blood his locks were loathly dight
 sighs and complaints on each side might he hear
 made for the sudden death of that great knight
 amazed he asked who durst and did so much
 for yet he knew not whom the fault would touch

 xxxiii
 arnoldo minion of the prince thus slain
 augments the fault in telling it and saith
 this prince murdered for a quarrel vain
 by young rinaldo in his desperate wrath
 and with that sword that should christ's law maintain
 one of christ's champions bold he killed hath
 and this he did in such a place and hour
 as if he scorned your rule despised your power

 xxxiv
 and further adds that he deserved death
 by law and law should inviolate
 that none offence could greater be uneath
 and yet the place the fault did aggravate
 if he escapes that mischief would take breath
 and flourish bold in spite of rule and state
 and that gernando's friends would venge the wrong
 although to justice that did first belong

 xxxv
 and by that means should discord hate and strife
 raise mutinies and what therefore ensueth
 lastly he praised the dead and still had rife
 all words he thought could vengeance move or rut
 against him tancred argued for life
 with honest reasons to excuse the youth
 the duke heard all but with such sober cheer
 as banished hope and still increased fear

 xxxvi
 "great prince" quoth tancred "set before thine eyes
 rinaldo's worth and courage what it is
 how much our hope of conquest in him lies
 regard that princely house and race of his
 he that correcteth every fault he spies
 and judgeth all alike doth all amiss
 for faults you know are greater thought or less
 as is the person's self that doth transgress"

 xxxvii
 godfredo answered him "if high and low
 of sovereign power alike should feel the stroke
 then tancred ill you counsel us i trow
 if lords should know no law as erst you spoke
 how vile and base our empire were you know
 if none but slaves and peasants bear the yoke
 weak is the sceptre and the power is small
 that such provisos bring annexed withal

 xxxviii
 "but mine was freely given ere 'twas sought
 nor that it lessened be i now consent
 right well know i both when and where i ought
 to give condign reward and punishment
 since you are all in like subjection brought
 both high and low obey and be content"
 this heard tancredi wisely stayed his words
 such weight the sayings have of kings and lords

 xxxix
 old raymond praised his speech for old men think
 they ever wisest seem when most severe
 "'tis best" quoth he "to make these great ones shrink
 the people love him whom the nobles fear
 there must the rule to all disorders sink
 where pardons more than punishments appear
 for feeble is each kingdom frail and weak
 unless his basis be this fear i speak"

 xl
 these words tancredi heard and pondered well
 and by them wist how godfrey's thoughts were bent
 nor list he longer with these old men dwell
 but turned his horse and to rinaldo went
 who when his noble foe deathwounded fell
 withdrew him softly to his gorgeous tent
 there tancred found him and at large declared
 the words and speeches sharp which late you heard

 xli
 and said "although i wot the outward show
 is not true witness of the secret thought
 for that some men so subtle are i trow
 that what they purpose most appeareth naught
 yet dare i say godfredo means i know
 such knowledge hath his looks and speeches wrought
 you shall first prisoner be and then be tried
 as he shall deem it good and law provide"

 xlii
 with that a bitter smile well might you see
 rinaldo cast with scorn and high disdain
 "let them in fetters plead their cause" quoth he
 "that are base peasants born of servile stain
 i was free born i live and will die free
 before these feet be fettered in a chain
 these hands were made to shake sharp spears and swords
 not to be tied in gyves and twisted cords

 xliii
 "if my good service reap this recompense
 to be clapt up in close and secret mew
 and as a thief be after dragged from thence
 to suffer punishment as law finds due
 let godfrey come or send i will not hence
 until we know who shall this bargain rue
 that of our tragedy the late done fact
 may be the first and this the second act

 xliv
 "give me mine arms" he cried his squire them brings
 and clad his head and dressed in iron strong
 about his neck his silver shield he flings
 down by his side a cutting sword there hung
 among this earth's brave lords and mighty kings
 was none so stout so fierce so fair so young
 god mars he seemed descending from his sphere
 or one whose looks could make great mars to fear

 xlv
 tancredi labored with some pleasing speech
 his spirits fierce and courage to appease
 "young prince thy valor" thus he gan to preach
 "can chastise all that do thee wrong at ease
 i know your virtue can your enemies teach
 that you can venge you when and where you please
 but god forbid this day you lift your arm
 to do this camp and us your friends such harm

 xlvi
 "tell me what will you do why would you stain
 your noble hands in our unguilty blood
 by wounding christians will you again
 pierce christ whose parts they are and members good
 will you destroy us for your glory vain
 unstayed as rolling waves in ocean flood
 far be it from you so to prove your strength
 and let your zeal appease your rage at length

 xlvii
 "for god's love stay your heat and just displeasure
 appease your wrath your courage fierce assuage
 patience a praise forbearance is a treasure
 suffrance an angel's is a monster rage
 at least you actions by example measure
 and think how i in mine unbridled age
 was wronged yet i would not revengement take
 on all this camp for one offender's sake

 xlviii
 "cilicia conquered i as all men wot
 and there the glorious cross on high i reared
 but baldwin came and what i nobly got
 bereft me falsely when i least him feared
 he seemed my friend and i discovered not
 his secret covetise which since appeared
 yet strive i not to get mine own by fight
 or civil war although perchance i might

 xlix
 "if then you scorn to be in prison pent
 if bonds as high disgrace your hands refuse
 or if your thoughts still to maintain are bent
 your liberty as men of honor use
 to antioch what if forthwith you went
 and leave me here your absence to excuse
 there with prince boemond live in ease and peace
 until this storm of godfrey's anger cease

 l
 "for soon if forces come from egypt land
 or other nations that us here confine
 godfrey will beaten be with his own wand
 and feel he wants that valor great of thine
 our camp may seem an arm without a hand
 amid our troops unless thy eagle shine"
 with that came guelpho and those words approved
 and prayed him go if him he feared or loved

 li
 their speeches soften much the warrior's heart
 and make his wilful thoughts at last relent
 so that he yields and saith he will depart
 and leave the christian camp incontinent
 his friends whose love did never shrink or start
 preferred their aid what way soe'er he went
 he thanked them all but left them all besides
 two bold and trusty squires and so he rides

 lii
 he rides revolving in his noble spright
 such haughty thoughts as fill the glorious mind
 on hard adventures was his whole delight
 and now to wondrous acts his will inclined
 alone against the pagans would he fight
 and kill their kings from egypt unto inde
 from cynthia's hills and nilus' unknown spring
 he would fetch praise and glorious conquest bring

 liii
 but guelpho when the prince his leave had take
 and now had spurred his courser on his way
 no longer tarriance with the rest would make
 but tastes to find godfredo if he may
 who seeing him approaching forthwith spake
 "guelpho" quoth he "for thee i only stay
 for thee i sent my heralds all about
 in every tent to seek and find thee out"

 liv
 this said he softly drew the knight aside
 where none might hear and then bespake him thus
 "how chanceth it thy nephew's rage and pride
 makes him so far forget himself and us
 hardly could i believe what is betide
 a murder done for cause so frivolous
 how i have loved him thou and all can tell
 but godfrey loved him but whilst he did well

 lv
 "i must provide that every one have right
 that all be heard each cause be well discussed
 as far from partial love as free from spite
 i hear complaints yet naught but proves i trust
 now if rinaldo weigh our rule too light
 and have the sacred lore of war so brust
 take you the charge that he before us come
 to clear himself and hear our upright dome

 lvi
 "but let him come withouten bond or chain
 for still my thoughts to do him grace are framed
 but if our power he haply shall disdain
 as well i know his courage yet untamed
 to bring him by persuasion take some pain
 else if i prove severe both you be blamed
 that forced my gentle nature gainst my thought
 to rigor lest our laws return to naught"

 lvii
 lord guelpho answered thus "what heart can bear
 such slanders false devised by hate and spite
 or with stayed patience reproaches hear
 and not revenge by battle or by fight
 the norway prince hath bought his folly dear
 but who with words could stay the angry knight
 a fool is he that comes to preach or prate
 when men with swords their right and wrong debate

 lviii
 "and where you wish he should himself submit
 to hear the censure of your upright laws
 alas that cannot be for he is flit
 out if this camp withouten stay or pause
 there take my gage behold i offer it
 to him that first accused him in this cause
 or any else that dare and will maintain
 that for his pride the prince was justly slain

 lix
 "i say with reason lord gernando's pride
 he hath abated if he have offended
 gainst your commands who are his lord and guide
 oh pardon him that fault shall be amended"
 "if he be gone" quoth godfrey "let him ride
 and brawl elsewhere here let all strife be ended
 and you lord guelpho for your nephew's sake
 breed us no new nor quarrels old awake"

 lx
 this while the fair and false armida strived
 to get her promised aid in sure possession
 the day to end with endless plaint she derived
 wit beauty craft for her made intercession
 but when the earth was once of light deprived
 and western seas felt titan's hot impression
 'twixt two old knights and matrons twain she went
 where pitched was her fair and curious tent

 lxi
 but this false queen of craft and sly invention
 whose looks love's arrows were whose eyes his quivers
 whose beauty matchless free from reprehension
 a wonder left by heaven to afterlivers
 among the christian lord had bred contention
 who first should quench his flames in cupid's rivers
 while all her weapons and her darts rehearsed
 had not godfredo's constant bosom pierced

 lxii
 to change his modest thought the dame procureth
 and proffereth heaps of love's enticing treasure
 but as the falcon newly gorged endureth
 her keeper lure her oft but comes at leisure
 so he whom fulness of delight assureth
 what long repentance comes of love's short pleasure
 her crafts her arts herself and all despiseth
 so base affections fall when virtue riseth

 lxiii
 and not one foot his steadfast foot was moved
 out of that heavenly path wherein he paced
 yet thousand wiles and thousand ways she proved
 to have that castle fair of goodness raised
 she used those looks and smiles that most behoved
 to melt the frost which his hard heart embraced
 and gainst his breast a thousand shot she ventured
 yet was the fort so strong it was not entered

 lxiv
 the dame who thought that one blink of her eye
 could make the chastest heart feel love's sweet pain
 oh how her pride abated was hereby
 when all her sleights were void her crafts were vain
 some other where she would her forces try
 where at more ease she might more vantage gain
 as tired soldiers whom some fort keeps out
 thence raise their siege and spoil the towns about

 lxv
 but yet all ways the wily witch could find
 could not tancredi's heart to loveward move
 his sails were filled with another wind
 he list no blast of new affection prove
 for as one poison doth exclude by kind
 another's force so love excludeth love
 these two alone nor more nor less the dame
 could win the rest all burnt in her sweet flame

 lxvi
 the princess though her purpose would not frame
 as late she hoped and as still she would
 yet for the lords and knights of greatest name
 became her prey as erst you heard it told
 she thought ere truthrevealing time or frame
 bewrayed her act to lead them to some hold
 where chains and band she meant to make them prove
 composed by vulcan not by gentle love

 lxvii
 the time prefixed at length was come and past
 which godfrey had set down to lend her aid
 when at his feet herself to earth she cast
 "the hour is come my lord" she humbly said
 "and if the tyrant haply hear at last
 his banished niece hath your assistance prayed
 he will in arms to save his kingdom rise
 so shall we harder make this enterprise

 lxviii
 "before report can bring the tyrant news
 or his espials certify their king
 oh let thy goodness these few champions choose
 that to her kingdom should thy handmaid bring
 who except heaven to aid the right refuse
 recover shall her crown from whence shall spring
 thy profit for betide thee peace or war
 thine all her cities all her subjects are"

 lxix
 the captain sage the damsel fair assured
 his word was passed and should not be recanted
 and she with sweet and humble grace endured
 to let him point those ten which late he granted
 but to be one each one fought and procured
 no suit no entreaty intercession wanted
 there envy each at others' love exceeded
 and all importunate made more than needed

 lxx
 she that well saw the secret of their hearts
 and knew how best to warm them in their blood
 against them threw the cursed poisoned darts
 of jealousy and grief at others' good
 for love she wist was weak without those arts
 and slow for jealousy is cupid's food
 for the swift steed runs not so fast alone
 as when some strain some strive him to outgone

 lxxi
 her words in such alluring sort she framed
 her looks enticing and her wooing smiles
 that every one his fellows' favors blamed
 that of their mistress he received erewhiles
 this foolish crew of lovers unashamed
 mad with the poison of her secret wiles
 ran forward still in this disordered sort
 nor could godfredo's bridle rein them short

 lxxii
 he that would satisfy each good desire
 withouten partial love of every knight
 although he swelled with shame with grief and ire
 to see these fellows and these fashions light
 yet since by no advice they would retire
 another way he sought to set them right
 "write all your names" quoth he "and see whom chance
 of lot to this exploit will first advance"

 lxxiii
 their names were writ and in an helmet shaken
 while each did fortune's grace and aid implore
 at last they drew them and the foremost taken
 the earl of pembroke was artemidore
 doubtless the county thought his bread well baken
 next gerrard followed then with tresses hoar
 old wenceslaus that felt cupid's rage
 now in his doating and his dying age

 lxxiv
 oh how contentment in their foreheads shined
 their looks with joy thoughts swelled with secret pleasure
 these three it seemed good success designed
 to make the lords of love and beauty's treasure
 their doubtful fellows at their hap repined
 and with small patience wait fortune's leisure
 upon his lips that read the scrolls attending
 as if their lives were on his words depending

 lxxv
 guasco the fourth ridolpho him succeeds
 then ulderick whom love list so advance
 lord william of ronciglion next he reads
 then eberard and henry born in france
 rambaldo last whom wicked lust so leads
 that he forsook his saviour with mischance
 this wretch the tenth was who was thus deluded
 the rest to their huge grief were all excluded

 lxxvi
 o'ercome with envy wrath and jealousy
 the rest blind fortune curse and all her laws
 and mad with love yet out on love they cry
 that in his kingdom let her judge their cause
 and for man's mind is such that oft we try
 things most forbidden without stay or pause
 in spite of fortune purposed many a knight
 to follow fair armida when 'twas night

 lxxvii
 to follow her by night or else by day
 and in her quarrel venture life and limb
 with sighs and tears she gan them softly pray
 to keep that promise when the skies were dim
 to this and that knight did she plain and say
 what grief she felt to part withouten him
 meanwhile the ten had donned their armor best
 and taken leave of godfrey and the rest

 lxxviii
 the duke advised them every one apart
 how light how trustless was the pagan's faith
 and told what policy what wit what art
 avoids deceit which heedless men betray'th
 his speeches pierce their ear but not their heart
 love calls it folly whatso wisdom saith
 thus warned he leaves them to their wanton guide
 who parts that night such haste had she to ride

 lxxix
 the conqueress departs and with her led
 these prisoners whom love would captive keep
 the hearts of those she left behind her bled
 with point of sorrow's arrow pierced deep
 but when the night her drowsy mantle spread
 and filled the earth with silence shade and sleep
 in secret sort then each forsook his tent
 and as blind cupid led them blind they went

 lxxx
 eustatio first who scantly could forbear
 till friendly night might hide his haste and shame
 he rode in post and let his breast him bear
 as his blind fancy would his journey frame
 all night he wandered and he wist not where
 but with the morning he espied the dame
 that with her guard up from a village rode
 where she and they that night had made abode

 lxxxi
 thither he galloped fast and drawing near
 rambaldo knew the knight and loudly cried
 "whence comes young eustace and what seeks he here"
 "i come" quoth he "to serve the queen armide
 if she accept me would we all were there
 where my goodwill and faith might best be tried"
 "who" quoth the other "choseth thee to prove
 this high exploit of hers" he answered "love"

 lxxxii
 "love hath eustatio chosen fortune thee
 in thy conceit which is the best election"
 "nay then these shifts are vain" replied he
 "these titles false serve thee for no protection
 thou canst not here for this admitted be
 our fellowservant in this sweet subjection"
 "and who" quoth eustace angry "dares deny
 my fellowship" rambaldo answered "i"

 lxxxiii
 and with that word his cutting sword he drew
 that glittered bright and sparkled flaming fire
 upon his foe the other champion flew
 with equal courage and with equal ire
 the gentle princess who the danger knew
 between them stepped and prayed them both retire
 "rambald" quoth she "why should you grudge or plain
 if i a champion you an helper gain

 lxxxiv
 "if me you love why wish you me deprived
 in so great need of such a puissant knight
 but welcome eustace in good time arrived
 defender of my state my life my right
 i wish my hapless self no longer lived
 when i esteem such good assistance light"
 thus talked they on and travelled on their way
 their fellowship increasing every day

 lxxxv
 from every side they come yet wist there none
 of others coming or of others' mind
 she welcomes all and telleth every one
 what joy her thoughts in his arrival find
 but when duke godfrey wist his knights were gone
 within his breast his wiser soul divined
 some hard mishap upon his friends should light
 for which he sighed all day and wept all night

 lxxxvi
 a messenger while thus he mused drew near
 all soiled with dust and sweat quite out of breath
 it seemed the man did heavy tidings bear
 upon his looks sate news of loss and death
 "my lord" quoth he "so many ships appear
 at sea that neptune bears the load uneath
 from egypt come they all this lets thee weet
 william lord admiral of the genoa fleet

 lxxxvii
 "besides a convoy coming from the shore
 with victual for this noble camp of thine
 surprised was and lost is all that store
 mules horses camels laden corn and wine
 thy servants fought till they could fight no more
 for all were slain or captives made in fine
 the arabian outlaws them assailed by night
 when least they feared and least they looked for fight

 lxxxviii
 "their frantic boldness doth presume so far
 that many christians have they falsely slain
 and like a raging flood they spared are
 and overflow each country field and plain
 send therefore some strong troops of men of war
 to force them hence and drive them home again
 and keep the ways between these tents of thine
 and those broad seas the seas of palestine"

 lxxxix
 from mouth to mouth the heavy rumor spread
 of these misfortunes which dispersed wide
 among the soldiers great amazement bred
 famine they doubt and new come foes beside
 the duke that saw their wonted courage fled
 and in the place thereof weak fear espied
 with merry looks these cheerful words he spake
 to make them heart again and courage take

 xc
 "you champions bold with me that 'scaped have
 so many dangers and such hard assays
 whom still your god did keep defend and save
 in all your battles combats fights and frays
 you that subdued the turks and persians brave
 that thirst and hunger held in scorn always
 and vanquished hills and seas with heat and cold
 shall vain reports appal your courage bold

 xci
 "that lord who helped you out at every need
 when aught befell this glorious camp amiss
 shall fortune all your actions well to speed
 on whom his mercy large extended is
 tofore his tomb when conquering hands you spreed
 with what delight will you remember this
 be strong therefore and keep your valors high
 to honor conquest fame and victory"

 xcii
 their hopes half dead and courage wellnigh lost
 revived with these brave speeches of their guide
 but in his breast a thousand cares he tost
 although his sorrows he could wisely hide
 he studied how to feed that mighty host
 in so great scarceness and what force provide
 he should against the egyptian warriors sly
 and how subdue those thieves of araby



 sixth book

 the argument
 argantes calls the christians out to just
 otho not chosen doth his strength assay
 but from his saddle tumbleth in the dust
 and captive to the town is sent away
 tancred begins new fight and when both trust
 to win the praise and palm night ends the fray
 erminia hopes to cure her wounded knight
 and from the city armed rides by night


 i
 but better hopes had them recomforted
 that lay besieged in the sacred town
 with new supply late were they victualled
 when night obscured the earth with shadows brown
 their armes and engines on the walls they spread
 their slings to cast and stones to tumble down
 and all that side which to the northward lies
 high rampiers and strong bulwarks fortifies

 ii
 their wary king commands now here now there
 to build this tower to make that bulwark strong
 whether the sun the moon or stars appear
 to give them time to work no time comes wrong
 in every street new weapons forged were
 by cunning smiths sweating with labor long
 while thus the careful prince provision made
 to him argantes came and boasting said

 iii
 "how long shall we like prisoners in chains
 captived lie inclosed within this wall
 i see your workmen taking endless pains
 to make new weapons for no use at all
 meanwhile these western thieves destroy the plains
 your towns are burnt your forts and castles fall
 yet none of us dares at these gates outpeep
 or sound one trumpet shrill to break their sleep

 iv
 "their time in feasting and good cheer they spend
 nor dare we once their banquets sweet molest
 the days and night likewise they bring to end
 in peace assurance quiet ease and rest
 but we must yield whom hunger soon will shend
 and make for peace to save our lives request
 else if th' egyptian army stay too long
 like cowards die within this fortress strong

 v
 "yet never shall my courage great consent
 so vile a death should end my noble days
 nor on mine arms within these walls ypent
 tomorrow's sun shall spread his timely rays
 let sacred heavens dispose as they are bent
 of this frail life yet not withouten praise
 of valor prowess might argantes shall
 inglorious die or unrevenged fall

 vi
 "but if the roots of wonted chivalry
 be not quite dead your princely breast within
 devise not how with frame and praise to die
 but how to live to conquer and to win
 let us together at these gates outfly
 and skirmish bold and bloody fight begin
 for when last need to desperation driveth
 who dareth most he wisest counsel giveth

 vii
 "but if in field your wisdom dare not venture
 to hazard all your troops to doubtful fight
 then bind yourself to godfrey by indenture
 to end your quarrels by one single knight
 and for the christian this accord shall enter
 with better will say such you know your right
 that he the weapons place and time shall choose
 and let him for his best that vantage use

 viii
 "for though your foe had hands like hector strong
 with heart unfeared and courage stern and stout
 yet no misfortune can your justice wrong
 and what that wanteth shall this arm help out
 in spite of fate shall this right hand ere long
 return victorious if hereof you doubt
 take it for pledge wherein if trust you have
 it shall yourself defend and kingdom save"

 ix
 "bold youth" the tyrant thus began to speak
 "although i withered seem with age and years
 yet are not these old arms so faint and weak
 nor this hoar head so full of doubts and fears
 but whenas death this vital thread shall break
 he shall my courage hear my death who hears
 and aladine that lived a king and knight
 to his fair morn will have an evening bright

 x
 "but that which yet i would have further blazed
 to thee in secret shall be told and spoken
 great soliman of nice so far ypraised
 to be revenged for his sceptre broken
 the men of arms of araby hath raised
 from inde to africk and when we give token
 attends the favor of the friendly night
 to victual us and with our foes to fight

 xi
 "now though godfredo hold by warlike feat
 some castles poor and forts in vile oppression
 care not for that for still our princely seat
 this stately town we keep in our possession
 but thou appease and calm that courage great
 which in thy bosom make so hot impression
 and stay fit time which will betide ere long
 to increase thy glory and revenge our wrong"

 xii
 the saracen at this was inly spited
 who soliman's great worth had long envied
 to hear him praised thus he naught delighted
 nor that the king upon his aid relied
 "within your power sir king" he says "united
 are peace and war nor shall that be denied
 but for the turk and his arabian band
 he lost his own shall he defend your land

 xiii
 "perchance he comes some heavenly messenger
 sent down to set the pagan people free
 then let argantes for himself take care
 this sword i trust shall well safeconduct me
 but while you rest and all your forces spare
 that i go forth to war at least agree
 though not your champion yet a private knight
 i will some christian prove in single fight"

 xiv
 the king replied "though thy force and might
 should be reserved to better time and use
 yet that thou challenge some renowned knight
 among the christians bold i not refuse"
 the warrior breathing out desire of fight
 an herald called and said "go tell those news
 to godfrey's self and to the western lords
 and in their hearings boldly say these words

 xv
 "say that a knight who holds in great disdain
 to be thus closed up in secret mew
 will with his sword in open field maintain
 if any dare deny his words for true
 that no devotion as they falsely feign
 hath moved the french these countries to subdue
 but vile ambition and pride's hateful vice
 desire of rule and spoil and covetice

 xvi
 "and that to fight i am not only prest
 with one or two that dare defend the cause
 but come the fourth or fifth come all the rest
 come all that will and all that weapon draws
 let him that yields obey the victor's hest
 as wills the lore of mighty mars his laws"
 this was the challenge that fierce pagan sent
 the herald donned his coatofarms and went

 xvii
 and when the man before the presence came
 of princely godfrey and his captains bold
 "my lord" quoth he "may i withouten blame
 before your grace my message brave unfold"
 "thou mayest" he answered "we approve the same
 withouten fear be thine ambassage told"
 "then" quoth the herald "shall your highness see
 if this ambassage sharp or pleasing be"

 xviii
 the challenge gan he then at large expose
 with mighty threats high terms and glorious words
 on every side an angry murmur rose
 to wrath so moved were the knights and lords
 then godfrey spake and said "the man hath chose
 an hard exploit but when he feels our swords
 i trust we shall so far entreat the knight
 as to excuse the fourth or fifth of fight

 xix
 "but let him come and prove the field i grant
 nor wrong nor treason let him doubt or fear
 some here shall pay him for his glorious vaunt
 without or guile or vantage that i swear
 the herald turned when he had ended scant
 and hasted back the way he came whileare
 nor stayed he aught nor once forslowed his pace
 till he bespake argantes face to face

 xx
 "arm you my lord" he said "your bold defies
 by your brave foes accepted boldly been
 this combat neither high nor low denies
 ten thousand wish to meet you on the green
 a thousand frowned with angry flaming eyes
 and shaked for rage their swords and weapons keen
 the field is safely granted by their guide"
 this said the champion for his armor cried

 xxi
 while he was armed his heart for ire nigh brake
 so yearned his courage hot his foes to find
 the king to fair clorinda present spake
 "if he go forth remain not you behind
 but of our soldiers best a thousand take
 to guard his person and your own assigned
 yet let him meet alone the christian knight
 and stand yourself aloof while they two fight"

 xxii
 thus spake the king and soon without abode
 the troop went forth in shining armor clad
 before the rest the pagan champion rode
 his wonted arms and ensigns all he had
 a goodly plain displayed wide and broad
 between the city and the camp was spread
 a place like that wherein proud rome beheld
 the forward young men manage spear and shield

 xxiii
 there all alone argantes took his stand
 defying christ and all his servants true
 in stature stomach and in strength of hand
 in pride presumption and in dreadful show
 encelade like on the phlegrean strand
 or that huge giant jesse's infant slew
 but his fierce semblant they esteemed light
 for most not knew or else not feared his might

 xxiv
 as yet not one had godfrey singled out
 to undertake this hardy enterprise
 but on prince tancred saw he all the rout
 had fixed their wishes and had cast their eyes
 on him he spied them gazing round about
 as though their honor on his prowess lies
 and now they whispered louder what they meant
 which godfrey heard and saw and was content

 xxv
 the rest gave place for every one descried
 to whom their chieftain's will did most incline
 "tancred" quoth he "i pray thee calm the pride
 abate the rage of yonder saracine"
 no longer would the chosen champion bide
 his face with joy his eyes with gladness shine
 his helm he took and ready steed bestrode
 and guarded with his trusty friends forth rode

 xxvi
 but scantly had he spurred his courser swift
 near to the plain where proud argantes stayed
 when unawares his eyes he chanced to lift
 and on the hill beheld the warlike maid
 as white as snow upon the alpine clift
 the virgin shone in silver arms arrayed
 her vental up so high that he descried
 her goodly visage and her beauty's pride

 xxvii
 he saw not where the pagan stood and stared
 as if with looks he would his foeman kill
 but full of other thoughts he forward fared
 and sent his looks before him up the hill
 his gesture such his troubled soul declared
 at last as marble rock he standeth still
 stone cold without within burnt with love's flame
 and quite forgot himself and why he came

 xxviii
 the challenger that yet saw none appear
 that made or sign or show he came to just
 "how long" cried he "shall i attend you here
 dares none come forth dares none his fortune trust"
 the other stood amazed love stopped his ear
 he thinks on cupid think of mars who lust
 but forth stert otho bold and took the field
 a gentle knight whom god from danger shield

 xxix
 this youth was one of those who late desired
 with that vainglorious boaster to have fought
 but tancred chosen he and all retired
 now when his slackness he awhile admired
 and saw elsewhere employed was his thought
 nor that to just though chosen once he proffered
 he boldly took that fit occasion offered

 xxx
 no tiger panther spotted leopard
 runs half so swift the forests wild among
 as this young champion hasted thitherward
 where he attending saw the pagan strong
 tancredi started with the noise he heard
 as waked from sleep where he had dreamed long
 "oh stay" he cried "to me belongs this war"
 but cried too late otho was gone too far

 xxxi
 then full of fury anger and despite
 he stayed his horse and waxed red for shame
 the fight was his but now disgraced quite
 himself he thought another played his game
 meanwhile the saracen did hugely smite
 on otho's helm who to requite the same
 his foe quite through his sevenfold targe did bear
 and in his breastplate stuck and broke his spear

 xxxii
 the encounter such upon the tender grass
 down from his steed the christian backward fell
 yet his proud foe so strong and sturdy was
 that he nor shook nor staggered in his sell
 but to the knight that lay full low alas
 in high disdain his will thus gan he tell
 "yield thee my slave and this thine honor be
 thou may'st report thou hast encountered me"

 xxxiii
 "not so" quoth he "pardy it's not the guise
 of christian knights though fall'n so soon to yield
 i can my fall excuse in better wise
 and will revenge this shame or die in field"
 the great circassian bent his frowning eyes
 like that grim visage in minerva's shield
 "then learn" quoth he "what force argantes useth
 against that fool that proffered grace refuseth"

 xxxiv
 with that he spurred his horse with speed and haste
 forgetting what good knights to virtue owe
 otho his fury shunned and as he passed
 at his right side he reached a noble blow
 wide was the wound the blood outstreamed fast
 and from his side fell to his stirrup low
 but what avails to hurt if wounds augment
 our foe's fierce courage strength and hardiment

 xxxv
 argantes nimbly turned his ready steed
 and ere his foe was wist or well aware
 against his side he drove his courser's head
 what force could he gainst so great might prepare
 weak were his feeble joints his courage dead
 his heart amazed his paleness showed his care
 his tender side gainst the hard earth he cast
 shamed with the first fall bruised with the last

 xxxvi
 the victor spurred again his lightfoot steed
 and made his passage over otho's heart
 and cried "these fools thus under foot i tread
 that dare contend with me in equal mart"
 tancred for anger shook his noble head
 so was he grieved with that unknightly part
 the fault was his he was so slow before
 with double valor would he salve that sore

 xxxvii
 forward he galloped fast and loudly cried
 "villain" quoth he "thy conquest is thy shame
 what praise what honor shall this fact betide
 what gain what guerdon shall befall the same
 among the arabian thieves thy face go hide
 far from resort of men of worth and fame
 or else in woods and mountains wild by night
 on savage beasts employ thy savage might"

 xxxviii
 the pagan patience never knew nor used
 trembling for ire his sandy locks he tore
 out from his lips flew such a sound confused
 as lions make in deserts thick which roar
 or as when clouds together crushed and bruised
 pour down a tempest by the caspian shore
 so was his speech imperfect stopped and broken
 he roared and thundered when he should have spoken

 xxxix
 but when with threats they both had whetted keen
 their eager rage their fury spite and ire
 they turned their steeds and left large space between
 to make their forces greater 'proaching nigher
 with terms that warlike and that worthy been
 o sacred muse my haughty thoughts inspire
 and make a trumpet of my slender quill
 to thunder out this furious combat shrill

 xl
 these sons of mavors bore instead of spears
 two knotty masts which none but they could lift
 each foaming steed so fast his master bears
 that never beast bird shaft flew half so swift
 such was their fury as when boreas tears
 the shattered crags from taurus' northern clift
 upon their helms their lances long they broke
 and up to heaven flew splinters sparks and smoke

 xli
 the shock made all the towers and turrets quake
 and woods and mountains all nigh hand resound
 yet could not all that force and fury shake
 the valiant champions nor their persons wound
 together hurtled both their steeds and brake
 each other's neck the riders lay on ground
 but they great masters of war's dreadful art
 plucked forth their swords and soon from earth up start

 xlii
 close at his surest ward each warrior lieth
 he wisely guides his hand his foot his eye
 this blow he proveth that defence he trieth
 he traverseth retireth presseth nigh
 now strikes he out and now he falsifieth
 this blow he wardeth that he lets slip by
 and for advantage oft he lets some part
 discovered seem thus art deludeth art

 xliii
 the pagan ill defenced with sword or targe
 tancredi's thigh as he supposed espied
 and reaching forth gainst it his weapon large
 quite naked to his foe leaves his leftside
 tancred avoideth quick his furious charge
 and gave him eke a wound deep sore and wide
 that done himself safe to his ward retired
 his courage praised by all his skill admired

 xliv
 the proud circassian saw his streaming blood
 down from his wound as from a fountain running
 he sighed for rage and trembled as he stood
 he blamed his fortune folly want of cunning
 he lift his sword aloft for ire nigh wood
 and forward rushed tancred his fury shunning
 with a sharp thrust once more the pagan hit
 to his broad shoulder where his arm is knit

 xlv
 like as a bear through pierced with a dart
 within the secret woods no further flieth
 but bites the senseless weapon mad with smart
 seeking revenge till unrevenged she dieth
 so mad argantes fared when his proud heart
 wound upon wound and shame on shame espieth
 desire of vengeance so o'ercame his senses
 that he forgot all dangers all defences

 xlvi
 uniting force extreme with endless wrath
 supporting both with youth and strength untired
 his thundering blows so fast about he layeth
 that skies and earth the flying sparkles fired
 his foe to strike one blow no leisure hath
 scantly he breathed though he oft desired
 his warlike skill and cunning all was waste
 such was argantes' force and such his haste

 xlvii
 long time tancredi had in vain attended
 when this huge storm should overblow and pass
 some blows his mighty target well defended
 some fell beside and wounded deep the grass
 but when he saw the tempest never ended
 nor that the paynim's force aught weaker was
 he high advanced his cutting sword at length
 and rage to rage opposed and strength to strength

 xlviii
 wrath bore the sway both art and reason fail
 fury new force and courage new supplies
 their armors forged were of metal frail
 on every side thereof huge cantels flies
 the land was strewed all with plate and mail
 that on the earth on that their warm blood lies
 and at each rush and every blow they smote
 thunder the noise the sparks seemed lightning hot

 xlix
 the christian people and the pagans gazed
 on this fierce combat wishing oft the end
 twixt hope and fear they stood long time amazed
 to see the knights assail and eke defend
 yet neither sign they made nor noise they raised
 but for the issue of the fight attend
 and stood as still as life and sense they wanted
 save that their hearts within their bosoms panted

 l
 now were they tired both and wellnigh spent
 their blows show greater will than power to wound
 but night her gentle daughter darkness sent
 with friendly shade to overspread the ground
 two heralds to the fighting champions went
 to part the fray as laws of arms them bound
 aridens born in france and wise pindore
 the man that brought the challenge proud before

 li
 these men their sceptres interpose between
 the doubtful hazards of uncertain fight
 for such their privilege hath ever been
 the law of nations doth defend their right
 pindore began "stay stay you warriors keen
 equal your honor equal is your might
 forbear this combat so we deem it best
 give night her due and grant your persons rest

 lii
 "man goeth forth to labor with the sun
 but with the night all creatures draw to sleep
 nor yet of hidden praise in darkness won
 the valiant heart of noble knight takes keep"
 argantes answered him "the fight begun
 now to forbear doth wound my heart right deep
 yet will i stay so that this christian swear
 before you both again to meet me here"

 liii
 "i swear" quoth tancred "but swear thou likewise
 to make return thy prisoner eke with thee
 else for achievement of this enterprise
 none other time but this expect of me"
 thus swore they both the heralds both devise
 what time for this exploit should fittest be
 and for their wounds of rest and cure had need
 to meet again the sixth day was decreed

 liv
 this fight was deep imprinted in their hearts
 that saw this bloody fray to ending brought
 an horror great possessed their weaker parts
 which made them shrink who on their combat thought
 much speech was of the praise and high desarts
 of these brave champions that so nobly fought
 but which for knightly worth was most ypraised
 of that was doubt and disputation raised

 lv
 all long to see them end this doubtful fray
 and as they favor so they wish success
 these hope true virtue shall obtain the day
 those trust on fury strength and hardiness
 but on erminia most this burden lay
 whose looks her trouble and her fear express
 for on this dangerous combat's doubtful end
 her joy her comfort hope and life depend

 lvi
 her the sole daughter of that hapless king
 that of proud antioch late wore the crown
 the christian soldiers to tancredi bring
 when they had sacked and spoiled that glorious town
 but he in whom all good and virtue spring
 the virgin's honor saved and her renown
 and when her city and her state was lost
 then was her person loved and honored most

 lvii
 he honored her served her and leave her gave
 and willed her go whither and when she list
 her gold and jewels had he care to save
 and them restored all she nothing missed
 she that beheld this youth and person brave
 when by this deed his noble mind she wist
 laid ope her heart for cupid's shaft to hit
 who never knots of love more surer knit

 lviii
 her body free captivated was her heart
 and love the keys did of that prison bear
 prepared to go it was a death to part
 from that kind lord and from that prison dear
 but thou o honor which esteemed art
 the chiefest virtue noble ladies wear
 enforcest her against her will to wend
 to aladine her mother's dearest friend

 lix
 at sion was this princess entertained
 by that old tyrant and her mother dear
 whose loss too soon the woful damsel plained
 her grief was such she lived not half the year
 yet banishment nor loss of friends constrained
 the hapless maid her passions to forbear
 for though exceeding were her woe and grief
 of all her sorrows yet her love was chief

 lx
 the silly maid in secret longing pined
 her hope a mote drawn up by phoebus' rays
 her love a mountain seemed whereon bright shined
 fresh memory of tancred's worth and praise
 within her closet if her self she shrined
 a hotter fire her tender heart assays
 tancred at last to raise her hope nigh dead
 before those walls did his broad ensign spread

 lxi
 the rest to view the christian army feared
 such seemed their number such their power and might
 but she alone her troubled forehead cleared
 and on them spread her beauty shining bright
 in every squadron when it first appeared
 her curious eye sought out her chosen knight
 and every gallant that the rest excels
 the same seems him so love and fancy tells

 lxii
 within the kingly palace builded high
 a turret standeth near the city's wall
 from which erminia might at ease descry
 the western host the plains and mountains all
 and there she stood all the long day to spy
 from phoebus' rising to his evening fall
 and with her thoughts disputed of his praise
 and every thought a scalding sigh did raise

 lxiii
 from hence the furious combat she surveyed
 and felt her heart tremble with fear and pain
 her secret thoughts thus to her fancy said
 behold thy dear in danger to be slain
 so with suspect with fear and grief dismayed
 attended she her darling's loss or gain
 and ever when the pagan lift his blade
 the stroke a wound in her weak bosom made

 lxiv
 but when she saw the end and wist withal
 their strong contention should eftsoons begin
 amazement strange her courage did appal
 her vital blood was icy cold within
 sometimes she sighed sometimes tears let fall
 to witness what distress her heart was in
 hopeless dismayed pale sad astonished
 her love her fear her fear her torment bred

 lxv
 her idle brain unto her soul presented
 death in an hundred ugly fashions painted
 and if she slept then was her grief augmented
 with such sad visions were her thoughts acquainted
 she saw her lord with wounds and hurts tormented
 how he complained called for her help and fainted
 and found awaked from that unquiet sleeping
 her heart with panting sore eyes red with weeping

 lxvi
 yet these presages of his coming ill
 not greatest cause of her discomfort were
 she saw his blood from his deep wounds distil
 nor what he suffered could she bide or bear
 besides report her longing ear did fill
 doubling his danger doubling so her fear
 that she concludes so was her courage lost
 her wounded lord was weak faint dead almost

 lxvii
 and for her mother had her taught before
 the secret virtue of each herb that springs
 besides fit charms for every wound or sore
 corruption breedeth or misfortune brings
 an art esteemed in those times of yore
 beseeming daughters of great lords and kings
 she would herself be surgeon to her knight
 and heal him with her skill or with her sight

 lxviii
 thus would she cure her love and cure her foe
 she must that had her friends and kinsfolk slain
 some cursed weeds her cunning hand did know
 that could augment his harm increase his pain
 but she abhorred to be revenged so
 no treason should her spotless person stain
 and virtueless she wished all herbs and charms
 wherewith false men increase their patients' harms

 lxix
 nor feared she among the bands to stray
 of armed men for often had she seen
 the tragic end of many a bloody fray
 her life had full of haps and hazards been
 this made her bold in every hard assay
 more than her feeble sex became i ween
 she feared not the shake of every reed
 so cowards are courageous made through need

 lxx
 love fearless hardy and audacious love
 emboldened had this tender damsel so
 that where wild beasts and serpents glide and move
 through afric's deserts durst she ride or go
 save that her honor she esteemed above
 her life and body's safety told her no
 for in the secret of her troubled thought
 a doubtful combat love and honor fought

 lxxi
 "o spotless virgin" honor thus begun
 "that my true lore observed firmly hast
 when with thy foes thou didst in bondage won
 remember then i kept thee pure and chaste
 at liberty now where wouldest thou run
 to lay that field of princely virtue waste
 or lose that jewel ladies hold so dear
 is maidenhood so great a load to bear

 lxxii
 "or deem'st thou it a praise of little prize
 the glorious title of a virgin's name
 that thou will gad by night in giglot wise
 amid thine armed foes to seek thy shame
 o fool a woman conquers when she flies
 refusal kindleth proffers quench the flame
 thy lord will judge thou sinnest beyond measure
 if vainly thus thou waste so rich a treasure"

 lxxiii
 the sly deceiver cupid thus beguiled
 the simple damsel with his filed tongue
 "thou wert not born" quoth he "in desert wild
 the cruel bears and savage beasts among
 that you shouldest scorn fair citherea's child
 or hate those pleasures that to youth belong
 nor did the gods thy heart of iron frame
 to be in love is neither sin nor shame

 lxxiv
 "go then go whither sweet desire inviteth
 how can thy gentle knight so cruel be
 love in his heart thy grief and sorrows writeth
 for thy laments how he complaineth see
 oh cruel woman whom no care exciteth
 to save his life that saved and honored thee
 he languished one foot thou wilt not move
 to succor him yet say'st thou art in love

 lxxv
 "no no stay here argantes' wounds to cure
 and make him strong to shed thy darling's blood
 of such reward he may himself assure
 that doth a thankless woman so much good
 ah may it be thy patience can endure
 to see the strength of this circassian wood
 and not with horror and amazement shrink
 when on their future fight thou hap'st to think

 lxxvi
 "besides the thanks and praises for the deed
 suppose what joy what comfort shalt thou win
 when thy soft hand doth wholesome plaisters speed
 upon the breaches in his ivory skin
 thence to thy dearest lord may health succeed
 strength to his limbs blood to his cheeks so thin
 and his rare beauties now half dead and more
 thou may'st to him him to thyself restore

 lxxvii
 "so shall some part of his adventures bold
 and valiant acts henceforth be held as thine
 his dear embracements shall thee straight enfold
 together joined in marriage rites divine
 lastly high place of honor shalt thou hold
 among the matrons sage and dames latine
 in italy a land as each one tells
 where valor true and true religion dwells"

 lxxviii
 with such vain hopes the silly maid abused
 promised herself mountains and hills of gold
 yet were her thoughts with doubts and fears confused
 how to escape unseen out of that hold
 because the watchman every minute used
 to guard the walls against the christians bold
 and in such fury and such heat of war
 the gates or seld or never opened are

 lxxix
 with strong clorinda was erminia sweet
 in surest links of dearest friendship bound
 with her she used the rising sun to greet
 and her when phoebus glided under ground
 she made the lovely partner of her sheet
 in both their hearts one will one thought was found
 nor aught she hid from that virago bold
 except her love that tale to none she told

 lxxx
 that kept she secret if clorinda heard
 her make complaints or secretly lament
 to other cause her sorrow she referred
 matter enough she had of discontent
 like as the bird that having close imbarred
 her tender young ones in the springing bent
 to draw the searcher further from her nest
 cries and complains most where she needeth least

 lxxxi
 alone within her chamber's secret part
 sitting one day upon her heavy thought
 devising by what means what sleight what art
 her close departure should be safest wrought
 assembled in her unresolved heart
 an hundred passions strove and ceaseless fought
 at last she saw high hanging on the wall
 clorinda's silver arms and sighed withal

 lxxxii
 and sighing softly to herself she said
 "how blessed is this virgin in her might
 how i envy the glory of the maid
 yet envy not her shape or beauty's light
 her steps are not with trailing garments stayed
 nor chambers hide her valor shining bright
 but armed she rides and breaketh sword and spear
 nor is her strength restrained by shame or fear

 lxxxiii
 "alas why did not heaven these members frail
 with lively force and vigor strengthen so
 that i this silken gown and slender veil
 might for a breastplate and an helm forego
 then should not heat nor cold nor rain nor hail
 nor storms that fall nor blustering winds that blow
 withhold me but i would both day and night
 in pitched field or private combat fight

 lxxxiv
 "nor haddest thou argantes first begun
 with my dear lord that fierce and cruel fight
 but i to that encounter would have run
 and haply ta'en him captive by my might
 yet should he find our furious combat done
 his thraldom easy and his bondage light
 for fetters mine embracements should he prove
 for diet kisses sweet for keeper love

 lxxxv
 "or else my tender bosom opened wide
 and heart though pierced with his cruel blade
 the bloody weapon in my wounded side
 might cure the wound which love before had made
 then should my soul in rest and quiet slide
 down to the valleys of the elysian shade
 and my mishap the knight perchance would move
 to shed some tears upon his murdered love

 lxxxvi
 "alas impossible are all these things
 such wishes vain afflict my woful sprite
 why yield i thus to plaints and sorrowings
 as if all hope and help were perished quite
 my heart dares much it soars with cupid's wings
 why use i not for once these armors bright
 i may sustain awhile this shield aloft
 though i be tender feeble weak and soft

 lxxxvii
 "love strong bold mighty nevertired love
 supplieth force to all his servants true
 the fearful stags he doth to battle move
 till each his horns in others' blood imbrue
 yet mean not i the haps of war to prove
 a stratagem i have devised new
 clorindalike in this fair harness dight
 i will escape out of the town this night

 lxxxviii
 "i know the men that have the gate to ward
 if she command dare not her will deny
 in what sort else could i beguile the guard
 this way is only left this will i try
 o gentle love in this adventure hard
 thine handmaid guide assist and fortify
 the time the hour now fitteth best the thing
 while stout clorinda talketh with the king"

 lxxxix
 resolved thus without delay she went
 as her strong passion did her rashly guide
 and those bright arms down from the rafter hent
 within her closet did she closely hide
 that might she do unseen for she had sent
 the rest on sleeveless errands from her side
 and night her stealths brought to their wished end
 night patroness of thieves and lovers' friend

 xc
 some sparkling fires on heaven's bright visage shone
 his azure robe the orient blueness lost
 when she whose wit and reason both were gone
 called for a squire she loved and trusted most
 to whom and to a maid a faithful one
 part of her will she told how that in post
 she would depart from juda's king and feigned
 that other cause her sudden flight constrained

 xci
 the trusty squire provided needments meet
 as for their journey fitting most should be
 meanwhile her vesture pendant to her feet
 erminia doft as erst determined she
 stripped to her petticoat the virgin sweet
 so slender was that wonder was to see
 her handmaid ready at her mistress' will
 to arm her helped though simple were her skill

 xcii
 the rugged steel oppressed and offended
 her dainty neck and locks of shining gold
 her tender arm so feeble was it bended
 when that huge target it presumed to hold
 the burnished steel bright rays far off extended
 she feigned courage and appeared bold
 fast by her side unseen smiled venus' son
 as erst he laughed when alcides spun

 xciii
 oh with what labor did her shoulders bear
 that heavy burthen and how slow she went
 her maid to see that all the coasts were clear
 before her mistress through the streets was sent
 love gave her courage love exiled fear
 love to her tired limbs new vigor lent
 till she approached where the squire abode
 there took they horse forthwith and forward rode

 xciv
 disguised they went and by unused ways
 and secret paths they strove unseen to gone
 until the watch they meet which sore affrays
 their soldiers new when swords and weapons shone
 yet none to stop their journey once essays
 but place and passage yielded every one
 for that bright armor and that helmet bright
 were known and feared in the darkest night

 xcv
 erminia though some deal she were dismayed
 yet went she on and goodly countenance bore
 she doubted lest her purpose were bewrayed
 her too much boldness she repented sore
 but now the gate her fear and passage stayed
 the heedless porter she beguiled therefore
 "i am clorinda ope the gate" she cried
 "where as the king commands this late i ride"

 xcvi
 her woman's voice and terms all framed been
 most like the speeches of the princess stout
 who would have thought on horseback to have seen
 that feeble damsel armed round about
 the porter her obeyed and she between
 her trusty squire and maiden sallied out
 and through the secret dales they silent pass
 where danger least least fear least peril was

 xcvii
 but when these fair adventurers entered were
 deep in a vale erminia stayed her haste
 to be recalled she had no cause to fear
 this foremost hazard had she trimly past
 but dangers new tofore unseen appear
 new perils she descried new doubts she cast
 the way that her desire to quiet brought
 more difficult now seemed than erst she thought

 xcviii
 armed to ride among her angry foes
 she now perceived it were great oversight
 yet would she not she thought herself disclose
 until she came before her chosen knight
 to him she purposed to present the rose
 pure spotless clean untouched of mortal wight
 she stayed therefore and in her thoughts more wise
 she called her squire whom thus she gan advise

 xcix
 "thou must" quoth she "be mine ambassador
 be wise be careful true and diligent
 go to the camp present thyself before
 the prince tancredi wounded in his tent
 tell him thy mistress comes to cure his sore
 if he to grant her peace and rest consent
 gainst whom fierce love such cruel war hath raised
 so shall his wounds be cured her torments eased

 c
 "and say in him such hope and trust she hath
 that in his powers she fears no shame nor scorn
 tell him thus much and whatso'er he saith
 unfold no more but make a quick return
 i for this place is free from harm and scath
 within this valley will meanwhile sojourn"
 thus spake the princess and her servant true
 to execute the charge imposed flew

 ci
 and was received he so discreetly wrought
 first of the watch that guarded in their place
 before the wounded prince then was he brought
 who heard his message kind with gentle grace
 which told he left him tossing in his thought
 a thousand doubts and turned his speedy pace
 to bring his lady and his mistress word
 she might be welcome to that courteous lord

 cii
 but she impatient to whose desire
 grievous and harmful seemed each little stay
 recounts his steps and thinks now draws he nigher
 now enters in now speaks now comes his way
 and that which grieved her most the careful squire
 less speedy seemed than e'er before that day
 lastly she forward rode with love to guide
 until the christian tents at hand she spied

 ciii
 invested in her starry veil the night
 in her kind arms embraced all this round
 the silver moon from sea uprising bright
 spread frosty pearl upon the candid ground
 and cynthialike for beauty's glorious light
 the lovesick nymph threw glittering beams around
 and counsellors of her old love she made
 those valleys dumb that silence and that shade

 civ
 beholding then the camp quoth she "o fair
 and castlelike pavilions richly wrought
 from you how sweet methinketh blows the air
 how comforts it my heart my soul my thought
 through heaven's fair face from gulf of sad despair
 my tossed bark to port wellnigh is brought
 in you i seek redress for all my harms
 rest midst your weapons peace amongst your arms

 cv
 "receive me then and let me mercy find
 as gentle love assureth me i shall
 among you had i entertainment kind
 when first i was the prince tancredi's thrall
 i covet not led by ambition blind
 you should me in my father's throne install
 might i but serve in you my lord so dear
 that my content my joy my comfort were"

 cvi
 thus parleyed she poor soul and never feared
 the sudden blow of fortune's cruel spite
 she stood where phoebe's splendent beam appeared
 upon her silver armor double bright
 the place about her round she shining cleared
 with that pure white wherein the nymph was dight
 the tigress great that on her helmet laid
 bore witness where she went and where she stayed

 cvii
 so as her fortune would a christian band
 their secret ambush there had closely framed
 led by two brothers of italia land
 young poliphern and alicandro named
 these with their forces watched to withstand
 those that brought victuals to their foes untamed
 and kept that passage them erminia spied
 and fled as fast as her swift steed could ride

 cviii
 but poliphern before whose watery eyes
 his aged father strong clorinda slew
 when that bright shield and silver helm he spies
 the championess he thought he saw and knew
 upon his hidden mates for aid he cries
 gainst his supposed foe and forth he flew
 as he was rash and heedless in his wrath
 bending his lance "thou art but dead" he saith

 cix
 as when a chased hind her course doth bend
 to seek by soil to find some ease or goad
 whether from craggy rock the spring descend
 or softly glide within the shady wood
 if there the dogs she meet where late she wend
 to comfort her weak limbs in cooling flood
 again she flies swift as she fled at first
 forgetting weakness weariness and thirst

 cx
 so she that thought to rest her weary sprite
 and quench the endless thirst of ardent love
 with dear embracements of her lord and knight
 but such as marriage rites should first approve
 when she beheld her foe with weapon bright
 threatening her death his trusty courser move
 her love her lord herself abandoned
 she spurred her speedy steed and swift she fled

 cxi
 erminia fled scantly the tender grass
 her pegasus with his light footsteps bent
 her maiden's beast for speed did likewise pass
 yet divers ways such was their fear they went
 the squire who all too late returned alas
 with tardy news from prince tancredi's tent
 fled likewise when he saw his mistress gone
 it booted not to sojourn there alone

 cxii
 but alicandro wiser than the rest
 who this supposed clorinda saw likewise
 to follow her yet was he nothing pressed
 but in his ambush still and close he lies
 a messenger to godfrey he addressed
 that should him of this accident advise
 how that his brother chased with naked blade
 clorinda's self or else clorinda's shade

 cxiii
 yet that it was or that it could be she
 he had small cause or reason to suppose
 occasion great and weighty must it be
 should make her ride by night among her foes
 what godfrey willed that observed he
 and with his soldiers lay in ambush close
 these news through all the christian army went
 in every cabin talked in every tent

 cxiv
 tancred whose thoughts the squire had filled with doubt
 by his sweet words supposed now hearing this
 alas the virgin came to seek me out
 and for my sake her life in danger is
 himself forthwith he singled from the rout
 and rode in haste though half his arms he miss
 among those sandy fields and valleys green
 to seek his love he galloped fast unseen



 seventh book

 the argument
 a shepherd fair erminia entertains
 whom whilst tancredi seeks in vain to find
 he is entrapped in armida's trains
 raymond with strong argantes is assigned
 to fight an angel to his aid he gains
 satan that sees the pagan's fury blind
 and hasty wrath turn to his loss and harm
 doth raise new tempest uproar and alarm


 i
 erminia's steed this while his mistress bore
 through forests thick among the shady treen
 her feeble hand the bridle reins forlore
 half in a swoon she was for fear i ween
 but her fleet courser spared ne'er the more
 to bear her through the desert woods unseen
 of her strong foes that chased her through the plain
 and still pursued but still pursued in vain

 ii
 like as the weary hounds at last retire
 windless displeased from the fruitless chase
 when the sly beast tapished in bush and brier
 no art nor pains can rouse out of his place
 the christian knights so full of shame and ire
 returned back with faint and weary pace
 yet still the fearful dame fled swift as wind
 nor ever stayed nor ever looked behind

 iii
 through thick and thin all night all day she drived
 withouten comfort company or guide
 her plaints and tears with every thought revived
 she heard and saw her griefs but naught beside
 but when the sun his burning chariot dived
 in thetis' wave and weary team untied
 on jordan's sandy banks her course she stayed
 at last there down she light and down she laid

 iv
 her tears her drink her food her sorrowings
 this was her diet that unhappy night
 but sleep that sweet repose and quiet brings
 to ease the griefs of discontented wight
 spread forth his tender soft and nimble wings
 in his dull arms folding the virgin bright
 and love his mother and the graces kept
 strong watch and ward while this fair lady slept

 v
 the birds awaked her with their morning song
 their warbling music pierced her tender ear
 the murmuring brooks and whistling winds among
 the rattling boughs and leaves their parts did bear
 her eyes unclosed beheld the groves along
 of swains and shepherd grooms that dwellings were
 and that sweet noise birds winds and waters sent
 provoked again the virgin to lament

 vi
 her plaints were interrupted with a sound
 that seemed from thickest bushes to proceed
 some jolly shepherd sung a lusty round
 and to his voice he tuned his oaten reed
 thither she went an old man there she found
 at whose right hand his little flock did feed
 sat making baskets his three sons among
 that learned their father's art and learned his song

 vii
 beholding one in shining arms appear
 the seely man and his were sore dismay'd
 but sweet erminia comforted their fear
 her vental up her visage open laid
 you happy folk of heav'n beloved dear
 work on quoth she upon your harmless trade
 these dreadful arms i bear no warfare bring
 to your sweet toil nor those sweet tunes you sing

 viii
 "but father since this land these towns and towers
 destroyed are with sword with fire and spoil
 how may it be unhurt that you and yours
 in safety thus apply your harmless toil"
 "my son" quoth he "this poor estate of ours
 is ever safe from storm of warlike broil
 this wilderness doth us in safety keep
 no thundering drum no trumpet breaks our sleep

 ix
 "haply just heaven's defence and shield of right
 doth love the innocence of simple swains
 the thunderbolts on highest mountains light
 and seld or never strike the lower plains
 so kings have cause to fear bellona's might
 not they whose sweat and toil their dinner gains
 nor ever greedy soldier was enticed
 by poverty neglected and despised

 x
 "o poverty chief of the heavenly brood
 dearer to me than wealth or kingly crown
 no wish for honor thirst of others' good
 can move my heart contented with mine own
 we quench our thirst with water of this flood
 nor fear we poison should therein be thrown
 these little flocks of sheep and tender goats
 give milk for food and wool to make us coats

 xi
 "we little wish we need but little wealth
 from cold and hunger us to clothe and feed
 these are my sons their care preserves from stealth
 their father's flocks nor servants more i need
 amid these groves i walk oft for my health
 and to the fishes birds and beasts give heed
 how they are fed in forest spring and lake
 and their contentment for example take

 xii
 "time was for each one hath his doating time
 these silver locks were golden tresses then
 that country life i hated as a crime
 and from the forest's sweet contentment ran
 and there became the mighty caliph's man
 and though i but a simple gardener were
 yet could i mark abuses see and hear

 xiii
 "enticed on with hope of future gain
 i suffered long what did my soul displease
 but when my youth was spent my hope was vain
 i felt my native strength at last decrease
 i gan my loss of lusty years complain
 and wished i had enjoyed the country's peace
 i bade the court farewell and with content
 my latter age here have i quiet spent"

 xiv
 while thus he spake erminia hushed and still
 his wise discourses heard with great attention
 his speeches grave those idle fancies kill
 which in her troubled soul bred such dissension
 after much thought reformed was her will
 within those woods to dwell was her intention
 till fortune should occasion new afford
 to turn her home to her desired lord

 xv
 she said therefore "o shepherd fortunate
 that troubles some didst whilom feel and prove
 yet livest now in this contented state
 let my mishap thy thoughts to pity move
 to entertain me as a willing mate
 in shepherd's life which i admire and love
 within these pleasant groves perchance my heart
 of her discomforts may unload some part

 xvi
 "if gold or wealth of most esteemed dear
 if jewels rich thou diddest hold in prize
 such store thereof such plenty have i here
 as to a greedy mind might well suffice"
 with that down trickled many a silver tear
 two crystal streams fell from her watery eyes
 part of her sad misfortunes then she told
 and wept and with her wept that shepherd old

 xvii
 with speeches kind he gan the virgin dear
 toward his cottage gently home to guide
 his aged wife there made her homely cheer
 yet welcomed her and placed her by her side
 the princess donned a poor pastoral's gear
 a kerchief coarse upon her head she tied
 but yet her gestures and her looks i guess
 were such as ill beseemed a shepherdess

 xviii
 not those rude garments could obscure and hide
 the heavenly beauty of her angel's face
 nor was her princely offspring damnified
 or aught disparaged by those labors base
 her little flocks to pasture would she guide
 and milk her goats and in their folds them place
 both cheese and butter could she make and frame
 herself to please the shepherd and his dame

 xix
 but oft when underneath the greenwood shade
 her flocks lay hid from phoebus' scorching rays
 unto her knight she songs and sonnets made
 and them engraved in bark of beech and bays
 she told how cupid did her first invade
 how conquered her and ends with tancred's praise
 and when her passion's writ she over read
 again she mourned again salt tears she shed

 xx
 "you happy trees forever keep" quoth she
 "this woful story in your tender rind
 another day under your shade maybe
 will come to rest again some lover kind
 who if these trophies of my griefs he see
 shall feel dear pity pierce his gentle mind"
 with that she sighed and said "too late i prove
 there is no troth in fortune trust in love

 xxi
 "yet may it be if gracious heavens attend
 the earnest suit of a distressed wight
 at my entreat they will vouchsafe to send
 to these huge deserts that unthankful knight
 that when to earth the man his eyes shall bend
 and sees my grave my tomb and ashes light
 my woful death his stubborn heart may move
 with tears and sorrows to reward my love

 xxii
 "so though my life hath most unhappy been
 at least yet shall my spirit dead be blest
 my ashes cold shall buried on this green
 enjoy that good this body ne'er possessed"
 thus she complained to the senseless treen
 floods in her eyes and fires were in her breast
 but he for whom these streams of tears she shed
 wandered far off alas as chance him led

 xxiii
 he followed on the footsteps he had traced
 till in high woods and forests old he came
 where bushes thorns and trees so thick were placed
 and so obscure the shadows of the same
 that soon he lost the tract wherein he paced
 yet went he on which way he could not aim
 but still attentive was his longing ear
 if noise of horse or noise of arms he hear

 xxiv
 if with the breathing of the gentle wind
 an aspen leaf but shaked on the tree
 if bird or beast stirred in the bushes blind
 thither he spurred thither he rode to see
 out of the wood by cynthia's favor kind
 at last with travel great and pains got he
 and following on a little path he heard
 a rumbling sound and hasted thitherward

 xxv
 it was a fountain from the living stone
 that poured down clear streams in noble store
 whose conduit pipes united all in one
 throughout a rocky channel ghastly roar
 here tancred stayed and called yet answered none
 save babbling echo from the crooked shore
 and there the weary knight at last espies
 the springing daylight red and white arise

 xxvi
 he sighed sore and guiltless heaven gan blame
 that wished success to his desire denied
 and sharp revenge protested for the same
 if aught but good his mistress fair betide
 then wished he to return the way he came
 although he wist not by what path to ride
 and time drew near when he again must fight
 with proud argantes that vainglorious knight

 xxvii
 his stalwart steed the champion stout bestrode
 and pricked fast to find the way he lost
 but through a valley as he musing rode
 he saw a man that seemed for haste a post
 his horn was hung between his shoulders broad
 as is the guise with us tancredi crossed
 his way and gently prayed the man to say
 to godfrey's camp how he should find the way

 xxviii
 "sir" in the italian language answered he
 "i ride where noble boemond hath me sent"
 the prince thought this his uncle's man should be
 and after him his course with speed he bent
 a fortress stately built at last they see
 bout which a muddy stinking lake there went
 there they arrived when titan went to rest
 his weary limbs in night's untroubled nest

 xxix
 the courier gave the fort a warning blast
 the drawbridge was let down by them within
 "if thou a christian be" quoth he "thou mayest
 till phoebus shine again here take thine inn
 the county of cosenza three days past
 this castle from the turks did nobly win"
 the prince beheld the piece which site and art
 impregnable had made on every part

 xxx
 he feared within a pile so fortified
 some secret treason or enchantment lay
 but had he known even there he should have died
 yet should his looks no sign of fear betray
 for wheresoever will or chance him guide
 his strong victorious hand still made him way
 yet for the combat he must shortly make
 no new adventures list he undertake

 xxxi
 before the castle in a meadow plain
 beside the bridge's end he stayed and stood
 nor was entreated by the speeches vain
 of his false guide to pass beyond the flood
 upon the bridge appeared a warlike swain
 from top to toe all clad in armor good
 who brandishing a broad and cutting sword
 thus threatened death with many an idle word

 xxxii
 "o thou whom chance or will brings to the soil
 where fair armida doth the sceptre guide
 thou canst not fly of arms thyself despoil
 and let thy hands with iron chains be tied
 enter and rest thee from thy weary toil
 within this dungeon shalt thou safe abide
 and never hope again to see the day
 or that thy hair for age shall turn to gray

 xxxiii
 "except thou swear her valiant knights to aid
 against those traitors of the christian crew"
 tancred at this discourse a little stayed
 his arms his gesture and his voice he knew
 it was rambaldo who for that false maid
 forsook his country and religion true
 and of that fort defender chief became
 and those vile customs stablished in the same

 xxxiv
 the warrior answered blushing red for shame
 "cursed apostate and ungracious wight
 i am that tancred who defend the name
 of christ and have been aye his faithful knight
 his rebel foes can i subdue and tame
 as thou shalt find before we end this fight
 and thy false heart cleft with this vengeful sword
 shall feel the ire of thy forsaken lord"

 xxxv
 when that great name rambaldo's ears did fill
 he shook for fear and looked pale for dread
 yet proudly said "tancred thy hap was ill
 to wander hither where thou art but dead
 where naught can help thy courage strength and skill
 to godfrey will i send thy cursed head
 that he may see how for armida's sake
 of him and of his christ a scorn i make"

 xxxvi
 this said the day to sable night was turned
 that scant one could another's arms descry
 but soon an hundred lamps and torches burned
 that cleared all the earth and all the sky
 the castle seemed a stage with lights adorned
 on which men play some pompous tragedy
 within a terrace sat on high the queen
 and heard and saw and kept herself unseen

 xxxvii
 the noble baron whet his courage hot
 and busked him boldly to the dreadful fight
 upon his horse long while he tarried not
 because on foot he saw the pagan knight
 who underneath his trusty shield was got
 his sword was drawn closed was his helmet bright
 gainst whom the prince marched on a stately pace
 wrath in his voice rage in his eyes and face

 xxxviii
 his foe his furious charge not well abiding
 traversed his ground and stated here and there
 but he though faint and weary both with riding
 yet followed fast and still oppressed him near
 and on what side he felt rambaldo sliding
 on that his forces most employed were
 now at his helm not at his hauberk bright
 he thundered blows now at his face and sight

 xxxix
 against those members battery chief he maketh
 wherein man's life keeps chiefest residence
 at his proud threats the gascoign warrior quaketh
 and uncouth fear appalled every sense
 to nimble shifts the knight himself betaketh
 and skippeth here and there for his defence
 now with his rage now with his trusty blade
 against his blows he good resistance made

 xl
 yet no such quickness for defence he used
 as did the prince to work him harm and scathe
 his shield was cleft in twain his helmet bruised
 and in his blood his other arms did bathe
 on him he heaped blows with thrusts confused
 and more or less each stroke annoyed him hath
 he feared and in his troubled bosom strove
 remorse of conscience shame disdain and love

 xli
 at last so careless foul despair him made
 he meant to prove his fortune ill or good
 his shield cast down he took his helpless blade
 in both his hands which yet had drawn no blood
 and with such force upon the prince he laid
 that neither plate nor mail the blow withstood
 the wicked steel seized deep in his right side
 and with his streaming blood his bases dyed

 xlii
 another stroke he lent him on the brow
 so great that loudly rung the sounding steel
 yet pierced he not the helmet with the blow
 although the owner twice or thrice did reel
 the prince whose looks disdainful anger show
 now meant to use his puissance every deal
 he shaked his head and crashed his teeth for ire
 his lips breathed wrath eyes sparkled shining fire

 xliii
 the pagan wretch no longer could sustain
 the dreadful terror of his fierce aspect
 against the threatened blow he saw right plain
 no tempered armor could his life protect
 he leapt aside the stroke fell down in vain
 against a pillar near a bridge erect
 thence flaming fire and thousand sparks outstart
 and kill with fear the coward pagan's heart

 xliv
 toward the bridge the fearful paynim fled
 and in swift flight his hope of life reposed
 himself fast after lord tancredi sped
 and now in equal pace almost they closed
 when all the burning lamps extinguished
 the shining fort his goodly splendor losed
 and all those stars on heaven's blue face that shone
 with cynthia's self dispeared were and gone

 xlv
 amid those witchcrafts and that ugly shade
 no further could the prince pursue the chase
 nothing he saw yet forward still he made
 with doubtful steps and ill assured pace
 at last his foot upon a threshold trad
 and ere he wist he entered had the place
 with ghastly noise the doorleaves shut behind
 and closed him fast in prison dark and blind

 xlvi
 as in our seas in the commachian bay
 a silly fish with streams enclosed striveth
 to shun the fury and avoid the sway
 wherewith the current in that whirlpool driveth
 yet seeketh all in vain but finds no way
 out of that watery prison where she diveth
 for with such force there be the tides in brought
 there entereth all that will thence issueth naught

 xlvii
 this prison so entrapped that valiant knight
 of which the gate was framed by subtle train
 to close without the help of human wight
 so sure none could undo the leaves again
 against the doors he bended all his might
 but all his forces were employed in vain
 at last a voice gan to him loudly call
 "yield thee" quoth it "thou art armida's thrall"

 xlviii
 "within this dungeon buried shalt thou spend
 the res'due of thy woful days and years"
 the champion list not more with words contend
 but in his heart kept close his griefs and fears
 he blamed love chance gan he reprehend
 and gainst enchantment huge complaints he rears
 "it were small loss" softly he thus begun
 "to lose the brightness of the shining sun

 xlix
 "but i alas the golden beam forego
 of my far brighter sun nor can i say
 if these poor eyes shall e'er be blessed so
 as once again to view that shining ray"
 then thought he on his proud circassian foe
 and said "ah how shall i perform that fray
 he and the world with him will tancred blame
 this is my grief my fault mine endless shame"

 l
 while those high spirits of this champion good
 with love and honor's care are thus oppressed
 while he torments himself argantes wood
 waxed weary of his bed and of his rest
 such hate of peace and such desire of blood
 such thirst of glory boiled in his breast
 that though he scant could stir or stand upright
 yet longed he for the appointed day to fight

 li
 the night which that expected day forewent
 scantly the pagan closed his eyes to sleep
 he told how night her sliding hours spent
 and rose ere springing day began to peep
 he called for armor which incontinent
 was brought by him that used the same to keep
 that harness rich old aladine him gave
 a worthy present for a champion brave

 lii
 he donned them on not long their riches eyed
 nor did he aught with so great weight incline
 his wonted sword upon his thigh he tied
 the blade was old and tough of temper fine
 as when a comet far and wide descried
 in scorn of phoebus midst bright heaven doth shine
 and tidings sad of death and mischief brings
 to mighty lords to monarchs and to kings

 liii
 so shone the pagan in bright armor clad
 and rolled his eyes great swollen with ire and blood
 his dreadful gestures threatened horror sad
 and ugly death upon his forehead stood
 not one of all his squires the courage had
 to approach their master in his angry mood
 above his head he shook his naked blade
 and gainst the subtle air vain battle made

 liv
 "the christian thief" quoth he "that was so bold
 to combat me in hard and single fight
 shall wounded fall inglorious on the mould
 his locks with clods of blood and dust bedight
 and living shall with watery eyes behold
 how from his back i tear his harness bright
 nor shall his dying words me so entreat
 but that i'll give his flesh to dogs for meat"

 lv
 like as a bull when pricked with jealousy
 he spies the rival of his hot desire
 through all the fields doth bellow roar and cry
 and with his thundering voice augments his ire
 and threatening battle to the empty sky
 tears with his horn each tree plant bush and brier
 and with his foot casts up the sand on height
 defying his strong foe to deadly fight

 lvi
 such was the pagan's fury such his cry
 a herald called he then and thus he spake
 "go to the camp and in my name defy
 the man that combats for his jesus' sake"
 this said upon his steed he mounted high
 and with him did his noble prisoner take
 the town he thus forsook and on the green
 he ran as mad or frantic he had been

 lvii
 a bugle small he winded loud and shrill
 that made resound the fields and valleys near
 louder than thunder from olympus hill
 seemed that dreadful blast to all that hear
 the christian lords of prowess strength and skill
 within the imperial tent assembled were
 the herald there in boasting terms defied
 tancredi first and all that durst beside

 lviii
 with sober chear godfredo look'd about
 and viewed at leisure every lord and knight
 but yet for all his looks not one stepped out
 with courage bold to undertake the fight
 absent were all the christian champions stout
 no news of tancred since his secret flight
 boemond far off and banished from the crew
 was that strong prince who proud gernando slew

 lix
 and eke those ten which chosen were by lot
 and all the worthies of the camp beside
 after armida false were followed hot
 when night were come their secret flight to hide
 the rest their hands and hearts that trusted not
 blushed for shame yet silent still abide
 for none there was that sought to purchase fame
 in so great peril fear exiled shame

 lx
 the angry duke their fear discovered plain
 by their pale looks and silence from each part
 and as he moved was with just disdain
 these words he said and from his seat upstart
 "unworthy life i judge that coward swain
 to hazard it even now that wants the heart
 when this vile pagan with his glorious boast
 dishonors and defies christ's sacred host

 lxi
 "but let my camp sit still in peace and rest
 and my life's hazard at their ease behold
 come bring me here my fairest arms and best"
 and they were brought sooner than could be told
 but gentle raymond in his aged breast
 who had mature advice and counsel old
 than whom in all the camp were none or few
 of greater might before godfredo drew

 lxii
 and gravely said "ah let it not betide
 on one man's hand to venture all this host
 no private soldier thou thou art our guide
 if thou miscarry all our hope were lost
 by thee must babel fall and all her pride
 of our true faith thou art the prop and post
 rule with thy sceptre conquer with thy word
 let others combat make with spear and sword

 lxiii
 "let me this pagan's glorious pride assuage
 these aged arms can yet their weapons use
 let others shun bellona's dreadful rage
 these silver locks shall not raymondo scuse
 oh that i were in prime of lusty age
 like you that this adventure brave refuse
 and dare not once lift up your coward eyes
 gainst him that you and christ himself defies

 lxiv
 "or as i was when all the lords of fame
 and germain princes great stood by to view
 in conrad's court the second of that name
 when leopold in single fight i slew
 a greater praise i reaped by the same
 so strong a foe in combat to subdue
 than he should do who all alone should chase
 or kill a thousand of these pagans base

 lxv
 "within these arms had i that strength again
 this boasting paynim had not lived till now
 yet in this breast doth courage still remain
 for age or years these members shall not bow
 and if i be in this encounter slain
 scotfree argantes shall not scape i vow
 give me mine arms this battle shall with praise
 augment mine honor got in younger days"

 lxvi
 the jolly baron old thus bravely spake
 his words are spurs to virtue every knight
 that seemed before to tremble and to quake
 now talked bold example hath such might
 each one the battle fierce would undertake
 now strove they all who should begin the fight
 baldwin and roger both would combat fain
 stephen guelpho gernier and the gerrards twain

 lxvii
 and pyrrhus who with help of boemond's sword
 proud antioch by cunning sleight opprest
 the battle eke with many a lowly word
 ralph rosimond and eberard request
 a scotch an irish and an english lord
 whose lands the sea divides far from the rest
 and for the fight did likewise humbly sue
 edward and his gildippes lovers true

 lxviii
 but raymond more than all the rest doth sue
 upon that pagan fierce to wreak his ire
 now wants he naught of all his armors due
 except his helm that shone like flaming fire
 to whom godfredo thus "o mirror true
 of antique worth thy courage doth inspire
 new strength in us of mars in thee doth shine
 the art the honor and the discipline

 lxix
 "if ten like thee of valor and of age
 among these legions i could haply find
 i should the best of babel's pride assuage
 and spread our faith from thule to furthest inde
 but now i pray thee calm thy valiant rage
 reserve thyself till greater need us bind
 and let the rest each one write down his name
 and see whom fortune chooseth to this game

 lxx
 "or rather see whom god's high judgement taketh
 to whom is chance and fate and fortune slave"
 raymond his earnest suit not yet forsaketh
 his name writ with the residue would he have
 godfrey himself in his bright helmet shaketh
 the scrolls with names of all the champions brave
 they drew and read the first whereon they hit
 wherein was "raymond earl of tholouse" writ

 lxxi
 his name with joy and mighty shouts they bless
 the rest allow his choice and fortune praise
 new vigor blushed through those looks of his
 it seemed he now resumed his youthful days
 like to a snake whose slough new changed is
 that shines like gold against the sunny rays
 but godfrey most approved his fortune high
 and wished him honor conquest victory

 lxxii
 then from his side he took his noble brand
 and giving it to raymond thus he spake
 "this is the sword wherewith in saxon land
 the great rubello battle used to make
 from him i took it fighting hand to hand
 and took his life with it and many a lake
 of blood with it i have shed since that day
 with thee god grant it proves as happy may"

 lxxiii
 of these delays meanwhile impatient
 argantes threateneth loud and sternly cries
 "o glorious people of the occident
 behold him here that all your host defies
 why comes not tancred whose great hardiment
 with you is prized so dear pardie he lies
 still on his pillow and presumes the night
 again may shield him from my power and might

 lxxiv
 "why then some other come by band and band
 come all come forth on horseback come on foot
 if not one man dares combat hand to hand
 in all the thousands of so great a rout
 see where the tomb of mary's son doth stand
 march thither warriors hold what makes you doubt
 why run you not there for your sins to weep
 or to what greater need these forces keep"

 lxxv
 thus scorned by that heathen saracine
 were all the soldiers of christ's sacred name
 raymond while others at his words repine
 burst forth in rage he could not bear this shame
 for fire of courage brighter far doth shine
 if challenges and threats augment the same
 so that upon his steed he mounted light
 which aquilino for his swiftness hight

 lxxvi
 this jennet was by tagus bred for oft
 the breeder of these beasts to war assigned
 when first on trees burgeon the blossoms soft
 pricked forward with the sting of fertile kind
 against the air casts up her head aloft
 and gathereth seed so from the fruitful wind
 and thus conceiving of the gentle blast
 a wonder strange and rare she foals at last

 lxxvii
 and had you seen the beast you would have said
 the light and subtile wind his father was
 for if his course upon the sands he made
 no sign was left what way the beast did pass
 or if he menaged were or if he played
 he scantly bended down the tender grass
 thus mounted rode the earl and as he went
 thus prayed to heaven his zealous looks upbent

 lxxviii
 "o lord that diddest save keep and defend
 thy servant david from goliath's rage
 and broughtest that huge giant to his end
 slain by a faithful child of tender age
 like grace o lord like mercy now extend
 let me this vile blasphemous pride assuage
 that all the world may to thy glory know
 old men and babes thy foes can overthrow"

 lxxix
 thus prayed the county and his prayers dear
 strengthened with zeal with godliness and faith
 before the throne of that great lord appear
 in whose sweet grace is life death in his wrath
 among his armies bright and legions clear
 the lord an angel good selected hath
 to whom the charge was given to guard the knight
 and keep him safe from that fierce pagan's might

 lxxx
 the angel good appointed for the guard
 of noble raymond from his tender eild
 that kept him then and kept him afterward
 when spear and sword he able was to wield
 now when his great creator's will he heard
 that in this fight he should him chiefly shield
 up to a tower set on a rock he flies
 where all the heavenly arms and weapons lies

 lxxxi
 there stands the lance wherewith great michael slew
 the aged dragon in a bloody fight
 there are the dreadful thunders forged new
 with storms and plagues that on poor sinners light
 the massy trident mayest thou pendant view
 there on a golden pin hung up on height
 wherewith sometimes he smites this solid land
 and throws down towns and towers thereon which stand

 lxxxii
 among the blessed weapons there which stands
 upon a diamond shield his looks he bended
 so great that it might cover all the lands
 twixt caucasus and atlas hills extended
 with it the lord's dear flocks and faithful bands
 the holy kings and cities are defended
 the sacred angel took this target sheen
 and by the christian champion stood unseen

 lxxxiii
 but now the walls and turrets round about
 both young and old with many thousands fill
 the king clorinda sent and her brave rout
 to keep the field she stayed upon the hill
 godfrey likewise some christian bands sent out
 which armed and ranked in good array stood still
 and to their champions empty let remain
 twixt either troop a large and spacious plain

 lxxxiv
 argantes looked for tancredi bold
 but saw an uncouth foe at last appear
 raymond rode on and what he asked him told
 better by chance "tancred is now elsewhere
 yet glory not of that myself behold
 am come prepared and bid thee battle here
 and in his place or for myself to fight
 lo here i am who scorn thy heathenish might"

 lxxxv
 the pagan cast a scornful smile and said
 "but where is tancred is he still in bed
 his looks late seemed to make high heaven afraid
 but now for dread he is or dead or fled
 but whe'er earth's centre or the deep sea made
 his lurking hole it should not save his head"
 "thou liest" he says "to say so brave a knight
 is fled from thee who thee exceeds in might"

 lxxxvi
 the angry pagan said "i have not spilt
 my labor then if thou his place supply
 go take the field and let's see how thou wilt
 maintain thy foolish words and that brave lie"
 thus parleyed they to meet in equal tilt
 each took his aim at other's helm on high
 even in the fight his foe good raymond hit
 but shaked him not he did so firmly sit

 lxxxvii
 the fierce circassian missed of his blow
 a thing which seld befell the man before
 the angel by unseen his force did know
 and far awry the poignant weapon bore
 he burst his lance against the sand below
 and bit his lips for rage and cursed and swore
 against his foe returned he swift as wind
 half mad in arms a second match to find

 lxxxviii
 like to a ram that butts with horned head
 so spurred he forth his horse with desperate race
 raymond at his right hand let slide his steed
 and as he passed struck at the pagan's face
 he turned again the earl was nothing dread
 yet stept aside and to his rage gave place
 and on his helm with all his strength gan smite
 which was so hard his courtlax could not bite

 lxxxix
 the saracen employed his art and force
 to grip his foe within his mighty arms
 but he avoided nimbly with his horse
 he was no prentice in those fierce alarms
 about him made he many a winding course
 no strength nor sleight the subtle warrior harms
 his nimble steed obeyed his ready hand
 and where he stept no print left in the sand

 xc
 as when a captain doth besiege some hold
 set in a marsh or high up on a hill
 and trieth ways and wiles a thousandfold
 to bring the piece subjected to his will
 so fared the county with the pagan bold
 and when he did his head and breast none ill
 his weaker parts he wisely gan assail
 and entrance searched oft 'twixt mail and mail

 xci
 at last he hit him on a place or twain
 that on his arms the red blood trickled down
 and yet himself untouched did remain
 no nail was broke no plume cut from his crown
 argantes raging spent his strength in vain
 waste were his strokes his thrusts were idle thrown
 yet pressed he on and doubled still his blows
 and where he hits he neither cares nor knows

 xcii
 among a thousand blows the saracine
 at last struck one when raymond was so near
 that not the swiftness of his aquiline
 could his dear lord from that huge danger bear
 but lo at hand unseen was help divine
 which saves when worldly comforts none appear
 the angel on his targe received that stroke
 and on that shield argantes' sword was broke

 xciii
 the sword was broke therein no wonder lies
 if earthly tempered metal could not hold
 against that target forged above the skies
 down fell the blade in pieces on the mould
 the proud circassian scant believed his eyes
 though naught were left him but the hilts of gold
 and full of thoughts amazed awhile he stood
 wondering the christian's armor was so good

 xciv
 the brittle web of that rich sword he thought
 was broke through hardness of the county's shield
 and so thought raymond who discovered naught
 what succor heaven did for his safety yield
 but when he saw the man gainst whom he fought
 unweaponed still stood he in the field
 his noble heart esteemed the glory light
 at such advantage if he slew the knight

 xcv
 "go fetch" he would have said "another blade"
 when in his heart a better thought arose
 how for christ's glory he was champion made
 how godfrey had him to this combat chose
 the army's honor on his shoulder laid
 to hazards new he list not that expose
 while thus his thoughts debated on the case
 the hilts argantes hurled at his face

 xcvi
 and forward spurred his mounture fierce withal
 within his arms longing his foe to strain
 upon whose helm the heavy blow did fall
 and bent wellnigh the metal to his brain
 but he whose courage was heroical
 leapt by and makes the pagan's onset vain
 and wounds his hand which he outstretched saw
 fiercer than eagles' talon lions' paw

 xcvii
 now here now there on every side he rode
 with nimble speed and spurred now out now in
 and as he went and came still laid on load
 where lord argantes' arms were weak and thin
 all that huge force which in his arms abode
 his wrath his ire his great desire to win
 against his foe together all he bent
 and heaven and fortune furthered his intent

 xcviii
 but he whose courage for no peril fails
 well armed and better hearted scorns his power
 like a tall ship when spent are all her sails
 which still resists the rage of storm and shower
 whose mighty ribs fast bound with bands and nails
 withstand fierce neptune's wrath for many an hour
 and yields not up her bruised keel to winds
 in whose stern blast no ruth nor grace she finds

 xcix
 argantes such thy present danger was
 when satan stirred to aid thee at thy need
 in human shape he forged an airy mass
 and made the shade a body seem indeed
 well might the spirit for clorinda pass
 like her it was in armor and in weed
 in stature beauty countenance and face
 in looks in speech in gesture and in pace

 c
 and for the spirit should seem the same indeed
 from where she was whose show and shape it had
 toward the wall it rode with feigned speed
 where stood the people all dismayed and sad
 to see their knight of help have so great need
 and yet the law of arms all help forbad
 there in a turret sat a soldier stout
 to watch and at a loophole peeped out

 ci
 the spirit spake to him called oradine
 the noblest archer then that handled bow
 "o oradine" quoth she "who straight as line
 can'st shoot and hit each mark set high or low
 if yonder knight alas be slain in fine
 as likest is great ruth it were you know
 and greater shame if his victorious foe
 should with his spoils triumphant homeward go

 cii
 "now prove thy skill thine arrow's sharp head dip
 in yonder thievish frenchman's guilty blood
 i promise thee thy sovereign shall not slip
 to give thee large rewards for such a good"
 thus said the spirit the man did laugh and skip
 for hope of future gain nor longer stood
 but from his quiver huge a shaft he hent
 and set it in his mighty bow new bent

 ciii
 twanged the string out flew the quarrel long
 and through the subtle air did singing pass
 it hit the knight the buckles rich among
 wherewith his precious girdle fastened was
 it bruised them and pierced his hauberk strong
 some little blood down trickled on the grass
 light was the wound the angel by unseen
 the sharp head blunted of the weapon keen

 civ
 raymond drew forth the shaft as much behoved
 and with the steel his blood out streaming came
 with bitter words his foe he then reproved
 for breaking faith to his eternal shame
 godfrey whose careful eyes from his beloved
 were never turned saw and marked the same
 and when he viewed the wounded county bleed
 he sighed and feared more perchance than need

 cv
 and with his words and with his threatening eyes
 he stirred his captains to revenge that wrong
 forthwith the spurred courser forward hies
 within their rests put were their lances long
 from either side a squadron brave out flies
 and boldly made a fierce encounter strong
 the raised dust to overspread begun
 their shining arms and far more shining sun

 cvi
 of breaking spears of ringing helm and shield
 a dreadful rumor roared on every side
 there lay a horse another through the field
 ran masterless dismounted was his guide
 here one lay dead there did another yield
 some sighed some sobbed some prayed and some cried
 fierce was the fight and longer still it lasted
 fiercer and fewer still themselves they wasted

 cvii
 argantes nimbly leapt amid the throng
 and from a soldier wrung an iron mace
 and breaking through the ranks and ranges long
 therewith he passage made himself and place
 raymond he sought the thickest press among
 to take revenge for late received disgrace
 a greedy wolf he seemed and would assuage
 with raymond's blood his hunger and his rage

 cviii
 the way he found not easy as he would
 but fierce encounters put him oft to pain
 he met ormanno and rogero bold
 of balnavile guy and the gerrards twain
 yet nothing might his rage and haste withhold
 these worthies strove to stop him but in vain
 with these strong lets increased still his ire
 like rivers stopped or closely smouldered fire

 cix
 he slew ormanno and wounded guy and laid
 rogero low among the people slain
 on every side new troops the man invade
 yet all their blows were waste their onsets vain
 but while argantes thus his prizes played
 and seemed alone this skirmish to sustain
 the duke his brother called and thus he spake
 "go with thy troop fight for thy saviour's sake

 cx
 "there enter in where hottest is the fight
 thy force against the left wing strongly bend"
 this said so brave an onset gave the knight
 that many a paynim bold there made his end
 the turks too weak seemed to sustain his might
 and could not from his power their lives defend
 their ensigns rent and broke was their array
 and men and horse on heaps together lay

 cxi
 o'erthrown likewise away the right wing ran
 nor was there one again that turned his face
 save bold argantes else fled every man
 fear drove them thence on heaps with headlong chase
 he stayed alone and battle new began
 five hundred men weaponed with sword and mace
 so great resistance never could have made
 as did argantes with his single blade

 cxii
 the strokes of swords and thrusts of many a spear
 the shock of many a joust he long sustained
 he seemed of strength enough this charge to bear
 and time to strike now here now there he gained
 his armors broke his members bruised were
 he sweat and bled yet courage still he feigned
 but now his foes upon him pressed so fast
 that with their weight they bore him back at last

 cxiii
 his back against this storm at length he turned
 whose headlong fury bore him backward still
 not like to one that fled but one that mourned
 because he did his foes no greater ill
 his threatening eyes like flaming torches burned
 his courage thirsted yet more blood to spill
 and every way and every mean he sought
 to stay his flying mates but all for naught

 cxiv
 this good he did while thus he played his part
 his bands and troops at ease and safe retired
 yet coward dread lacks order fear wants art
 deaf to attend commanded or desired
 but godfrey that perceived in his wise heart
 how his bold knights to victory aspired
 fresh soldiers sent to make more quick pursuit
 and help to gather conquest's precious fruit

 cxv
 but this alas was not the appointed day
 set down by heaven to end this mortal war
 the western lords this time had borne away
 the prize for which they travelled had so far
 had not the devils that saw the sure decay
 of their false kingdom by this bloody war
 at once made heaven and earth with darkness blind
 and stirred up tempests storms and blustering wind

 cxvi
 heaven's glorious lamp wrapped in an ugly veil
 of shadows dark was hid from mortal eye
 and hell's grim blackness did bright skies assail
 on every side the fiery lightnings fly
 the thunders roar the streaming rain and hail
 pour down and make that sea which erst was dry
 the tempests rend the oaks and cedars brake
 and make not trees but rocks and mountains shake

 cxvii
 the rain the lightning and the raging wind
 beat in the frenchmen's eyes with hideous force
 the soldiers stayed amazed in heart and mind
 the terror such that stopped both man and horse
 surprised with this evil no way they find
 whither for succor to direct their course
 but wise clorinda soon the advantage spied
 and spurring forth thus to her soldiers cried

 cxviii
 "you hardy men at arms behold" quoth she
 "how heaven how justice in our aid doth fight
 our visages are from this tempest free
 our hands at will may wield our weapons bright
 the fury of this friendly storm you see
 upon the foreheads of our foes doth light
 and blinds their eyes then let us take the tide
 come follow me good fortune be our guide"

 cxix
 this said against her foes on rode the dame
 and turned their backs against the wind and rain
 upon the french with furious rage she came
 and scorned those idle blows they struck in vain
 argantes at the instant did the same
 and them who chased him now chased again
 naught but his fearful back each christian shows
 against the tempest and against their blows

 cxx
 the cruel hail and deadly wounding blade
 upon their shoulders smote them as they fled
 the blood new spilt while thus they slaughter made
 the water fallen from skies had dyed red
 among the murdered bodies pyrrhus laid
 and valiant raiphe his heart blood there out bled
 the first subdued by strong argantes' might
 the second conquered by that virgin knight

 cxxi
 thus fled the french and then pursued in chase
 the wicked sprites and all the syrian train
 but gainst their force and gainst their fell menace
 of hail and wind of tempest and of rain
 godfrey alone turned his audacious face
 blaming his barons for their fear so vain
 himself the camp gate boldly stood to keep
 and saved his men within his trenches deep

 cxxii
 and twice upon argantes proud he flew
 and beat him backward maugre all his might
 and twice his thirsty sword he did imbrue
 in pagan's blood where thickest was the fight
 at last himself with all his folk withdrew
 and that day's conquest gave the virgin bright
 which got she home retired and all her men
 and thus she chased this lion to his den

 cxxiii
 yet ceased not the fury and the ire
 of these huge storms of wind of rain and hail
 now was it dark now shone the lightning fire
 the wind and water every place assail
 no bank was safe no rampire left entire
 no tent could stand when beam and cordage fail
 wind thunder rain all gave a dreadful sound
 and with that music deafed the trembling ground



 eighth book

 the argument
 a messenger to godfrey sage doth tell
 the prince of denmark's valour death and end
 the italians trusting signs untrue too well
 think their rinaldo slain the wicked fiend
 breeds fury in their breasts their bosoms swell
 with ire and hate and war and strife forth send
 they threaten godfrey he prays to the lord
 and calms their fury with his look and word


 i
 now were the skies of storms and tempests cleared
 lord aeolus shut up his winds in hold
 the silvermantled morning fresh appeared
 with roses crowned and buskined high with gold
 the spirits yet which had these tempests reared
 their malice would still more and more unfold
 and one of them that astragor was named
 his speeches thus to foul alecto framed

 ii
 "alecto see we could not stop nor stay
 the knight that to our foes new tidings brings
 who from the hands escaped with life away
 of that great prince chief of all pagan kings
 he comes the fall of his slain lord to say
 of death and loss he tells and such sad things
 great news he brings and greatest dangers is
 bertoldo's son shall be called home for this

 iii
 "thou knowest what would befall bestir thee than
 prevent with craft what force could not withstand
 turn to their evil the speeches of the man
 with his own weapon wound godfredo's hand
 kindle debate infect with poison wan
 the english switzer and italian band
 great tumult move make brawls and quarrels rife
 set all the camp on uproar and at strife

 iv
 "this act beseems thee well and of the deed
 much may'st thou boast before our lord and king"
 thus said the sprite persuasion small did need
 the monster grants to undertake the thing
 meanwhile the knight whose coming thus they dread
 before the camp his weary limbs doth bring
 and wellnigh breathless "warriors bold" he cried
 "who shall conduct me to your famous guide"

 v
 an hundred strove the stranger's guide to be
 to hearken news the knights by heaps assemble
 the man fell lowly down upon his knee
 and kissed the hand that made proud babel tremble
 "right puissant lord whose valiant acts" quoth he
 "the sands and stars in number best resemble
 would god some gladder news i might unfold"
 and there he paused and sighed then thus he told

 vi
 "sweno the king of denmark's only heir
 the stay and staff of his declining eild
 longed to be among these squadrons fair
 who for christ's faith here serve with spear and shield
 no weariness no storms of sea or air
 no such contents as crowns and sceptres yield
 no dear entreaties of so kind a sire
 could in his bosom quench that glorious fire

 vii
 "he thirsted sore to learn this warlike art
 of thee great lord and master of the same
 and was ashamed in his noble heart
 that never act he did deserved fame
 besides the news and tidings from each part
 of young rinaldo's worth and praises came
 but that which most his courage stirred hath
 is zeal religion godliness and faith

 viii
 "he hasted forward then without delay
 and with him took of knights a chosen band
 directly toward thrace we took the way
 to byzance old chief fortress of that land
 there the greek monarch gently prayed him stay
 and there an herald sent from you we fand
 how antioch was won who first declared
 and how defended nobly afterward

 ix
 "defended gainst corbana valiant knight
 that all the persian armies had to guide
 and brought so many soldiers bold to fight
 that void of men he left that kingdom wide
 he told thine acts thy wisdom and thy might
 and told the deeds of many a lord beside
 his speech at length to young rinaldo passed
 and told his great achievements first and last

 x
 "and how this noble camp of yours of late
 besieged had this town and in what sort
 and how you prayed him to participate
 of the last conquest of this noble fort
 in hardy sweno opened was the gate
 of worthy anger by this brave report
 so that each hour seemed five years long
 till he were fighting with these pagans strong

 xi
 "and while the herald told your fights and frays
 himself of cowardice reproved he thought
 and him to stay that counsels him or prays
 he hears not or else heard regardeth naught
 he fears no perils but whilst he delays
 lest this last work without his help be wrought
 in this his doubt in this his danger lies
 no hazard else he fears no peril spies

 xii
 "thus hasting on he hasted on his death
 death that to him and us was fatal guide
 the rising morn appeared yet aneath
 when he and we were armed and fit to ride
 the nearest way seemed best o'er hold and heath
 we went through deserts waste and forests wide
 the streets and ways he openeth as he goes
 and sets each land free from intruding foes

 xiii
 "now want of food now dangerous ways we find
 now open war now ambush closely laid
 yet passed we forth all perils left behind
 our foes or dead or run away afraid
 of victory so happy blew the wind
 that careless all the heedless to it made
 until one day his tents he happed to rear
 to palestine when we approached near

 xiv
 "there did our scouts return and bring us news
 that dreadful noise of horse and arms they hear
 and that they deemed by sundry signs and shows
 there was some mighty host of pagans near
 at these sad tidings many changed their hues
 some looked pale for dread some shook for fear
 only our noble lord was altered naught
 in look in face in gesture or in thought

 xv
 "but said 'a crown prepare you to possess
 of martyrdom or happy victory
 for this i hope for that i wish no less
 of greater merit and of greater glory
 brethren this camp will shortly be i guess
 a temple sacred to our memory
 to which the holy men of future age
 to view our graves shall come in pilgrimage'

 xvi
 "this said he set the watch in order right
 to guard the camp along the trenches deep
 and as he armed was so every knight
 he willed on his back his arms to keep
 now had the stillness of the quiet night
 drowned all the world in silence and in sleep
 when suddenly we heard a dreadful sound
 which deafed the earth and tremble made the ground

 xvii
 "'arm arm' they cried prince sweno at the same
 glistering in shining steel leaped foremost out
 his visage shone his noble looks did flame
 with kindled brand of courage bold and stout
 when lo the pagans to assault us came
 and with huge numbers hemmed us round about
 a forest thick of spears about us grew
 and over us a cloud of arrows flew

 xviii
 "uneven the fight unequal was the fray
 our enemies were twenty men to one
 on every side the slain and wounded lay
 unseen where naught but glistering weapons shone
 the number of the dead could no man say
 so was the place with darkness overgone
 the night her mantle black upon its spreads
 hiding our losses and our valiant deeds

 xix
 "but hardy sweno midst the other train
 by his great acts was well descried i wot
 no darkness could his valor's daylight stain
 such wondrous blows on every side he smote
 a stream of blood a bank of bodies slain
 about him made a bulwark and a mote
 and when soe'er he turned his fatal brand
 dread in his looks and death sate in his hand

 xx
 "thus fought we till the morning bright appeared
 and strewed roses on the azure sky
 but when her lamp had night's thick darkness cleared
 wherein the bodies dead did buried lie
 then our sad cries to heaven for grief we reared
 our loss apparent was for we descry
 how all our camp destroyed was almost
 and all our people wellnigh slain and lost

 xxi
 "of thousands twain an hundred scant survived
 when sweno murdered saw each valiant knight
 i know not if his heart in sunder rived
 for dear compassion of that woful sight
 he showed no change but said 'since so deprived
 we are of all our friends by chance of fight
 come follow them the path to heaven their blood
 marks out now angels made of martyrs good'

 xxii
 "this said and glad i think of death at hand
 the signs of heavenly joy shone through his eyes
 of saracens against a mighty band
 with fearless heart and constant breast he flies
 no steel could shield them from his cutting brand
 but whom he hits without recure he dies
 he never struck but felled or killed his foe
 and wounded was himself from top to toe

 xxiii
 "not strength but courage now preserved on live
 this hardy champion fortress of our faith
 strucken he strikes still stronger more they strive
 the more they hurt him more he doth them scathe
 when toward him a furious knight gan drive
 of members huge fierce looks and full of wrath
 that with the aid of many a pagan crew
 after long fight at last prince sweno slew

 xxiv
 "ah heavy chance down fell the valiant youth
 nor mongst us all did one so strong appear
 as to revenge his death that this is truth
 by his dear blood and noble bones i swear
 that of my life i had not care nor ruth
 no wounds i shunned no blows i would off bear
 and had not heaven my wished end denied
 even there i should and willing should have died

 xxv
 "alive i fell among my fellows slain
 yet wounded so that each one thought me dead
 nor what our foes did since can i explain
 so sore amazed was my heart and head
 but when i opened first mine eyes again
 night's curtain black upon the earth was spread
 and through the darkness to my feeble sight
 appeared the twinkling of a slender light

 xxvi
 "not so much force or judgement in me lies
 as to discern things seen and not mistake
 i saw like them who ope and shut their eyes
 by turns now half asleep now half awake
 my body eke another torment tries
 my wounds began to smart my hurts to ache
 for every sore each member pinched was
 with night's sharp air heaven's frost and earth's cold grass

 xxvii
 "but still the light approached near and near
 and with the same a whispering murmur run
 till at my side arrived both they were
 when i to spread my feeble eyes begun
 two men behold in vestures long appear
 with each a lamp in hand who said 'o son
 in that dear lord who helps his servants trust
 who ere they ask grants all things to the just'

 xxviii
 "this said each one his sacred blessings flings
 upon my corse with broad ourstretched hand
 and mumbled hymns and psalms and holy things
 which i could neither hear nor understand
 'arise' quoth they with that as i had wings
 all whole and sound i leaped up from the land
 oh miracle sweet gentle strange and true
 my limbs new strength received and vigor new

 xxix
 "i gazed on them like one whose heart denieth
 to think that done he sees so strangely wrought
 till one said thus 'o thou of little faith
 what doubts perplex thy unbelieving thought
 each one of us a living body hath
 we are christ's chosen servants fear us naught
 who to avoid the world's allurements vain
 in wilful penance hermits poor remain

 xxx
 "'us messengers to comfort thee elect
 that lord hath sent that rules both heaven and hell
 who often doth his blessed will effect
 by such weak means as wonder is to tell
 he will not that this body lie neglect
 wherein so noble soul did lately dwell
 to which again when it uprisen is
 it shall united be in lasting bliss

 xxxi
 "'i say lord sweno's corpse for which prepared
 a tomb there is according to his worth
 by which his honor shall be far declared
 and his just praises spread from south to north"
 but lift thine eyes up to the heavens ward
 mark yonder light that like the sun shines forth
 that shall direct thee with those beams so clear
 to find the body of thy master dear'

 xxxii
 "with that i saw from cynthia's silver face
 like to a falling star a beam down slide
 that bright as golden line marked out the place
 and lightened with clear streams the forest wide
 so latmos shone when phoebe left the chase
 and laid her down by her endymion's side
 such was the light that well discern i could
 his shape his wounds his face though dead yet bold

 xxxiii
 "he lay not grovelling now but as a knight
 that ever had to heavenly things desire
 so toward heaven the prince lay bolt upright
 like him that upward still sought to aspire
 his right hand closed held his weapon bright
 ready to strike and execute his ire
 his left upon his breast was humbly laid
 that men might know that while he died he prayed

 xxxiv
 "whilst on his wounds with bootless tears i wept
 that neither helped him nor eased my care
 one of those aged fathers to him stepped
 and forced his hand that needless weapon spare
 'this sword' quoth he 'hath yet good token kept
 that of the pagans' blood he drunk his share
 and blusheth still he could not save his lord
 rich strong and sharp was never better sword

 xxxv
 "'heaven therefore will not though the prince be slain
 who used erst to wield this precious brand
 that so brave blade unused should remain
 but that it pass from strong to stronger hand
 who with like force can wield the same again
 and longer shall in grace of fortune stand
 and with the same shall bitter vengeance take
 on him that sweno slew for sweno's sake

 xxxvi
 "'great solyman killed sweno solyman
 for sweno's sake upon this sword must die
 here take the blade and with it haste thee than
 thither where godfrey doth encamped lie
 and fear not thou that any shall or can
 or stop thy way or lead thy steps awry
 for he that doth thee on this message send
 thee with his hand shall guide keep and defend

 xxxvii
 "'arrived there it is his blessed will
 with true report that thou declare and tell
 the zeal the strength the courage and the skill
 in thy beloved lord that late did dwell
 how for christ's sake he came his blood to spill
 and sample left to all of doing well
 that future ages may admire his deed
 and courage take when his brave end they read

 xxxviii
 "'it resteth now thou know that gentle knight
 that of this sword shall be thy master's heir
 it is rinaldo young with whom in might
 and martial skill no champion may compare
 give it to him and say "the heavens bright
 of this revenge to him commit the care"
 while thus i listened what this old man said
 a wonder new from further speech us stayed

 xxxix
 "for there whereas the wounded body lay
 a stately tomb with curious work behold
 and wondrous art was built out of the clay
 which rising round the carcass did enfold
 with words engraven in the marble gray
 the warrior's name his worth and praise that told
 on which i gazing stood and often read
 that epitaph of my dear master dead

 xl
 "'among his soldiers' quoth the hermit 'here
 must sweno's corpse remain in marble chest
 while up to heaven are flown their spirits dear
 to live in endless joy forever blest
 his funeral thou hast with many a tear
 accompanied it's now high time to rest
 come be my guest until the morning ray
 shall light the world again then take thy way'

 xli
 "this said he led me over holts and hags
 through thorns and bushes scant my legs i drew
 till underneath a heap of stones and crags
 at last he brought me to a secret mew
 among the bears wild boars the wolves and stags
 there dwelt he safe with his disciple true
 and feared no treason force nor hurt at all
 his guiltless conscience was his castle's wall

 xlii
 "my supper roots my bed was moss and leaves
 but weariness in little rest found ease
 but when the purple morning night bereaves
 of late usurped rule on lands and seas
 his loathed couch each wakeful hermit leaves
 to pray rose they and i for so they please
 i congee took when ended was the same
 and hitherward as they advised me came"

 xliii
 the dane his woful tale had done when thus
 the good prince godfrey answered him "sir knight
 thou bringest tidings sad and dolorous
 for which our heavy camp laments of right
 since so brave troops and so dear friends to us
 one hour hath spent in one unlucky fight
 and so appeared hath thy master stout
 as lightning doth now kindled now quenched out

 xliv
 "but such a death and end exceedeth all
 the conquests vain of realms or spoils of gold
 nor aged rome's proud stately capital
 did ever triumph yet like theirs behold
 they sit in heaven on thrones celestial
 crowned with glory for their conquest bold
 where each his hurts i think to other shows
 and glories in those bloody wounds and blows

 xlv
 "but thou who hast part of thy race to run
 with haps and hazards of this world ytost
 rejoice for those high honors they have won
 which cannot be by chance or fortune crossed
 but for thou askest for bertoldo's son
 know that he wandereth banished from this host
 and till of him new tidings some man tell
 within this camp i deem it best thou dwell"

 xlvi
 these words of theirs in many a soul renewed
 the sweet remembrance of fair sophia's child
 some with salt tears for him their cheeks bedewed
 lest evil betide him mongst the pagans wild
 and every one his valiant prowess showed
 and of his battles stories long compiled
 telling the dane his acts and conquests past
 which made his ears amazed his heart aghast

 xlvii
 now when remembrance of the youth had wrought
 a tender pity in each softened mind
 behold returned home with all they caught
 the bands that were to forage late assigned
 and with them in abundance great they brought
 both flocks and herds of every sort and kind
 and corn although not much and hay to feed
 their noble steeds and coursers when they need

 xlviii
 they also brought of misadventure sad
 tokens and signs seemed too apparent true
 rinaldo's armor frushed and hacked they had
 oft pierced through with blood besmeared new
 about the camp for always rumors bad
 are farthest spread these woful tidings flew
 thither assembled straight both high and low
 longing to see what they were loth to know

 xlix
 his heavy hauberk was both seen and known
 and his brand shield wherein displayed flies
 the bird that proves her chickens for her own
 by looking gainst the sun with open eyes
 that shield was to the pagans often shown
 in many a hard and hardy enterprise
 but now with many a gash and many a stroke
 they see and sigh to see it frushed and broke

 l
 while all his soldiers whispered under hand
 and here and there the fault and cause do lay
 godfrey before him called aliprand
 captain of those that brought of late this prey
 a man who did on points of virtue stand
 blameless in words and true whate'er he say
 "say" quoth the duke "where you this armor had
 hide not the truth but tell it good or bad"

 li
 he answered him "as far from hence think i
 as on two days a speedy post well rideth
 to gazaward a little plain doth lie
 itself among the steepy hills which hideth
 through it slow falling from the mountains high
 a rolling brook twixt bush and bramble glideth
 clad with thick shade of boughs of broadleaved treen
 fit place for men to lie in wait unseen

 lii
 "thither to seek some flocks or herds we went
 perchance close hid under the greenwood shaw
 and found the springing grass with blood besprent
 a warrior tumbled in his blood we saw
 his arms though dusty bloody hacked and rent
 yet well we knew when near the corse we draw
 to which to view his face in vain i started
 for from his body his fair head was parted

 liii
 "his right hand wanted eke with many a wound
 the trunk through pierced was from back to breast
 a little by his empty helm we found
 the silver eagle shining on his crest
 to spy at whom to ask we gazed round
 a churl then toward us his steps addressed
 but when us armed by the corse he spied
 he ran away his fearful face to hide

 liv
 "but we pursued him took him spake him fair
 till comforted at last he answer made
 how that the day before he saw repair
 a band of soldiers from that forest shade
 of whom one carried by the golden hair
 a head but late cut off with murdering blade
 the face was fair and young and on the chin
 no sign of heard to bud did yet begin

 lv
 "and how in sindal wrapt away he bore
 that head with him hung at his saddlebow
 and how the murtherers by the arms they wore
 for soldiers of our camp he well did know
 the carcass i disarmed and weeping sore
 because i guessed who should that harness owe
 away i brought it but first order gave
 that noble body should be laid in grave

 lvi
 "but if it be his trunk whom i believe
 a nobler tomb his worth deserveth well"
 this said good aliprando took his leave
 of certain troth he had no more to tell
 sore sighed the duke so did these news him grieve
 fears in his heart doubts in his bosom dwell
 he yearned to know to find and learn the truth
 and punish would them that had slain the youth

 lvii
 but now the night dispread her lazy wings
 o'er the broad fields of heaven's bright wilderness
 sleep the soul's rest and ease of careful things
 buried in happy peace both more and less
 thou argillan alone whom sorrow stings
 still wakest musing on great deeds i guess
 nor sufferest in thy watchful eyes to creep
 the sweet repose of mild and gentle sleep

 lviii
 this man was strong of limb and all his 'says
 were bold of ready tongue and working sprite
 near trento born bred up in brawls and frays
 in jars in quarrels and in civil fight
 for which exiled the hills and public ways
 he filled with blood and robberies day and night
 until to asia's wars at last he came
 and boldly there he served and purchased fame

 lix
 he closed his eyes at last when day drew near
 yet slept he not but senseless lay opprest
 with strange amazedness and sudden fear
 which false alecto breathed in his breast
 his working powers within deluded were
 stone still he quiet lay yet took no rest
 for to his thought the fiend herself presented
 and with strange visions his weak brain tormented

 lx
 a murdered body huge beside him stood
 of head and right hand both but lately spoiled
 his left hand bore the head whose visage good
 both pale and wan with dust and gore defoiled
 yet spake though dead with whose sad words the blood
 forth at his lips in huge abundance boiled
 "fly argillan from this false camp fly far
 whose guide a traitor captains murderers are

 lxi
 "godfrey hath murdered me by treason vile
 what favor then hope you my trusty friends
 his villain heart is full of fraud and guile
 to your destruction all his thoughts he bends
 yet if thou thirst of praise for noble stile
 if in thy strength thou trust thy strength that ends
 all hard assays fly not first with his blood
 appease my ghost wandering by lethe flood

 lxii
 "i will thy weapon whet inflame thine ire
 arm thy right hand and strengthen every part"
 this said even while she spake she did inspire
 with fury rage and wrath his troubled heart
 the man awaked and from his eyes like fire
 the poisoned sparks of headstrong madness start
 and armed as he was forth is he gone
 and gathered all the italian bands in one

 lxiii
 he gathered them where lay the arms that late
 were good rinaldo's then with semblance stout
 and furious words his foreconceived hate
 in bitter speeches thus he vomits out
 "is not this people barbarous and ingrate
 in whom truth finds no place faith takes no rout
 whose thirst unquenched is of blood and gold
 whom no yoke boweth bridle none can hold

 lxiv
 "so much we suffered have these seven years long
 under this servile and unworthy yoke
 that thorough rome and italy our wrong
 a thousand years hereafter shall be spoke
 i count not how cilicia's kingdom strong
 subdued was by prince tancredi's stroke
 nor how false baldwin him that land bereaves
 of virtue's harvest fraud there reaped the sheaves

 lxv
 "nor speak i how each hour at every need
 quick ready resolute at all assays
 with fire and sword we hasted forth with speed
 and bore the brunt of all their fights and frays
 but when we had performed and done the deed
 at ease and leisure they divide the preys
 we reaped naught but travel for our toil
 theirs was the praise the realms the gold the spoil

 lxvi
 "yet all this season were we willing blind
 offended unrevenged wronged but unwroken
 light griefs could not provoke our quiet mind
 but now alas the mortal blow is stroken
 rinaldo have they slain and law of kind
 of arms of nations and of high heaven broken
 why doth not heaven kill them with fire and thunder
 to swallow them why cleaves not earth asunder

 lxvii
 "they have rinaldo slain the sword and shield
 of christ's true faith and unrevenged he lies
 still unrevenged lieth in the field
 his noble corpse to feed the crows and pies
 who murdered him who shall us certain yield
 who sees not that although he wanted eyes
 who knows not how the italian chivalry
 proud godfrey and false baldwin both envy

 lxviii
 "what need we further proof heaven heaven i swear
 will not consent herein we be beguiled
 this night i saw his murdered sprite appear
 pale sad and wan with wounds and blood defiled
 a spectacle full both of grief and fear
 godfrey for murdering him the ghost reviled
 i saw it was no dream before mine eyes
 howe'er i look still still methinks it flies

 lxix
 "what shall we do shall we be governed still
 by this false hand contaminate with blood
 or else depart and travel forth until
 to euphrates we come that sacred flood
 where dwells a people void of martial skill
 whose cities rich whose land is fat and good
 where kingdoms great we may at ease provide
 far from these frenchmen's malice from their pride

 lxx
 "then let us go and no revengement take
 for this brave knight though it lie in our power
 no no that courage rather newly wake
 which never sleeps in fear and dread one hour
 and this pestiferous serpent poisoned snake
 of all our knights that hath destroyed the flower
 first let us slay and his deserved end
 example make to him that kills his friend

 lxxi
 "i will i will if your courageous force
 dareth so much as it can well perform
 tear out his cursed heart without remorse
 the nest of treason false and guile enorm"
 thus spake the angry knight with headlong course
 the rest him followed with a furious storm
 "arm arm" they cried to arms the soldiers ran
 and as they run "arm arm" cried every man

 lxxii
 mongst them alecto strowed wasteful fire
 envenoming the hearts of most and least
 folly disdain madness strife rancor ire
 thirst to shed blood in every breast increased
 this ill spread far and till it set on fire
 with rage the italian lodgings never ceased
 from thence unto the switzers' camp it went
 and last infected every english tent

 lxxiii
 not public loss of their beloved knight
 alone stirred up their rage and wrath untamed
 but foreconceived griefs and quarrels light
 the ire still nourished and still inflamed
 awaked was each former cause of spite
 the frenchmen cruel and unjust they named
 and with bold threats they made their hatred known
 hate seld kept close and oft unwisely shown

 lxxiv
 like boiling liquor in a seething pot
 that fumeth swelleth high and bubbleth fast
 till o'er the brims among the embers hot
 part of the broth and of the scum is cast
 their rage and wrath those few appeased not
 in whom of wisdom yet remained some taste
 camillo william tancred were away
 and all whose greatness might their madness stay

 lxxv
 now headlong ran to harness in this heat
 these furious people all on heaps confused
 the roaring trumpets battle gan to threat
 as it in time of mortal war is used
 the messengers ran to godfredo great
 and bade him arm while on this noise he mused
 and baldwin first well clad in iron hard
 stepped to his side a sure and faithful guard

 lxxvi
 their murmurs heard to heaven he lift his een
 as was his wont to god for aid he fled
 "o lord thou knowest this right hand of mine
 abhorred ever civil blood to shed
 illumine their dark souls with light divine
 repress their rage by hellish fury bred
 the innocency of my guiltless mind
 thou knowest and make these know with fury blind"

 lxxvii
 tis said he felt infused in each vein
 a sacred heat from heaven above distilled
 a heat in man that courage could constrain
 that his brave look with awful boldness filled
 well guarded forth he went to meet the train
 of those that would revenge rinaldo killed
 and though their threats he heard and saw them bent
 to arms on every side yet on he went

 lxxviii
 above his hauberk strong a coat he ware
 embroidered fair with pearl and richest stone
 his hands were naked and his face was bare
 wherein a lamp of majesty bright shone
 he shook his golden mace wherewith he dare
 resist the force of his rebellious foe
 thus he appeared and thus he gan them teach
 in shape an angel and a god in speech

 lxxix
 "what foolish words what threats be these i hear
 what noise of arms who dares these tumults move
 am i so honored stand you so in fear
 where is your late obedience where your love
 of godfrey's falsehood who can witness bear
 who dare or will these accusations prove
 perchance you look i should entreaties bring
 sue for your favors or excuse the thing

 lxxx
 "ah god forbid these lands should hear or see
 him so disgraced at whose great name they quake
 this sceptre and my noble acts for me
 a true defence before the world can make
 yet for sharp justice governed shall be
 with clemency i will no vengeance take
 for this offence but for rinaldo's love
 i pardon you hereafter wiser prove

 lxxxi
 "but argillano's guilty blood shall wash
 this stain away who kindled this debate
 and led by hasty rage and fury rash
 to these disorders first undid the gate"
 while thus he spoke the lightning beams did flash
 out of his eyes of majesty and state
 that argillanwho would have thought itshook
 for fear and terror conquered with his look

 lxxxii
 the rest with indiscreet and foolish wrath
 who threatened late with words of shame and pride
 whose hands so ready were to harm and scath
 and brandished bright swords on every side
 now hushed and still attend what godfrey saith
 with shame and fear their bashful looks they hide
 and argillan they let in chains be bound
 although their weapons him environed round

 lxxxiii
 so when a lion shakes his dreadful mane
 and beats his tail with courage proud and wroth
 if his commander come who first took pain
 to tame his youth his lofty crest down goeth
 his threats he feareth and obeys the rein
 of thralldom base and serviceage though loth
 nor can his sharp teeth nor his armed paws
 force him rebel against his ruler's laws

 lxxxiv
 fame as a winged warrior they beheld
 with semblant fierce and furious look that stood
 and in his left hand had a splendent shield
 wherewith he covered safe their chieftain good
 his other hand a naked sword did wield
 from which distilling fell the lukewarm blood
 the blood pardie of many a realm and town
 whereon the lord his wrath had poured down

 lxxxv
 thus was the tumult without bloodshed ended
 their arms laid down strife into exile sent
 godfrey his thoughts to greater actions bended
 and homeward to his rich pavilion went
 for to assault the fortress he intended
 before the second or third day were spent
 meanwhile his timber wrought he oft surveyed
 whereof his ram and engines great he made



 ninth book

 the argument
 alecto false great solyman doth move
 by night the christians in their tents to kill
 but god who their intents saw from above
 sends michael down from his sacred hill
 the spirits foul to hell the angels drove
 the knights delivered from the witch at will
 destroy the pagans scatter all their host
 the soldan flies when all his bands are lost


 i
 the grisly child of erebus the grim
 who saw these tumults done and tempest spent
 gainst stream of grace who ever strove to swim
 and all her thoughts against heaven's wisdom bent
 departed now bright titan's beams were dim
 and fruitful lands waxed barren as she went
 she sought the rest of her infernal crew
 new storms to raise new broils and tumults new

 ii
 she that well wist her sisters had enticed
 by their false arts far from the christian host
 tancred rinaldo and the rest best prized
 for martial skill for might esteemed most
 said of these discords and these strifes advised
 "great solyman when day his light hath lost
 these christians shall assail with sudden war
 and kill them all while thus they strive and jar"

 iii
 with that where solyman remained she flew
 and found him out with his arabian bands
 great solyman of all christ's foes untrue
 boldest of courage mightiest of his hands
 like him was none of all that earthbred crew
 that heaped mountains on the aemonian sands
 of turks he sovereign was and nice his seat
 where late he dwelt and ruled that kingdom great

 iv
 the lands forenenst the greekish shore he held
 from sangar's mouth to crooked meander's fall
 where they of phrygia mysia lydia dwelled
 bithynia's towns and pontus' cities all
 but when the hearts of christian princes swelled
 and rose in arms to make proud asia thrall
 those lands were won where he did sceptre wield
 and he twice beaten was in pitched field

 v
 when fortune oft he had in vain assayed
 and spent his forces which availed him naught
 to egypt's king himself he close conveyed
 who welcomed him as he could best have thought
 glad in his heart and inly well apayed
 that to his court so great a lord was brought
 for he decreed his armies huge to bring
 to succor juda land and juda's king

 vi
 but ere he open war proclaimed he would
 that solyman should kindle first the fire
 and with huge sums of false enticing gold
 the arabian thieves he sent him forth to hire
 while he the asian lords and morians hold
 unites the soldan won to his desire
 those outlaws ready aye for gold to fight
 the hope of gain hath such alluring might

 vii
 thus made their captain to destroy and burn
 in juda land he entered is so far
 that all the ways whereby he should return
 by godfrey's people kept and stopped are
 and now he gan his former losses mourn
 this wound had hit him on an elder scar
 on great adventures ran his hardy thought
 but naught assured he yet resolved on naught

 viii
 to him alecto came and semblant bore
 of one whose age was great whose looks were grave
 whose cheeks were bloodless and whose locks were hoar
 mustaches strouting long and chin close shave
 a steepled turban on her head she wore
 her garment wide and by her side her glaive
 her gilden quiver at her shoulders hung
 and in her hand a bow was stiff and strong

 ix
 "we have" quoth she "through wildernesses gone
 through sterile sands strange paths and uncouth ways
 yet spoil or booty have we gotten none
 nor victory deserving fame or praise
 godfrey meanwhile to ruin stick and stone
 of this fair town with battery sore assays
 and if awhile we rest we shall behold
 this glorious city smoking lie in mould

 x
 "are sheepcotes burnt or preys of sheep or kine
 the cause why solyman these bands did arm
 canst thou that kingdom lately lost of thine
 recover thus or thus redress thy harm
 no no when heaven's small candles next shall shine
 within their tents give them a bold alarm
 believe araspes old whose grave advice
 thou hast in exile proved and proved in nice

 xi
 "he feareth naught he doubts no sudden broil
 from these illarmed and worsehearted bands
 he thinks this people used to rob and spoil
 to such exploit dares not lift up their hands
 up then and with thy courage put to foil
 this fearless camp while thus secure it stands"
 this said her poison in his breast she hides
 and then to shapeless air unseen she glides

 xii
 the soldan cried "o thou which in my thought
 increased hast my rage and fury so
 nor seem'st a wight of mortal metal wrought
 i follow thee whereso thee list to go
 mountains of men by dint of sword down brought
 thou shalt behold and seas of red blood flow
 where'er i go only be thou my guide
 when sable night the azure skies shall hide"

 xiii
 when this was said he mustered all his crew
 reproved the cowards and allowed the bold
 his forward camp inspired with courage new
 was ready dight to follow where he would
 alecto's self the warning trumpet blew
 and to the wind his standard great unrolled
 thus on they marched and thus on they went
 of their approach their speed the news prevent

 xiv
 alecto left them and her person dight
 like one that came some tidings new to tell
 it was the time when first the rising night
 her sparkling diamonds poureth forth to sell
 when into sion come she marched right
 where juda's aged tyrant used to dwell
 to whom of solyman's designment bold
 the place the manner and the time she told

 xv
 their mantle dark the grisly shadows spread
 stained with spots of deepest sanguine hue
 warm drops of blood on earth's black visage shed
 supplied the place of pure and precious dew
 the moon and stars for fear of sprites were fled
 the shrieking goblins eachwhere howling flew
 the furies roar the ghosts and fairies yell
 the earth was filled with devils and empty hell

 xvi
 the soldan fierce through all this horror went
 toward the camp of his redoubted foes
 the night was more than half consumed and spent
 now headlong down the western hill she goes
 when distant scant a mile from godfrey's tent
 he let his people there awhile repose
 and victualled them and then he boldly spoke
 these words which rage and courage might provoke

 xvii
 "see there a camp full stuffed of spoils and preys
 not half so strong as false report recordeth
 see there the storehouse where their captain lays
 our treasures stolen where asia's wealth he hoardeth
 now chance the ball unto our racket plays
 take then the vantage which good luck affordeth
 for all their arms their horses gold and treasure
 are ours ours without loss harm or displeasure

 xviii
 "nor is this camp that great victorious host
 that slew the persian lords and nice hath won
 for those in this long war are spent and lost
 these are the dregs the wine is all outrun
 and these few left are drowned and dead almost
 in heavy sleep the labor half is done
 to send them headlong to avernus deep
 for little differs death and heavy sleep

 xix
 "come come this sword the passage open shall
 into their camp and on their bodies slain
 we will pass o'er their rampire and their wall
 this blade as scythes cut down the fields of grain
 shall cut them so christ's kingdom now shall fall
 asia her freedom you shall praise obtain"
 thus he inflamed his soldiers to the fight
 and led them on through silence of the night

 xx
 the sentinel by starlight lo descried
 this mighty soldan and his host draw near
 who found not as he hoped the christians' guide
 unware ne yet unready was his gear
 the scouts when this huge army they descried
 ran back and gan with shouts the 'larum rear
 the watch stert up and drew their weapons bright
 and busked them bold to battle and to fight

 xxi
 the arabians wist they could not come unseen
 and therefore loud their jarring trumpets sound
 their yelling cries to heaven upheaved been
 the horses thundered on the solid ground
 the mountains roared and the valley green
 the echoes sighed from the caves around
 alecto with her brand kindled in hell
 tokened to them in david's tower that dwell

 xxii
 before the rest forth pricked the soldan fast
 against the watch not yet in order just
 as swift as hideous boreas' hasty blast
 from hollow rocks when first his storms outburst
 the raging floods that trees and rocks down cast
 thunders that towns and towers drive to dust
 earthquakes to tear the world in twain that threat
 are naught compared to his fury great

 xxiii
 he struck no blow but that his foe he hit
 and never hit but made a grievous wound
 and never wounded but death followed it
 and yet no peril hurt or harm he found
 no weapon on his hardened helmet bit
 no puissant stroke his senses once astound
 yet like a bell his tinkling helmet rung
 and thence flew flames of fire and sparks among

 xxiv
 himself well nigh had put the watch to flight
 a jolly troop of frenchmen strong and stout
 when his arabians came by heaps to fight
 covering like raging floods the fields about
 the beaten christians run away full light
 the pagans mingled with the flying rout
 entered their camp and filled as they stood
 their tents with ruin slaughter death and blood

 xxv
 high on the soldan's helm enamelled laid
 an hideous dragon armed with many a scale
 with iron paws and leathern wings displayed
 which twisted on a knot her forked tail
 with triple tongue it seemed she hissed and brayed
 about her jaws the froth and venom trail
 and as he stirred and as his foes him hit
 so flames to cast and fire she seemed to spit

 xxvi
 with this strange light the soldan fierce appeared
 dreadful to those that round about him been
 as to poor sailors when huge storms are reared
 with lightning flash the rafting seas are seen
 some fled away because his strength they feared
 some bolder gainst him bent their weapons keen
 and forward night in evils and mischiefs pleased
 their dangers hid and dangers still increased

 xxvii
 among the rest that strove to merit praise
 was old latinus born by tiber's bank
 to whose stout heart in fights and bloody frays
 for all his eild base fear yet never sank
 five sons he had the comforts of his days
 that from his side in no adventure shrank
 but long before their time in iron strong
 they clad their members tender soft and young

 xxviii
 the bold ensample of their father's might
 their weapons whetted and their wrath increased
 "come let us go" quoth he "where yonder knight
 upon our soldiers makes his bloody feast
 let not their slaughter once your hearts affright
 where danger most appears there fear it least
 for honor dwells in hard attempts my sons
 and greatest praise in greatest peril wons"

 xxix
 her tender brood the forest's savage queen
 ere on their crests their rugged manes appear
 before their mouths by nature armed been
 or paws have strength a silly lamb to tear
 so leadeth forth to prey and makes them keen
 and learns by her ensample naught to fear
 the hunter in those desert woods that takes
 the lesser beasts whereon his feast he makes

 xxx
 the noble father and his hardy crew
 fierce solyman on every side invade
 at once all six upon the soldan flew
 with lances sharp and strong encounters made
 his broken spear the eldest boy down threw
 and boldly overboldly drew his blade
 wherewith he strove but strove therewith in vain
 the pagan's steed unmarked to have slain

 xxxi
 but as a mountain or a cape of land
 assailed with storms and seas on every side
 doth unremoved steadfast still withstand
 storm thunder lightning tempest wind and tide
 the soldan so withstood latinus' band
 and unremoved did all their justs abide
 and of that hapless youth who hurt his steed
 down to the chin he cleft in twain the head

 xxxii
 kind aramante who saw his brother slain
 to hold him up stretched forth his friendly arm
 oh foolish kindness and oh pity vain
 to add our proper loss to other's harm
 the prince let fall his sword and cut in twain
 about his brother twined the child's weak arm
 down from their saddles both together slide
 together mourned they and together died

 xxxiii
 that done sabino's lance with nimble force
 he cut in twain and 'gainst the stripling bold
 he spurred his steed that underneath his horse
 the hardy infant tumbled on the mould
 whose soul out squeezed from his bruised corpse
 with ugly painfulness forsook her hold
 and deeply mourned that of so sweet a cage
 she left the bliss and joys of youthful age

 xxxiv
 but picus yet and lawrence were on live
 whom at one birth their mother fair brought out
 a pair whose likeness made the parents strive
 oft which was which and joyed in their doubt
 but what their birth did undistinguished give
 the soldan's rage made known for picus stout
 headless at one huge blow he laid in dust
 and through the breast his gentle brother thrust

 xxxv
 their father but no father now alas
 when all his noble sons at once were slain
 in their five deaths so often murdered was
 i know not how his life could him sustain
 except his heart were forged of steel or brass
 yet still he lived pardie he saw not plain
 their dying looks although their deaths he knows
 it is some ease not to behold our woes

 xxxvi
 he wept not for the night her curtain spread
 between his cause of weeping and his eyes
 but still he mourned and on sharp vengeance fed
 and thinks he conquers if revenged he dies
 he thirsts the soldan's heathenish blood to shed
 and yet his own at less than naught doth prize
 nor can he tell whether he liefer would
 or die himself or kill the pagan bold

 xxxvii
 at last "is this right hand" quoth he "so weak
 that thou disdain'st gainst me to use thy might
 can it naught do can this tongue nothing speak
 that may provoke thine ire thy wrath and spite"
 with that he struck his anger great to wreak
 a blow that pierced the mail and metal bright
 and in his flank set ope a floodgate wide
 whereat the blood out streamed from his side

 xxxviii
 provoked with his cry and with that blow
 the turk upon him gan his blade discharge
 he cleft his breastplate having first pierced through
 lined with seven bulls' hides his mighty targe
 and sheathed his weapons in his guts below
 wretched latinus at that issue large
 and at his mouth poured out his vital blood
 and sprinkled with the same his murdered brood

 xxxix
 on apennine like as a sturdy tree
 against the winds that makes resistance stout
 if with a storm it overturned be
 falls down and breaks the trees and plants about
 so latine fell and with him felled he
 and slew the nearest of the pagans' rout
 a worthy end fit for a man of fame
 that dying slew and conquered overcame

 xl
 meanwhile the soldan strove his rage
 to satisfy with blood of christian spilled
 the arabians heartened by their captain stern
 with murder every tent and cabin filled
 henry the english knight and olipherne
 o fierce draguto by thy hands were killed
 gilbert and philip were by ariadene
 both slain both born upon the banks of rhone

 xli
 albazar with his mace ernesto slew
 under algazel engerlan down fell
 but the huge murder of the meaner crew
 or manner of their deaths what tongue can tell
 godfrey when first the heathen trumpets blew
 awaked which heard no fear could make him dwell
 but he and his were up and armed ere long
 and marched forward with a squadron strong

 xlii
 he that well heard the rumor and the cry
 and marked the tumult still grow more and more
 the arabian thieves he judged by and by
 against his soldiers made this battle sore
 for that they forayed all the countries nigh
 and spoiled the fields the duke knew well before
 yet thought he not they had the hardiment
 so to assail him in his armed tent

 xliii
 all suddenly he heard while on he went
 how to the cityward "arm arm" they cried
 the noise upreared to the firmament
 with dreadful howling filled the valleys wlde
 this was clorinda whom the king forth sent
 to battle and argantes by her side
 the duke this heard to guelpho turned and prayed
 him his lieutenant be and to him said

 xliv
 "you hear this new alarm from yonder part
 that from the town breaks out with so much rage
 us needeth much your valor and your art
 to calm their fury and their heat to 'suage
 go thither then and with you take some part
 of these brave soldiers of mine equipage
 while with the residue of my champions bold
 i drive these wolves again out of our fold"

 xlv
 they parted this agreed on them between
 by divers paths lord guelpho to the hill
 and godfrey hasted where the arabians keen
 his men like silly sheep destroy and kill
 but as he went his troops increased been
 from every part the people flocked still
 that now grown strong enough he 'proached nigh
 where the fierce turk caused many a christian die

 xlvi
 so from the top of vesulus the cold
 down to the sandy valleys tumbleth po
 whose streams the further from the fountain rolled
 still stronger wax and with more puissance go
 and horned like a bull his forehead bold
 he lifts and o'er his broken banks doth flow
 and with his horns to pierce the sea assays
 to which he proffereth war not tribute pays

 xlvii
 the duke his men fast flying did espy
 and thither ran and thus displeased spake
 "what fear is this oh whither do you fly
 see who they be that this pursuit do make
 a heartless band that dare no battle try
 who wounds before dare neither give nor take
 against them turn your stern eye's threatening sight
 an angry look will put them all to flight"

 xlviii
 this said he spurred forth where solyman
 destroyed christ's vineyard like a savage boar
 through streams of blood through dust and dirt he ran
 o'er heaps of bodies wallowing in their gore
 the squadrons close his sword to ope began
 he broke their ranks behind beside before
 and where he goes under his feet he treads
 the armed saracens and barbed steeds

 xlix
 this slaughterhouse of angry mars he passed
 where thousands dead halfdead and dying were
 the hardy soldan saw him come in haste
 yet neither stepped aside nor shrunk for fear
 but busked him bold to fight aloft he cast
 his blade prepared to strike and stepped near
 these noble princes twain so fortune wrought
 from the world's end here met and here they fought

 l
 with virtue fury strength with courage strove
 for asia's mighty empire who can tell
 with how strange force their cruel blows they drove
 how sore their combat was how fierce how fell
 great deeds they wrought each other's harness clove
 yet still in darkness more the ruth they dwell
 the night their acts her black veil covered under
 their acts whereat the sun the world might wonder

 li
 the christians by their guide's ensample hearted
 of their best armed made a squadron strong
 and to defend their chieftain forth they started
 the pagans also saved their knight from wrong
 fortune her favors twixt them evenly parted
 fierce was the encounter bloody doubtful long
 these won those lost these lost those won again
 the loss was equal even the numbers slain

 lii
 with equal rage as when the southern wind
 meeteth in battle strong the northern blast
 the sea and air to neither is resigned
 but cloud gainst cloud and wave gainst wave they cast
 so from this skirmish neither part declined
 but fought it out and kept their footings fast
 and oft with furious shock together rush
 and shield gainst shield and helm gainst helm they crush

 liii
 the battle eke to sionward grew hot
 the soldiers slain the hardy knights were killed
 legions of sprites from limbo's prisons got
 the empty air the hills and valleys filled
 hearting the pagans that they shrinked not
 till where they stood their dearest blood they spilled
 and with new rage argantes they inspire
 whose heat no flames whose burning need no fire

 liv
 where he came in he put to shameful flight
 the fearful watch and o'er the trenches leaped
 even with the ground he made the rampire's height
 and murdered bodies in the ditch unheaped
 so that his greedy mates with labor light
 amid the tents a bloody harvest reaped
 clorinda went the proud circassian by
 so from a piece two chained bullets fly

 lv
 now fled the frenchmen when in lucky hour
 arrived guelpho and his helping band
 he made them turn against this stormy shower
 and with bold face their wicked foes withstand
 sternly they fought that from their wounds downpour
 the streams of blood and run on either hand
 the lord of heaven meanwhile upon this fight
 from his high throne bent down his gracious sight

 lvi
 from whence with grace and goodness compassed round
 he ruleth blesseth keepeth all he wrought
 above the air the fire the sea and ground
 our sense our wit our reason and our thought
 where persons three with power and glory crowned
 are all one god who made all things of naught
 under whose feet subjected to his grace
 sit nature fortune motion time and place

 lvii
 this is the place from whence like smoke and dust
 of this frail world the wealth the pomp and power
 he tosseth tumbleth turneth as he lust
 and guides our life our death our end and hour
 no eye however virtuous pure and just
 can view the brightness of that glorious bower
 on every side the blessed spirits be
 equal in joys though differing in degree

 lviii
 with harmony of their celestial song
 the palace echoed from the chambers pure
 at last he michael called in harness strong
 of never yielding diamonds armed sure
 "behold" quoth he "to do despite and wrong
 to that dear flock my mercy hath in cure
 how satan from hell's loathsome prison sends
 his ghosts his sprites his furies and his fiends

 lix
 "go bid them all depart and leave the care
 of war to soldiers as doth best pertain
 bid them forbear to infect the earth and air
 to darken heaven's fair light bid them refrain
 bid them to acheron's black flood repair
 fit house for them the house of grief and pain
 there let their king himself and them torment
 so i command go tell them mine intent"

 lx
 this said the winged warrior low inclined
 at his creator's feet with reverence due
 then spread his golden feathers to the wind
 and swift as thought away the angel flew
 he passed the light and shining fire assigned
 the glorious seat of his selected crew
 the mover first and circle crystalline
 the firmament where fixed stars all shine

 lxi
 unlike in working then in shape and show
 at his left hand saturn he left and jove
 and those untruly errant called i trow
 since he errs not who them doth guide and move
 the fields he passed then whence hail and snow
 thunder and rain fall down from clouds above
 where heat and cold dryness and moisture strive
 whose wars all creatures kill and slain revive

 lxii
 the horrid darkness and the shadows dun
 dispersed he with his eternal wings
 the flames which from his heavenly eyes outrun
 beguiled the earth and all her sable things
 after a storm so spreadeth forth the sun
 his rays and binds the clouds in golden strings
 or in the stillness of a moonshine even
 a falling star so glideth down from heaven

 lxiii
 but when the infernal troop he 'proached near
 that still the pagans' ire and rage provoke
 the angel on his wings himself did bear
 and shook his lance and thus at last he spoke
 "have you not learned yet to know and fear
 the lord's just wrath and thunder's dreadful stroke
 or in the torments of your endless ill
 are you still fierce still proud rebellious still

 lxiv
 "the lord hath sworn to break the iron bands
 the brazen gates of sion's fort which close
 who is it that his sacred will withstands
 against his wrath who dares himself oppose
 go hence you cursed to your appointed lands
 the realms of death of torments and of woes
 and in the deeps of that infernal lake
 your battles fight and there your triumphs make

 lxv
 "there tyrannize upon the souls you find
 condemned to woe and double still their pains
 where some complain where some their teeth do grind
 some howl and weep some clank their iron chains"
 this said they fled and those that stayed behind
 with his sharp lance he driveth and constrains
 they sighing left the lands his silver sheep
 where hesperus doth lead doth feed and keep

 lxvi
 and toward hell their lazy wings display
 to wreak their malice on the damned ghosts
 the birds that follow titan's hottest ray
 pass not in so great flocks to warmer coasts
 nor leaves in so great numbers fall away
 when winter nips them with his newcome frosts
 the earth delivered from so foul annoy
 recalled her beauty and resumed her joy

 lxvii
 but not for this in fierce argantes' breast
 lessened the rancor and decreased the ire
 although alecto left him to infest
 with the hot brands of her infernal fire
 round his armed head his trenchant blade he blest
 and those thick ranks that seemed moist entire
 he breaks the strong the high the weak the low
 were equalized by his murdering blow

 lxviii
 not far from him amid the blood and dust
 heads arms and legs clorinda strewed wide
 her sword through berengarius' breast she thrust
 quite through the heart where life doth chiefly bide
 and that fell blow she struck so sure and just
 that at his back his life and blood forth glide
 even in the mouth she smote albinus then
 and cut in twain the visage of the man

 lxix
 gernier's right hand she from his arm divided
 whereof but late she had received a wound
 the hand his sword still held although not guided
 the fingers half alive stirred on the ground
 so from a serpent slain the tail divided
 moves in the grass rolleth and tumbleth round
 the championess so wounded left the knight
 and gainst achilles turned her weapon bright

 lxx
 upon his neck light that unhappy blow
 and cut the sinews and the throat in twain
 the head fell down upon the earth below
 and soiled with dust the visage on the plain
 the headless trunk a woful thing to know
 still in the saddle seated did remain
 until his steed that felt the reins at large
 with leaps and flings that burden did discharge

 lxxi
 while thus this fair and fierce bellona slew
 the western lords and put their troops to flight
 gildippes raged mongst the pagan crew
 and low in dust laid many a worthy knight
 like was their sex their beauty and their hue
 like was their youth their courage and their might
 yet fortune would they should the battle try
 of mightier foes for both were framed to die

 lxxii
 yet wished they oft and strove in vain to meet
 so great betwixt them was the press and throng
 but hardy guelpho gainst clorinda sweet
 ventured his sword to work her harm and wrong
 and with a cutting blow so did her greet
 that from her side the blood streamed down along
 but with a thrust an answer sharp she made
 and 'twixt his ribs colored somedeal her blade

 lxxiii
 lord guelpho struck again but hit her not
 for strong osmida haply passed by
 and not meant him another's wound he got
 that cleft his front in twain above his eye
 near guelpho now the battle waxed hot
 for all the troops he led gan thither hie
 and thither drew eke many a paynim knight
 that fierce stern bloody deadly waxed the fight

 lxxiv
 meanwhile the purple morning peeped o'er
 the eastern threshold to our half of land
 and argillano in this great uproar
 from prison loosed was and what he fand
 those arms he hent and to the field them bore
 resolved to take his chance what came to hand
 and with great acts amid the pagan host
 would win again his reputation lost

 lxxv
 as a fierce steed 'scaped from his stall at large
 where he had long been kept for warlike need
 runs through the fields unto the flowery marge
 of some green forest where he used to feed
 his curled mane his shoulders broad doth charge
 and from his lofty crest doth spring and spreed
 thunder his feet his nostrils fire breathe out
 and with his neigh the world resounds about

 lxxvi
 so argillan rushed forth sparkled his eyes
 his front high lifted was no fear therein
 lightly he leaps and skips it seems he flies
 he left no sign in dust imprinted thin
 and coming near his foes he sternly cries
 as one that forced not all their strength a pin
 "you outcasts of the world you men of naught
 what hath in you this boldness newly wrought

 lxxvii
 "too weak are you to bear a helm or shield
 unfit to arm your breast in iron bright
 you run halfnaked trembling through the field
 your blows are feeble and your hope in flight
 your facts and all the actions that you wield
 the darkness hides your bulwark is the night
 now she is gone how will your fights succeed
 now better arms and better hearts you need"

 lxxviii
 while thus he spoke he gave a cruel stroke
 against algazel's throat with might and main
 and as he would have answered him and spoke
 he stopped his words and cut his jaws in twain
 upon his eyes death spread his misty cloak
 a chilling frost congealed every vein
 he fell and with his teeth the earth he tore
 raging in death and full of rage before

 lxxix
 then by his puissance mighty saladine
 proud agricalt and muleasses died
 and at one wondrous blow his weapon fine
 did adiazel in two parts divide
 then through the breast he wounded ariadine
 whom dying with sharp taunts he gan deride
 he lifting up uneath his feeble eyes
 to his proud scorns thus answereth ere he dies

 lxxx
 "not thou whoe'er thou art shall glory long
 thy happy conquest in my death i trow
 like chance awaits thee from a hand more strong
 which by my side will shortly lay thee low"
 he smiled and said "of mine hour short or long
 let heaven take care but here meanwhile die thou
 pasture for wolves and crows" on him his foot
 he set and drew his sword and life both out

 lxxxi
 among this squadron rode a gentle page
 the soldan's minion darling and delight
 on whose fair chin the springtime of his age
 yet blossomed out her flowers small or light
 the sweat spread on his cheeks with heat and rage
 seemed pearls or morning dews on lilies white
 the dust therein uprolled adorned his hair
 his face seemed fierce and sweet wrathful and fair

 lxxxii
 his steed was white and white as purest snow
 that falls on tops of aged apennine
 lightning and storm are not so 'swift i trow
 as he to run to stop to turn and twine
 a dart his right hand shaked prest to throw
 his cutlass by his thigh short hooked fine
 and braving in his turkish pomp he shone
 in purple robe o'erfret with gold and stone

 lxxxiii
 the hardy boy while thirst of warlike praise
 bewitched so his unadvised thought
 gainst every band his childish strength assays
 and little danger found though much he sought
 till argillan that watched fit time always
 in his swift turns to strike him as he fought
 did unawares his snowwhite courser slay
 and under him his master tumbling lay

 lxxxiv
 and gainst his face where love and pity stand
 to pray him that rich throne of beauty spare
 the cruel man stretched forth his murdering hand
 to spoil those gifts whereof he had no share
 it seemed remorse and sense was in his brand
 which lighting flat to hurt the lad forbare
 but all for naught gainst him the point he bent
 that what the edge had spared pierced and rent

 lxxxv
 fierce solyman that with godfredo strived
 who first should enter conquest's glorious gate
 left off the fray and thither headlong drived
 when first he saw the lad in such estate
 he brake the press and soon enough arrived
 to take revenge but to his aid too late
 because he saw his lesbine slain and lost
 like a sweet flower nipped with untimely frost

 lxxxvi
 he saw wax dim the starlight of his eyes
 his ivory neck upon his shoulders fell
 in his pale looks kind pity's image lies
 that death even mourned to hear his passing bell
 his marble heart such soft impression tries
 that midst his wrath his manly tears outwell
 thou weepest solyman thou that beheld
 thy kingdoms lost and not one tear could yield

 lxxxvii
 but when the murderer's sword he hapt to view
 dropping with blood of his lesbino dead
 his pity vanished ire and rage renew
 he had no leisure bootless tears to shed
 but with his blade on argillano flew
 and cleft his shield his helmet and his head
 down to his throat and worthy was that blow
 of solyman his strength and wrath to show

 lxxxviii
 and not content with this down from his horse
 he lights and that dead carcass rent and tore
 like a fierce dog that takes his angry course
 to bite the stone which had him hit before
 oh comfort vain for grief of so great force
 to wound the senseless earth that feels no sore
 but mighty godfrey 'gainst the soldan's train
 spent not this while his force and blows in vain

 lxxxix
 a thousand hardy turks affront he had
 in sturdy iron armed from head to foot
 resolved in all adventures good or bad
 in actions wise in execution stout
 whom solyman into arabia lad
 when from his kingdom he was first cast out
 where living wild with their exiled guide
 to him in all extremes they faithful bide

 xc
 all these in thickest order sure unite
 for godfrey's valor small or nothing shrank
 corcutes first he on the face did smite
 then wounded strong rosteno in the flank
 at one blow selim's head he stroke off quite
 then both rossano's arms in every rank
 the boldest knights of all that chosen crew
 he felled maimed wounded hurt and slew

 xci
 while thus he killed many a saracine
 and all their fierce assaults unhurt sustained
 ere fortune wholly from the turks decline
 while still they hoped much though small they gained
 behold a cloud of dust wherein doth shine
 lightning of war in midst thereof contained
 whence unawares burst forth a storm of swords
 which tremble made the pagan knights and lords
 xcii
 these fifty champions were mongst whom there stands
 in silver field the ensign of christ's death
 if i had mouths and tongues as briareus hands
 if voice as iron tough if iron breath
 what harm this troop wrought to the heathen bands
 what knights they slew i could recount uneath
 in vain the turks resist the arabians fly
 if they fly they are slain if fight they die

 xciii
 fear cruelty grief horror sorrow pain
 run through the field disguised in divers shapes
 death might you see triumphant on the plain
 drowning in blood him that from blows escapes
 the king meanwhile with parcel of his train
 comes hastily out and for sure conquest gapes
 and from a bank whereon he stood beheld
 the doubtful hazard of that bloody field

 xciv
 but when he saw the pagans shrink away
 he sounded the retreat and gan desire
 his messengers in his behalf to pray
 argantes and clorinda to retire
 the furious couple both at once said nay
 even drunk with shedding blood and mad with ire
 at last they went and to recomfort thought
 and stay their troops from flight but all for nought

 xcv
 for who can govern cowardice or fear
 their host already was begun to fly
 they cast their shields and cutting swords arrear
 as not defended but made slow thereby
 a hollow dale the city's bulwarks near
 from west to south outstretched long doth lie
 thither they fled and in a mist of dust
 toward the walls they run they throng they thrust

 xcvi
 while down the bank disordered thus they ran
 the christian knights huge slaughter on them made
 but when to climb the other hill they gan
 old aladine came fiercely to their aid
 on that steep brae lord guelpho would not than
 hazard his folk but there his soldiers stayed
 and safe within the city's walls the king
 the relics small of that sharp fight did bring

 xcvii
 meanwhile the soldan in this latest charge
 had done as much as human force was able
 all sweat and blood appeared his members large
 his breath was short his courage waxed unstable
 his arm grew weak to bear his mighty targe
 his hand to rule his heavy sword unable
 which bruised not cut so blunted was the blade
 it lost the use for which a sword was made

 xcviii
 feeling his weakness he gan musing stand
 and in his troubled thought this question tossed
 if he himself should murder with his hand
 because none else should of his conquest boast
 or he should save his life when on the land
 lay slain the pride of his subdued host
 "at last to fortune's power" quoth he "i yield
 and on my flight let her her trophies build

 xcix
 "let godfrey view my flight and smile to see
 this mine unworthy second banishment
 for armed again soon shall he hear of me
 from his proud head the unsettled crown to rent
 for as my wrongs my wrath etern shall be
 at every hour the bow of war new bent
 i will rise again a foe fierce bold
 though dead though slain though burnt to ashes cold"



 tenth book

 the argument
 ismen from sleep awakes the soldan great
 and into sion brings the prince by night
 where the sad king sits fearful on his seat
 whom he emboldeneth and excites to fight
 godfredo hears his lords and knights repeat
 how they escaped armida's wrath and spite
 rinaldo known to live peter foresays
 his offspring's virtue good deserts and praise

 i
 a gallant steed while thus the soldan said
 came trotting by him without lord or guide
 quickly his hand upon the reins he laid
 and weak and weary climbed up to ride
 the snake that on his crest hot fire outbraid
 was quite cut off his helm had lost the pride
 his coat was rent his harness hacked and cleft
 and of his kingly pomp no sign was left

 ii
 as when a savage wolf chased from the fold
 to hide his head runs to some holt or wood
 who though he filled have while it might hold
 his greedy paunch yet hungreth after food
 with sanguine tongue forth of his lips outrolled
 about his jaws that licks up foam and blood
 so from this bloody fray the soldan hied
 his rage unquenched his wrath unsatisfied

 iii
 and as his fortune would he scaped free
 from thousand arrows which about him flew
 from swords and lances instruments that be
 of certain death himself he safe withdrew
 unknown unseen disguised travelled he
 by desert paths and ways but used by few
 and rode revolving in his troubled thought
 what course to take and yet resolved on naught

 iv
 thither at last he meant to take his way
 where egypt's king assembled all his host
 to join with him and once again assay
 to win by fight by which so oft he lost
 determined thus he made no longer stay
 but thitherward spurred forth his steed in post
 nor need he guide the way right well he could
 that leads to sandy plains of gaza old

 v
 nor though his smarting wounds torment him oft
 his body weak and wounded back and side
 yet rested he nor once his armor doffed
 but all day long o'er hills and dales doth ride
 but when the night cast up her shade aloft
 and all earth's colors strange in sables dyed
 he light and as he could his wounds upbound
 and shook ripe dates down from a palm he found

 vi
 on them he supped and amid the field
 to rest his weary limbs awhile he sought
 he made his pillow of his broken shield
 to ease the griefs of his distempered thought
 but little ease could so hard lodging yield
 his wounds so smarted that he slept right naught
 and in his breast his proud heart rent in twain
 two inward vultures sorrow and disdain

 vii
 at length when midnight with her silence deep
 did heaven and earth hushed still and quiet make
 sore watched and weary he began to steep
 his cares and sorrows in oblivion's lake
 and in a little short unquiet sleep
 some small repose his fainting spirits take
 but while he slept a voice grave and severe
 at unawares thus thundered in his ear

 viii
 "o solyman thou farrenowned king
 till better season serve forbear thy rest
 a stranger doth thy lands in thraldom bring
 nice is a slave by christian yoke oppressed
 sleepest thou here forgetful of this thing
 that here thy friends lie slain not laid in chest
 whose bones bear witness of thy shame and scorn
 and wilt thou idly here attend the morn"

 ix
 the king awoke and saw before his eyes
 a man whose presence seemed grave and old
 a writhen staff his steps unstable guies
 which served his feeble members to uphold
 "and what art thou" the prince in scorn replies
 "what sprite to vex poor passengers so bold
 to break their sleep or what to thee belongs
 my shame my loss my vengeance or my wrongs"

 x
 "i am the man of thine intent" quoth he
 "and purpose new that sure conjecture hath
 and better than thou weenest know i thee
 i proffer thee my service and my faith
 my speeches therefore sharp and biting be
 because quick words the whetstones are of wrath
 accept in gree my lord the words i spoke
 as spurs thine ire and courage to provoke

 xi
 "but now to visit egypt's mighty king
 unless my judgment fall you are prepared
 i prophesy about a needless thing
 you suffer shall a voyage long and hard
 for though you stay the monarch great will bring
 his new assembled host to judaward
 no place of service there no cause of fight
 nor gainst our foes to use your force and might

 xii
 "but if you follow me within this wall
 with christian arms hemmed in on every side
 withouten battle fight or stroke at all
 even at noonday i will you safely guide
 where you delight rejoice and glory shall
 in perils great to see your prowess tried
 that noble town you may preserve and shield
 till egypt's host come to renew the field"

 xiii
 while thus he parleyed of this aged guest
 the turk the words and looks did both admire
 and from his haughty eyes and furious breast
 he laid apart his pride his rage and ire
 and humbly said "i willing am and prest
 to follow where thou leadest reverend sire
 and that advice best fits my angry vein
 that tells of greatest peril greatest pain"

 xiv
 the old man praised his words and for the air
 his late received wounds to worse disposes
 a quintessence therein he poured fair
 that stops the bleeding and incision closes
 beholding then before apollo's chair
 how fresh aurora violets strewed and roses
 "it's time" he says "to wend for titan bright
 to wonted labor summons every wight"

 xv
 and to a chariot that beside did stand
 ascended he and with him solyman
 he took the reins and with a mastering hand
 ruled his steeds and whipped them now and than
 the wheels or horses' feet upon the land
 had left no sign nor token where they ran
 the coursers pant and smoke with lukewarm sweat
 and foaming cream their iron mouthfuls eat

 xvi
 the air about them round a wondrous thing
 itself on heaps in solid thickness drew
 the chariot hiding and environing
 the subtle mist no mortal eye could view
 and yet no stone from engine cast or sling
 could pierce the cloud it was of proof so true
 yet seen it was to them within which ride
 and heaven and earth without all clear beside

 xvii
 his beetle brows the turk amazed bent
 he wrinkled up his front and wildly stared
 upon the cloud and chariot as it went
 for speed to cynthia's car right well compared
 the other seeing his astonishment
 how he bewondered was and how he fared
 all suddenly by name the prince gan call
 by which awaked thus he spoke withal

 xviii
 "whoe'er thou art above all worldly wit
 that hast these high and wondrous marvels brought
 and know'st the deep intents which hidden sit
 in secret closet of man's private thought
 if in thy skilful heart this lot be writ
 to tell the event of things to end unbrought
 then say what issue and what ends the stars
 allot to asia's troubles broils and wars

 xix
 "but tell me first thy name and by what art
 thou dost these wonders strange above our skill
 for full of marvel is my troubled heart
 tell then and leave me not amazed still"
 the wizard smiled and answered "in some part
 easy it is to satisfy thy will
 ismen i hight called an enchanter great
 such skill have i in magic's secret feat

 xx
 "but that i should the sure events unfold
 of things to come or destinies foretell
 too rash is your desire your wish too bold
 to mortal heart such knowledge never fell
 our wit and strength on us bestowed i hold
 to shun the evils and harms mongst which we dwell
 they make their fortune who are stout and wise
 wit rules the heavens discretion guides the skies

 xxi
 "that puissant arm of thine that well can rend
 from godfrey's brow the new usurped crown
 and not alone protect save and defend
 from his fierce people this besieged town
 gainst fire and sword with strength and courage bend
 adventure suffer trust tread perils down
 and to content and to encourage thee
 know this which as i in a cloud foresee

 xxii
 "i guess before the overgliding sun
 shall many years mete out by weeks and days
 a prince that shall in fertile egypt won
 shall fill all asia with his prosperous frays
 i speak not of his acts in quiet done
 his policy his rule his wisdom's praise
 let this suffice by him these christians shall
 in fight subdued fly and conquered fall

 xxiii
 "and their great empire and usurped state
 shall overthrown in dust and ashes lie
 their woful remnant in an angle strait
 compassed with sea themselves shall fortify
 from thee shall spring this lord of war and fate"
 whereto great solyman gan thus reply
 "o happy man to so great praise ybore"
 thus he rejoiced but yet envied more

 xxiv
 and said "let chance with good or bad aspect
 upon me look as sacred heaven's decree
 this heart to her i never will subject
 nor ever conquered shall she look on me
 the moon her chariot shall awry direct
 ere from this course i will diverted be"
 while thus he spake it seemed he breathed fire
 so fierce his courage was so hot his ire

 xxv
 thus talked they till they arrived been
 nigh to the place where godfrey's tents were reared
 there was a woful spectacle yseen
 death in a thousand ugly forms appeared
 the soldan changed hue for grief and teen
 on that sad book his shame and loss he lead
 ah with what grief his men his friends he found
 and standards proud inglorious lie on ground

 xxvi
 and saw one visage of some wellknown friend
 in foul despite a rascal frenchman tread
 and there another ragged peasant rend
 the arms and garments from some champion dead
 and there with stately pomp by heaps they wend
 and christians slain roll up in webs of lead
 lastly the turks and slain arabians brought
 on heaps he saw them burn with fire to naught

 xxvii
 deeply he sighed and with naked sword
 out of the coach he leaped in the mire
 but ismen called again the angry lord
 and with grave words appeased his foolish ire
 the prince content remounted at his sword
 toward a hill on drove the aged sire
 and hasting forward up the bank they pass
 till far behind the christian leaguer was

 xxviii
 there they alight and took their way on foot
 the empty chariot vanished out of sight
 yet still the cloud environed them about
 at their left hand down went they from the height
 of sion's hill till they approached the route
 on that side where to west he looketh right
 there ismen stayed and his eyesight bent
 upon the bushy rocks and thither went

 xxix
 a hollow cave was in the craggy stone
 wrought out by hand a number years tofore
 and for of long that way had walked none
 the vault was hid with plants and bushes hoar
 the wizard stooping in thereat to gone
 the thorns aside and scratching brambles bore
 his right hand sought the passage through the cleft
 and for his guide he gave the prince his left

 xxx
 "what" quoth the soldan "by what privy mine
 what hidden vault behoves it me to creep
 this sword can find a better way than thine
 although our foes the passage guard and keep"
 "let not" quoth he "thy princely foot repine
 to tread this secret path though dark and deep
 for great king herod used to tread the same
 he that in arms had whilom so great fame

 xxxi
 "this passage made he when he would suppress
 his subjects' pride and them in bondage hold
 by this he could from that small forteress
 antonia called of antony the bold
 convey his folk unseen of more and less
 even to the middest of the temple old
 thence hither where these privy ways begin
 and bring unseen whole armies out and in

 xxxii
 "but now saye i in all this world lives none
 that knows the secret of this darksome place
 come then where aladine sits on his throne
 with lords and princes set about his grace
 he feareth more than fitteth such an one
 such signs of doubt show in his cheer and face
 fitly you come hear see and keep you still
 till time and season serve then speak your fill"

 xxxiii
 this said that narrow entrance passed the knight
 so creeps a camel through a needle's eye
 and through the ways as black as darkest night
 he followed him that did him rule and guie
 strait was the way at first withouten light
 but further in did further amplify
 so that upright walked at ease the men
 ere they had passed half that secret den

 xxxiv
 a privy door ismen unlocked at last
 and up they clomb a littleused stair
 thereat the day a feeble beam in cast
 dim was the light and nothing clear the air
 out of the hollow cave at length they passed
 into a goodly hall high broad and fair
 where crowned with gold and all in purple clad
 sate the sad king among his nobles sad

 xxxv
 the turk close in his hollow cloud imbarred
 unseen at will did all the prease behold
 these heavy speeches of the king he heard
 who thus from lofty siege his pleasure told
 "my lords last day our state was much impaired
 our friends were slain killed were our soldiers bold
 great helps and greater hopes are us bereft
 nor aught but aid from egypt land is left

 xxxvi
 "and well you see far distant is that aid
 upon our heels our danger treadeth still
 for your advice was this assembly made
 each what he thinketh speak and what he will"
 a whisper soft arose when this was said
 as gentle winds the groves with murmur fill
 but with bold face high looks and merry cheer
 argantes rose the rest their talk forbear

 xxxvii
 "o worthy sovereign" thus began to say
 the hardy young man to the tyrant wise
 "what words be these what fears do you dismay
 who knows not this you need not our advice
 but on your hand your hope of conquest lay
 and for no loss true virtue damnifies
 make her our shield pray her us succors give
 and without her let us not wish to live

 xxxviii
 "nor say i this for that i aught misdeem
 that egypt's promised succors fail us might
 doubtful of my great master's words to seem
 to me were neither lawful just nor right
 i speak these words for spurs i them esteem
 to waken up each dull and fearful sprite
 and make our hearts resolved to all assays
 to win with honor or to die with praise"

 xxxix
 thus much argantes said and said no more
 as if the case were clear of which he spoke
 orcano rose of princely stem ybore
 whose presence 'mongst them bore a mighty stroke
 a man esteemed well in arms of yore
 but now was coupled new in marriage yoke
 young babes he had to fight which made him loth
 he was a husband and a father both

 xl
 "my lord" quoth he "i will not reprehend
 the earnest zeal of this audacious speech
 from courage sprung which seld is close ypend
 in swelling stomach without violent breach
 and though to you our good circassian friend
 in terms too bold and fervent oft doth preach
 yet hold i that for good in warlike feat
 for his great deeds respond his speeches great

 xli
 "but if it you beseem whom graver age
 and long experience hath made wise and sly
 to rule the heat of youth and hardy rage
 which somewhat have misled this knight awry
 in equal balance ponder then and gauge
 your hopes far distant with your perils nigh
 this town's old walls and rampires new compare
 with godfrey's forces and his engines rare

 xlii
 "but if i may say what i think unblamed
 this town is strong by nature site and art
 but engines huge and instruments are framed
 gainst these defences by our adverse part
 who thinks him most secure is eathest shamed
 i hope the best yet fear unconstant mart
 and with this siege if we be long up pent
 famine i doubt our store will all be spent

 xliii
 "for all that store of cattle and of grain
 which yesterday within these walls you brought
 while your proud foes triumphant through the plain
 on naught but shedding blood and conquest thought
 too little is this city to sustain
 to raise the siege unless some means be sought
 and it must last till the prefixed hour
 that it be raised by egypt's aid and power

 xliv
 "but what if that appointed day they miss
 or else ere we expect what if they came
 the victory yet is not ours for this
 oh save this town from ruin us from shame
 with that same godfrey still our warfare is
 these armies soldiers captains are the same
 who have so oft amid the dusty plain
 turks persians syrians and arabians slain

 xlv
 "and thou argantes wotest what they be
 oft hast thou fled from that victorious host
 thy shoulders often hast thou let them see
 and in thy feet hath been thy safeguard most
 clorinda bright and i fled eke with thee
 none than his fellows had more cause to boast
 nor blame i any for in every fight
 we showed courage valor strength and might

 xlvi
 "and though this hardy knight the certain threat
 of nearapproaching death to hear disdain
 yet to this state of loss and danger great
 from this strong foe i see the tokens plain
 no fort how strong soe'er by art or seat
 can hinder godfrey why he should not reign
 this makes me sayto witness heaven i bring
 zeal to this state love to my lord and king

 xlvii
 "the king of tripoli was well advised
 to purchase peace and so preserve his crown
 but solyman who godfrey's love despised
 is either dead or deep in prison thrown
 else fearful is he run away disguised
 and scant his life is left him for his own
 and yet with gifts with tribute and with gold
 he might in peace his empire still have hold"

 xlviii
 thus spake orcanes and some inkling gave
 in doubtful words of that he would have said
 to sue for peace or yield himself a slave
 he durst not openly his king persuade
 but at those words the soldan gan to rave
 and gainst his will wrapt in the cloud he stayed
 whom ismen thus bespake "how can you bear
 these words my lord or these reproaches hear"

 xlix
 "oh let me speak" quoth he "with ire and scorn
 i burn and gains my will thus hid i stay"
 this said the smoky cloud was cleft and torn
 which like a veil upon them stretched lay
 and up to open heaven forthwith was borne
 and left the prince in view of lightsome day
 with princely look amid the press he shined
 and on a sudden thus declared his mind

 l
 "of whom you speak behold the soldan here
 neither afraid nor run away for dread
 and that these slanders lies and fables were
 this hand shall prove upon that coward's head
 i who have shed a sea of blood well near
 and heaped up mountains high of christians dead
 i in their camp who still maintained the fray
 my men all murdered i that run away

 li
 "if this or any coward vile beside
 false to his faith and country dares reply
 and speak of concord with yon men of pride
 by your good leave sir king here shall he die
 the lambs and wolves shall in one fold abide
 the doves and serpents in one nest shall lie
 before one town us and these christians shall
 in peace and love unite within one wall"

 lii
 while thus he spoke his broad and trenchant sword
 his hand held high aloft in threatening guise
 dumb stood the knights so dreadful was his word
 a storm was in his front fire in his eyes
 he turned at last to sion's aged lord
 and calmed his visage stern in humbler wise
 "behold" quoth he "good prince what aid i bring
 since solyman is joined with juda's king"

 liii
 king aladine from his rich throne upstart
 and said "oh how i joy thy face to view
 my noble friend it lesseneth in some part
 my grief for slaughter of my subjects true
 my weak estate to stablish come thou art
 and mayest thine own again in time renew
 if heavens consent" with that the soldan bold
 in dear embracements did he long enfold

 liv
 their greetings done the king resigned his throne
 to solyman and set himself beside
 in a rich seat adorned with gold and stone
 and ismen sage did at his elbow bide
 of whom he asked what way they two had gone
 and he declared all what had them betide
 clorinda bright to solyman addressed
 her salutations first then all the rest

 lv
 among them rose ormusses' valiant knight
 whom late the soldan with a convoy sent
 and when most hot and bloody was the fight
 by secret paths and blind byways he went
 till aided by the silence and the night
 safe in the city's walls himself he pent
 and there refreshed with corn and cattle store
 the pined soldiers famished nigh before

 lvi
 with surly countenance and disdainful grace
 sullen and sad sat the circassian stout
 like a fierce lion grumbling in his place
 his fiery eyes that turns and rolls about
 nor durst orcanes view the soldan's face
 but still upon the floor did pore and tout
 thus with his lords and peers in counselling
 the turkish monarch sat with juda's king

 lvii
 godfrey this while gave victory the rein
 and following her the straits he opened all
 then for his soldiers and his captains slain
 he celebrates a stately funeral
 and told his camp within a day or twain
 he would assault the city's mighty wall
 and all the heathen there enclosed doth threat
 with fire and sword with death and danger great

 lviii
 and for he had that noble squadron known
 in the last fight which brought him so great aid
 to be the lords and princes of his own
 who followed late the sly enticing maid
 and with them tancred who had late been thrown
 in prison deep by that false witch betrayed
 before the hermit and some private friends
 for all those worthies lords and knights he sends

 lix
 and thus he said "some one of you declare
 your fortunes whether good or to be blamed
 and to assist us with your valors rare
 in so great need how was your coming framed"
 they blush and on the ground amazed stare
 for virtue is of little guilt ashamed
 at last the english prince with countenance bold
 the silence broke and thus their errors told

 lx
 "we not elect to that exploit by lot
 with secret flight from hence ourselves withdrew
 following false cupid i deny it not
 enticed forth by love and beauty's hue
 a jealous fire burnt in our stomachs hot
 and by close ways we passed least in view
 her words her looks alas i know too late
 nursed our love our jealousy our hate

 lxi
 "at last we gan approach that woful clime
 where fire and brimstone down from heaven was sent
 to take revenge for sin and shameful crime
 gainst kind commit by those who nould repent
 a loathsome lake of brimstone pitch and lime
 o'ergoes that land erst sweet and redolent
 and when it moves thence stench and smoke up flies
 which dim the welkin and infect the skies

 lxii
 "this is the lake in which yet never might
 aught that hath weight sink to the bottom down
 but like to cork or leaves or feathers light
 stones iron men there fleet and never drown
 therein a castle stands to which by sight
 but o'er a narrow bridge no way is known
 hither us brought here welcomed us the witch
 the house within was stately pleasant rich

 lxiii
 "the heavens were clear and wholsome was the air
 high trees sweet meadows waters pure and good
 for there in thickest shade of myrtles fair
 a crystal spring poured out a silver flood
 amid the herbs the grass and flowers rare
 the falling leaves down pattered from the wood
 the birds sung hymns of love yet speak i naught
 of gold and marble rich and richly wrought

 lxiv
 "under the curtain of the greenwood shade
 beside the brook upon the velvet grass
 in massy vessel of pure silver made
 a banquet rich and costly furnished was
 all beasts all birds beguiled by fowler's trade
 all fish were there in floods or seas that pass
 all dainties made by art and at the table
 an hundred virgins served for husbands able

 lxv
 "she with sweet words and false enticing smiles
 infused love among the dainties set
 and with empoisoned cups our souls beguiles
 and made each knight himself and god forget
 she rose and turned again within short whiles
 with changed looks where wrath and anger met
 a charming rod a book with her she brings
 on which she mumbled strange and secret things

 lxvi
 "she read and change i felt my will and thought
 i longed to change my life and place of biding
 that virtue strange in me no pleasure wrought
 i leapt into the flood myself there hiding
 my legs and feet both into one were brought
 mine arms and hands into my shoulders sliding
 my skin was full of scales like shields of brass
 now made a fish where late a knight i was

 lxvii
 "the rest with me like shape like garments wore
 and dived with me in that quicksilver stream
 such mind to my remembrance then i bore
 as when on vain and foolish things men dream
 at last our shade it pleased her to restore
 then full of wonder and of fear we seem
 and with an ireful look the angry maid
 thus threatened us and made us thus afraid

 lxviii
 "'you see' quoth she 'my sacred might and skill
 how you are subject to my rule and power
 in endless thraldom damned if i will
 i can torment and keep you in this tower
 or make you birds or trees on craggy hill
 to bide the bitter blasts of storm and shower
 or harden you to rocks on mountains old
 or melt your flesh and bones to rivers cold

 lxix
 "'yet may you well avoid mine ire and wrath
 if to my will your yielding hearts you bend
 you must forsake your christendom and faith
 and gainst godfredo false my crown defend'
 we all refused for speedy death each prayeth
 save false rambaldo he became her friend
 we in a dungeon deep were helpless cast
 in misery and iron chained fast

 lxx
 "then for alone they say falls no mishap
 within short while prince tancred thither came
 and was unwares surprised in the trap
 but there short while we stayed the wily dame
 in other folds our mischiefs would upwrap
 from hidraort an hundred horsemen came
 whose guide a baron bold to egypt's king
 should us disarmed and bound in fetters bring

 lxxi
 "now on our way the way to death we ride
 but providence divine thus for us wrought
 rinaldo whose high virtue is his guide
 to great exploits exceeding human thought
 met us and all at once our guard defied
 and ere he left the fight to earth them brought
 and in their harness armed us in the place
 which late were ours before our late disgrace

 lxxii
 "i and all these the hardy champion knew
 we saw his valor and his voice we heard
 then is the rumor of his death untrue
 his life is safe good fortune long it guard
 three times the golden sun hath risen new
 since us he left and rode to antiochward
 but first his armors broken hacked and cleft
 unfit for service there he doft and left"

 lxxiii
 thus spake the briton prince with humble cheer
 the hermit sage to heaven cast up his eyne
 his color and his countenance changed were
 with heavenly grace his looks and visage shine
 ravished with zeal his soul approached near
 the seat of angels pure and saints divine
 and there he learned of things and haps to come
 to give foreknowledge true and certain doom

 lxxiv
 at last he spoke in more than human sound
 and told what things his wisdom great foresaw
 and at his thundering voice the folk around
 attentive stood with trembling and with awe
 "rinaldo lives" he said "the tokens found
 from women's craft their false beginnings draw
 he lives and heaven will long preserve his days
 to greater glory and to greater praise

 lxxv
 "these are but trifles yet though asia's kings
 shrink at his name and tremble at his view
 i well foresee he shall do greater things
 and wicked emperors conquer and subdue
 under the shadow of his eagle's wings
 shall holy church preserve her sacred crew
 from caesar's bird he shall the sable train
 pluck off and break her talons sharp in twain

 lxxvi
 "his children's children at his hardiness
 and great attempts shall take example fair
 from emperors unjust in all distress
 they shall defend the state of peter's chair
 to raise the humble up pride to suppress
 to help the innocents shall be their care
 this bird of east shall fly with conquest great
 as far as moon gives light or sun gives heat

 lxxvii
 "her eyes behold the truth and purest light
 and thunders down in peter's aid she brings
 and where for christ and christian faith men fight
 there forth she spreadeth her victorious wings
 this virtue nature gives her and this might
 then lure her home for on her presence hings
 the happy end of this great enterprise
 so heaven decrees and so command the skies"

 lxxviii
 these words of his of prince rinaldo's death
 out of their troubled hearts the fear had rased
 in all this joy yet godfrey smiled uneath
 in his wise thought such care and heed was placed
 but now from deeps of regions underneath
 night's veil arose and sun's bright lustre chased
 when all full sweetly in their cabins slept
 save he whose thoughts his eyes still open kept



 eleventh book

 the argument
 with grave procession songs and psalms devout
 heaven's sacred aid the christian lords invoke
 that done they scale the wall which kept them out
 the fort is almost won the gates nigh broke
 godfrey is wounded by clorinda stout
 and lost is that day's conquest by the stroke
 the angel cures him he returns to fight
 but lost his labor for day lost his light


 i
 the christian army's great and puissant guide
 to assault the town that all his thoughts had bent
 did ladders rams and engines huge provide
 when reverend peter to him gravely went
 and drawing him with sober grace aside
 with words severe thus told his high intent
 "right well my lord these earthly strengths you move
 but let us first begin from heaven above

 ii
 "with public prayer zeal and faith devout
 the aid assistance and the help obtain
 of all the blessed of the heavenly rout
 with whose support you conquest sure may gain
 first let the priests before thine armies stout
 with sacred hymns their holy voices strain
 and thou and all thy lords and peers with thee
 of godliness and faith examples be"

 iii
 thus spake the hermit grave in words severe
 godfrey allowed his counsel sage and wise
 "of christ the lord" quoth he "thou servant dear
 i yield to follow thy divine advice
 and while the princes i assemble here
 the great procession songs and sacrifice
 with bishop william thou and ademare
 with sacred and with solemn pomp prepare"

 iv
 next morn the bishops twain the heremite
 and all the clerks and priests of less estate
 did in the middest of the camp unite
 within a place for prayer consecrate
 each priest adorned was in a surplice white
 the bishops donned their albes and copes of state
 above their rochets buttoned fair before
 and mitres on their heads like crowns they wore

 v
 peter alone before spread to the wind
 the glorious sign of our salvation great
 with easy pace the choir come all behind
 and hymns and psalms in order true repeat
 with sweet respondence in harmonious kind
 their humble song the yielding air doth beat
 "lastly together went the reverend pair
 of prelates sage william and ademare

 vi
 the mighty duke came next as princes do
 without companion marching all alone
 the lords and captains then came two and two
 with easy pace thus ordered passing through
 the trench and rampire to the fields they gone
 no thundering drum no trumpet shrill they hear
 their godly music psalms and prayers were

 vii
 to thee o father son and sacred sprite
 one true eternal everlasting king
 to christ's dear mother mary vlrgin bright
 psalms of thanksgiving and of praise they sing
 to them that angels down from heaven to fight
 gainst the blasphemous beast and dragon bring
 to him also that of our saviour good
 washed the sacred font in jordan's flood

 viii
 him likewise they invoke called the rock
 whereon the lord they say his church did rear
 whose true successors close or else unlock
 the blessed gates of grace and mercy dear
 and all the elected twelve the chosen flock
 of his triumphant death who witness bear
 and them by torment slaughter fire and sword
 who martyrs died to confirm his word

 ix
 and them also whose books and writings tell
 what certain path to heavenly bliss us leads
 and hermits good and ancresses that dwell
 mewed up in walls and mumble on their beads
 and virgin nuns in close and private cell
 where but shrift fathers never mankind treads
 on these they called and on all the rout
 of angels martyrs and of saints devout

 x
 singing and saying thus the camp devout
 spread forth her zealous squadrons broad and wide'
 toward mount olivet went all this route
 so called of olive trees the hills which hide
 a mountain known by fame the world throughout
 which riseth on the city's eastern side
 from it divided by the valley green
 of josaphat that fills the space between

 xi
 hither the armies went and chanted shrill
 that all the deep and hollow dales resound
 from hollow mounts and caves in every hill
 a thousand echoes also sung around
 it seemed some clever that sung with art and skill
 dwelt in those savage dens and shady ground
 for oft resounds from the banks they hear
 the name of christ and of his mother dear

 xii
 upon the walls the pagans old and young
 stood hushed and still amated and amazed
 at their grave order and their humble song
 at their strange pomp and customs new they gazed
 but when the show they had beholden long
 an hideous yell the wicked miscreants raised
 that with vile blasphemies the mountain hoar
 the woods the waters and the valleys roar

 xiii
 but yet with sacred notes the hosts proceed
 though blasphemies they hear and cursed things
 so with apollo's harp pan tunes his reed
 so adders hiss where philomela sings
 nor flying darts nor stones the christians dreed
 nor arrows shot nor quarries cast from slings
 but with assured faith as dreading naught
 the holy work begun to end they brought

 xiv
 a table set they on the mountain's height
 to minister thereon the sacrament
 in golden candlesticks a hallowed light
 at either end of virgin wax there brent
 in costly vestments sacred william dight
 with fear and trembling to the altar went
 and prayer there and service loud begins
 both for his own and all the army's sins

 xv
 humbly they heard his words that stood him nigh
 the rest far off upon him bent their eyes
 but when he ended had the service high
 "you servants of the lord depart" he cries
 his hands he lifted then up to the sky
 and blessed all those warlike companies
 and they dismissed returned the way they came
 their order as before their pomp the same

 xvi
 within their camp arrived this voyage ended
 toward his tent the duke himself withdrew
 upon their guide by heaps the bands attended
 till his pavilion's stately door they view
 there to the lord his welfare they commended
 and with him left the worthies of the crew
 whom at a costly and rich feast he placed
 and with the highest room old raymond graced

 xvii
 now when the hungry knights sufficed are
 with meat with drink with spices of the best
 quoth he "when next you see the morning star
 to assault the town be ready all and prest
 tomorrow is a day of pains and war
 this of repose of quiet peace and rest
 go take your ease this evening and this night
 and make you strong against tomorrow's fight"

 xviii
 they took their leave and godfrey's heralds rode
 to intimate his will on every side
 and published it through all the lodgings broad
 that gainst the morn each should himself provide
 meanwhile they might their hearts of cares unload
 and rest their tired limbs that eveningtide
 thus fared they till night their eyes did close
 night friend to gentle rest and sweet repose

 xix
 with little sign as yet of springing day
 out peeped not well appeared the rising morn
 the plough yet tore not up the fertile lay
 nor to their feed the sheep from folds return
 the birds sate silent on the greenwood spray
 amid the groves unheard was hound and horn
 when trumpets shrill true signs of hardy fights
 called up to arms the soldiers called the knights

 xx
 "arm arm at once" an hundred squadrons cried
 and with their cry to arm them all begin
 godfrey arose that day he laid aside
 his hauberk strong he wonts to combat in
 and donned a breastplate fair of proof untried
 such one as footmen use light easy thin
 scantly the warlord thus clothed had his gromes
 when aged raymond to his presence comes

 xxi
 and furnished to us when he the man beheld
 by his attire his secret thought he guessed
 "where is" quoth he "your sure and trusty shield
 your helm your hauberk strong where all the rest
 why be you half disarmed why to the field
 approach you in these weak defences dressed
 i see this day you mean a course to run
 wherein may peril much small praise be won

 xxii
 "alas do you that idle prise expect
 to set first foot this conquered wall above
 of less account some knight thereto object
 whose loss so great and harmful cannot prove
 my lord your life with greater care protect
 and love yourself because all us you love
 your happy life is spirit soul and breath
 of all this camp preserve it then from death"

 xxiii
 to this he answered thus "you know" he said
 "in clarimont by mighty urban's hand
 when i was girded with this noble blade
 for christ's true faith to fight in every land
 to god even then a secret vow i made
 not as a captain here this day to stand
 and give directions but with shield and sword
 to fight to win or die for christ my lord

 xxiv
 "when all this camp in battle strong shall be
 ordained and ordered well disposed all
 and all things done which to the high degree
 and sacred place i hold belongen shall
 then reason is it nor dissuade thou me
 that i likewise assault this sacred wall
 lest from my vow to god late made i swerve
 he shall this life defend keep and preserve"

 xxv
 thus he concludes and every hardy knight
 his sample followed and his brethren twain
 the other princes put on harness light
 as footmen use but all the pagan train
 toward that side bent their defensive might
 which lies exposed to view of charles's wain
 and zephyrus' sweet blasts for on that part
 the town was weakest both by side and art

 xxvi
 on all parts else the fort was strong by site
 with mighty hills defenced from foreign rage
 and to this part the tyrant gan unite
 his subjects born and bands that serve for wage
 from this exploit he spared nor great nor lite
 the aged men and boys of tender age
 to fire of angry war still brought new fuel
 stones darts lime brimstone and bitumen cruel

 xxvii
 all full of arms and weapons was the wall
 under whose basis that fair plain doth run
 there stood the soldan like a giant tall
 so stood at rhodes the coloss of the sun
 waist high argantes showed himself withal
 at whose stern looks the french to quake begun
 clorinda on the corner tower alone
 in silver arms like rising cynthia shone

 xxviii
 her rattling quiver at her shoulders hung
 therein a flash of arrows feathered weel
 in her left hand her bow was bended strong
 therein a shaft headed with mortal steel
 so fit to shoot she singled forth among
 her foes who first her quarries' strength should feel
 so fit to shoot latona's daughter stood
 when niobe she killed and all her brood

 xxix
 the aged tyrant tottered on his feet
 from gate to gate from wall to wall he flew
 he comforts all his bands with speeches sweet
 and every fort and bastion doth review
 for every need prepared in every street
 new regiments he placed and weapons new
 the matrons grave within their temples high
 to idols false for succors call and cry

 xxx
 "o macon break in twain the steeled lance
 on wicked godfrey with thy righteous hands
 against thy name he doth his arm advance
 his rebel blood pour out upon these sands"
 these cries within his ears no enterance
 could find for naught he hears naught understands
 while thus the town for her defence ordains
 his armies godfrey ordereth on the plains

 xxxi
 his forces first on foot he forward brought
 with goodly order providence and art
 and gainst these towers which to assail he thought
 in battles twain his strength he doth depart
 between them crossbows stood and engines wrought
 to cast a stone a quarry or a dart
 from whence like thunder's dint or lightnings new
 against the bulwark stones and lances flew

 xxxii
 his men at arms did back his bands on foot
 the light horse ride far off and serve for wings
 he gave the sign so mighty was the rout
 of those that shot with bows and cast with slings
 such storms of shafts and stones flew all about
 that many a pagan proud to death it brings
 some died some at their loops durst scant outpeep
 some fled and left the place they took to keep

 xxxiii
 the hardy frenchmen full of heat and haste
 ran boldly forward to the ditches large
 and o'er their heads an iron pentice vast
 they built by joining many a shield and targe
 some with their engines ceaseless shot and cast
 and volleys huge of arrows sharp discharge
 upon the ditches some employed their pain
 to fill the moat and even it with the plain

 xxxiv
 with slime or mud the ditches were not soft
 but dry and sandy void of waters clear
 though large and deep the christians fill them oft
 with rubbish fagots stones and trees they bear
 adrastus first advanced his crest aloft
 and boldly gan a strong scalado rear
 and through the falling storm did upward climb
 of stones darts arrows fire pitch and lime

 xxxv
 the hardy switzer now so far was gone
 that half way up with mickle pain he got
 a thousand weapons he sustained alone
 and his audacious climbing ceased not
 at last upon him fell a mighty stone
 as from some engine great it had been shot
 it broke his helm he tumbled from the height
 the strong circassian cast that wondrous weight

 xxxvi
 not mortal was the blow yet with the fall
 on earth sore bruised the man lay in a swoon
 argantes gan with boasting words to call
 "who cometh next this first is tumbled down
 come hardy soldiers come assault this wall
 i will not shrink nor fly nor hide my crown
 if in your trench yourselves for dread you hold
 there shall you die like sheep killed in their fold"

 xxxvii
 thus boasted he but in their trenches deep
 the hidden squadrons kept themselves from scath
 the curtain made of shields did well off keep
 both darts and shot and scorned all their wrath
 but now the ram upon the rampiers steep
 on mighty beams his head advanced hath
 with dreadful horns of iron tough tree great
 the walls and bulwarks trembled at his threat

 xxxviii
 an hundred able men meanwhile let fall
 the weights behind the engine tumbled down
 and battered flat the battlements and wall
 so fell taigetus hill on sparta town
 it crushed the steeled shield in pieces small
 and beat the helmet to the wearers' crown
 and on the ruins of the walls and stones
 dispersed left their blood their brains and bones

 xxxix
 the fierce assailants kept no longer close
 undcr the shelter of their target fine
 but their bold fronts to chance of war expose
 and gainst those towers let their virtue shine
 the scaling ladders up to skies arose
 the groundworks deep some closely undermine
 the walls before the frenchmen shrink and shake
 and gaping sign of headlong falling make

 xl
 and fallen they had so far the strength extends
 of that fierce ram and his redoubted stroke
 but that the pagan's care the place defends
 and saved by warlike skill the wall nigh broke
 for to what part soe'er the engine bends
 their sacks of wool they place the blow to choke
 whose yielding breaks the strokes thereon which light
 so weakness oft subdues the greatest might

 xli
 while thus the worthies of the western crew
 maintained their brave assault and skirmish hot
 her mighty bow clorinda often drew
 and many a sharp and deadly arrow shot
 and from her bow no steeled shaft there flew
 but that some blood the cursed engine got
 blood of some valiant knight or man of fame
 for that proud shootress scorned weaker game

 xlii
 the first she hit among the christian peers
 was the bold son of england's noble king
 above the trench himself he scantly rears
 but she an arrow loosed from the string
 the wicked steel his gauntlet breaks and tears
 and through his right hand thrust the piercing sting
 disabled thus from fight he gan retire
 groaning for pain but fretting more for ire

 xliii
 lord stephen of amboise on the ditch's brim
 and on a ladder high clotharius died
 from back to breast an arrow pierced him
 the other was shot through from side to side
 then as he managed brave his courser trim
 on his left arm he hit the flemings' guide
 he stopped and from the wound the reed outtwined
 but left the iron in his flesh behind

 xliv
 as ademare stood to behold the fight
 high on the bank withdrawn to breathe a space
 a fatal shaft upon his forehead light
 his hand he lifted up to feel the place
 whereon a second arrow chanced right
 and nailed his hand unto his wounded face
 he fell and with his blood distained the land
 his holy blood shed by a virgin's hand

 xlv
 while palamede stood near the battlement
 despising perils all and all mishap
 and upward still his hardy footings bent
 on his right eye he caught a deadly clap
 through his right eye clorinda's seventh shaft went
 and in his neck broke forth a bloody gap
 he underneath that bulwark dying fell
 which late to scale and win he trusted well

 xlvi
 thus shot the maid the duke with hard assay
 and sharp assault meanwhile the town oppressed
 against that part which to his campward lay
 an engine huge and wondrous he addressed
 a tower of wood built for the town's decay
 as high as were the walls and bulwarks best
 a turret full of men and weapons pent
 and yet on wheels it rolled moved and went

 xlvii
 this rolling fort his nigh approaches made
 and darts and arrows spit against his foes
 as ships are wont in fight so it assayed
 with the strong wall to grapple and to close
 the pagans on each side the piece invade
 and all their force against this mass oppose
 sometimes the wheels sometimes the battlement
 with timber logs and stones they broke and rent

 xlviii
 so thick flew stones and darts that no man sees
 the azure heavens the sun his brightness lost
 the clouds of weapons like to swarms of bees
 move the air and there each other crossed
 and look how falling leaves drop down from trees
 when the moist sap is nipped with timely frost
 or apples in strong winds from branches fall
 the saracens so tumbled from the wall

 xlix
 for on their part the greatest slaughter light
 they had no shelter gainst so sharp a shower
 some left on live betook themselves to flight
 so feared they this deadly thundering tower
 but solyman stayed like a valiant knight
 and some with him that trusted in his power
 argantes with a long beech tree in hand
 ran thither this huge engine to withstand

 l
 with this he pushed the tower and back it drives
 the length of all his tree a wondrous way
 the hardy virgin by his side arrives
 to help argantes in this hard assay
 the band that used the ram this season strives
 to cut the cords wherein the woolpacks lay
 which done the sacks down in the trenches fall
 and to the battery naked left the wall

 li
 the tower above the ram beneath doth thunder
 what lime and stone such puissance could abide
 the wall began new bruised and crushed asunder
 her wounded lap to open broad and wide
 godfrey himself and his brought safely under
 the shattered wall where greatest breach he spied
 himself he saves behind his mighty targe
 a shield not used but in some desperate charge

 lii
 from hence he sees where solyman descends
 down to the threshold of the gaping breach
 and there it seems the mighty prince intends
 godfredo's hoped entrance to impeach
 argantes and with him the maid defends
 the walls above to which the tower doth reach
 his noble heart when godfrey this beheld
 with courage new with wrath and valor swelled

 liii
 he turned about and to good sigiere spake
 who bare his greatest shield and mighty bow
 "that sure and trusty target let me take
 impenetrable is that shield i know
 over these ruins will i passage make
 and enter first the way is eath and low
 and time requires that by some noble feat
 i should make known my strength and puissance great"

 liv
 he scant had spoken scant received the charge
 when on his leg a sudden shaft him hit
 and through that part a hole made wide and large
 where his strong sinews fastened were and knit
 clorinda thou this arrow didst discharge
 and let the pagans bless thy hand for it
 for by that shot thou savedst them that day
 from bondage vile from death and sure decay

 lv
 the wounded duke as though he felt no pain
 still forward went and mounted up the breach
 his high attempt at first he nould refrain
 and after called his lords with cheerful speech
 but when his leg could not his weight sustain
 he saw his will did far his power outreach
 and more he strove his grief increased the more
 the bold assault he left at length therefore

 lvi
 and with his hand he beckoned guelpho near
 and said "i must withdraw me to my tent
 my place and person in mine absence bear
 supply my want let not the fight relent
 i go and will ere long again be here
 i go and straight return" this said he went
 on a light steed he leaped and o'er the green
 he rode but rode not as he thought unseen

 lvii
 when godfrey parted parted eke the heart
 the strength and fortune of the christian bands
 courage increased in their adverse part
 wrath in their hearts and vigor in their hands
 valor success strength hardiness and art
 failed in the princes of the western lands
 their swords were blunt faint was their trumpet's blast
 their sun was set or else with clouds o'ercast

 lviii
 upon the bulwarks now appeared bold
 that fearful band that late for dread was fled
 the women that clorinda's strength behold
 their country's love to war encouraged
 they weapons got and fight like men they would
 their gowns tucked up their locks were loose and spread
 sharp darts they cast and without dread or fear
 exposed their breasts to save their fortress dear

 lix
 but that which most dismayed the christian knights
 and added courage to the pagans most
 was guelpho's sudden fall in all men's sights
 who tumbled headlong down his footing lost
 a mighty stone upon the worthy lights
 but whence it came none wist nor from what coast
 and with like blow which more their hearts dismayed
 beside him low in dust old raymond laid

 lx
 and eustace eke within the ditches large
 to narrow shifts and last extremes they drive
 upon their foes so fierce the pagans charge
 and with goodfortune so their blows they give
 that whom they hit in spite of helm or targe
 they deeply wound or else of life deprive
 at this their good success argantes proud
 waxing more fell thus roared and cried aloud

 lxi
 "this is not antioch nor the evening dark
 can help your privy sleights with friendly shade
 the sun yet shines your falsehood can we mark
 in other wise this bold assault is made
 of praise and glory quenched is the spark
 that made you first these eastern lands invade
 why cease you now why take you not this fort
 what are you weary for a charge so short"

 lxii
 thus raged he and in such hellish sort
 increased the fury in the brainsick knight
 that he esteemed that large and ample fort
 too strait a field wherein to prove his might
 there where the breach had framed a newmade port
 himself he placed with nimble skips and light
 he cleared the passage out and thus he cried
 to solyman that fought close by his side

 lxiii
 "come solyman the time and place behold
 that of our valors well may judge the doubt
 what sayest thou amongst these christians bold
 first leap he forth that holds himself most stout"
 while thus his will the mighty champion told
 both solyman and he at once leaped out
 fury the first provoked disdain the last
 who scorned the challenge ere his lips it passed

 lxiv
 upon their foes unlookedfor they flew
 each spited other for his virtue's sake
 so many soldiers this fierce couple slew
 so many shields they cleft and helms they break
 so many ladders to the earth they threw
 that well they seemed a mount thereof to make
 or else some vamure fit to save the town
 instead of that the christians late beat down

 lxv
 the folk that strove with rage and haste before
 who first the wall and rampire should ascend
 retire and for that honor strive no more
 scantly they could their limbs and lives defend
 they fled their engines lost the pagans tore
 in pieces small their rams to naught they rend
 and all unfit for further service make
 with so great force and rage their beams they brake

 lxvi
 the pagans ran transported with their ire
 now here now there and woful slaughters wrought
 at last they called for devouring fire
 two burning pines against the tower they brought
 so from the palace of their hellish sire
 when all this world they would consume to naught
 the fury sisters come with fire in hands
 shaking their snaky locks and sparkling brands

 lxvii
 but noble tancred who this while applied
 grave exhortations to his bold latines
 when of these knights the wondrous acts he spied
 and saw the champions with their burning pines
 he left his talk and thither forthwith hied
 to stop the rage of those fell saracines
 and with such force the fight he there renewed
 that now they fled and lost who late pursued

 lxviii
 thus changed the state and fortune of the fray
 meanwhile the wounded duke in grief and teen
 within his great pavilion rich and gay
 good sigiere and baldwin stood between
 his other friends whom his mishap dismay
 with grief and tears about assembled been
 he strove in haste the weapon out to wind
 and broke the reed but left the head behind

 lxix
 he bade them take the speediest way they might
 of that unlucky hurt to make him sound
 and to lay ope the depth thereof to sight
 he willed them open search and lance the wound
 "send me again" quoth he "to end this fight
 before the sun be sunken under ground"
 and leaning on a broken spear he thrust
 his leg straight out to him that cure it must

 lxx
 erotimus born on the banks of po
 was he that undertook to cure the knight
 all what green herbs or waters pure could do
 he knew their power their virtue and their might
 a noble poet was the man also
 but in this science had a more delight
 he could restore to health deathwounded men
 and make their names immortal with his pen

 lxxi
 the mighty duke yet never changed cheer
 but grieved to see his friends lamenting stand
 the leech prepared his cloths and cleansing gear
 and with a belt his gown about him band
 now with his herbs the steely head to tear
 out of the flesh he proved now with his hand
 now with his hand now with his instrument
 he shaked and plucked it yet not forth it went

 lxxii
 his labor vain his art prevailed naught
 his luck was ill although his skill were good
 to such extremes the wounded prince he brought
 that with fell pain he swooned as he stood
 but the angel pure that kept him went and sought
 divine dictamnum out of ida wood
 this herb is rough and bears a purple flower
 and in his budding leaves lies all his power

 lxxiii
 kind nature first upon the craggy clift
 bewrayed this herb unto the mountain goat
 that when her sides a cruel shaft hath rift
 with it she shakes the reed out of her coat
 this in a moment fetched the angel swift
 and brought from ida hill though far remote
 the juice whereof in a prepared bath
 unseen the blessed spirit poured hath

 lxxiv
 pure nectar from that spring of lydia than
 and panaces divine therein he threw
 the cunning leech to bathe the wound began
 and of itself the steely head outflew
 the bleeding stanched no vermile drop outran
 the leg again waxed strong with vigor new
 erotimus cried out "this hurt and wound
 no human art or hand so soon makes sound

 lxxv
 "some angel good i think come down from skies
 thy surgeon is for here plain tokens are
 of grace divine which to thy help applies
 thy weapon take and haste again to war"
 in precious cloths his leg the chieftain ties
 naught could the man from blood and fight debar
 a sturdy lance in his right hand he braced
 his shield he took and on his helmet laced

 lxxvi
 and with a thousand knights and barons bold
 toward the town he hasted from his camp
 in clouds of dust was titan's face enrolled
 trembled the earth whereon the worthies stamp
 his foes far off his dreadful looks behold
 which in their hearts of courage quenched the lamp
 a chilling fear ran cold through every vein
 lord godfrey shouted thrice and all his train

 lxxvii
 their sovereign's voice his hardy people knew
 and his loud cries that cheered each fearful heart
 thereat new strength they took and courage new
 and to the fierce assault again they start
 the pagans twain this while themselves withdrew
 within the breach to save that battered part
 and with great loss a skirmish hot they hold
 against tancredi and his squadron bold

 lxxviii
 thither came godfrey armed round about
 in trusty plate with fierce and dreadful look
 at first approach against argantes stout
 headed with poignant steel a lance he shook
 no casting engine with such force throws out
 a knotty spear and as the way it took
 it whistled in the air the fearless knight
 opposed his shield against that weapon's might

 lxxix
 the dreadful blow quite through his target drove
 and bored through his breastplate strong and thick
 the tender skin it in his bosom rove
 the purpleblood outstreamed from the quick
 to wrest it out the wounded pagan strove
 and little leisure gave it there to stick
 at godfrey's head the lance again he cast
 and said "lo there again thy dart thou hast"

 lxxx
 the spear flew back the way it lately came
 and would revenge the harm itself had done
 but missed the mark whereat the man did aim
 he stepped aside the furious blow to shun
 but sigiere in his throat received the same
 the murdering weapon at his neck outrun
 nor aught it grieved the man to lose his breath
 since in his prince's stead he suffered death

 lxxxi
 even then the soldan struck with monstrous main
 the noble leader of the norman band
 he reeled awhile and staggered with the pain
 and wheeling round fell grovelling on the sand
 godfrey no longer could the grief sustain
 of these displeasures but with flaming brand
 up to the breach in heat and haste he goes
 and hand to hand there combats with his foes

 lxxxii
 and there great wonders surely wrought he had
 mortal the fight and fierce had been the fray
 but that dark night from her pavilion sad
 her cloudy wings did on the earth display
 her quiet shades she interposed glad
 to cause the knights their arms aside to lay
 godfrey withdrew and to their tents they wend
 and thus this bloody day was brought to end

 lxxxiii
 the weak and wounded ere he left the field
 the godly duke to safety thence conveyed
 nor to his foes his engines would he yield
 in them his hope to win the fortress laid
 then to the tower he went and it beheeld
 the tower that late the pagan lords dismayed
 but now stood bruised broken cracked and shivered
 from some sharp storm as it were late delivered

 lxxxiv
 from dangers great escaped but late it was
 and now to safety brought wellnigh it seems
 but as a ship that under sail doth pass
 the roaring billows and the raging streams
 and drawing nigh the wished port alas
 breaks on some hidden rocks her ribs and beams
 or as a steed rough ways that well hath passed
 before his inn stumbleth and falls at last

 lxxxv
 such hap befell that tower for on that side
 gainst which the pagans' force and battery bend
 two wheels were broke whereon the piece should ride
 the maimed engine could no further wend
 the troop that guarded it that part provide
 to underprop with posts and it defend
 till carpenters and cunning workmen came
 whose skill should help and rear again the same

 lxxxvi
 thus godfrey bids and that ere springingday
 the cracks and bruises all amend they should
 each open passage and each privy way
 about the piece he kept with soldiers bold
 but the loud rumor both of that they say
 and that they do is heard within the hold
 a thousand lights about the tower they view
 and what they wrought all night both saw and knew



 twelfth book

 the argument
 clorinda hears her eunuch old report
 her birth her offspring and her native land
 disguised she fireth godfrey's rolling fort
 the burned piece falls smoking on the sand
 with tancred long unknown in desperate sort
 she fights and falls through pierced with his brand
 christened she dies with sighs with plaints and tears
 he wails her death argant revengement swears


 i
 now in dark night was all the world embarred
 but yet the tired armies took no rest
 the careful french kept heedful watch and ward
 while their high tower the workmen newly dressed
 the pagan crew to reinforce prepared
 the weakened bulwarks late to earth down kest
 their rampiers broke and bruised walls to mend
 lastly their hurts the wounded knights attend

 ii
 their wounds were dressed part of the work was brought
 to wished end part left to other days
 a dull desire to rest deep midnight wrought
 his heavy rod sleep on their eyelids lays
 yet rested not clorinda's working thought
 which thirsted still for fame and warlike praise
 argantes eke accompanied the maid
 from place to place which to herself thus said

 iii
 "this day argantes strong and solyman
 strange things have done and purchased great renown
 among our foes out of the walls they ran
 their rams they broke and rent their engines down
 i used my bow of naught else boast i can
 my self stood safe meanwhile within this town
 and happy was my shot and prosperous too
 but that was all a woman's hand could do

 iv
 "on birds and beasts in forests wild that feed
 it were more fit mine arrows to bestow
 than for a feeble maid in warlike deed
 with strong and hardy knights herself to show
 why take i not again my virgin's weed
 and spend my days in secret cell unknow"
 thus thought thus mused thus devised the maid
 and turning to the knight at last thus said

 v
 "my thoughts are full my lord of strange desire
 some high attempt of war to undertake
 whether high god my mind therewith inspire
 or of his will his god mankind doth make
 among our foes behold the light and fire
 i will among them wend and burn or break
 the tower god grant therein i have my will
 and that performed betide me good or ill

 vi
 "but if it fortune such my chance should be
 that to this town i never turn again
 mine eunuch whom i dearly love with thee
 i leave my faithful maids and all my train
 to egypt then conducted safely see
 those woful damsels and that aged swain
 help them my lord in that distressed case
 their feeble sex his age deserveth grace"

 vii
 argantes wondering stood and felt the effect
 of true renown pierce through his glorious mind
 "and wilt thou go" quoth he "and me neglect
 disgraced despised leave in this fort behind
 shall i while these strong walls my life protect
 behold thy flames and fires tossed in the wind
 no no thy fellow have i been in arms
 and will be still in praise in death in harms

 viii
 "this heart of mine death's bitter stroke despiseth
 for praise this life for glory take this breath"
 "my soul and more" quoth she "thy friendship prizeth
 for this thy proffered aid required uneath
 i but a woman am no loss ariseth
 to this besieged city by my death
 but if as god forbid this night thou fall
 ah who shall then who can defend this wall"

 ix
 "too late these 'scuses vain" the knight replied
 "you bring my will is firm my mind is set
 i follow you whereso you list me guide
 or go before if you my purpose let"
 this said they hasted to the palace wide
 about their prince where all his lords were met
 clorinda spoke for both and said "sir king
 attend my words hear and allow the thing

 x
 "argantes here this bold and hardy knight
 will undertake to burn the wondrous tower
 and i with him only we stay till night
 bury in sleep our foes at deadest hour"
 the king with that cast up his hands on height
 the tears for joy upon his cheeks down pour
 "praised" quoth he "be macon whom we serve
 this land i see he keeps and will preserve

 xi
 "nor shall so soon this shaken kingdom fall
 while such unconquered hearts my state defend
 but for this act what praise or guerdon shall
 i give your virtues which so far extend
 let fame your praises sound through nations all
 and fill the world therewith to either end
 take half my wealth and kingdom for your meed
 you are rewarded half even with the deed"

 xii
 thus spake the prince and gently 'gan distrain
 now him now her between his friendly arms
 the soldan by no longer could refrain
 that noble envy which his bosom warms
 "nor i" quoth he "bear this broad sword in vain
 nor yet am unexpert in night alarms
 take me with you ah" quoth clorinda "no
 whom leave we here of prowess if you go"

 xiii
 this spoken ready with a proud refuse
 argantes was his proffered aid to scorn
 whom aladine prevents and with excuse
 to solyman thus gan his speeches torn
 "right noble prince as aye hath been your use
 your self so still you bear and long have borne
 bold in all acts no danger can affright
 your heart nor tired is your strength with fight

 xiv
 "if you went forth great things perform you would
 in my conceit yet far unfit it seems
 that you who most excel in courage bold
 at once should leave this town in these extremes
 nor would i that these twain should leave this hold
 my heart their noble lives far worthier deems
 if this attempt of less importance were
 or weaker posts so great a weight could bear

 xv
 "but for wellguarded is the mighty tower
 with hardy troops and squadrons round about
 and cannot harmed be with little power
 nor fit the time to send whole armies out
 this pair who passed have many a dreadful stowre
 and proffer now to prove this venture stout
 alone to this attempt let them go forth
 alone than thousands of more price and worth

 xvi
 "thou as it best beseems a mighty king
 with ready bands besides the gate attend
 that when this couple have performed the thing
 and shall again their footsteps homeward bend
 from their strong foes upon them following
 thou may'st them keep preserve save and defend"
 thus said the king "the soldan must consent"
 silent remained the turk and discontent

 xvii
 then ismen said "you twain that undertake
 this hard attempt awhile i pray you stay
 till i a wildfire of fine temper make
 that this great engine burn to ashes may
 haply the guard that now doth watch and wake
 will then lie tumbled sleeping on the lay"
 thus they conclude and in their chambers sit
 to wait the time for this adventure fit

 xviii
 clorinda there her silver arms off rent
 her helm her shield her hauberk shining bright
 an armor black as jet or coal she hent
 wherein withouten plume herself she dight
 for thus disguised amid her foes she meant
 to pass unseen by help of friendly night
 to whom her eunuch old arsetes came
 that from her cradle nursed and kept the dame

 xix
 this aged sire had followed far and near
 through lands and seas the strong and hardy maid
 he saw her leave her arms and wonted gear
 her danger nigh that sudden change foresaid
 by his white locks from black that changed were
 in following her the woful man her prayed
 by all his service and his taken pain
 to leave that fond attempt but prayed in vain

 xx
 "at last" quoth he "since hardened to thine ill
 thy cruel heart is to thy loss prepared
 that my weak age nor tears that down distil
 not humble suit nor plaint thou list regard
 attend awhile strange things unfold i will
 hear both thy birth and high estate declared
 follow my counsel or thy will that done"
 she sat to hear the eunuch thus begun

 xxi
 "senapus ruled and yet perchance doth reign
 in mighty ethiop and her deserts waste
 the lore of christ both he and all his train
 of people black hath kept and long embraced
 to him a pagan was i sold for gain
 and with his queen as her chief eunuch placed
 black was this queen as jet yet on her eyes
 sweet loveliness in black attired lies

 xxii
 "the fire of love and frost of jealousy
 her husband's troubled soul alike torment
 the tide of fond suspicion flowed high
 the foe to love and plague to sweet content
 he mewed her up from sight of mortal eye
 nor day he would his beams on her had bent
 she wise and lowly by her husband's pleasure
 her joy her peace her will her wish did measure

 xxiii
 "her prison was a chamber painted round
 with goodly portraits and with stories old
 as white as snow there stood a virgin bound
 besides a dragon fierce a champion bold
 the monster did with poignant spear through wound
 the gored beast lay dead upon the mould
 the gentle queen before this image laid
 she plained she mourned she wept she sighed she prayed

 xxiv
 "at last with child she proved and forth she brought
 and thou art she a daughter fair and bright
 in her thy color white new terror wrought
 she wondered on thy face with strange affright
 but yet she purposed in her fearful thought
 to hide thee from the king thy father's sight
 lest thy bright hue should his suspect approve
 for seld a crow begets a silver dove

 xxv
 "and to her spouse to show she was disposed
 a negro's babe late born in room of thee
 and for the tower wherein she lay enclosed
 was with her damsels only wond and me
 to me on whose true faith she most reposed
 she gave thee ere thou couldest christened be
 nor could i since find means thee to baptize
 in pagan lands thou knowest it's not the guise

 xxvi
 "to me she gave thee and she wept withal
 to foster thee in some far distant place
 who can her griefs and plaints to reckoning call
 how oft she swooned at the last embrace
 her streaming tears amid her kisses fall
 her sighs her dire complaints did interlace
 and looking up at last 'o god' quoth she
 'who dost my heart and inward mourning see

 xxvii
 "'if mind and body spotless to this day
 if i have kept my bed still undefiled
 not for myself a sinful wretch i pray
 that in thy presence am an abject vilde
 preserve this babe whose mother must denay
 to nourish it preserve this harmless child
 oh let it live and chaste like me it make
 but for good fortune elsewhere sample take

 xxviii
 "'thou heavenly soldier which delivered hast
 that sacred virgin from the serpent old
 if on thine altars i have offerings placed
 and sacrificed myrrh frankincense and gold
 on this poor child thy heavenly looks down cast
 with gracious eye this silly babe behold'
 this said her strength and living sprite was fled
 she sighed she groaned she swooned in her bed

 xxix
 "weeping i took thee in a little chest
 covered with herbs and leaves i brought thee out
 so secretly that none of all the rest
 of such an act suspicion had or doubt
 to wilderness my steps i first addressed
 where horrid shades enclosed me round about
 a tigress there i met in whose fierce eyes
 fury and wrath rage death and terror lies

 xxx
 "up to a tree i leaped and on the grass
 such was my sudden fear i left thee lying
 to thee the beast with furious course did pass
 with curious looks upon thy visage prying
 all suddenly both meek and mild she was
 with friendly cheer thy tender body eying
 at last she licked thee and with gesture mild
 about thee played and thou upon her smiled

 xxxi
 "her fearful muzzle full of dreadful threat
 in thy weak hand thou took'st withouten dread
 the gentle beast with milkoutstretched teat
 as nurses' custom proffered thee to feed
 as one that wondereth on some marvel great
 i stood this while amazed at the deed
 when thee she saw well filled and satisfied
 unto the woods again the tigress hied

 xxxii
 "she gone down from the tree i came in haste
 and took thee up and on my journey wend
 within a little thorp i stayed at last
 and to a nurse the charge of thee commend
 and sporting with thee there long time i passed
 till term of sixteen months were brought to end
 and thou begun as little children do
 with half clipped words to prattle and to go

 xxxiii
 "but having passed the august of mine age
 when more than half my tap of life was run
 rich by rewards given by your mother sage
 for merits past and service yet undone
 i longed to leave this wandering pilgrimage
 and in my native soil again to won
 to get some seely home i had desire
 loth still to warm me at another's fire

 xxxiv
 "to egyptward where i was born i went
 and bore thee with me by a rolling flood
 till i with savage thieves wellnigh was hent
 before the brook the thieves behind me stood
 thee to forsake i never could consent
 and gladly would i 'scape those outlaws wood
 into the flood i leaped far from the brim
 my left hand bore thee with the right i swim

 xxxv
 "swift was the current in the middle stream
 a whirlpool gaped with devouring jaws
 the gulf on such mishap ere i could dream
 into his deep abyss my carcass draws
 there i forsook thee the wild waters seem
 to pity thee a gentle wind there blows
 whose friendly puffs safe to the shore thee drive
 where wet and weary i at last arrive

 xxxvi
 "i took thee up and in my dream that night
 when buried was the world in sleep and shade
 i saw a champion clad in armor bright
 that o'er my head shaked a flaming blade
 he said 'i charge thee execute aright
 that charge this infant's mother on thee laid
 baptize the child high heaven esteems her dear
 and i her keeper will attend her near

 xxxvii
 "'i will her keep defend save and protect
 i made the waters mild the tigress tame
 o wretch that heavenly warnings dost reject'
 the warrior vanished having said the same
 i rose and journeyed on my way direct
 when blushing morn from tithon's bed forth came
 but for my faith is true and sure i ween
 and dreams are false you still unchristened been

 xxxviii
 "a pagan therefore thee i fostered have
 nor of thy birth the truth did ever tell
 since you increased are in courage brave
 your sex and nature'sself you both excel
 full many a realm have you made bond and slave
 your fortunes last yourself remember well
 and how in peace and war in joy and teen
 i have your servant and your tutor been

 xxxix
 "last morn from skies ere stars exiled were
 in deep and deathlike sleep my senses drowned
 the selfsame vision did again appear
 with stormy wrathful looks and thundering sound
 'villain' quoth he 'within short while thy dear
 must change her life and leave this sinful ground
 thine be the loss the torment and the care'
 this said he fled through skies through clouds and air

 xl
 "hear then my joy my hope my darling hear
 high heaven some dire misfortune threatened hath
 displeased pardie because i did thee lere
 a lore repugnant to thy parents' faith
 ah for my sake this bold attempt forbear
 put off these sable arms appease thy wrath"
 this said he wept she pensive stood and sad
 because like dream herself but lately had

 xli
 with cheerful smile she answered him at last
 "i will this faith observe it seems me true
 which from my cradle age thou taught me hast
 i will not change it for religion new
 nor with vain shows of fear and dread aghast
 this enterprise forbear i to pursue
 no not if death in his most dreadful face
 wherewith he scareth mankind kept the place"

 xlii
 approachen gan the time while thus she spake
 wherein they ought that dreadful hazard try
 she to argantes went who should partake
 of her renown and praise or with her die
 ismen with words more hasty still did make
 their virtue great which by itself did fly
 two balls he gave them made of hollow brass
 wherein enclosed fire pitch and brimstone was

 xliii
 and forth they went and over dale and hill
 they hasted forward with a speedy pace
 unseen unmarked undescried until
 beside the engine close themselves they place
 new courage there their swelling hearts did fill
 rage in their breasts fury shown in their face
 they yearned to blow the fire and draw the sword
 the watch descried them both and gave the word

 xliv
 silent they passed on the watch begun
 to rear a huge alarm with hideous cries
 therewith the hardy couple forward run
 to execute their valiant enterprise
 so from a cannon or a roaring gun
 at once the noise the flame and bullet flies
 they run they give the charge begin the fray
 and all at once their foes break spoil and slay

 xlv
 they passed first through thousand thousand blows
 and then performed their designment bold
 a fiery ball each on the engine throws
 the stuff was dry the fire took quickly hold
 furious upon the timberwork it grows
 how it increased cannot well be told
 how it crept up the piece and how to skies
 the burning sparks and towering smoke upflies

 xlvi
 a mass of solid fire burning bright
 rolled up in smouldering fumes there bursteth out
 and there the blustering winds add strength and might
 and gather close the sparsed flames about
 the frenchmen trembled at the dreadful light
 to arms in haste and fear ran all the rout
 down fell the piece dreaded so much in war
 thus what long days do make one hour doth mar

 xlvii
 two christian bands this while came to the place
 with speedy haste where they beheld the fire
 argantes to them cried with scornful grace
 "your blood shall quench these flames and quench mine ire"
 this said the maid and he with sober pace
 drew back and to the banks themselves retire
 faster than brooks which falling showers increase
 their foes augment and faster on them press

 xlviii
 the gilden port was opened and forth stepped
 with all his soldiers bold the turkish king
 ready to aid the two his force he kept
 when fortune should them home with conquest bring
 over the bars the hardy couple leapt
 and after them a band of christians fling
 whom solyman drove back with courage stout
 and shut the gate but shut clorinda out

 xlix
 alone was she shut forth for in that hour
 wherein they closed the port the virgin went
 and full of heat and wrath her strength and power
 gainst arimon that struck her erst she bent
 she slew the knight nor argant in that stowre
 wist of her parting or her fierce intent
 the fight the press the night and darksome skies
 care from his heart had ta'en sight from his eyes

 l
 but when appeased was her angry mood
 her fury calmed and settled was her head
 she saw the gates were shut and how she stood
 amid her foes she held herself for dead
 while none her marked at last she thought it good
 to save her life some other path to tread
 she feigned her one of them and close her drew
 amid the press that none her saw or knew

 li
 then as a wolf guilty of some misdeed
 flies to some grove to hide himself from view
 so favored with the night with secret speed
 dissevered from the press the damsel flew
 tancred alone of her escape took heed
 he on that quarter was arrived new
 when arimon she killed he thither came
 he saw it marked it and pursued the dame

 lii
 he deemed she was some man of mickle might
 and on her person would he worship win
 over the hills the nymph her journey dight
 toward another port there to get in
 with hideous noise fast after spurred the knight
 she heard and stayed and thus her words begin
 "what haste hast thou ride softly take thy breath
 what bringest thou" he answered "war and death"

 liii
 "and war and death" quoth she "here mayest thou get
 if thou for battle come" with that she stayed
 tancred to ground his foot in haste down set
 and left his steed on foot he saw the maid
 their courage hot their ire and wrath they whet
 and either champion drew a trenchant blade
 together ran they and together stroke
 like two fierce bulls whom rage and love provoke

 liv
 worthy of royal lists and brightest day
 worthy a golden trump and laurel crown
 the actions were and wonders of that fray
 which sable knight did in dark bosom drown
 yet night consent that i their acts display
 and make their deeds to future ages known
 and in records of long enduring story
 enrol their praise their fame their worth and glory

 lv
 they neither shrunk nor vantage sought of ground
 they traverse not nor skipped from part to part
 their blows were neither false nor feigned found
 the night their rage would let them use no art
 their swords together clash with dreadful sound
 their feet stand fast and neither stir nor start
 they move their hands steadfast their feet remain
 nor blow nor loin they struck or thrust in vain

 lvi
 shame bred desire a sharp revenge to take
 and vengeance taken gave new cause of shame
 so that with haste and little heed they strake
 fuel enough they had to feed the flame
 at last so close their battle fierce they make
 they could not wield their swords so nigh they came
 they used the hilts and each on other rushed
 and helm to helm and shield to shield they crushed

 lvii
 thrice his strong arms he folds about her waist
 and thrice was forced to let the virgin go
 for she disdained to be so embraced
 no lover would have strained his mistress so
 they took their swords again and each enchased
 deep wounds in the soft flesh of his strong foe
 till weak and weary faint alive uneath
 they both retired at once at once took breath

 lviii
 each other long beheld and leaning stood
 upon their swords whose points in earth were pight
 when daybreak rising from the eastern flood
 put forth the thousand eyes of blindfold night
 tancred beheld his foe's outstreaming blood
 and gaping wounds and waxed proud with the sight
 oh vanity of man's unstable mind
 puffed up with every blast of friendly wind

 lix
 why joy'st thou wretch oh what shall be thy gain
 what trophy for this conquest is't thou rears
 thine eyes shall shed in case thou be not slain
 for every drop of blood a sea of tears
 the bleeding warriors leaning thus remain
 each one to speak one word long time forbears
 tancred the silence broke at last and said
 for he would know with whom this fight he made

 lx
 "evil is our chance and hard our fortune is
 who here in silence and in shade debate
 where light of sun and witness all we miss
 that should our prowess and our praise dilate
 if words in arms find place yet grant me this
 tell me thy name thy country and estate
 that i may know this dangerous combat done
 whom i have conquered or who hath me won"

 lxi
 "what i nill tell you ask" quoth she "in vain
 nor moved by prayer nor constrained by power
 but thus much know i am one of those twain
 which late with kindled fire destroyed the tower"
 tancred at her proud words swelled with disdain
 "that hast thou said" quoth he "in evil hour
 thy vaunting speeches and thy silence both
 uncivil wretch hath made my heart more wroth"

 lxii
 ire in their chafed breasts renewed the fray
 fierce was the fight though feeble were their might
 their strength was gone their cunning was away
 and fury in their stead maintained the fight
 their swords both points and edges sharp embay
 in purple blood whereso they hit or light
 and if weak life yet in their bosoms lie
 they lived because they both disdained to die

 lxiii
 as aegean seas when storms be calmed again
 that rolled their tumbling waves with troublous blasts
 do yet of tempests past some shows retain
 and here and there their swelling billows casts
 so though their strength were gone and might were vain
 of their first fierceness still the fury lasts
 wherewith sustained they to their tackling stood
 and heaped wound on wound and blood on blood

 lxiv
 but now alas the fatal hour arrives
 that her sweet life must leave that tender hold
 his sword into her bosom deep he drives
 and bathed in lukewarm blood his iron cold
 between her breasts the cruel weapon rives
 her curious square embossed with swelling gold
 her knees grow weak the pains of death she feels
 and like a falling cedar bends and reels

 lxv
 the prince his hand upon her shield doth stretch
 and low on earth the wounded damsel layeth
 and while she fell with weak and woful speech
 her prayers last and last complaints she sayeth
 a spirit new did her those prayers teach
 spirit of hope of charity and faith
 and though her life to christ rebellious were
 yet died she his child and handmaid dear

 lxvi
 "friend thou hast won i pardon thee nor save
 this body that all torments can endure
 but save my soul baptism i dying crave
 come wash away my sins with waters pure"
 his heart relenting nigh in sunder rave
 with woful speech of that sweet creature
 so that his rage his wrath and anger died
 and on his cheeks salt tears for ruth down slide

 lxvii
 with murmur loud down from the mountain's side
 a little runnel tumbled near the place
 thither he ran and filled his helmet wide
 and quick returned to do that work of grace
 with trembling hands her beaver he untied
 which done he saw and seeing knew her face
 and lost therewith his speech and moving quite
 oh woful knowledge ah unhappy sight

 lxviii
 he died not but all his strength unites
 and to his virtues gave his heart in guard
 bridling his grief with water he requites
 the life that he bereft with iron hard
 and while the sacred words the knight recites
 the nymph to heaven with joy herself prepared
 and as her life decays her joys increase
 she smiled and said "farewell i die in peace"

 lxix
 as violets blue mongst lilies pure men throw
 so paleness midst her native white begun
 her looks to heaven she cast their eyes i trow
 downward for pity bent both heaven and sun
 her naked hand she gave the knight in show
 of love and peace her speech alas was done
 and thus the virgin fell on endless sleep
 love beauty virtue for your darling weep

 lxx
 but when he saw her gentle soul was went
 his manly courage to relent began
 grief sorrow anguish sadness discontent
 free empire got and lordship on the man
 his life within his heart they close up pent
 death through his senses and his visage ran
 like his dead lady dead seemed tancred good
 in paleness stillness wounds and streams of blood

 lxxi
 and his weak sprite to be unbodied
 from fleshly prison free that ceaseless strived
 had followed her fair soul but lately fled
 had not a christian squadron there arrived
 to seek fresh water thither haply led
 and found the princess dead and him deprived
 of signs of life yet did the knight remain
 on live nigh dead for her himself had slain

 lxxii
 their guide far off the prince knew by his shield
 and thither hasted full of grief and fear
 her dead him seeming so he there beheld
 and for that strange mishap shed many a tear
 he would not leave the corpses fair in field
 for food to wolves though she a pagan were
 but in their arms the soldiers both uphent
 and both lamenting brought to tancred's tent

 lxxiii
 with those dear burdens to their camp they pass
 yet would not that dead seeming knight awake
 at last he deeply groaned which token was
 his feeble soul had not her flight yet take
 the other lay a still and heavy mass
 her spirit had that earthen cage forsake
 thus were they brought and thus they placed were
 in sundry rooms yet both adjoining near

 lxxiv
 all skill and art his careful servants used
 to life again their dying lord to bring
 at last his eyes unclosed with tears suffused
 he felt their hands and heard their whispering
 but how he thither came long time he mused
 his mind astonished was with everything
 he gazed about his squires in fine he knew
 then weak and woful thus his plaints out threw

 lxxv
 "what live i yet and do i breathe and see
 of this accursed day the hateful light
 this spiteful ray which still upbraideth me
 with that accursed deed i did this night
 ah coward hand afraid why should'st thou be
 thou instrument of death shame and despite
 why should'st thou fear with sharp and trenchant knife
 to cut the thread of this bloodguilty life

 lxxvi
 "pierce through this bosom and my cruel heart
 in pieces cleave break every string and vein
 but thou to slaughters vile which used art
 think'st it were pity so to ease my pain
 of luckless love therefore in torments' smart
 a sad example must i still remain
 a woful monster of unhappy love
 who still must live lest death his comfort prove

 lxxvii
 "still must i live in anguish grief and care
 furies my guilty conscience that torment
 the ugly shades dark night and troubled air
 in grisly forms her slaughter still present
 madness and death about my bed repair
 hell gapeth wide to swallow up this tent
 swift from myself i run myself i fear
 yet still my hell within myself i bear

 lxxviii
 "but where alas where be those relics sweet
 wherein dwelt late all love all joy all good
 my fury left them cast in open street
 some beast hath torn her flesh and licked her blood
 ah noble prey for savage beast unmeet
 ah sweet too sweet and far too precious food
 ah seely nymph whom night and darksome shade
 to beasts and me far worse than beasts betrayed

 lxxix
 "but where you be if still you be i wend
 to gather up those relics dear at least
 but if some beast hath from the hills descend
 and on her tender bowels made his feast
 let that fell monster me in pieces rend
 and deep entomb me in his hollow chest
 for where she buried is there shall i have
 a stately tomb a rich and costly grave"

 lxxx
 thus mourned the knight his squires him told at last
 they had her there for whom those tears he shed
 a beam of comfort his dim eyes outcast
 like lightning through thick clouds of darkness spread
 the heavy burden of his limbs in haste
 with mickle pain he drew forth of his bed
 and scant of strength to stand to move or go
 thither he staggered reeling to and fro

 lxxxi
 when he came there and in her breast espied
 his handiwork that deep and cruel wound
 and her sweet face with leaden paleness dyed
 where beauty late spread forth her beams around
 he trembled so that nere his squires beside
 to hold him up he had sunk down to ground
 and said "o face in death still sweet and fair
 thou canst not sweeten yet my grief and care

 lxxxii
 "o fair right hand the pledge of faith and love
 given me but late too late in sign of peace
 how haps it now thou canst not stir nor move
 and you dear limbs now laid in rest and ease
 through which my cruel blade this floodgate rove
 your pains have end my torments never cease
 o hands o cruel eyes accursed alike
 you gave the wound you gave them light to strike

 lxxxiii
 "but thither now run forth my guilty blood
 whither my plaints my sorrows cannot wend"
 he said no more but as his passion wood
 inforced him he gan to tear and rend
 his hair his face his wounds a purple flood
 did from each side in rolling streams descend
 he had been slain but that his pain and woe
 bereft his senses and preserved him so

 lxxxiv
 cast on his bed his squires recalled his sprite
 to execute again her hateful charge
 but tattling fame the sorrows of the knight
 and hard mischance had told this while at large
 godfrey and all his lords of worth and might
 ran thither and the duty would discharge
 of friendship true and with sweet words the rage
 of bitter grief and woe they would assuage

 lxxxv
 but as a mortal wound the more doth smart
 the more it searched is handled or sought
 so their sweet words to his afflicted heart
 more grief more anguish pain and torment brought
 but reverend peter that would set apart
 care of his sheep as a good shepherd ought
 his vanity with grave advice reproved
 and told what mourning christian knights behoved

 lxxxvi
 "o tancred tancred how far different
 from thy beginnings good these follies be
 what makes thee deaf what hath thy eyesight blent
 what mist what cloud thus overshadeth thee
 this is a warning good from heaven down sent
 yet his advice thou canst not hear nor see
 who calleth and conducts thee to the way
 from which thou willing dost and witting stray

 lxxxvii
 "to worthy actions and achievements fit
 for christian knights he would thee home recall
 but thou hast left that course and changed it
 to make thyself a heathen damsel's thrall
 but see thy grief and sorrow's painful fit
 is made the rod to scourge thy sins withal
 of thine own good thyself the means he makes
 but thou his mercy goodness grace forsakes

 lxxxviii
 "thou dost refuse of heaven the proffered
 and gainst it still rebel with sinful ire
 oh wretch oh whither doth thy rage thee chase
 refrain thy grief bridle thy fond desire
 at hell's wide gate vain sorrow doth thee place
 sorrow misfortune's son despair's foul fire
 oh see thine evil thy plaint and woe refrain
 the guides to death to hell and endless pain"

 lxxxix
 this said his will to die the patient
 abandoned that second death he feared
 these words of comfort to his heart down went
 and that dark night of sorrow somewhat cleared
 yet now and then his grief deep sighs forth sent
 his voice shrill plaints and sad laments oft reared
 now to himself now to his murdered love
 he spoke who heard perchance from heaven above

 xc
 till phoebus' rising from his evening fall
 to her for her he mourns he calls he cries
 the nightingale so when her children small
 some churl takes before their parents' eyes
 alone dismayed quite bare of comforts all
 tires with complaints the seas the shores the skies
 till in sweet sleep against the morning bright
 she fall at last so mourned so slept the knight

 xci
 and clad in starry veil amid his dream
 for whose sweet sake he mourned appeared the maid
 fairer than erst yet with that heavenly beam
 not out of knowledge was her lovely shade
 with looks of ruth her eyes celestial seem
 to pity his sad plight and thus she said
 "behold how fair how glad thy love appears
 and for my sake my dear forbear these tears

 xcii
 "thine be the thanks my soul thou madest flit
 at unawares out of her earthly nest
 thine be the thanks thou hast advanced it
 in abraham's dear bosom long to rest
 there still i love thee there for tancred fit
 a seat prepared is among the blest
 there in eternal joy eternal light
 thou shalt thy love enjoy and she her knight

 xciii
 "unless thyself thyself heaven's joys envy
 and thy vain sorrow thee of bliss deprive
 live know i love thee that i nill deny
 as angels men as saints may wights on live"
 this said of zeal and love forth of her eye
 an hundred glorious beams bright shining drive
 amid which rays herself she closed from sigh
 and with new joy new comfort left her knight

 xciv
 thus comforted he waked and men discreet
 in surgery to cure his wounds were sought
 meanwhile of his dear love the relics sweet
 as best he could to grave with pomp he brought
 her tomb was not of varied spartan greet
 nor yet by cunning hand of scopas wrought
 but built of polished stone and thereon laid
 the lively shape and portrait of the maid

 xcv
 with sacred burning lamps in order long
 and mournful pomp the corpse was brought to ground
 her arms upon a leafless pine were hung
 the hearse with cypress arms with laurel crowned
 next day the prince whose love and courage strong
 drew forth his limbs weak feeble and unsound
 to visit went with care and reverence meet
 the buried ashes of his mistress sweet

 xcvi
 before her newmade tomb at last arrived
 the woful prison of his living sprite
 pale cold sad comfortless of sense deprived
 upon the marble gray he fixed his sight
 two streams of tears were from his eyes derived
 thus with a sad "alas" began the knight
 "o marble dear on my dear mistress placed
 my flames within without my tears thou hast

 xcvii
 "not of dead bones art thou the mournful grave
 but of quick love the fortress and the hold
 still in my heart thy wonted brands i have
 more bitter far alas but not more cold
 receive these sighs these kisses sweet receive
 in liquid drops of melting tears enrolled
 and give them to that body pure and chaste
 which in thy bosom cold entombed thou hast

 xcviii
 "for if her happy soul her eye doth bend
 on that sweet body which it lately dressed
 my love thy pity cannot her offend
 anger and wrath is not in angels blessed
 she pardon will the trespass of her friend
 that hope relieves me with these griefs oppressed
 this hand she knows hath only sinned not i
 who living loved her and for love now die

 xcix
 "and loving will i die oh happy day
 whene'er it chanceth but oh far more blessed
 if as about thy polished sides i stray
 my bones within thy hollow grave might rest
 together should in heaven our spirits stay
 together should our bodies lie in chest
 so happy death should join what life doth sever
 o death o life sweet both both blessed ever"

 c
 meanwhile the news in that besieged town
 of this mishap was whispered here and there
 forthwith it spread and for too true was known
 her woful loss was talked everywhere
 mingled with cries and plaints to heaven upthrown
 as if the city's self new taken were
 with conquering foes or as if flame and fire
 nor house nor church nor street had left entire

 ci
 but all men's eyes were on arsetes bent
 his sighs were deep his looks full of despair
 out of his woful eyes no tear there went
 his heart was hardened with his too much care
 his silver locks with dust he foul besprent
 he knocked his breast his face he rent and tare
 and while the press flocked to the eunuch old
 thus to the people spake argantes bold

 cii
 "i would when first i knew the hardy maid
 excluded was among her christian foes
 have followed her to give her timely aid
 or by her side this breath and life to lose
 what did i not or what left i unsaid
 to make the king the gates again unclose
 but he denied his power did aye restrain
 my will my suit was waste my speech was vain

 ciii
 "ah had i gone i would from danger free
 have brought to sion that sweet nymph again
 or in the bloody fight where killed was she
 in her defence there nobly have been slain
 but what could i do more the counsels be
 of god and man gainst my designments plain
 dead is clorinda fair laid in cold grave
 let me revenge her whom i could not save

 civ
 "jerusalem hear what argantes saith
 hear heaven and if he break his oath and word
 upon this head cast thunder in thy wrath
 i will destroy and kill that christian lord
 who this fair dame by night thus murdered hath
 nor from my side i will ungird this sword
 till tancred's heart it cleave and shed his blood
 and leave his corpse to wolves and crows for food"

 cv
 this said the people with a joyful shout
 applaud his speeches and his words approve
 and calmed their grief in hope the boaster stout
 would kill the prince who late had slain his love
 o promise vain it otherwise fell out
 men purpose but high gods dispose above
 for underneath his sword this boaster died
 whom thus he scorned and threatened in his pride



 thirteenth book

 the argument
 ismeno sets to guard the forest old
 the wicked sprites whose ugly shapes affray
 and put to flight the men whose labor would
 to their dark shades let in heaven's golden ray
 thither goes tancred hardy faithful bold
 but foolish pity lets him not assay
 his strength and courage heat the christian power
 annoys whom to refresh god sends a shower


 i
 but scant dissolved into ashes cold
 the smoking tower fell on the scorched grass
 when new device found out the enchanter old
 by which the town besieged secured was
 of timber fit his foes deprive he would
 such terror bred that late consumed mass
 so that the strength of sion's walls to shake
 they should no turrets rams nor engines make

 ii
 from godfrey's camp a grove a little way
 amid the valleys deep grows out of sight
 thick with old trees whose horrid arms display
 an ugly shade like everlasting night
 there when the sun spreads forth his clearest ray
 dim thick uncertain gloomy seems the light
 as when in evening day and darkness strive
 which should his foe from our horizon drive

 iii
 but when the sun his chair in seas doth steep
 night horror darkness thick the place invade
 which veil the mortal eyes with blindness deep
 and with sad terror make weak hearts afraid
 thither no groom drives forth his tender sheep
 to browse or ease their faint in cooling shade
 nor traveller nor pilgrim there to enter
 so awful seems that forest old dare venture

 iv
 united there the ghosts and goblins meet
 to frolic with their mates in silent night
 with dragons' wings some cleave the welkin fleet
 some nimbly run o'er hills and valleys light
 a wicked troop that with allurements sweet
 draws sinful man from that is good and right
 and there with hellish pomp their banquets brought
 they solemnize thus the vain parians thought

 v
 no twist no twig no bough nor branch therefore
 the saracens cut from that sacred spring
 but yet the christians spared ne'er the more
 the trees to earth with cutting steel to bring
 thither went ismen old with tresses hoar
 when night on all this earth spread forth her wing
 and there in silence deaf and mirksome shade
 his characters and circles vain he made

 vi
 he in the circle set one foot unshod
 and whispered dreadful charms in ghastly wise
 three times for witchcraft loveth numbers odd
 toward the east he gaped westward thrice
 he struck the earth thrice with his charmed rod
 wherewith dead bones he makes from grave to rise
 and thrice the ground with naked foot he smote
 and thus he cried loud with thundering note

 vii
 "hear hear you spirits all that whilom fell
 cast down from heaven with dint of roaring thunder
 hear you amid the empty air that dwell
 and storms and showers pour on these kingdoms under
 hear all you devils that lie in deepest hell
 and rend with torments damned ghosts asunder
 and of those lands of death of pain and fear
 thou monarch great great dis great pluto hear

 viii
 "keep you this forest well keep every tree
 numbered i give you them and truly told
 as souls of men in bodies clothed be
 so every plant a sprite shall hide and hold
 with trembling fear make all the christians flee
 when they presume to cut these cedars old"
 this said his charms he gan again repeat
 which none can say but they that use like feat

 ix
 at those strange speeches still night's splendent fires
 quenched their lights and shrunk away for doubt
 the feeble moon her silver beams retires
 and wrapt her horns with folding clouds about
 ismen his sprites to come with speed requires
 "why come you not you ever damned rout
 why tarry you so long pardie you stay
 till stronger charms and greater words i say

 x
 "i have not yet forgot for want of use
 what dreadful terms belong this sacred feat
 my tongue if still your stubborn hearts refuse
 that so much dreaded name can well repeat
 which heard great dis cannot himself excuse
 but hither run from his eternal seat
 o great and fearful"more he would have said
 but that he saw the sturdy sprites obeyed

 xi
 legions of devils by thousands thither come
 such as in sparsed air their biding make
 and thousands also which by heavenly doom
 condemned lie in deep avernus lake
 but slow they came displeased all and some
 because those woods they should in keeping take
 yet they obeyed and took the charge in hand
 and under every branch and leaf they stand

 xii
 when thus his cursed work performed was
 the wizard to his king declared the feat
 "my lord let fear let doubt and sorrow pass
 henceforth in safety stands your regal seat
 your foe as he supposed no mean now has
 to build again his rams and engines great"
 and then he told at large from part to part
 all what he late performed by wondrous art

 xiii
 "besides this help another hap" quoth he
 "will shortly chance that brings not profit small
 within few days mars and the sun i see
 their fiery beams unite in leo shall
 and then extreme the scorching heat will be
 which neither rain can quench nor dews that fall
 so placed are the planets high and low
 that heat fire burning all the heavens foreshow

 xiv
 "so great with us will be the warmth therefore
 as with the garamants or those of inde
 yet nill it grieve us in this town so sore
 we have sweet shade and waters cold by kind
 our foes abroad will be tormented more
 what shield can they or what refreshing find
 heaven will them vanquish first then egypt's crew
 destroy them quite weak weary faint and few

 xv
 "thou shalt sit still and conquer prove no more
 the doubtful hazard of uncertain fight
 but if argantes bold that hates so sore
 all cause of quiet peace though just and right
 provoke thee forth to battle as before
 find means to calm the rage of that fierce knight
 for shortly heaven will send thee ease and peace
 and war and trouble mongst thy foes increase"

 xvi
 the king assured by these speeches fair
 held godfrey's power his might and strength in scorn
 and now the walls he gan in part repair
 which late the ram had bruised with iron horn
 with wise foresight and well advised care
 he fortified each breach and bulwark torn
 and all his folk men women children small
 with endless toil again repaired the wall

 xvii
 but godfrey nould this while bring forth his power
 to give assault against that fort in vain
 till he had builded new his dreadful tower
 and reared high his downfallen rams again
 his workmen therefore he despatched that hour
 to hew the trees out of the forest main
 they went and scant the wood appeared in sight
 when wonders new their fearful hearts affright

 xviii
 as silly children dare not bend their eye
 where they are told strange bugbears haunt the place
 or as new monsters while in bed they lie
 their fearful thoughts present before their face
 so feared they and fled yet wist not why
 nor what pursued them in that fearful chase
 except their fear perchance while thus they fled
 new chimeras sphinxes or like monsters bred

 xix
 swift to the camp they turned back dismayed
 with words confused uncertain tales they told
 that all which heard them scorned what they said
 and those reports for lies and fables hold
 a chosen crew in shining arms arrayed
 duke godfrey thither sent of soldiers bold
 to guard the men and their faint arms provoke
 to cut the dreadful trees with hardy stroke

 xx
 these drawing near the wood where close ypent
 the wicked sprites in sylvan pinfolds were
 their eyes upon those shades no sooner bent
 but frozen dread pierced through their entrails dear
 yet on they stalked still and on they went
 under bold semblance hiding coward fear
 and so far wandered forth with trembling pace
 till they approached nigh that enchanted place

 xxi
 when from the grove a fearful sound outbreaks
 as if some earthquake hill and mountain tore
 wherein the southern wind a rumbling makes
 or like sea waves against the scraggy shore
 there lions grumble there hiss scaly snakes
 there howl the wolves the rugged bears there roar
 there trumpets shrill are heard and thunders fell
 and all these sounds one sound expressed well

 xxii
 upon their faces pale well might you note
 a thousand signs of heartamating fear
 their reason gone by no device they wot
 how to press nigh or stay still where they were
 against that sudden dread their breasts which smote
 their courage weak no shield of proof could bear
 at last they fled and one than all more bold
 excused their flight and thus the wonders told

 xxiii
 "my lord not one of us there is i grant
 that dares cut down one branch in yonder spring
 i think there dwells a sprite in every plant
 there keeps his court great dis infernal king
 he hath a heart of hardened adamant
 that without trembling dares attempt the thing
 and sense he wanteth who so hardy is
 to hear the forest thunder roar and hiss"

 xxiv
 this said alcasto to his words gave heed
 alcasto leader of the switzers grim
 a man both void of wit and void of dreed
 who feared not loss of life nor loss of limb
 no savage beasts in deserts wild that feed
 nor ugly monster could dishearten him
 nor whirlwind thunder earthquake storm or aught
 that in this world is strange or fearful thought

 xxv
 he shook his head and smiling thus gan say
 "the hardiness have i that wood to fell
 and those proud trees low in the dust to lay
 wherein such grisly fiends and monsters dwell
 no roaring ghost my courage can dismay
 no shriek of birds beast's roar or dragon's yell
 but through and through that forest will i wend
 although to deepest hell the paths descend"

 xxvi
 thus boasted he and leave to go desired
 and forward went with joyful cheer and will
 he viewed the wood and those thick shades admired
 he heard the wondrous noise and rumbling shrill
 yet not one foot the audacious man retired
 he scorned the peril pressing forward still
 till on the forest's outmost marge he stepped
 a flaming fire from entrance there him kept

 xxvii
 the fire increased and built a stately wall
 of burning coals quick sparks and embers hot
 and with bright flames the wood environed all
 that there no tree nor twist alcasto got
 the higher stretched the flames seemed bulwarks tall
 castles and turrets full of fiery shot
 with slings and engines strong of every sort
 what mortal wight durst scale so strange a fort

 xxviii
 oh what strange monsters on the battlement
 in loathsome forms stood to defend the place
 their frowning looks upon the knight they bent
 and threatened death with shot with sword and mace
 at last he fled and though but slow he went
 as lions do whom jolly hunters chase
 yet fled the man and with sad fear withdrew
 though fear till then he never felt nor knew

 xxix
 that he had fled long time he never wist
 but when far run he had discoverd it
 himself for wonder with his hand he blist
 a bitter sorrow by the heart him bit
 amazed ashamed disgraced sad silent trist
 alone he would all day in darkness sit
 nor durst he look on man of worth or fame
 his pride late great now greater made his shame

 xxx
 godfredo called him but he found delays
 and causes why he should his cabin keep
 at length perforce he comes but naught he says
 or talks like those that babble in their sleep
 his shamefacedness to godfrey plain bewrays
 his flight so does his sighs and sadness deep
 whereat amazed "what chance is this" quoth he
 "these witchcrafts strange or nature's wonders be

 xxxi
 "but if his courage any champion move
 to try the hazard of this dreadful spring
 i give him leave the adventure great to prove
 some news he may report us of the thing"
 this said his lords attempt the charmed grove
 yet nothing back but fear and flight they bring
 for them inforced with trembling to retire
 the sight the sound the monsters and the fire

 xxxii
 this happed when woful tancred left his bed
 to lay in marble cold his mistress dear
 the lively color from his cheek was fled
 his limbs were weak his helm or targe to bear
 nathless when need to high attempts him led
 no labor would he shun no danger fear
 his valor boldness heart and courage brave
 to his faint body strength and vigor gave

 xxxiii
 to this exploit forth went the venturous knight
 fearless yet heedful silent well advised
 the terrors of that forest's dreadful sight
 storms earthquakes thunders cries he all despised
 he feared nothing yet a motion light
 that quickly vanished in his heart arised
 when lo between him and the charmed wood
 a fiery city high as heaven up stood

 xxxiv
 the knight stepped back and took a sudden pause
 and to himself "what help these arms" quoth he
 "if in this fire or monster's gaping jaws
 i headlong cast myself what boots it me
 for common profit or my country's cause
 to hazard life before me none should be
 but this exploit of no such weight i hold
 for it to lose a prince or champion bold

 xxxv
 but if i fly what will the pagans say
 if i retire who shall cut down this spring
 godfredo will attempt it every day
 what if some other knight perform the thing
 these flames uprisen to forestall my way
 perchance more terror far than danger bring
 but hap what shall" this said he forward stepped
 and through the fire oh wondrous boldness leapt

 xxxvi
 he bolted through but neither warmth nor heat
 he felt nor sign of fire or scorching flame
 yet wist he not in his dismayed conceit
 if that were fire or no through which he came
 for at first touch vanished those monsters great
 and in their stead the clouds black night did frame
 and hideous storms and showers of hail and rain
 yet storms and tempests vanished straight again

 xxxvii
 amazed but not afraid the champion good
 stood still but when the tempest passed he spied
 he entered boldly that forbidden wood
 and of the forest all the secrets eyed
 in all his walk no sprite or phantasm stood
 that stopped his way or passage free denied
 save that the growing trees so thick were set
 that oft his sight and passage oft they let

 xxxviii
 at length a fair and spacious green he spied
 like calmest waters plain like velvet soft
 wherein a cypress clad in summer's pride
 pyramidwise lift up his tops aloft
 in whose smooth bark upon the evenest side
 strange characters he found and viewed them oft
 like those which priests of egypt erst instead
 of letters used which none but they could read

 xxxix
 mongst them he picked out these words at last
 writ in the syriac tongue which well he could
 "oh hardy knight who through these woods hast passed
 where death his palace and his court doth hold
 oh trouble not these souls in quiet placed
 oh be not cruel as thy heart is bold
 pardon these ghosts deprived of heavenly light
 with spirits dead why should men living fight"

 xl
 this found he graven in the tender rind
 and while he mused on this uncouth writ
 him thought he heard the softly whistling wind
 his blasts amid the leaves and branches knit
 and frame a sound like speech of human kind
 but full of sorrow grief and woe was it
 whereby his gentle thoughts all filled were
 with pity sadness grief compassion fear

 xli
 he drew his sword at last and gave the tree
 a mighty blow that made a gaping wound
 out of the rift red streams he trickling see
 that all bebled the verdant plain around
 his hair start up yet once again stroke he
 he nould give over till the end he found
 of this adventure when with plaint and moan
 as from some hollow grave he heard one groan

 xlii
 "enough enough" the voice lamenting said
 "tancred thou hast me hurt thou didst me drive
 out of the body of a noble maid
 who with me lived whom late i kept on live
 and now within this woful cypress laid
 my tender rind thy weapon sharp doth rive
 cruel is't not enough thy foes to kill
 but in their graves wilt thou torment them still

 xliii
 "i was clorinda now imprisoned here
 yet not alone within this plant i dwell
 for every pagan lord and christian peer
 before the city's walls last day that fell
 in bodies new or graves i wot not clear
 but here they are confined by magic's spell
 so that each tree hath life and sense each bough
 a murderer if thou cut one twist art thou"

 xliv
 as the sick man that in his sleep doth see
 some ugly dragon or some chimera new
 though he suspect or half persuaded be
 it is an idle dream no monster true
 yet still he fears he quakes and strives to flee
 so fearful is that wondrous form to view
 so feared the knight yet he both knew and thought
 all were illusions false by witchcraft wrought

 xlv
 but cold and trembling waxed his frozen heart
 such strange effects such passions it torment
 out of his feeble hand his weapon start
 himself out of his wits nigh after went
 wounded he saw he thought for pain and smart
 his lady weep complain mourn and lament
 nor could he suffer her dear blood to see
 or hear her sighs that deep far fetched be

 xlvi
 thus his fierce heart which death had scorned oft
 whom no strange shape or monster could dismay
 with feigned shows of tender love made soft
 a spirit false did with vain plaints betray
 a whirling wind his sword heaved up aloft
 and through the forest bare it quite away
 o'ercome retired the prince and as he came
 his sword he found and repossessed the same

 xlvii
 yet nould return he had no mind to try
 his courage further in those forests green
 but when to godfrey's tent he proached nigh
 his spirits waked his thoughts composed been
 "my lord" quoth he "a witness true am i
 of wonders strange believe it scant though seen
 what of the fire the shades the dreadful sound
 you heard all true by proof myself have found

 xlviii
 "a burning fire so are those deserts charmed
 built like a battled wall to heaven was reared
 whereon with darts and dreadful weapons armed
 of monsters foul misshaped whole bands appeared
 but through them all i passed unhurt unharmed
 no flame or threatened blow i felt or feared
 then rain and night i found but straight again
 to day the night to sunshine turned the rain

 xlix
 "what would you more each tree through all that wood
 hath sense hath life hath speech like human kind
 i heard their words as in that grove i stood
 that mournful voice still still i bear in mind
 and as they were of flesh the purple blood
 at every blow streams from the wounded rind
 no no not i nor any else i trow
 hath power to cut one leaf one branch one bough"
 l
 while thus he said the christian's noble guide
 felt uncouth strife in his contentious thought
 he thought what if himself in perzon tried
 those witchcrafts strange and bring those charms to naught
 for such he deemed them or elsewhere provide
 for timber easier got though further sought
 but from his study he at last abraid
 called by the hermit old that to him said

 li
 "leave off thy hardy thought another's hands
 of these her plants the wood dispoilen shall
 now now the fatal ship of conquest lands
 her sails are struck her silver anchors fall
 our champion broken hath his worthless bands
 and looseth from the soil which held him thrall
 the time draws nigh when our proud foes in field
 shall slaughtered lie and sion's fort shall yield"

 lii
 this said his visage shone with beams divine
 and more than mortal was his voice's sound
 godfredo's thought to other acts incline
 his working brain was never idle found
 but in the crab now did bright titan shine
 and scorched with scalding beams the parched ground
 and made unfit for toil or warlike feat
 his soldiers weak with labor faint with sweat

 liii
 the planets mild their lamps benign quenched out
 and cruel stars in heaven did signorize
 whose influence cast fiery flames about
 and hot impressions through the earth and skies
 the growing heat still gathered deeper rout
 the noisome warmth through lands and kingdoms flies
 a harmful night a hurtful day succeeds
 and worse than both next morn her light outspreads

 liv
 when phoebus rose he left his golden weed
 and donned a gite in deepest purple dyed
 his sanguine beams about his forehead spread
 a sad presage of ill that should betide
 with vermeil drops at even his tresses bleed
 foreshows of future heat from the ocean wide
 when next he rose and thus increased still
 their present harms with dread of future ill

 lv
 while thus he bent gainst earth his scorching rays
 he burnt the flowers burnt his clytie dear
 the leaves grew wan upon the withered sprays
 the grass and growing herbs all parched were
 earth cleft in rifts in floods their streams decays
 the barren clouds with lightning bright appear
 and mankind feared lest climenes' child again
 had driven awry his sire's illguided wain

 lvi
 as from a furnace flew the smoke to skies
 such smoke as that when damned sodom brent
 within his caves sweet zephyr silent lies
 still was the air the rack nor came nor went
 but o'er the lands with lukewarm breathing flies
 the southern wind from sunburnt afric sent
 which thick and warm his interrupted blasts
 upon their bosoms throats and faces casts

 lvii
 nor yet more comfort brought the gloomy night
 in her thick shades was burning heat uprolled
 her sable mantle was embroidered bright
 with blazing stars and gliding fires for gold
 nor to refresh sad earth thy thirsty sprite
 the niggard moon let fall her may dews cold
 and dried up the vital moisture was
 in trees in plants in herbs in flowers in grass

 lviii
 sleep to his quiet dales exiled fled
 from these unquiet nights and oft in vain
 the soldiers restless sought the god in bed
 but most for thirst they mourned and most complain
 for juda's tyrant had strong poison shed
 poison that breeds more woe and deadly pain
 than acheron or stygian waters bring
 in every fountain cistern well and spring

 lix
 and little siloe that his store bestows
 of purest crystal on the christian bands
 the pebbles naked in his channel shows
 and scantly glides above the scorched sands
 nor po in may when o'er his banks he flows
 nor ganges waterer of the indian lands
 nor sevenmouthed nile that yields all egypt drink
 to quench their thirst the men sufficient think

 lx
 he that the gliding rivers erst had seen
 adown their verdant channels gently rolled
 or falling streams which to the valleys green
 distilled from tops of alpine mountains cold
 those he desired in vain new torments been
 augmented thus with wish of comforts old
 those waters cool he drank in vain conceit
 which more increased his thirst increased his heat

 lxi
 the sturdy bodies of the warriors strong
 whom neither marching far nor tedious way
 nor weighty arms which on their shoulders hung
 could weary make nor death itself dismay
 now weak and feeble cast their limbs along
 unwieldly burdens on the burned clay
 and in each vein a smouldering fire there dwelt
 which dried their flesh and solid bones did melt

 lxii
 languished the steed late fierce and proffered grass
 his fodder erst despised and from him cast
 each step he stumbled and which lofty was
 and high advanced before now fell his crest
 his conquests gotten all forgotten pass
 nor with desire of glory swelled his breast
 the spoils won from his foe his late rewards
 he now neglects despiseth naught regards

 lxiii
 languished the faithful dog and wonted care
 of his dear lord and cabin both forgot
 panting he laid and gathered fresher air
 to cool the burning in his entrails hot
 but breathing which wise nature did prepare
 to suage the stomach's heat now booted not
 for little ease alas small help they win
 that breathe forth air and scalding fire suck in

 lxiv
 thus languished the earth in this estate
 lay woful thousands of the christians stout
 the faithful people grew nigh desperate
 of hoped conquest shameful death they doubt
 of their distress they talk and oft debate
 these sad complaints were heard the camp throughout
 "what hope hath godfrey shall we still here lie
 till all his soldiers all our armies die

 lxv
 "alas with what device what strength thinks he
 to scale these walls or this strong fort to get
 whence hath he engines new doth he not see
 how wrathful heaven gainst us his sword doth whet
 these tokens shown true signs and witness be
 our angry god our proud attempts doth let
 and scorching sun so hot his beams outspreads
 that not more cooling inde nor aethiop needs

 lxvi
 "or thinks he it an eath or little thing
 that us despised neglected and disdained
 like abjects vile to death he thus should bring
 that so his empire may be still maintained
 is it so great a bliss to be a king
 when he that wears the crown with blood is stained
 and buys his sceptre with his people's lives
 see whither glory vain fond mankind drives

 lxvii
 "see see the man called holy just and good
 that courteous meek and humble would be thought
 yet never cared in what distress we stood
 if his vain honor were diminished naught
 when dried up from us his spring and flood
 his water must from jordan streams be brought
 and how he sits at feasts and banquets sweet
 and mingleth waters fresh with wines of crete"

 lxviii
 the french thus murmured but the greekish knight
 tatine that of this war was weary grown
 "why die we here" quoth he "slain without fight
 killed not subdued murdered not overthrown
 upon the frenchmen let the penance light
 of godfrey's folly let me save mine own"
 and as he said without farewell the knight
 and all his comet stole away by night

 lxix
 his bad example many a troop prepares
 to imitate when his escape they know
 clotharius his band and ademare's
 and all whose guides in dust were buried low
 discharged of duty's chains and bondage snares
 free from their oath to none they service owe
 but now concluded all on secret flight
 and shrunk away by thousands every night

 lxx
 godfredo this both heard and saw and knew
 yet nould with death them chastise though he mought
 but with that faith wherewith he could renew
 the steadfast hills and seas dry up to naught
 he prayed the lord upon his flock to rue
 to ope the springs of grace and ease this drought
 out of his looks shone zeal devotion faith
 his hands and eyes to heaven he heaves and saith

 lxxi
 "father and lord if in the deserts waste
 thou hadst compassion on thy children dear
 the craggy rock when moses cleft and brast
 and drew forth flowing streams of waters clear
 like mercy lord like grace on us down cast
 and though our merits less than theirs appear
 thy grace supply that want for though they be
 thy firstborn son thy children yet are we"

 lxxii
 these prayers just from humble hearts forth sent
 were nothing slow to climb the starry sky
 but swift as winged bird themselves present
 before the father of the heavens high
 the lord accepted them and gently bent
 upon the faithful host his gracious eye
 and in what pain and what distress it laid
 he saw and grieved to see and thus he said

 lxxiii
 "mine armies dear till now have suffered woe
 distress and danger hell's infernal power
 their enemy hath been the world their foe
 but happy be their actions from this hour
 what they begin to blessed end shall go
 i will refresh them with a gentle shower
 rinaldo shall return the egyptian crew
 they shall encounter conquer and subdue"

 lxxiv
 at these high words great heaven began to shake
 the fixed stars the planets wandering still
 trembled the air the earth and ocean quake
 spring fountain river forest dale and hill
 from north to east a lightning flash outbrake
 and coming drops presaged with thunders shrill
 with joyful shouts the soldiers on the plain
 these tokens bless of longdesired rain

 lxxv
 a sudden cloud as when helias prayed
 not from dry earth exhaled by phoebus' beams
 arose moist heaven his windows open laid
 whence clouds by heaps out rush and watery streams
 the world o'erspread was with a gloomy shade
 that like a dark mirksome even it seems
 the crashing rain from molten skies down fell
 and o'er their banks the brooks and fountains swell

 lxxvi
 in summer season when the cloudy sky
 upon the parched ground doth rain down send
 as duck and mallard in the furrows dry
 with merry noise the promised showers attend
 and spreading broad their wings displayed lie
 to keep the drops that on their plumes descend
 and where the streams swell to a gathered lake
 therein they dive and sweet refreshing take

 lxxvii
 so they the streaming showers with shouts and cries
 salute which heaven shed on the thirsty lands
 the falling liquor from the dropping skies
 he catcheth in his lap he barehead stands
 and his bright helm to drink therein unties
 in the fresh streams he dives his sweaty hands
 their faces some and some their temples wet
 and some to keep the drops large vessels set

 lxxviii
 nor man alone to ease his burning sore
 herein doth dive and wash and hereof drinks
 but earth itself weak feeble faint before
 whose solid limbs were cleft with rifts and chinks
 received the falling showers and gathered store
 of liquor sweet that through her veins down sinks
 and moisture new infused largely was
 in trees in plants in herbs in flowers in grass

 lxxix
 earth like the patient was whose lively blood
 hath overcome at last some sickness strong
 whose feeble limbs had been the bait and food
 whereon this strange disease depastured long
 but now restored in health and welfare stood
 as sound as erst as fresh as fair as young
 so that forgetting all his grief and pain
 his pleasant robes and crowns he takes again

 lxxx
 ceased the rain the sun began to shine
 with fruitful sweet benign and gentle ray
 full of strong power and vigor masculine
 as be his beams in april or in may
 o happy zeal who trusts in help divine
 the world's afflictions thus can drive away
 can storms appease and times and seasons change
 and conquer fortune fate and destiny strange



 fourteenth book

 the argument
 the lord to godfrey in a dream doth show
 his will rinaldo must return at last
 they have their asking who for pardon sue
 two knights to find the prince are sent in haste
 but peter who by vision all foreknew
 sendeth the searchers to a wizard placed
 deep in a vault who first at large declares
 armida's trains then how to shun those snares

 i
 now from the fresh the soft and tender bed
 of her still mother gentle night out flew
 the fleeting balm on hills and dales she shed
 with honey drops of pure and precious dew
 and on the verdure of green forests spread
 the virgin primrose and the violet blue
 and sweetbreathed zephyr on his spreading wings
 sleep ease repose rest peace and quiet brings

 ii
 the thoughts and troubles of broadwaking day
 they softly dipped in mild oblivion's lake
 but he whose godhead heaven and earth doth sway
 in his eternal light did watch and wake
 and bent on godfrey down the gracious ray
 of his bright eye still ope for godfrey's sake
 to whom a silent dream the lord down sent
 which told his will his pleasure and intent

 iii
 far in the east the golden gate beside
 whence phoebus comes a crystal port there is
 and ere the sun his broad doors open wide
 the beam of springing day uncloseth this
 hence comes the dreams by which heaven's sacred guide
 reveals to man those high degrees of his
 hence toward godfrey ere he left his bed
 a vision strange his golden plumes bespread

 iv
 such semblances such shapes such portraits fair
 did never yet in dream or sleep appear
 for all the forms in sea in earth or air
 the signs in heaven the stars in every sphere
 all that was wondrous uncouth strange and rare
 all in that vision well presented were
 his dream had placed him in a crystal wide
 beset with golden fires top bottom side

 v
 there while he wondereth on the circles vast
 the stars their motions course and harmony
 a knight with shining rays and fire embraced
 presents himself unwares before his eye
 who with a voice that far for sweetness passed
 all human speech thus said approaching nigh
 "what godfrey knowest thou not thy hugo here
 come and embrace thy friend and fellow dear"

 vi
 he answered him "thy glorious shining light
 which in thine eyes his glistering beams doth place
 estranged hath from my foreknowledge quite
 thy countenance thy favor and thy face"
 this said three times he stretched his hands outright
 and would in friendly arms the knight embrace
 and thrice the spirit fled that thrice he twined
 naught in his folded arms but air and wind

 vii
 lord hugo smiled "not as you think" quoth he
 "i clothed am in flesh and earthly mould
 my spirit pure and naked soul you see
 a citizen of this celestial hold
 this place is heaven and here a room for thee
 prepared is among christ's champions bold"
 "ah when" quoth he "these mortal bonds unknit
 shall i in peace in ease and rest there sit"

 viii
 hugo replied "ere many years shall run
 amid the saints in bliss here shalt thou reign
 but first great wars must by thy hand be done
 much blood be shed and many pagans slain
 the holy city by assault be won
 the land set free from servile yoke again
 wherein thou shalt a christian empire frame
 and after thee shall baldwin rule the same

 ix
 "but to increase thy love and great desire
 to heavenward this blessed place behold
 these shining lamps these globes of living fire
 how they are turned guided moved and rolled
 the angels' singing hear and all their choir
 then bend thine eyes on yonder earth and mould
 all in that mass that globe and compass see
 land sea spring fountain man beast grass and tree

 x
 "how vile how small and of how slender price
 is their reward of goodness virtue's gain
 a narrow room our glory vain upties
 a little circle doth our pride contain
 earth like an isle amid the water lies
 which sea sometime is called sometime the main
 yet naught therein responds a name so great
 it's but a lake a pond a marish strait"

 xi
 thus said the one the other bended down
 his looks to ground and half in scorn he smiled
 he saw at once earth sea flood castle town
 strangely divided strangely all compiled
 and wondered folly man so far should drown
 to set his heart on things so base and vild
 that servile empire searcheth and dumb fame
 and scorns heaven's bliss yet proffereth heaven the same

 xii
 wherefore he answered "since the lord not yet
 will free my spirit from this cage of clay
 lest worldly error vain my voyage let
 teach me to heaven the best and surest way"
 hugo replied "thy happy foot is set
 in the true path nor from this passage stray
 only from exile young rinaldo call
 this give i thee in charge else naught at all

 xiii
 "for as the lord of hosts the king of bliss
 hath chosen thee to rule the faithful band
 so he thy stratagems appointed is
 to execute so both shall win this land
 the first is thine the second place is his
 thou art this army's head and he the hand
 no other champion can his place supply
 and that thou do it doth thy state deny

 xiv
 "the enchanted forest and her charmed treen
 with cutting steel shall he to earth down hew
 and thy weak armies which too feeble been
 to scale again these walls reinforced new
 and fainting lie dispersed on the green
 shall take new strength new courage at his view
 the highbuilt towers the eastern squadrons all
 shall conquered be shall fly shall die shall fall"

 xv
 he held his peace and godfrey answered so
 "oh how his presence would recomfort me
 you that man's hidden thoughts perceive and know
 if i say truth or if i love him see
 but say what messengers shall for him go
 what shall their speeches what their errand be
 shall i entreat or else command the man
 with credit neither well perform i can"

 xvi
 "the eternal lord" the other knight replied
 "that with so many graces hath thee blest
 will that among the troops thou hast to guide
 thou honored be and feared of most and least
 then speak not thou lest blemish some betide
 thy sacred empire if thou make request
 but when by suit thou moved art to ruth
 then yield forgive and home recall the youth

 xvii
 "guelpho shall pray thee god shall him inspire
 to pardon this offence this fault commit
 by hasty wrath by rash and headstrong ire
 to call the knight again yield thou to it
 and though the youth enwrapped in fond desire
 far hence in love and looseness idle sit
 year fear it not he shall return with speed
 when most you wish him and when most you need

 xviii
 "your hermit peter to whose sapient heart
 high heaven his secrets opens tells and shews
 your messengers direct can to that part
 where of the prince they shall hear certain news
 and learn the way the manner and the art
 to bring him back to these thy warlike crews
 that all thy soldiers wandered and misgone
 heaven may unite again and join in one

 xix
 "but this conclusion shall my speeches end
 know that his blood shall mixed be with thine
 whence barons bold and worthies shall descend
 that many great exploits shall bring to fine"
 this said he vanished from his sleeping friend
 like smoke in wind or mist in titan's shine
 sleep fled likewise and in his troubled thought
 with wonder pleasure joy with marvel fought

 xx
 the duke looked up and saw the azure sky
 with argent beams of silver morning spread
 and started up for praise axed virtue lie
 in toil and travel sin and shame in bed
 his arms he took his sword girt to his thigh
 to his pavilion all his lords them sped
 and there in council grave the princes sit
 for strength by wisdom war is ruled by wit

 xxi
 lord guelpho there within whose gentle breast
 heaven had infused that new and sudden thought
 his pleasing words thus to the duke addressed
 "good prince mild though unasked kind unbesought
 oh let thy mercy grant my just request
 pardon this fault by rage not malice wrought
 for great offence i grant so late commit
 my suit too hasty is perchance unfit

 xxii
 but since to godfrey meek benign and kind
 for prince rinaldo bold i humbly sue
 and that the suitor's self is not behind
 thy greatest friends in state or friendship true
 i trust i shall thy grace and mercy find
 acceptable to me and all this crew
 oh call him home this trespass to amend
 he shall his blood in godfrey's service spend

 xxiii
 "and if not he who else dares undertake
 of this enchanted wood to cut one tree
 gainst death and danger who dares battle make
 with so bold face so fearless heart as he
 beat down these walls these gates in pieces break
 leap o'er these rampires high thou shalt him see
 restore therefore to this desirous band
 their wish their hope their strength their shield their hand

 xxiv
 "to me my nephew to thyself restore
 a trusty help when strength of hand thou needs
 in idleness let him consume no more
 recall him to his noble acts and deeds
 known be his worth as was his strength of yore
 wher'er thy standard broad her cross outspreads
 oh let his fame and praise spread far and wide
 be thou his lord his teacher and his guidel"

 xxv
 thus he entreated and the rest approve
 his words with friendly murmurs whispered low
 godfrey as though their suit his mind did move
 to that whereon he never thought tell now
 "how can my heart" quoth he "if you i love
 to your request and suit but bend and bow
 let rigor go that right and justice be
 wherein you all consent and all agree

 xxvi
 "rinaldo shall return let him restrain
 henceforth his headstrong wrath and hasty ire
 and with his hardy deeds let him take pain
 to correspond your hope and my desire
 guelpho thou must call home the knight again
 see that with speed he to these tents retire
 the messengers appoint as likes thy mind
 and teach them where they should the young man find"

 xxvii
 up start the dane that bare prince sweno's brand
 "i will" quoth he "that message undertake
 i will refuse no pains by sea or land
 to give the knight this sword kept for his sake"
 this man was bold of courage strong of hand
 guelpho was glad he did the proffer make
 "thou shalt" quoth he "ubaldo shalt thou have
 to go with thee a knight stout wise and grave"

 xxviii
 ubaldo in his youth had known and seen
 the fashions strange of many an uncouth land
 and travelled over all the realms between
 the arctic circle and hot meroe's strand
 and as a man whose wit his guide had been
 their customs use he could tongues understand
 forthy when spent his youthful seasons were
 lord guelpho entertained and held him dear

 xxix
 to these committed was the charge and care
 to find and bring again the champion bold
 guelpho commands them to the fort repair
 where boemond doth his seat and sceptre hold
 for public fame said that bertoldo's heir
 there lived there dwelt there stayed the hermit old
 that knew they were misled by false report
 among them came and parleyed in this sort

 xxx
 "sir knights" quoth he "if you intend to ride
 and follow each report fond people say
 you follow but a rash and truthless guide
 that leads vain men amiss and makes them stray
 near ascalon go to the salt seaside
 where a swift brook fails in with hideous sway
 an aged sire our friend there shall you find
 all what he saith that do that keep in mind

 xxxi
 "of this great voyage which you undertake
 much by his skill and much by mine advise
 hath he foreknown and welcome for my sake
 you both shall be the man is kind and wise"
 instructed thus no further question make
 the twain elected for this enterprise
 but humbly yielded to obey his word
 for what the hermit said that said the lord

 xxxii
 they took their leave and on their journey went
 their will could brook no stay their zeal no let
 to ascalon their voyage straight they bent
 whose broken shores with brackish waves are wet
 and there they heard how gainst the cliffs besprent
 with bitter foam the roaring surges bet
 a tumbling brook their passage stopped and stayed
 which latefall'n rain had proud and puissant made

 xxxiii
 so proud that over all his banks he grew
 and through the fields ran swift as shaft from bow
 while here they stopped and stood before them drew
 an aged sire grave and benign in show
 crowned with a beechen garland gathered new
 clad in a linen robe that raught down low
 in his right hand a rod and on the flood
 against the stream he marched and dry shod yode

 xxxiv
 as on the rhene when winter's freezing cold
 congeals the streams to thick and hardened glass
 the beauties fair of shepherds' daughters bold
 with wanton windlays run turn play and pass
 so on this river passed the wizard old
 although unfrozen soft and swift it was
 and thither stalked where the warriors stayed
 to whom their greetings done he spoke and said

 xxxv
 "great pains great travel lords you have begun
 and of a cunning guide great need you stand
 far off alas is great bertoldo's son
 imprisoned in a waste and desert land
 what soil remains by which you must not run
 what promontory rock sea shore or sand
 your search must stretch before the prince be found
 beyond our world beyond our half of ground

 xxxvi
 but yet vouchsafe to see my cell i pray
 in hidden caves and vaults though builded low
 great wonders there strange things i will bewray
 things good for you to hear and fit to know"
 this said he bids the river make them way
 the flood retired backward gan to flow
 and here and there two crystal mountains rise
 so fled the red sea once and jordan thrice

 xxxvii
 he took their hands and led them headlong down
 under the flood through vast and hollow deeps
 such light they had as when through shadows brown
 of thickest deserts feeble cynthia peeps
 their spacious caves they saw all overflown
 there all his waters pure great neptune keeps
 and thence to moisten all the earth he brings
 seas rivers floods lakes fountains wells and springs

 xxxviii
 whence ganges indus volga ister po
 whence euphrates whence tigris' spring they view
 whence tanais whence nilus comes also
 although his head till then no creature knew
 but under these a wealthy stream doth go
 that sulphur yields and ore rich quick and new
 which the sunbeams doth polish purge and fine
 and makes it silver pure and gold divine

 xxxix
 and all his banks the rich and wealthy stream
 hath fair beset with pearl and precious stone
 like stars in sky or lamps on stage that seem
 the darkness there was day the night was gone
 there sparkled clothed in his azurebeam
 the heavenly sapphire there the jacinth shone
 the carbuncle there flamed the diamond sheen
 there glistered bright there smiled the emerald green

 xl
 amazed the knights amid these wonders passed
 and fixed so deep the marvels in their thought
 that not one word they uttered till at last
 ubaldo spake and thus his guide besought
 "o father tell me by what skill thou hast
 these wonders done and to what place us brought
 for well i know not if i wake or sleep
 my heart is drowned in such amazement deep"

 xli
 "you are within the hollow womb" quoth he
 "of fertile earth the nurse of all things made
 and but you brought and guided are by me
 her sacred entrails could no wight invade
 my palace shortly shall you splendent see
 with glorious light though built in night and shade
 a pagan was i born but yet the lord
 to grace by baptism hath my soul restored

 xlii
 "nor yet by help of devil or aid from hell
 i do this uncouth work and wondrous feat
 the lord forbid i use or charm or spell
 to raise foul dis from his infernal seat
 but of all herbs of every spring and well
 the hidden power i know and virtue great
 and all that kind hath hid from mortal sight
 and all the stars their motions and their might

 xliii
 "for in these caves i dwell not buried still
 from sight of heaven but often i resort
 to tops of lebanon or carmel hill
 and there in liquid air myself disport
 there mars and venus i behold at will
 as bare as erst when vulcan took them short
 and how the rest roll glide and move i see
 how their aspects benign or froward be"

 xliv
 "and underneath my feet the clouds i view
 now thick now thin now bright with iris' bow
 the frost and snow the rain the hail the dew
 the winds from whence they come and whence they blow
 how jove his thunder makes and lightning new
 how with the bolt he strikes the earth below
 how comate crinite caudate stars are framed
 i knew my skill with pride my heart inflamed

 xlv
 "so learned cunning wise myself i thought
 that i supposed my wit so high might climb
 to know all things that god had framed or wrought
 fire air sea earth man beast sprite place and time
 but when your hermit me to baptism brought
 and from my soul had washed the sin and crime
 then i perceived my sight was blindness still
 my wit was folly ignorance my skill

 xlvi
 "then saw i that like owls in shining sun
 so gainst the beams of truth our souls are blind
 and at myself to smile i then begun
 and at my heart puffed up with folly's wind
 yet still these arts as i before had done
 i practised such was the hermit's mind
 thus hath he changed my thoughts my heart my will
 and rules mine art my knowledge and my skill

 xlvii
 "in him i rest on him my thoughts depend
 my lord my teacher and my guide is he
 this noble work he strives to bring to end
 he is the architect the workmen we
 the hardy youth home to this camp to send
 from prison strong my care my charge shall be
 so he commands and me ere this foretold
 your coming oft to seek the champion bold"

 xlviii
 while this he said he brought the champions twain
 down to a vault wherein he dwells and lies
 it was a cave high wide large ample plain
 with goodly rooms halls chambers galleries
 all what is bred in rich and precious vein
 of wealthy earth and hid from mortal eyes
 there shines and fair adorned was every part
 with riches grown by kind not framed by art

 xlix
 an hundred grooms quick diligent and neat
 attendance gave about these strangers bold
 against the wall there stood a cupboard great
 of massive plate of silver crystal gold
 but when with precious wines and costly meat
 they filled were thus spake the wizard old
 "now fits the time sir knights i tell and show
 what you desire to hear and long to know

 l
 "armida's craft her sleight and hidden guile
 you partly wot her acts and arts untrue
 how to your camp she came and by what wile
 the greatest lords and princes thence she drew
 you know she turned them first to monsters vile
 and kept them since closed up in secret mew
 lastly to gazaward in bonds them sent
 whom young rinaldo rescued as they went

 li
 "what chanced since i will at large declare
 to you unknown a story strange and true
 when first her prey got with such pain and care
 escaped and gone the witch perceived and knew
 her hands she wrung for grief her clothes she tare
 and full of woe these heavy words outthrew
 'alas my knights are slain my prisoners free
 yet of that conquest never boast shall he

 lii
 "'he in their place shall serve me and sustain
 their plagues their torments suffer sorrows bear
 and they his absence shall lament in vain
 and wail his loss and theirs with many a tear'
 thus talking to herself she did ordain
 a false and wicked guile as you shall hear
 thither she hasted where the valiant knight
 had overcome and slain her men in fight

 liii
 "rinaldo there had dolt and left his own
 and on his back a pagan's harness tied
 perchance he deemed so to pass unknown
 and in those arms less noted false to ride
 a headless corse in fight late overthrown
 the witch in his forsaken arms did hide
 and by a brook exposed it on the sand
 whither she wished would come a christian band

 liv
 "their coming might the dame foreknow right well
 for secret spies she sent forth thousand ways
 which every day news from the camp might tell
 who parted thence booties to search or preys
 beside the sprites conjured by sacred spell
 all what she asks or doubts reveals and says
 the body therefore placed she in that part
 that furthered best her sleight her craft and art

 lv
 "and near the corpse a varlet false and sly
 she left attired in shepherd's homely weed
 and taught him how to counterfeit and lie
 as time required and he performed the deed
 with him your soldiers spoke of jealousy
 and false suspect mongst them he strewed the seed
 that since brought forth the fruit of strife and jar
 of civil brawls contention discord war

 lvi
 "and as she wished so the soldiers thought
 by godfrey's practice that the prince was slain
 yet vanished that suspicion false to naught
 when truth spread forth her silver wings again
 her false devices thus armida wrought
 this was her first deceit her foremost train
 what next she practised shall you hear me tell
 against our knight and what thereof befell

 lvii
 "armida hunted him through wood and plain
 till on orontes' flowery banks he stayed
 there where the stream did part and meet again
 and in the midst a gentle island made
 a pillar fair was pight beside the main
 near which a little frigate floating laid
 the marble white the prince did long behold
 and this inscription read there writ in gold

 lviii
 "'whoso thou art whom will or chance doth bring
 with happy steps to flood orontes' sides
 know that the world hath not so strange a thing
 twixt east and west as this small island hides
 then pass and see without more tarrying'
 the hasty youth to pass the stream provides
 and for the cogs was narrow small and strait
 alone he rowed and bade his squires there wait

 lix
 "landed he stalks about yet naught he sees
 but verdant groves sweet shades and mossy rocks
 with caves and fountains flowers herbs and trees
 so that the words he read he takes for mocks
 but that green isle was sweet at all degrees
 wherewith enticed down sits he and unlocks
 his closed helm and bares his visage fair
 to take sweet breath from cool and gentle air

 lx
 "a rumbling sound amid the waters deep
 meanwhile he heard and thither turned his sight
 and tumbling in the troubled stream took keep
 how the strong waves together rush and fight
 whence first he saw with golden tresses peep
 the rising visage of a virgin bright
 and then her neck her breasts and all as low
 as he for shame could see or she could show

 lxi
 "so in the twilight does sometimes appear
 a nymph a goddess or a fairy queen
 and though no siren but a sprite this were
 yet by her beauty seemed it she had been
 one of those sisters false which haunted near
 the tyrrhene shores and kept those waters sheen
 like theirs her face her voice was and her sound
 and thus she sung and pleased both skies and ground

 lxii
 "'ye happy youths who april fresh and may
 attire in flowering green of lusty age
 for glory vain or virtue's idle ray
 do not your tender limbs to toil engage
 in calm streams fishes birds in sunshine play
 who followeth pleasure he is only sage
 so nature saith yet gainst her sacred will
 why still rebel you and why strive you still

 lxiii
 "'o fools who youth possess yet scorn the same
 a precious but a shortabiding treasure
 virtue itself is but an idle name
 prized by the world 'bove reason all and measure
 and honor glory praise renown and fame
 that men's proud harts bewitch with tickling pleasure
 an echo is a shade a dream a flower
 with each wind blasted spoiled with every shower

 lxiv
 "'but let your happy souls in joy possess
 the ivory castles of your bodies fair
 your passed harms salve with forgetfulness
 haste not your coming evils with thought and care
 regard no blazing star with burning tress
 nor storm nor threatening sky nor thundering air
 this wisdom is good life and worldly bliss
 kind teacheth us nature commands us this'

 lxv
 "thus sung the spirit false and stealing sleep
 to which her tunes enticed his heavy eyes
 by step and step did on his senses creep
 still every limb therein unmoved lies
 not thunders loud could from this slumber deep
 of quiet death true image make him rise
 then from her ambush forth armida start
 swearing revenge and threatening torments smart

 lxvi
 "but when she looked on his face awhile
 and saw how sweet he breathed how still he lay
 how his fair eyes though closed seemed to smile
 at first she stayed astound with great dismay
 then sat her down so love can art beguile
 and as she sat and looked fled fast away
 her wrath that on his forehead gazed the maid
 as in his spring narcissus tooting laid

 lxvii
 "and with a veil she wiped now and then
 from his fair cheeks the globes of silver sweat
 and cool air gathered with a trembling fan
 to mitigate the rage of melting heat
 thus who would think it his hot eyeglance can
 of that cold frost dissolve the hardness great
 which late congealed the heart of that fair dame
 who late a foe a lover now became

 lxviii
 "of woodbines lilies and of roses sweet
 which proudly flowered through that wanton plain
 all platted fast well knit and joined meet
 she framed a soft but surely holding chain
 wherewith she bound his neck his hands and feet
 thus bound thus taken did the prince remain
 and in a coach which two old dragons drew
 she laid the sleeping knight and thence she flew

 lxix
 "nor turned she to damascus' kingdoms large
 nor to the fort built in asphalte's lake
 but jealous of her dear and precious charge
 and of her love ashamed the way did take
 to the wide ocean whither skiff or barge
 from us doth seld or never voyage make
 and there to frolic with her love awhile
 she chose a waste a sole and desert isle

 lxx
 "an isle that with her fellows bears the name
 of fortunate for temperate air and mould
 there in a mountain high alight the dame
 a hill obscured with shades of forests old
 upon whose sides the witch by art did frame
 continual snow sharp frost and winter cold
 but on the top fresh pleasant sweet and green
 beside a lake a palace built this queen

 lxxi
 "there in perpetual sweet and flowering spring
 she lives at ease and joys her lord at will
 the hardy youth from this strange prison bring
 your valors must directed by my skill
 and overcome each monster and each thing
 that guards the palace or that keeps the hill
 nor shall you want a guide or engines fit
 to bring you to the mount or conquer it

 lxxii
 "beside the stream yparted shall you find
 a dame in visage young but old in years
 her curled locks about her front are twined
 a partycolored robe of silk she wears
 this shall conduct you swift as air or wind
 or that flit bird that jove's hot weapon bears
 a faithful pilot cunning trusty sure
 as tiphys was or skilful palinure

 lxxiii
 "at the hill's foot whereon the witch doth dwell
 the serpents hiss and cast their poison vilde
 the ugly boars do rear their bristles fell
 there gape the bears and roar the lions wild
 but yet a rod i have can easily quell
 their rage and wrath and make them meek and mild
 yet on the top and height of all the hill
 the greatest danger lies and greatest ill

 lxxiv
 "there welleth out a fair clear bubbling spring
 whose waters pure the thirsty guests entice
 but in those liquors cold the secret sting
 of strange and deadly poison closed lies
 one sup thereof the drinker's heart doth bring
 to sudden joy whence laughter vain doth rise
 nor that strange merriment once stops or stays
 till with his laughter's end he end his days

 lxxv
 "then from those deadly wicked streams refrain
 your thirsty lips despise the dainty cheer
 you find exposed upon the grassy plain
 nor those false damsels once vouchsafe to hear
 that in melodious tunes their voices strain
 whose faces lovely smiling sweet appear
 but you their looks their voice their songs despise
 and enter fair armida's paradise

 lxxvi
 "the house is builded like a maze within
 with turning stairs false doors and winding ways
 the shape whereof plotted in vellum thin
 i will you give that all those sleights bewrays
 in midst a garden lies where many a gin
 and net to catch frail hearts false cupid lays
 there in the verdure of the arbors green
 with your brave champion lies the wanton queen

 lxxvii
 "but when she haply riseth from the knight
 and hath withdrawn her presence from the place
 then take a shield i have of diamonds bright
 and hold the same before the young man's face
 that he may glass therein his garments light
 and wanton soft attire and view his case
 that with the sight shame and disdain may move
 his heart to leave that base and servile love

 lxxviii
 "now resteth naught that needful is to tell
 but that you go secure safe sure and bold
 unseen the palace may you enter well
 and pass the dangers all i have foretold
 for neither art nor charm nor magic spell
 can stop your passage or your steps withhold
 nor shall armida so you guarded be
 your coming aught foreknow or once foresee

 lxxix
 "and eke as safe from that enchanted fort
 you shall return and scape unhurt away
 but now the time doth us to rest exhort
 and you must rise by peep of springing day"
 this said he led them through a narrow port
 into a lodging fair wherein they lay
 there glad and full of thoughts he left his guests
 and in his wonted bed the old man rests



 fifteenth book

 the argument
 the well instructed knights forsake their host
 and come where their strange bark in harbor lay
 and setting sail behold on egypt's coast
 the monarch's ships and armies in array
 their wind and pilot good the seas in post
 they pass and of long journeys make short way
 the farsought isle they find armida's charms
 they scorn they shun her sleights despise her arms


 i
 the rosyfingered morn with gladsome ray
 rose to her task from old tithonus' lap
 when their grave host came where the warriors lay
 and with him brought the shield the rod the map
 "arise" quoth he "ere lately broken day
 in his bright arms the round world fold or wrap
 all what i promised here i have them brought
 enough to bring armida's charms to naught"

 ii
 they started up and every tender limb
 in sturdy steel and stubborn plate they dight
 before the old man stalked they followed him
 through gloomy shades of sad and sable night
 through vaults obscure again and entries dim
 the way they came their steps remeasured right
 but at the flood arrived "farewell" quoth he
 "good luck your aid your guide good fortune be"

 iii
 the flood received them in his bottom low
 and lilt them up above his billows thin
 the waters so east up a branch or bough
 by violence first plunged and dived therein
 but when upon the shore the waves them throw
 the knights for their fair guide to look begin
 and gazing round a little bark they spied
 wherein a damsel sate the stern to guide

 iv
 upon her front her locks were curled new
 her eyes were courteous full of peace and love
 in look a saint an angel bright in show
 so in her visage grace and virtue strove
 her robe seemed sometimes red and sometimes blue
 and changed still as she did stir or move
 that look how oft man's eye beheld the same
 so oft the colors changed went and came

 v
 the feathers so that tender soft and plain
 about the dove's smooth neck close couched been
 do in one color never long remain
 but change their hue gainst glimpse of phoebus' sheen
 and now of rubies bright a vermeil chain
 now make a carknet rich of emeralds green
 now mingle both now alter turn and change
 to thousand colors rich pure fair and strange

 vi
 "enter this boat you happy men" she says
 "wherein through raging waves secure i ride
 to which all tempest storm and wind obeys
 all burdens light benign is stream and tide
 my lord that rules your journeys and your ways
 hath sent me here your servant and your guide"
 this said her shallop drove she gainst the sand
 and anchor cast amid the steadfast land

 vii
 they entered in her anchors she upwound
 and launched forth to sea her pinnace flit
 spread to the wind her sails she broad unbound
 and at the helm sat down to govern it
 swelled the flood that all his banks he drowned
 to bear the greatest ship of burthen fit
 yet was her fatigue little swift and light
 that at his lowest ebb bear it he might

 viii
 swifter than thought the friendly wind forth bore
 the sliding boat upon the rolling wave
 with curded foam and froth the billows hoar
 about the cable murmur roar and rave
 at last they came where all his watery store
 the flood in one deep channel did engrave
 and forth to greedy seas his streams he sent
 and so his waves his name himself he spent

 ix
 the wondrous boat scant touched the troubled main
 but all the sea still hushed and quiet was
 vanished the clouds ceased the wind and rain
 the tempests threatened overblow and pass
 a gentle breathing air made even and plain
 the azure face of heaven's smooth lookingglass
 and heaven itself smiled from the skies above
 with a calm clearness on the earth his love

 x
 by ascalon they sailed and forth drived
 toward the west their speedy course they frame
 in sight of gaza till the bark arrived
 a little port when first it took that name
 but since by others' loss so well it thrived
 a city great and rich that it became
 and there the shores and borders of the land
 they found as full of armed men as sand

 xi
 the passengers to landward turned their sight
 and there saw pitched many a stately tent
 soldier and footman captain lord and knight
 between the shore and city came and went
 huge elephants strong camels coursers light
 with horned hoofs the sandy ways outrent
 and in the haven many a ship and boat
 with mighty anchors fastened swim and float

 xii
 some spread their sails some with strong oars sweep
 the waters smooth and brush the buxom wave
 their breasts in sunder cleave the yielding deep
 the broken seas for anger foam and rave
 when thus their guide began "sir knights take keep
 how all these shores are spread with squadrons brave
 and troops of hardy knights yet on these sands
 the monarch scant hath gathered half his bands

 xiii
 "of egypt only these the forces are
 and aid from other lands they here attend
 for twixt the noonday sun and morning star
 all realms at his command do bow and bend
 so that i trust we shall return from far
 and bring our journey long to wished end
 before this king or his lieutenant shall
 these armies bring to zion's conquered wall"

 xiv
 while thus she said as soaring eagles fly
 mongst other birds securely through the air
 and mounting up behold with wakeful eye
 the radiant beams of old hyperion's hair
 her gondola so passed swiftly by
 twixt ship and ship withouten fear or care
 who should her follow trouble stop or stay
 and forth to sea made lucky speed and way

 xv
 themselves fornenst old raffia's town they fand
 a town that first to sailors doth appear
 as they from syria pass to egypt land
 the sterile coasts of barren rhinocere
 they passed and seas where casius hill doth stand
 that with his trees o'erspreads the waters near
 against whose roots breaketh the brackish wave
 where jove his temple pompey hath his grave

 xvi
 then damiata next where they behold
 how to the sea his tribute nilus pays
 by his seven mouths renowned in stories old
 and by an hundred more ignoble ways
 they pass the town built by the grecian bold
 of him called alexandria till our days
 and pharaoh's tower and isle removed of yore
 far from the land now joined to the shore

 xvii
 both crete and rhodes they left by north unseen
 and sailed along the coasts of afric lands
 whose sea towns fair but realms more inward been
 all full of monsters and of desert sands
 with her five cities then they left cyrene
 where that old temple of false hammon stands
 next ptolemais and that sacred wood
 whence spring the silent streams of lethe flood

 xviii
 the greater syrte that sailors often cast
 in peril great of death and loss extreme
 they compassed round about and safely passed
 the cape judeca and flood magra's stream
 then tripoli gainst which is malta placed
 that low and hid to lurk in seas doth seem
 the little syrte then and alzerhes isle
 where dwelt the folk that lotos ate erewhile

 xix
 next tunis on the crooked shore they spied
 whose bay a rock on either side defends
 tunis all towns in beauty wealth and pride
 above as far as libya's bounds extends
 gainst which from fair sicilia's fertile side
 his rugged front great lilybaeum bends
 the dame there pointed out where sometime stood
 rome's stately rival whilom carthage proud

 xx
 great carthage low in ashes cold doth lie
 her ruins poor the herbs in height scant pass
 so cities fall so perish kingdoms high
 their pride and pomp lies hid in sand and grass
 then why should mortal man repine to die
 whose life is air breath wind and body glass
 from thence the seas next bisert's walls they cleft
 and far sardinia on their right hand left

 xxi
 numidia's mighty plains they coasted then
 where wandering shepherds used their flocks to feed
 then bugia and argier the infamous den
 of pirates false oran they left with speed
 all tingitan they swiftly overren
 where elephants and angry lions breed
 where now the realms of fez and maroc be
 gainst which granada's shores and coasts they see

 xxii
 now are they there where first the sea brake in
 by great alcides' help as stories feign
 true may it be that where those floods begin
 it whilom was a firm and solid main
 before the sea there through did passage win
 and parted afric from the land of spain
 abila hence thence calpe great upsprings
 such power hath time to change the face of things

 xxiii
 four times the sun had spread his morning ray
 since first the dame launched forth her wondrous barge
 and never yet took port in creek or bay
 but fairly forward bore the knights her charge
 now through the strait her jolly ship made way
 and boldly sailed upon the ocean large
 but if the sea in midst of earth was great
 oh what was this wherein earth hath her seat

 xxiv
 now deep engulphed in the mighty flood
 they saw not gades nor the mountains near
 fled was the land and towns on land that stood
 heaven covered sea sea seemed the heavens to bear
 "at last fair lady" quoth ubaldo good
 "that in this endless main dost guide us here
 if ever man before here sailed tell
 or other lands here be wherein men dwell"

 xxv
 "great hercules" quoth she "when he had quailed
 the monsters fierce in afric and in spain
 and all along your coasts and countries sailed
 yet durst he not assay the ocean main
 within his pillars would he have impaled
 the overdaring wit of mankind vain
 till lord ulysses did those bounders pass
 to see and know he so desirous was

 xxvi
 "he passed those pillars and in open wave
 of the broad sea first his bold sails untwined
 but yet the greedy ocean was his grave
 naught helped him his skill gainst tide and wind
 with him all witness of his voyage brave
 lies buried there no truth thereof we find
 and they whom storm hath forced that way since
 are drowned all or unreturned from thence

 xxvii
 "so that this mighty sea is yet unsought
 where thousand isles and kingdoms lie unknown
 not void of men as some have vainly thought
 but peopled well and wonned like your own
 the land is fertile ground but scant well wrought
 air wholesome temperate sun grass proudly grown"
 "but" quoth ubaldo "dame i pray thee teach
 of that hid world what be the laws and speech"

 xxviii
 "as diverse be their nations" answered she
 "their tongues their rites their laws so different are
 some pray to beasts some to a stone or tree
 some to the earth the sun or morning star
 their meats unwholesome vile and hateful be
 some eat man's flesh and captives ta'en in war
 and all from calpe's mountain west that dwell
 in faith profane in life are rude and fell"

 xxix
 "but will our gracious god" the knight replied
 "that with his blood all sinful men hath bought
 his truth forever and his gospel hide
 from all those lands as yet unknown unsought"
 "oh no" quoth she "his name both far and wide
 shall there be known all learning thither brought
 nor shall these long and tedious ways forever
 your world and theirs their lands your kingdoms sever

 xxx
 "the time shall come that sailors shall disdain
 to talk or argue of alcides' streat
 and lands and seas that nameless yet remain
 shall well be known their boundaries site and seat
 the ships encompass shall the solid main
 as far as seas outstretch their waters great
 and measure all the world and with the sun
 about this earth this globe this compass run

 xxxi
 "a knight of genes shall have the hardiment
 upon this wondrous voyage first to wend
 nor winds nor waves that ships in sunder rent
 nor seas unused strange clime or pool unkenned
 nor other peril nor astonishment
 that makes frail hearts of men to bow and bend
 within abilas' strait shall keep and hold
 the noble spirit of this sailor bold

 xxxii
 "thy ship columbus shall her canvas wing
 spread o'er that world that yet concealed lies
 that scant swift fame her looks shall after bring
 though thousand plumes she have and thousand eyes
 let her of bacchus and alcides sing
 of thee to future age let this suffice
 that of thine acts she some forewarning give
 which shall in verse and noble story live"

 xxxiii
 thus talking swift twixt south and west they run
 and sliced out twixt froth and foam their way
 at once they saw before the setting sun
 behind the rising beam of springing day
 and when the morn her drops and dews begun
 to scatter broad upon the flowering lay
 far off a hill and mountain high they spied
 whose top the clouds environ clothe and hide

 xxxiv
 and drawing near the hill at ease they view
 when all the clouds were molten fallen and fled
 whose top pyramidwise did pointed show
 high narrow sharp the sides yet more outspread
 thence now and then fire flame and smoke outflew
 as from that hill whereunder lies in bed
 enceladus whence with imperious sway
 bright fire breaks out by night black smoke by day

 xxxv
 about the hill lay other islands small
 where other rocks crags cliffs and mountains stood
 the isles fortunate these elder time did call
 to which high heaven they reigned so kind and good
 and of his blessings rich so liberal
 that without tillage earth gives corn for food
 and grapes that swell with sweet and precious wine
 there without pruning yields the fertile vine

 xxxvi
 the olive fat there ever buds and flowers
 the honeydrops from hollow oaks distil
 the falling brook her silver streams downpours
 with gentle murmur from their native hill
 the western blast tempereth with dews and showers
 the sunny rays lest heat the blossoms kill
 the fields elysian as fond heathen sain
 were there where souls of men in bliss remain

 xxxvii
 to these their pilot steered "and now" quoth she
 "your voyage long to end is brought wellnear
 the happy isles of fortune now you see
 of which great fame and little truth you hear
 sweet wholesome pleasant fertile fat they be
 yet not so rich as fame reports they were"
 this said toward an island fresh she bore
 the first of ten that lies next afric's shore

 xxxviii
 when charles thus "if worthy governess
 to our good speed such tarriance be no let
 upon this isle that heaven so fair doth bless
 to view the place on land awhile us set
 to know the folk and what god they confess
 and all whereby man's heart may knowledge get
 that i may tell the wonders therein seen
 another day and say there have i been"

 xxxix
 she answered him "well fits this high desire
 thy noble heart yet cannot i consent
 for heaven's decree firm stable and entire
 thy wish repugns and gainst thy will is bent
 nor yet the time hath titan's gliding fire
 met forth prefixed for this discoverment
 nor is it lawful of the ocean main
 that you the secrets know or known explain

 xl
 "to you withouten needle map or card
 it's given to pass these seas and there arrive
 where in strong prison lies your knight imbarred
 and of her prey you must the witch deprive
 if further to aspire you be prepared
 in vain gainst fate and heaven's decree you strive"
 while thus she said the first seen isle gave place
 and high and rough the second showed his face

 xli
 they saw how eastward stretched in order long
 the happy islands sweetly flowering lay
 and how the seas betwixt those isles enthrong
 and how they shouldered land from land away
 in seven of them the people rude among
 the shady trees their sheds had built of clay
 the rest lay waste unless wild beasts unseen
 or wanton nymphs roamed on the mountains green

 xlii
 a secret place they found in one of those
 where the cleft shore sea in his bosom takes
 and 'twixt his stretched arms doth fold and close
 an ample bay a rock the haven makes
 which to the main doth his broad back oppose
 whereon the roaring billow cleaves and breaks
 and here and there two crags like turrets high
 point forth a port to all that sail thereby

 xliii
 the quiet seas below lie safe and still
 the green wood like a garland grows aloft
 sweet caves within cool shades and waters shrill
 where lie the nymphs on moss and ivy soft
 no anchor there needs hold her frigate still
 nor cable twisted sure though breaking oft
 into this desert silent quiet glad
 entered the dame and there her haven made

 xliv
 "the palace proudly built" quoth she "behold
 that sits on top of yonder mountain's height
 of christ's true faith there lies the champion bold
 in idleness love fancy folly light
 when phoebus shall his rising beams unfold
 prepare you gainst the hill to mount upright
 nor let this stay in your bold hearts breed care
 for save that one all hours unlucky are

 xlv
 "but yet this evening if you make good speed
 to that hill's foot with daylight might you pass"
 thus said the dame their guide and they agreed
 and took their leave and leaped forth on the grass
 they found the way that to the hill doth lead
 and softly went that neither tired was
 but at the mountain's foot they both arrived
 before the sun his team in waters dived

 xlvi
 they saw how from the crags and clefts below
 his proud and stately pleasant top grew out
 and how his sides were clad with frost and snow
 the height was green with herbs and flowerets sout
 like hairy locks the trees about him grow
 the rocks of ice keep watch and ward about
 the tender roses and the lilies new
 thus art can nature change and kind subdue

 xlvii
 within a thick a dark and shady plot
 at the hill's foot that night the warriors dwell
 but when the sun his rays bright shining hot
 dispread of golden light the eternal well
 "up up" they cried and fiercely up they got
 and climbed boldly gainst the mountain fell
 but forth there crept from whence i cannot say
 an ugly serpent which forestalled their way

 xlviii
 armed with golden scales his head and crest
 he lifted high his neck swelled great with ire
 flamed his eyes and hiding with his breast
 all the broad path he poison breathed and fire
 now reached he forth in folds and forward pressed
 now would he back in rolls and heaps retire
 thus he presents himself to guard the place
 the knights pressed forward with assured pace

 xlix
 charles drew forth his brand to strike the snake
 ubaldo cried "stay my companion dear
 will you with sword or weapon battle make
 against this monster that affronts us here"
 this said he gan his charmed rod to shake
 so that the serpent durst not hiss for fear
 but fled and dead for dread fell on the grass
 and so the passage plain eath open was

 l
 a little higher on the way they met
 a lion fierce that hugely roared and cried
 his crest he reared high and open set
 of his broadgaping jaws the furnace wide
 his stern his back oft smote his rage to whet
 but when the sacred staff he once espied
 a trembling fear through his bold heart was spread
 his native wrath was gone and swift he fled

 li
 the hardy couple on their way forth wend
 and met a host that on them roar and gape
 of savage beasts tofore unseen unkend
 differing in voice in semblance and in shape
 all monsters which hot afric doth forthsend
 twixt nilus atlas and the southern cape
 were all there met and all wild beasts besides
 hyrcania breeds or hyrcane forest hides

 lii
 but yet that fierce that strange and savage host
 could not in presence of those worthies stand
 but fled away their heart and courage lost
 when lord ubaldo shook his charming wand
 no other let their passage stopped or crossed
 till on the mountain's top themselves they land
 save that the ice the frost and drifted snow
 oft made them feeble weary faint and slow

 liii
 but having passed all that frozen ground
 and overgone that winter sharp and keen
 a warm mild pleasant gentle sky they found
 that overspread a large and ample green
 the winds breathed spikenard myrrh and balm around
 the blasts were firm unchanged stable been
 not as elsewhere the winds now rise now fall
 and phoebus there aye shines sets not at all

 liv
 not as elsewhere now sunshine bright now showers
 now heat now cold there interchanged were
 but everlasting spring mild heaven down pours
 in which nor rain nor storm nor clouds appear
 nursing to fields their grass to grass his flowers
 to flowers their smell to trees the leaves they bear
 there by a lake a stately palace stands
 that overlooks all mountains seas and lands

 lv
 the passage hard against the mountain steep
 these travellers had faint and weary made
 that through those grassy plains they scantly creep
 they walked they rested oft they went they stayed
 when from the rocks that seemed for joy to weep
 before their feet a dropping crystal played
 enticing them to drink and on the flowers
 the plenteous spring a thousand streams down pours

 lvi
 all which united in the springing grass
 ate forth a channel through the tender green
 and underneath eternal shade did pass
 with murmur shrill cold pure and scantly seen
 yet so transparent that perceived was
 the bottom rich and sands that golden been
 and on the brims the silken grass aloft
 proffered them seats sweet easy fresh and soft

 lvii
 "see here the stream of laughter see the spring"
 quoth they "of danger and of deadly pain
 here fond desire must by fair governing
 be ruled our lust bridled with wisdom's rein
 our ears be stopped while these sirens sing
 their notes enticing man to pleasure vain"
 thus passed they forward where the stream did make
 an ample pond a large and spacious lake

 lviii
 there on a table was all dainty food
 that sea that earth or liquid air could give
 and in the crystal of the laughing flood
 they saw two naked virgins bathe and dive
 that sometimes toying sometimes wrestling stood
 sometimes for speed and skill in swimming strive
 now underneath they dived now rose above
 and ticing baits laid forth of lust and love

 lix
 these naked wantons tender fair and white
 moved so far the warriors' stubborn hearts
 that on their shapes they gazed with delight
 the nymphs applied their sweet alluring arts
 and one of them above the waters quite
 lift up her head her breasts and higher parts
 and all that might weak eyes subdue and take
 her lower beauties veiled the gentle lake

 lx
 as when the morning star escaped and fled
 from greedy waves with dewy beams up flies
 or as the queen of love new born and bred
 of the ocean's fruitful froth did first arise
 so vented she her golden locks forth shed
 round pearls and crystal moist therein which lies
 but when her eyes upon the knights she cast
 she start and feigned her of their sight aghast

 lxi
 and her fair locks that in a knot were tied
 high on her crown she 'gan at large unfold
 which falling long and thick and spreading wide
 the ivory soft and white mantled in gold
 thus her fair skin the dame would clothe and hide
 and that which hid it no less fair was hold
 thus clad in waves and locks her eyes divine
 from them ashamed did she turn and twine

 lxii
 withal she smiled and she blushed withal
 her blush her smilings smiles her blushing graced
 over her face her amber tresses fall
 whereunder love himself in ambush placed
 at last she warbled forth a treble small
 and with sweet looks her sweet songs interlaced
 "oh happy men i that have the grace" quoth she
 "this bliss this heaven this paradise to see

 lxiii
 "this is the place wherein you may assuage
 your sorrows past here is that joy and bliss
 that flourished in the antique golden age
 here needs no law here none doth aught amiss
 put off those arms and fear not mars his rage
 your sword your shield your helmet needless is
 then consecrate them here to endless rest
 you shall love's champions be and soldiers blest

 lxiv
 "the fields for combat here are beds of down
 or heaped lilies under shady brakes
 but come and see our queen with golden crown
 that all her servants blest and happy makes
 she will admit you gently for her own
 numbered with those that of her joy partakes
 but first within this lake your dust and sweat
 wash off and at that table sit and eat"

 lxv
 while thus she sung her sister lured them nigh
 with many a gesture kind and loving show
 to music's sound as dames in court apply
 their cunning feet and dance now swift now slow
 but still the knights unmoved passed by
 these vain delights for wicked charms they know
 nor could their heavenly voice or angel's look
 surprise their hearts if eye or ear they took

 lxvi
 for if that sweetness once but touched their hearts
 and proffered there to kindle cupid's fire
 straight armed reason to his charge up starts
 and quencheth lust and killeth fond desire
 thus scorned were the dames their wiles and arts
 and to the palace gates the knights retire
 while in their stream the damsels dived sad
 ashamed disgraced for that repulse they had



 sixteenth book

 the argument
 the searchers pass through all the palace bright
 where in sweet prison lies rinaldo pent
 and do so much that full of rage and spite
 with them he goes sad shamed discontent
 with plaints and prayers to retain her knight
 armida strives he hears but thence he went
 and she forlorn her palace great and fair
 destroys for grief and flies thence through the air


 i
 the palace great is builded rich and round
 and in the centre of the inmost hold
 there lies a garden sweet on fertile ground
 fairer than that where grew the trees of gold
 the cunning sprites had buildings reared around
 with doors and entries false a thousandfold
 a labyrinth they made that fortress brave
 like daedal's prison or porsenna's grave

 ii
 the knights passed through the castle's largest gate
 though round about an hundred ports there shine
 the doorleaves framed of carved silverplate
 upon their golden hinges turn and twine
 they stayed to view this work of wit and state
 the workmanship excelled the substance fine
 for all the shapes in that rich metal wrought
 save speech of living bodies wanted naught

 iii
 alcides there sat telling tales and spun
 among the feeble troops of damsels mild
 he that the fiery gates of hell had won
 and heaven upheld false love stood by and smiled
 armed with his club fair iole forth run
 his club with blood of monsters foul defiled
 and on her back his lion's skin had she
 too rough a bark for such a tender tree

 iv
 beyond was made a sea whose azure flood
 the hoary froth crushed from the surges blue
 wherein two navies great well ranged stood
 of warlike ships fire from their arms outflew
 the waters burned about their vessels good
 such flames the gold therein enchased threw
 caesar his romans hence the asian kings
 thence antony and indian princes brings

 v
 the cyclades seemed to swim amid the main
 and hill gainst hill and mount gainst mountain smote
 with such great fury met those armies twain
 here burnt a ship there sunk a bark or boat
 here darts and wildfire flew there drowned or slain
 of princes dead the bodies fleet and float
 here caesar wins and yonder conquered been
 the eastern ships there fled the egyptian queen

 vi
 antonius eke himself to flight betook
 the empire lost to which he would aspire
 yet fled not he nor fight for fear forsook
 but followed her drawn on by fond desire
 well might you see within his troubled look
 strive and contend love courage shame and ire
 oft looked he back oft gazed he on the fight
 but oftener on his mistress and her flight

 vii
 then in the secret creeks of fruitful nile
 cast in her lap he would sad death await
 and in the pleasure of her lovely smile
 sweeten the bitter stroke of cursed fate
 all this did art with curious hand compile
 in the rich metal of that princely gate
 the knights these stories viewed first and last
 which seen they forward pressed and in they passed

 viii
 as through his channel crooked meander glides
 with turns and twines and rolls now to now fro
 whose streams run forth there to the salt sea sides
 here back return and to their springward go
 such crooked paths such ways this palace hides
 yet all the maze their map described so
 that through the labyrinth they got in fine
 as theseus did by ariadne's line

 ix
 when they had passed all those troubled ways
 the garden sweet spread forth her green to show
 the moving crystal from the fountains plays
 fair trees high plants strange herbs and flowerets new
 sunshiny hills dales hid from phoebus' rays
 groves arbors mossy caves at once they view
 and that which beauty moat most wonder brought
 nowhere appeared the art which all this wrought

 x
 so with the rude the polished mingled was
 that natural seemed all and every part
 nature would craft in counterfeiting pass
 and imitate her imitator art
 mild was the air the skies were clear as glass
 the trees no whirlwind felt nor tempest smart
 but ere the fruit drop off the blossom comes
 this springs that falls that ripeneth and this blooms

 xi
 the leaves upon the selfsame bough did hide
 beside the young the old and ripened fig
 here fruit was green there ripe with vermeil side
 the apples new and old grew on one twig
 the fruitful vine her arms spread high and wide
 that bended underneath their clusters big
 the grapes were tender here hard young and sour
 there purple ripe and nectar sweet forth pour

 xii
 the joyous birds hid under greenwood shade
 sung merry notes on every branch and bough
 the wind that in the leaves and waters played
 with murmur sweet now sung and whistled now
 ceased the birds the wind loud answer made
 and while they sung it rumbled soft and low
 thus were it hap or cunning chance or art
 the wind in this strange music bore his part

 xiii
 with partycolored plumes' and purple bill
 a wondrous bird among the rest there flew
 that in plain speech sung lovelays loud and shrill
 her leden was like human language true
 so much she talked and with such wit and skill
 that strange it seemed how much good she knew
 her feathered fellows all stood hush to hear
 dumb was the wind the waters silent were

 xiv
 "the gently budding rose" quoth she "behold
 that first scant peeping forth with virgin beams
 half ope half shut her beauties doth upfold
 in their dear leaves and less seen fairer seems
 and after spreads them forth more broad and bold
 then languisheth and dies in last extremes
 nor seems the same that decked bed and bower
 of many a lady late and paramour

 xv
 "so in the passing of a day doth pass
 the bud and blossom of the life of man
 nor e'er doth flourish more but like the grass
 cut down becometh withered pale and wan
 oh gather then the rose while time thou hast
 short is the day done when it scant began
 gather the rose of love while yet thou mayest
 loving be loved embracing be embraced"

 xvi
 he ceased and as approving all he spoke
 the choir of birds their heavenly tunes renew
 the turtles sighed and sighs with kisses broke
 the fowls to shades unseen by pairs withdrew
 it seemed the laurel chaste and stubborn oak
 and all the gentle trees on earth that grew
 it seemed the land the sea and heaven above
 all breathed out fancy sweet and sighed out love

 xvii
 through all this music rare and strong consent
 of strange allurements sweet bove mean and measure
 severe firm constant still the knights forthwent
 hardening their hearts gainst false enticing pleasure
 twixt leaf and leaf their sight before they sent
 and after crept themselves at ease and leisure
 till they beheld the queen set with their knight
 besides the lake shaded with boughs from sight

 xviii
 her breasts were naked for the day was hot
 her locks unbound waved in the wanton wind
 some deal she sweat tired with the game you wot
 her sweatdrops bright white round like pearls of ind
 her humid eyes a fiery smile forthshot
 that like sunbeams in silver fountains shined
 o'er him her looks she hung and her soft breast
 the pillow was where he and love took rest

 xix
 his hungry eyes upon her face he fed
 and feeding them so pined himself away
 and she declining often down her head
 his lips his cheeks his eyes kissed as he lay
 wherewith he sighed as if his soul had fled
 from his frail breast to hers and there would stay
 with her beloved sprite the armed pair
 these follies all beheld and this hot fare

 xx
 down by the lovers' side there pendent was
 a crystal mirror bright pure smooth and neat
 he rose and to his mistress held the glass
 a noble page graced with that service great
 she with glad looks he with inflamed alas
 beauty and love beheld both in one seat
 yet them in sundry objects each espies
 she in the glass he saw them in her eyes

 xxi
 her to command to serve it pleased the knight
 he proud of bondage of her empire she
 "my dear" he said "that blessest with thy sight
 even blessed angels turn thine eyes to me
 for painted in my heart and portrayed right
 thy worth thy beauties and perfections be
 of which the form the shape and fashion best
 not in this glass is seen but in my breast

 xxii
 "and if thou me disdain yet be content
 at least so to behold thy lovely hue
 that while thereon thy looks are fixed and bent
 thy happy eyes themselves may see and view
 so rare a shape no crystal can present
 no glass contain that heaven of beauties true
 oh let the skies thy worthy mirror be
 and in dear stars try shape and image see"

 xxiii
 and with that word she smiled and ne'ertheless
 her lovetoys still she used and pleasures bold
 her hair that done she twisted up in tress
 and looser locks in silken laces rolled
 her curles garlandwise she did updress
 wherein like rich enamel laid on gold
 the twisted flowers smiled and her white breast
 the lilies there that spring with roses dressed

 xxiv
 the jolly peacock spreads not half so fair
 the eyed feathers of his pompous train
 nor golden iris so bends in the air
 her twentycolored bow through clouds of rain
 yet all her ornaments strange rich and rare
 her girdle did in price and beauty stain
 nor that with scorn which tuscan guilla lost
 igor venus ceston could match this for cost

 xxv
 of mild denays of tender scorns of sweet
 repulses war peace hope despair joy fear
 of smiles jests mirth woe grief and sad regreet
 sighs sorrows tears embracements kisses dear
 that mixed first by weight and measure meet
 then at an easy fire attempered were
 this wondrous girdle did armida frame
 and when she would be loved wore the same

 xxvi
 but when her wooing fit was brought to end
 she congee took kissed him and went her way
 for once she used every day to wend
 bout her affairs her spells and charms to say
 the youth remained yet had no power to bend
 one step from thence but used there to stray
 mongst the sweet birds through every walk and grove
 alone save for an hermit false called love

 xxvii
 and when the silence deep and friendly shade
 recalled the lovers to their wonted sport
 in a fair room for pleasure built they laid
 and longest nights with joys made sweet and short
 now while the queen her household things surveyed
 and left her lord her garden and disport
 the twain that hidden in the bushes were
 before the prince in glistering arms appear

 xxviii
 as the fierce steed for age withdrawn from war
 wherein the glorious beast had always wone
 that in vile rest from fight sequestered far
 feeds with the mares at large his service done
 if arms he see or hear the trumpet's jar
 he neigheth loud and thither fast doth run
 and wiseth on his back the armed knight
 longing for jousts for tournament and fight

 xxix
 so fared rinaldo when the glorious light
 of their bright harness glistered in his eyes
 his noble sprite awaked at that sight
 his blood began to warm his heart to rise
 though drunk with ease devoid of wonted might
 on sleep till then his weakened virtue lies
 ubaldo forward stepped and to him hield
 of diamonds clear that pure and precious shield

 xxx
 upon the targe his looks amazed he bent
 and therein all his wanton habit spied
 his civet balm and perfumes redolent
 how from his locks they smoked and mantle wide
 his sword that many a pagan stout had shent
 bewrapped with flowers hung idly by his side
 so nicely decked that it seemed the knight
 wore it for fashion's sake but not for fight

 xxxi
 as when from sleep and idle dreams abraid
 a man awaked calls home his wits again
 so in beholding his attire he played
 but yet to view himself could not sustain
 his looks he downward cast and naught he said
 grieved shamed sad he would have died fain
 and oft he wished the earth or ocean wide
 would swallow him and so his errors hide

 xxxii
 ubaldo took the time and thus begun
 "all europe now and asia be in war
 and all that christ adore and fame have won
 in battle strong in syria fighting are
 but thee alone bertoldo's noble son
 this little corner keeps exiled far
 from all the world buried in sloth and shame
 a carpet champion for a wanton dame

 xxxiii
 "what letharge hath in drowsiness uppenned
 thy courage thus what sloth doth thee infect
 up up our camp and godfrey for thee send
 thee fortune praise and victory expect
 come fatal champion bring to happy end
 this enterprise begun all that sect
 which oft thou shaken hast to earth full low
 with thy sharp brand strike down kill overthrow"

 xxxiv
 this said the noble infant stood a space
 confused speechless senseless illashamed
 but when that shame to just disdain gave place
 to fierce disdain from courage sprung untamed
 another redness blushed through his face
 whence worthy anger shone displeasure flamed
 his nice attire in scorn he rent and tore
 for of his bondage vile that witness bore

 xxxv
 that done he hasted from the charmed fort
 and through the maze passed with his searchers twain
 armida of her mount and chiefest port
 wondered to find the furious keeper slain
 awhile she feared but she knew in short
 that her dear lord was fled then saw she plain
 ah woful sight how from her gates the man
 in haste in fear in wrath in anger ran

 xxxvi
 "whither o cruel leavest thou me alone"
 she would have cried her grief her speeches stayed
 so that her woful words are backward gone
 and in her heart a bitter echo made
 poor soul of greater skill than she was one
 whose knowledge from her thus her joy conveyed
 this wist she well yet had desire to prove
 if art could keep if charms recall her love

 xxxvii
 all what the witches of thessalia land
 with lips unpure yet ever said or spake
 words that could make heaven's rolling circles stand
 and draw the damned ghosts from limbo lake
 all well she knew but yet no time she fand
 to use her knowledge or her charms to make
 but left her arts and forth she ran to prove
 if single beauty were best charm for love

 xxxviii
 she ran nor of her honor took regard
 oh where be all her vaunts and triumphs now
 love's empire great of late she made or marred
 to her his subjects humbly bend and bow
 and with her pride mixed was a scorn so hard
 that to be loved she loved yet whilst they woo
 her lovers all she hates that pleased her will
 to conquer men and conquered so to kill

 xxxix
 but now herself disdained abandoned
 ran after him that from her fled in scorn
 and her despised beauty labored
 with humble plaints and prayers to adorn
 she ran and hasted after him that fled
 through frost and snow through brier bush and thorn
 and sent her cries on message her before
 that reached not him till he had reached the shore

 xl
 "oh thou that leav'st but half behind" quoth she
 "of my poor heart and half with thee dost carry
 oh take this part or render that to me
 else kill them both at once ah tarry tarry
 hear my last words no parting kiss of thee
 i crave for some more fit with thee to marry
 keep them unkind what fear'st thou if thou stay
 thou may'st deny as well as run away"

 xli
 at this rinaldo stopped stood still and stayed
 she came sad breathless weary faint and weak
 so woebegone was never nymph or maid
 and yet her beauty's pride grief could not break
 on him she looked she gazed but naught she said
 she would not could not or she durst not speak
 at her he looked not glanced not if he did
 those glances shamefaced were close secret hid

 xlii
 as cunning singers ere they strain on high
 in loud melodious tunes their gentle voice
 prepare the hearers' ears to harmony
 with feignings sweet low notes and warbles choice
 so she not having yet forgot pardie
 her wonted shifts and sleights in cupid's toys
 a sequence first of sighs and sobs forthcast
 to breed compassion dear then spake at last

 xliii
 "suppose not cruel that i come to vow
 or pray as ladies do their loves and lords
 such were we late if thou disdain it now
 or scorn to grant such grace as love affords
 at least yet as an enemy listen thou
 sworn foes sometimes will talk and chaffer words
 for what i ask thee may'st thou grant right well
 and lessen naught thy wrath and anger fell

 xliv
 "if me thou hate and in that hate delight
 i come not to appease thee hate me still
 it's like for like i bore great hate and spite
 gainst christians all chiefly i wish thee ill
 i was a pagan born and all my might
 against godfredo bent mine art and skill
 i followed thee took thee and bore thee far
 to this strange isle and kept thee safe from war

 xlv
 "and more which more thy hate may justly move
 more to thy loss more to thy shame and grief
 i thee inchanted and allured to love
 wicked deceit craft worthy sharp reprief
 mine honor gave i thee all gifts above
 and of my beauties made thee lord and chief
 and to my suitors old what i denayed
 that gave i thee my lover new unprayed

 xlvi
 "but reckon that among my faults and let
 those many wrongs provoke thee so to wrath
 that hence thou run and that at naught thou set
 this pleasant house so many joys which hath
 go travel pass the seas fight conquest get
 destroy our faith what shall i say our faith
 ah no no longer ours before thy shrine
 alone i pray thou cruel saint of mine

 xlvii
 "all only let me go with thee unkind
 a small request although i were thy foe
 the spoiler seldom leaves the prey behind
 who triumphs lets his captives with him go
 among thy prisoners poor armida bind
 and let the camp increase thy praises so
 that thy beguiler so thou couldst beguile
 and point at me thy thrall and bondslave vile

 xlviii
 "despised bondslave since my lord doth hate
 these locks why keep i them or hold them dear
 come cut them off that to my servile state
 my habit answer may and all my gear
 i follow thee in spite of death and fate
 through battles fierce where dangers most appear
 courage i have and strength enough perchance
 to lead thy courser spare and bear thy lance

 xlix
 "i will or bear or be myself thy shield
 and to defend thy life will lose mine own
 this breast this bosom soft shall be thy bield
 gainst storms of arrows darts and weapons thrown
 thy foes pardie encountering thee in field
 will spare to strike thee mine affection known
 lest me they wound nor will sharp vengeance take
 on thee for this despised beauty's sake

 l
 "o wretch dare i still vaunt or help invoke
 from this poor beauty scorned and disdained"
 she said no more her tears her speeches broke
 which from her eyes like streams from springs down rained
 she would have caught him by the hand or cloak
 but he stepped backward and himself restrained
 conquered his will his heart ruth softened not
 there plaints no issue love no entrance got

 li
 love entered not to kindle in his breast
 which reason late had quenched his wonted flame
 yet entered pity in the place at least
 love's sister but a chaste and sober dame
 and stirred him so that hardly he suppressed
 the springing tears that to his eyes up came
 but yet even there his plaints repressed were
 and as he could he looked and feigned cheer

 lii
 "madam" quoth he "for your distress i grieve
 and would amend it if i might or could
 from your wise heart that fond affection drive
 i cannot hate nor scorn you though i would
 i seek no vengeance wrongs i all forgive
 nor you my servant nor my foe i hold
 truth is you erred and your estate forgot
 too great your hate was and your love too hot

 liii
 "but those are common faults and faults of kind
 excused by nature by your sex and years
 i erred likewise if i pardon find
 none can condemn you that our trespass hears
 your dear remembrance will i keep in mind
 in joys in woes in comforts hopes and fears
 call me your soldier and your knight as far
 as christian faith permits and asia's war

 liv
 "ah let our faults and follies here take end
 and let our errors past you satisfy
 and in this angle of the world ypend
 let both the fame and shame thereof now die
 from all the earth where i am known and kenned
 i wish this fact should still concealed lie
 nor yet in following me poor knight disgrace
 your worth your beauty and your princely race

 lv
 "stay here in peace i go nor wend you may
 with me my guide your fellowship denies
 stay here or hence depart some better way
 and calm your thoughts you are both sage and wise"
 while thus he spoke her passions found no stay
 but here and there she turned and rolled her eyes
 and staring on his face awhile at last
 thus in foul terms her bitter wrath forth brast

 lvi
 "of sophia fair thou never wert the child
 nor of the azzain race ysprung thou art
 the mad seawaves thee hare some tigress wild
 on caucasus' cold crags nursed thee apart
 ah cruel man l in whom no token mild
 appears of pity ruth or tender heart
 could not my griefs my woes my plaints and all
 one sigh strain from thy breast one tear make fall

 lvii
 "what shall i say or how renew my speech
 he scorns me leaves me bids me call him mine
 the victor hath his foe within his reach
 yet pardons her that merits death and pine
 hear how he counsels me how he can preach
 like chaste xenocrates gainst love divine
 o heavens o gods why do these men of shame
 thus spoil your temples and blaspheme your name

 lviii
 "go cruel go go with such peace such rest
 such joy such comfort as thou leavest me here
 my angry soul discharged from this weak breast
 shall haunt thee ever and attend thee near
 and furylike in snakes and firebrands dressed
 shall aye torment thee whom it late held dear
 and if thou 'scape the seas the rocks and sands
 and come to fight among the pagan bands

 lix
 "there lying wounded mongst the hurt and slain
 of these my wrongs thou shalt the vengeance bear
 and oft armida shalt thou call in vain
 at thy last gasp this hope i soon to hear"
 here fainted she with sorrow grief and pain
 her latest words scant well expressed were
 but in a swoon on earth outstretched she lies
 stiff were her frozen limbs closed were her eyes

 lx
 thou closed thine eyes armida heaven envied
 ease to thy grief or comfort to thy woe
 ah open then again see tears down slide
 from his kind eyes whom thou esteem'st thy foe
 if thou hadst heard his sighs had mollified
 thine anger hard he sighed and mourned so
 and as he could with sad and rueful look
 his leave of thee and last farewell he took

 lxi
 what should he do leave on the naked sand
 this woful lady half alive half dead
 kindness forbade pity did that withstand
 but hard constraint alas did thence him lead
 away he went the west wind blew from land
 mongst the rich tresses of their pilot's head
 and with that golden sail the waves she cleft
 to land he looked till land unseen he left

 lxii
 waked from her trance foresaken speechless sad
 armida wildly stared and gazed about
 "and is he gone" quoth she "nor pity had
 to leave me thus twixt life and death in doubt
 could he not stay could not the traitorlad
 from this last trance help or recall me out
 and do i love him still and on this sand
 still unrevenged still mourn still weeping stand

 lxiii
 "fie no complaints farewell with arms and art
 i will pursue to death this spiteful knight
 not earth's low centre nor sea's deepest part
 not heaven nor hell can shield him from my might
 i will o'ertake him take him cleave his heart
 such vengeance fits a wronged lover's spite
 in cruelty that cruel knight surpass
 i will but what avail vain words alas

 lxiv
 "o fool thou shouldest have been cruel than
 for then this cruel well deserved thine ire
 when thou in prison hadst entrapped the man
 now dead with cold too late thou askest fire
 but though my wit my cunning nothing can
 some other means shall work my heart's desire
 to thee my beauty thine be all these wrongs
 vengeance to thee to thee revenge belongs

 lxv
 "thou shalt be his reward with murdering brand
 that dare this traitor of his head deprive
 o you my lovers on this rock doth stand
 the castle of her love for whom you strive
 i the sole heir of all damascus land
 for this revenge myself and kingdom give
 if by this price my will i cannot gain
 nature gives beauty fortune wealth in vain

 lxvi
 "but thee vain gift vain beauty thee i scorn
 i hate the kingdom which i have to give
 i hate myself and rue that i was born
 only in hope of sweet revenge i live"
 thus raging with fell ire she gan return
 from that bare shore in haste and homeward drive
 and as true witness of her frantic ire
 her locks waved loose face shone eyes sparkled fire

 lxvii
 when she came home she called with outcries shrill
 a thousand devils in limbo deep that won
 black clouds the skies with horrid darkness fill
 and pale for dread became the eclipsed sun
 the whirlwind blustered big on every hill
 and hell to roar under her feet begun
 you might have heard how through the palace wide
 some spirits howled some barked some hissed some cried

 lxviii
 a shadow blacker than the mirkest night
 environed all the place with darkness sad
 wherein a firebrand gave a dreadful light
 kindled in hell by tisiphone the mad
 vanished the shade the sun appeared in sight
 pale were his beams the air was nothing glad
 and all the palace vanished was and gone
 nor of so great a work was left one stone

 lxix
 as oft the clouds frame shapes of castles great
 amid the air that little time do last
 but are dissolved by wind or titan's heat
 or like vain dreams soon made and sooner past
 the palace vanished so nor in his seat
 left aught but rocks and crags by kind there placed
 she in her coach which two old serpents drew
 sate down and as she used away she flew

 lxx
 she broke the clouds and cleft the yielding sky
 and bout her gathered tempest storm and wind
 the lands that view the south pole flew she by
 and left those unknown countries far behind
 the straits of hercules she passed which lie
 twixt spain and afric nor her flight inclined
 to north or south but still did forward ride
 o'er seas and streams till syria's coasts she spied

 lxxi
 now she went forward to damascus fair
 but of her country dear she fled the sight
 and guided to asphaltes' lake her chair
 where stood her castle there she ends her flight
 and from her damsels far she made repair
 to a deep vault far from resort and light
 where in sad thoughts a thousand doubts she cast
 till grief and shame to wrath gave place at last

 lxxii
 "i will not hence" quoth she "till egypt's lord
 in aid of zion's king his host shall move
 then will i use all helps that charms afford
 and change my shape or sex if so behove
 well can i handle bow or lance or sword
 the worthies all will aid me for my love
 i seek revenge and to obtain the same
 farewell regard of honor farewell shame

 lxxiii
 "nor let mine uncle and protector me
 reprove for this he most deserves the blame
 my heart and sex that weak and tender be
 he bent to deeds that maidens ill became
 his niece a wandering damsel first made he
 he spurred my youth and i cast off my shame
 his be the fault if aught gainst mine estate
 i did for love or shall commit for hate"

 lxxiv
 this said her knights her ladies pages squires
 she all assembleth and for journey fit
 in such fair arms and vestures them attires
 as showed her wealth and well declared her wit
 and forward marched full of strange desires
 nor rested she by day or night one whit
 till she came there where all the eastern bands
 their kings and princes lay on gaza's sands



 seventeenth book

 the argument
 egypt's great host in battleray forth brought
 the caliph sends with godfrey's power to fight
 armida who rinaldo's ruin sought
 to them adjoins herself and syria's might
 to satisfy her cruel will and thought
 she gives herself to him that kills her knight
 he takes his fatal arms and in his shield
 his ancestors and their great deeds beheld


 i
 gaza the city on the frontier stands
 of juda's realm as men to egypt ride
 built near the sea beside it of dry sands
 huge wildernesses lie and deserts wide
 which the strong winds lift from the parched lands
 and toss like roaring waves in roughest tide
 that from those storms poor passengers almost
 no refuge find but there are drowned and lost

 ii
 within this town won from the turks of yore
 strong garrison the king of egypt placed
 and for it nearer was and fitted more
 that high emprise to which his thoughts he cast
 he left great memphis and to gaza bore
 his regal throne and there from countries vast
 of his huge empire all the puissant host
 assembled he and mustered on the coast

 iii
 come say my muse what manner times these were
 and in those times how stood the state of things
 what power this monarch had what arms they bear
 what nations subject and what friends he brings
 from all lands the southern ocean near
 or morning star came princes dukes and kings
 and only thou of half the world wellnigh
 the armies lords and captains canst descry

 iv
 when egypt from the greekish emperor
 rebelled first and christ's true faith denied
 of mahomet's descent a warrior
 there set his throne and ruled that kingdom wide
 caliph he hight and caliphs since that hour
 are his successors named all beside
 so nilus old his kings long time had seen
 that ptolemies and pharaohs called had been

 v
 established was that kingdom in short while
 and grew so great that over asia's lands
 and lybia's realms it stretched many a mile
 from syria's coasts as far as cirene sands
 and southward passed gainst the course of nile
 through the hot clime where burnt syene stands
 hence bounded in with sandy deserts waste
 and thence with euphrates' rich flood embraced

 vi
 maremma myrrh and spices that doth bring
 and all the rich red sea it comprehends
 and to those lands toward the morning spring
 that lie beyond that gulf it far extends
 great is that empire greater by the king
 that rules it now whose worth the land amends
 and makes more famous lord thereof by blood
 by wisdom valor and all virtues good

 vii
 with turks and persians war he oft did wage
 and oft he won and sometimes lost the field
 nor could his adverse fortune aught assuage
 his valor's heat or make his proud heart yield
 but when he grew unfit for war through age
 he sheathed his sword and laid aside his shield
 but yet his warlike mind he laid not down
 nor his great thirst of rule praise and renown

 viii
 but by his knights still cruel wars maintained
 so wise his words so quick his wit appears
 that of the kingdom large o'er which he reigned
 the charge seemed not too weighty for his years
 his greatness afric's lesser kings constrained
 to tremble at his name all ind him fears
 and other realms that would his friendship hold
 some armed soldiers sent some gifts some gold

 ix
 this mighty prince assembled had the flower
 of all his realms against the frenchmen stout
 to break their rising empire and their power
 nor of sure conquest had he fear or doubt
 to him armida came even at the hour
 when in the plains old gaza's walls without
 the lords and leaders all their armies bring
 in battleray mustered before their king

 x
 he on his throne was set to which on height
 who clomb an hundred ivory stairs first told
 under a pentise wrought of silver bright
 and trod on carpets made of silk and gold
 his robes were such as best beseemen might
 a king so great so grave so rich so old
 and twined of sixty ells of lawn and more
 a turban strange adorned his tresses hoar

 xi
 his right hand did his precious sceptre wield
 his beard was gray his looks severe and grave
 and from his eyes not yet made dim with eild
 sparkled his former worth and vigor brave
 his gestures all the majesty upheild
 and state as his old age and empire crave
 so phidias carved apelles so pardie
 erst painted jove jove thundering down from sky

 xii
 on either side him stood a noble lord
 whereof the first held in his upright hand
 of severe justice the unpartial sword
 the other bare the seal and causes scanned
 keeping his folk in peace and good accord
 and termed was lord chancellor of the land
 but marshal was the first and used to lead
 his armies forth to war oft with good speed

 xiii
 of bold circassians with their halberts long
 about his throne his guards stood in a ring
 all richly armed in gilden corslets strong
 and by their sides their crooked swords down hing
 thus set thus seated his grave lords among
 his hosts and armies great beheld the king
 and every band as by his throne it went
 their ensigns low inclined and arms down bent

 xiv
 their squadrons first the men of egypt show
 in four troops and each his several guide
 of the high country two two of the low
 which nile had won out of the salt seaside
 his fertile slime first stopped the waters' flow
 then hardened to firm land the plough to bide
 so egypt still increased within far placed
 that part is now where ships erst anchor cast

 xv
 the foremost band the people were that dwelled
 in alexandria's rich and fertile plain
 along the western shore whence nile expelled
 the greedy billows of the swelling main
 araspes was their guide who more excelled
 in wit and craft than strength or warlike pain
 to place an ambush close or to devise
 a treason false was none so sly so wise

 xvi
 the people next that gainst the morning rays
 along the coasts of asia have their seat
 arontes led them whom no warlike praise
 ennobled but high birth and titles great
 his helm ne'er made him sweat in toilsome frays
 nor was his sleep e'er broke with trumpet's threat
 but from soft ease to try the toil of fight
 his fond ambition brought this carpet knight

 xvii
 the third seemed not a troop or squadron small
 but an huge host nor seemed it so much grain
 in egypt grew as to sustain them all
 yet from one town thereof came all that train
 a town in people to huge shires equal
 that did a thousand streets and more contain
 great caire it hight whose commons from each side
 came swarming out to war campson their guide

 xviii
 next under gazel marched they that plough
 the fertile lands above that town which lie
 up to the place where nilus tumbling low
 falls from his second cataract from high
 the egyptians weaponed were with sword and bow
 no weight of helm or hauberk list they try
 and richly armed in their strong foes no dreed
 of death but great desire of spoil they breed

 xix
 the naked folk of barca these succeed
 unarmed half alarcon led that band
 that long in deserts lived in extreme need
 on spoils and preys purchased by strength of hand
 to battle strong unfit their king did lead
 his army next brought from zumara land
 then he of tripoli for sudden fight
 and skirmish short both ready bold and light

 xx
 two captains next brought forth their bands to show
 whom stony sent and happy araby
 which never felt the cold of frost and snow
 or force of burning heat unless fame lie
 where incense pure and all sweet odors grow
 where the sole phoenix doth revive not die
 and midst the perfumes rich and flowerets brave
 both birth and burial cradle hath and grave

 xxi
 their clothes not rich their garments were not gay
 but weapons like the egyptian troops they had
 the arabians next that have no certain stay
 no house no home no mansion good or bad
 but ever as the scythian hordes stray
 from place to place their wandering cities gad
 these have both voice and stature feminine
 hair long and black black face and fiery eyne

 xxii
 long indian canes with iron armed they bear
 and as upon their nimble steeds they ride
 like a swift storm their speedy troops appear
 if winds so fast bring storms from heavens wide
 by syphax led the first arabians were
 aldine the second squadron had no guide
 and abiazar proud brought to the fight
 the third a thief a murderer not a knight

 xxiii
 the islanders came then their prince before
 whose lands arabia's gulf enclosed about
 wherein they fish and gather oysters store
 whose shells great pearls rich and round pour out
 the red sea sent with them from his left shore
 of negroes grim a black and ugly rout
 these agricalt and those osmida brought
 a man that set law faith and truth at naught

 xxiv
 the ethiops next which meroe doth breed
 that sweet and gentle isle of meroe
 twixt nile and astrabore that far doth spread
 where two religions are and kingdoms three
 these assimiro and canario led
 both kings both pagans and both subjects be
 to the great caliph but the third king kept
 christ's sacred faith nor to these wars outstepped

 xxv
 after two kings both subjects also ride
 and of two bands of archers had the charge
 the first soldan of ormus placed in the wide
 huge persian bay a town rich fair and large
 the last of boecan which at every tide
 the sea cuts off from persia's southern marge
 and makes an isle but when it ebbs again
 the passage there is sandy dry and plain

 xxvi
 nor thee great altamore in her chaste bed
 thy loving queen kept with her dear embrace
 she tore her locks she smote her breast and shed
 salt tears to make thee stay in that sweet place
 "seem the rough seas more calm cruel" she said
 "than the mild looks of thy kind spouse's face
 or is thy shield with blood and dust defiled
 a dearer armful than thy tender child"

 xxvii
 this was the mighty king of samarcand
 a captain wise well skilled in feats of war
 in courage fierce matchless for strength of hand
 great was his praise his force was noised far
 his worth right well the frenchmen understand
 by whom his virtues feared and loved are
 his men were armed with helms and hauberks strong
 and by their sides broad swords and maces hong

 xxviii
 then from the mansions bright of fresh aurore
 adrastus came the glorious king of ind
 a snake's green skin spotted with black he wore
 that was made rich by art and hard by kind
 an elephant this furious giant bore
 he fierce as fire his mounture swift as wind
 much people brought he from his kingdoms wide
 twixt indus ganges and the salt seaside

 xxix
 the king's own troop come next a chosen crew
 of all the camp the strength the crown the flower
 wherein each soldier had with honors due
 rewarded been for service ere that hour
 their arms were strong for need and fair for show
 upon fierce steeds well mounted rode this power
 and heaven itself with the clear splendor shone
 of their bright armor purple gold and stone

 xxx
 mongst these alarco fierce and odemare
 the muster master was and hidraort
 and rimedon whose rashness took no care
 to shun death's bitter stroke in field or fort
 tigranes rapold stem the men that fare
 by sea that robbed in each creek and port
 ormond and marlabust the arabian named
 because that land rebellious he reclaimed

 xxxi
 there pirga arimon orindo are
 brimarte the scaler and with him suifant
 the breaker of wild horses brought from far
 then the great wresteler strong aridamant
 and tisapherne the thunderbolt of war
 whom none surpassed whom none to match durst vaunt
 at tilt at tourney or in combat brave
 with spear or lance with sword with mace or glaive

 xxxii
 a false armenian did this squadron guide
 that in his youth from christ's true faith and light
 to the blind lore of paganism did slide
 that clement late now emireno hight
 yet to his king he faithful was and tried
 true in all causes his in wrong and right
 a cunning leader and a soldier bold
 for strength and courage young for wisdom old

 xxxiii
 when all these regiments were passed and gone
 appeared armide and came her troop to show
 set in a chariot bright with precious stone
 her gown tucked up and in her hand a bow
 in her sweet face her new displeasures shone
 mixed with the native beauties there which grow
 and quickened so her looks that in sharp wise
 it seems she threats and yet her threats entice

 xxxiv
 her chariot like aurora's glorious wain
 with carbuncles and jacinths glistered round
 her coachman guided with the golden rein
 four unicorns by couples yoked and bound
 of squires and lovely ladies hundreds twain
 whose rattling quivers at their backs resound
 on milkwhite steeds wait on the chariot bright
 their steeds to manage ready swift to flight

 xxxv
 followed her troop led forth by aradin
 which hidraort from syria's kingdom sent
 as when the newborn phoenix doth begin
 to fly to ethiopward at the fair bent
 of her rich wings strange plumes and feathers thin
 her crowns and chains with native gold besprent
 the world amazed stands and with her fly
 an host of wondering birds that sing and cry

 xxxvi
 so passed armida looked on gazed on so
 a wondrous dame in habit gesture face
 there lived no wight to love so great a foe
 but wished and longed those beauties to embrace
 scant seen with anger sullen sad for woe
 she conquered all the lords and knights in place
 what would she do her sorrows passed think you
 when her fair eyes her looks and smiles shall woo

 xxxvii
 she passed the king commanded emiren
 of his rich throne to mount the lofty stage
 to whom his host his army and his men
 he would commit now in his graver age
 with stately grace the man approached then
 his looks his coming honor did presage
 the guard asunder cleft and passage made
 he to the throne up went and there he stayed

 xxxviii
 to earth he cast his eyes and bent his knee
 to whom the king thus gan his will explain
 "to thee this sceptre emiren to thee
 these armies i commit my place sustain
 mongst them go set the king of judah free
 and let the frenchmen feel my just disdain
 go meet them conquer them leave none alive
 or those that scape from battle bring captive"

 xxxix
 thus spake the tyrant and the sceptre laid
 with all his sovereign power upon the knight
 "i take this sceptre at your hand" he said
 "and with your happy fortune go to fight
 and trust my lord in your great virtue's aid
 to venge all asia's harms her wrongs to right
 nor e'er but victor will i see your face
 our overthrow shall bring death not disgrace

 xl
 "heavens grant if evil yet no mishap i dread
 or harm they threaten against this camp of thine
 that all that mischief fall upon my head
 theirs be the conquest and the danger mine
 and let them safe bring home their captain dead
 buried in pomp of triumph's glorious shine"
 he ceased and then a murmur loud up went
 with noise of joy and sound of instrument

 xli
 amid the noise and shout uprose the king
 environed with many a noble peer
 that to his royal tent the monarch bring
 and there he feasted them and made them cheer
 to him and him he talked and carved each thing
 the greatest honored meanest graced were
 and while this mirth this joy and feast doth last
 armida found fit time her nets to cast

 xlii
 but when the feast was done she that espied
 all eyes on her fair visage fixed and bent
 and by new notes and certain signs described
 how love's empoisoned fire their entrails brent
 arose and where the king sate in his pride
 with stately pace and humble gestures went
 and as she could in looks in voice she strove
 fierce stern bold angry and severe to prove

 xliii
 "great emperor behold me here" she said
 "for thee my country and my faith to fight
 a dame a virgin but a royal maid
 and worthy seems this war a princess hight
 for by the sword the sceptre is upstayed
 this hand can use them both with skill and might
 this hand of mine can strike and at each blow
 thy foes and ours kill wound and overthrow

 xliv
 "nor yet suppose this is the foremost day
 wherein to war i bent my noble thought
 but for the surety of thy realms and stay
 of our religion true ere this i wrought
 yourself best know if this be true i say
 or if my former deeds rejoiced you aught
 when godfrey's hardy knights and princes strong
 i captive took and held in bondage long

 xlv
 "i took them bound them and so sent them bound
 to thee a noble gift with whom they had
 condemned low in dungeon under ground
 forever dwelt in woe and torment sad
 so might thine host an easy way have found
 to end this doubtful war with conquest glad
 had not rinaldo fierce my knights all slain
 and set those lords his friends at large again

 xlvi
 "rinaldo is well known" and there a long
 and true rehearsal made she of his deeds
 "this is the knight that since hath done me wrong
 wrong yet untold that sharp revengement needs
 displeasure therefore mixed with reason strong
 this thirst of war in me this courage breeds
 nor how he injured me time serves to tell
 let this suffice i seek revengement fell

 xlvii
 "and will procure it for all shafts that fly
 light not in vain some work the shooter's will
 and jove's right hand with thunders cast from sky
 takes open vengeance oft for secret ill
 but if some champion dare this knight defy
 to mortal battle and by fight him kill
 and with his hateful head will me present
 that gift my soul shall please my heart content

 xlviii
 "so please that for reward enjoy he shall
 the greatest gift i can or may afford
 myself my beauty wealth and kingdoms all
 to marry him and take him for my lord
 this promise will i keep whate'er befall
 and thereto bind myself by oath and word
 now he that deems this purchase worth his pain
 let him step forth and speak i none disdain"

 xlix
 while thus the princess said his hungry eyne
 adrastus fed on her sweet beauty's light
 "the gods forbid" quoth he "one shaft of thine
 should be discharged gainst that discourteous knight
 his heart unworthy is shootress divine
 of thine artillery to feel the might
 to wreak thine ire behold me prest and fit
 i will his head cut off and bring thee it

 l
 "i will his heart with this sharp sword divide
 and to the vultures cast his carcass out"
 thus threatened he but tisapherne envied
 to hear his glorious vaunt and boasting stout
 and said "but who art thou that so great pride
 thou showest before the king me and this rout
 pardie here are some such whose worth exceeds
 thy vaunting much yet boast not of their deeds"

 li
 the indian fierce replied "i am the man
 whose acts his words and boasts have aye surpassed
 but if elsewhere the words thou now began
 had uttered been that speech had been thy last"
 thus quarrelled they the monarch stayed them than
 and 'twixt the angry knights his sceptre cast
 then to armida said "fair queen i see
 thy heart is stout thy thoughts courageous be

 lii
 "thou worthy art that their disdain and ire
 at thy commands these knights should both appease
 that gainst thy foe their courage hot as fire
 thou may'st employ both when and where you please
 there all their power and force and what desire
 they have to serve thee may they show at ease"
 the monarch held his peace when this was said
 and they new proffer of their service made

 liii
 nor they alone but all that famous were
 in feats of arms boast that he shall be dead
 all offer her their aid all say and swear
 to take revenge on his condemned head
 so many arms moved she against her dear
 and swore her darling under foot to tread
 but he since first the enchanted isle he left
 safe in his barge the roaring waves still cleft

 liv
 by the same way returned the welltaught boat
 by which it came and made like haste like speed
 the friendly wind upon her sail that smote
 so turned as to return her ship had need
 the youth sometimes the pole or bear did note
 or wandering stars which dearest nights forthspread
 sometimes the floods the hills or mountains steep
 whose woody fronts o'ershade the silent deep

 lv
 now of the camp the man the state inquires
 now asks the customs strange of sundry lands
 and sailed till clad in beams and bright attires
 the fourth day's sun on the eastern threshold stands
 but when the western seas had quenched those fires
 their frigate struck against the shore and sands
 then spoke their guide "the land of palestine
 this is here must your journey end and mine"

 lvi
 the knights she set upon the shore all three
 and vanished thence in twinkling of an eye
 uprose the night in whose deep blackness be
 all colors hid of things in earth or sky
 nor could they house or hold or harbor see
 or in that desert sign of dwelling spy
 nor track of man or horse or aught that might
 inform them of some path or passage right

 lvii
 when they had mused what way they travel should
 from the west shore their steps at last they twined
 and lo far off at last their eyes behold
 something they wist not what that clearly shined
 with rays of silver and with beams of gold
 which the dark folds of night's black mantle lined
 forward they went and marched against the light
 to see and find the thing that shone so bright

 lviii
 high on a tree they saw an armor new
 that glistered bright gainst cynthia's silver ray
 therein like stars in skies the diamonds show
 fret in the gilden helm and hauberk gay
 the mighty shield all scored full they view
 of pictures fair ranged in meet array
 to keep them sate an aged man beside
 who to salute them rose when them he spied

 lix
 the twain who first were sent in this pursuit
 of their wise friend well knew the aged face
 but when the wizard sage their first salute
 received and quitted had with kind embrace
 to the young prince that silent stood and mute
 he turned his speech "in this unused place
 for you alone i wait my lord" quoth he
 "my chiefest care your state and welfare be

 lx
 "for though you wot it not i am your friend
 and for your profit work as these can tell
 i taught them how armida's charms to end
 and bring you thither from love's hateful cell
 now to my words though sharp perchance attend
 nor be aggrieved although they seem too fell
 but keep them well in mind till in the truth
 a wise and holier man instruct thy youth

 lxi
 "not underneath sweet shades and fountains shrill
 among the nymphs the fairies leaves and flowers
 but on the steep the rough and craggy hill
 of virtue stands this bliss this good of ours
 by toil and travel not by sitting still
 in pleasure's lap we come to honor's bowers
 why will you thus in sloth's deep valley lie
 the royal eagles on high mountains fly

 lxii
 "nature lifts up thy forehead to the skies
 and fills thy heart with high and noble thought
 that thou to heavenward aye shouldst lift thine eyes
 and purchase fame by deeds well done and wrought
 she gives thee ire by which not courage flies
 to conquests not through brawls and battles fought
 for civil jars nor that thereby you might
 your wicked malice wreak and cursed spite

 lxiii
 "but that your strength spurred forth with noble wrath
 with greater fury might christ's foes assault
 and that your bridle should with lesser scath
 each secret vice and kill each inward fault
 for so his godly anger ruled hath
 each righteous man beneath heaven's starry vault
 and at his will makes it now hot now cold
 now lets it run now doth it fettered hold"

 lxiv
 thus parleyed he rinaldo hushed and still
 great wisdom heard in those few words compiled
 he marked his speech a purple blush did fill
 his guilty checks down went his eyesight mild
 the hermit by his bashful looks his will
 well understood and said "look up my child
 and painted in this precious shield behold
 the glorious deeds of thy forefathers old

 lxv
 "thine elders' glory herein see and know
 in virtue's path how they trod all their days
 whom thou art far behind a runner slow
 in this true course of honor fame and praise
 up up thyself incite by the fair show
 of knightly worth which this bright shield bewrays
 that be thy spur to praise" at last the knight
 looked up and on those portraits bent his sight

 lxvi
 the cunning workman had in little space
 infinite shapes of men there well expressed
 for there described was the worthy race
 and pedigree of all of the house of est
 come from a roman spring o'er all the place
 flowed pure streams of crystals east and west
 with laurel crowned stood the princes old
 their wars the hermit and their battles told

 lxvii
 he showed them caius first when first in prey
 to people strange the falling empire went
 first prince of est that did the sceptre sway
 o'er such as chose him lord by tree consent
 his weaker neighbors to his rule obey
 need made them stoop constraint doth force content
 after when lord honorius called the train
 of savage goths into his land again

 lxviii
 and when all italy did burn and flame
 with bloody war by this fierce people mad
 when rome a captive and a slave became
 and to be quite destroyed was most afraid
 aurelius to his everlasting fame
 preserved in peace the folk that him obeyed
 next whom was forest who the rage withstood
 of the bold huns and of their tyrant proud

 lxix
 known by his look was attila the fell
 whose dragon eyes shone bright with anger's spark
 worse faced than a dog who viewed him well
 supposed they saw him grin and heard him bark
 but when in single fight he lost the bell
 how through his troops he fled there might you mark
 and how lord forest after fortified
 aquilea's town and how for it he died

 lxx
 for there was wrought the fatal end and fine
 both of himself and of the town he kept
 but his great son renowned acarine
 into his father's place and honor stepped
 to cruel fate not to the huns altine
 gave place and when time served again forth leapt
 and in the vale of po built for his seat
 of many a village a small city great

 lxxi
 against the swelling flood he banked it strong
 and thence uprose the fair and noble town
 where they of est should by succession long
 command and rule in bliss and high renown
 gainst odoacer then he fought but wrong
 oft spoileth right fortune treads courage down
 for there he died for his dear country's sake
 and of his father's praise did so partake

 lxxii
 with him died alforisio azzo was
 with his dear brother into exile sent
 but homeward they in arms again repass
 the herule king oppressedfrom banishment
 his front through pierced with a dart alas
 next them of est the epaminondas went
 that smiling seemed to cruel death to yield
 when totila was fled and safe his shield

 lxxiii
 of boniface i speak valerian
 his son in praise and power succeeded him
 who durst sustain in years though scant a man
 of the proud goths an hundred squadrons trim
 then he that gainst the sclaves much honor wan
 ernesto threatening stood with visage grim
 before him aldoard the lombard stout
 who from monselce boldly erst shut out

 lxxiv
 there henry was and berengare the bold
 that served great charles in his conquest high
 who in each battle give the onset would
 a hardy soldier and a captain sly
 after prince lewis did he well uphold
 against his nephew king of italy
 he won the field and took that king on live
 next him stood otho with his children five

 lxxv
 of almeric the image next they view
 lord marquis of ferrara first create
 founder of many churches that upthrew
 his eyes like one that used to contemplate
 gainst him the second azzo stood in rew
 with berengarius that did long debate
 till after often change of fortune stroke
 he won and on all italy laid the yoke

 lxxvi
 albert his son the germans warred among
 and there his praise and fame was spread so wide
 that having foiled the danes in battle strong
 his daughter young became great otho's bride
 behind him hugo stood with warfare long
 that broke the horn of all the romans' pride
 who of all italy the marquis hight
 and tuscan whole possessed as his right

 lxxvii
 after tebaldo puissant boniface
 and beatrice his dear possessed the stage
 nor was there left heir male of that great race
 to enjoy the sceptre state and heritage
 the princess maud alone supplied the place
 supplied the want in number sex and age
 for far above each sceptre throne and crown
 the noble dame advanced her veil and gown

 lxxviii
 with manlike vigor shone her noble look
 and more than manlike wrath her face o'erspread
 there the fell normans guichard there forsook
 the field till then who never feared nor fled
 henry the fourth she beat and from him took
 his standard and in church it offered
 which done the pope back to the vatican
 she brought and placed in peter's chair again

 lxxix
 as he that honored her and held her dear
 azzo the fifth stood by her lovely side
 but the fourth azzo's offspring far and near
 spread forth and through germania fructified
 sprung from the branch did guelpho bold appear
 guelpho his son by cunigond his bride
 and in bavaria's field transplanted new
 the roman graft flourished increased and grew

 lxxx
 a branch of est there in the guelfian tree
 engrafted was which of itself was old
 whereon you might the guelfoes fairer see
 renew their sceptres and their crowns of gold
 of which heaven's good aspects so bended be
 that high and broad it spread and flourished bold
 till underneath his glorious branches laid
 half germany and all under his shade

 lxxxi
 this regal plant from his italian rout
 sprung up as high and blossomed fair above
 fornenst lord guelpho bertold issued out
 with the sixth azzo whom all virtues love
 this was the pedigree of worthies stout
 who seemed in that bright shield to live and move
 rinaldo waked up and cheered his face
 to see these worthies of his house and race

 lxxxii
 to do like acts his courage wished and sought
 and with that wish transported him so far
 that all those deeds which filled aye his thought
 towns won forts taken armies killed in war
 as if they were things done indeed and wrought
 before his eyes he thinks they present are
 he hastily arms him and with hope and haste
 sure conquest met prevented and embraced

 lxxxiii
 but charles who had told the death and fall
 of the young prince of danes his late dear lord
 gave him the fatal weapon and withal
 "young knight" quoth he "take with good luck this sword
 your just strong valiant hand in battle shall
 employ it long for christ's true faith and word
 and of his former lord revenge the wrongs
 who loved you so that deed to you belongs"

 lxxxiv
 he answered "god for his mercy's sake
 grant that this hand which holds this weapon good
 for thy dear master may sharp vengeance take
 may cleave the pagan's heart and shed his blood"
 to this but short reply did charles make
 and thanked him much nor more on terms they stood
 for lo the wizard sage that was their guide
 on their dark journey hastes them forth to ride

 lxxxv
 "high time it is" quoth he "for you to wend
 where godfrey you awaits and many a knight
 there may we well arrive ere night doth end
 and through this darkness can i guide you right"
 this said up to his coach they all ascend
 on his swift wheels forth rolled the chariot light
 he gave his coursers fleet the rod and rein
 and galloped forth and eastward drove amain

 lxxxvi
 while silent so through night's dark shade they fly
 the hermit thus bespake the young man stout
 "of thy great house thy race thine offspring high
 here hast thou seen the branch the bole the root
 and as these worthies born to chivalry
 and deeds of arms it hath tofore brought out
 so is it so it shall be fertile still
 nor time shall end nor age that seed shall kill

 lxxxvii
 "would god as drawn from the forgetful lap
 of antique time i have thine elders shown
 that so i could the catalogue unwrap
 of thy great nephews yet unborn unknown
 that ere this light they view their fate and hap
 i might foretell and how their chance is thrown
 that like thine elders so thou mightst behold
 thy children many famous stout and bold

 lxxxviii
 "but not by art or skill of things future
 can the plain truth revealed be and told
 although some knowledge doubtful dark obscure
 we have of coming haps in clouds uprolled
 nor all which in this cause i know for sure
 dare i foretell for of that father old
 the hermit peter learned i much and he
 withouten veil heaven's secrets great doth see

 lxxxix
 "but this to him revealed by grace divine
 by him to me declared to thee i say
 was never race greek barbarous or latine
 great in times past or famous at this day
 richer in hardy knights than this of thine
 such blessings heaven shall on thy children lay
 that they in fame shall pass in praise o'ercome
 the worthies old of sparta carthage rome

 xc
 "but mongst the rest i chose alphonsus bold
 in virtue first second in place and name
 he shall be born when this frail world grows old
 corrupted poor and bare of men of fame
 better than he none shall none can or could
 the sword or sceptre use or guide the same
 to rule in peace or to command in fight
 thine offspring's glory and thy house's light

 xci
 "his younger age foretokens true shall yield
 of future valor puissance force and might
 from him no rock the savage beast shall shield
 at tilt or tourney match him shall no knight
 after he conquer shall in pitched field
 great armies and win spoils in single fight
 and on his locks rewards for knightly praise
 shall garlands wear of grass of oak of bays

 xcii
 "his graver age as well that eild it fits
 shall happy peace preserve and quiet blest
 and from his neighbors strong mongst whom he sits
 shall keep his cities safe in wealth and rest
 shall nourish arts and cherish pregnant wits
 make triumphs great and feast his subjects best
 reward the good the evil with pains torment
 shall dangers all foresee and seen prevent

 xciii
 "but if it hap against those wicked bands
 that sea and earth invest with blood and war
 and in these wretched times to noble lands
 give laws of peace false and unjust that are
 that he be sent to drive their guilty hands
 from christ's pure altars and high temples far
 oh what revenge what vengeance shall he bring
 on that false sect and their accursed king

 xciv
 "too late the moors too late the turkish king
 gainst him should arm their troops and legions bold
 for he beyond great euphrates should bring
 beyond the frozen tops of taurus cold
 beyond the land where is perpetual spring
 the cross the eagle white the lily of gold
 and by baptizing of the ethiops brown
 of aged nile reveal the springs unknown"

 xcv
 thus said the hermit and his prophecy
 the prince accepted with content and pleasure
 the secret thought of his posterity
 of his concealed joys heaped up the measure
 meanwhile the morning bright was mounted high
 and changed heaven's silver wealth to golden treasure
 and high above the christian tents they view
 how the broad ensigns trembled waved and blew

 xcvi
 when thus again their leader sage begun
 "see how bright phoebus clears the darksome skies
 see how with gentle beams the friendly sun
 the tents the towns the hills and dales descries
 through my well guiding is your voyage done
 from danger safe in travel off which lies
 hence without fear of harm or doubt of foe
 march to the camp i may no nearer go"

 xcvii
 thus took he leave and made a quick return
 and forward went the champions three on foot
 and marching right against the rising morn
 a ready passage to the camp found out
 meanwhile had speedy fame the tidings borne
 that to the tents approached these barons stout
 and starting from his throne and kingly seat
 to entertain them rose godfredo great



 eighteenth book

 the argument
 the charms and spirits false therein which lie
 rinaldo chaseth from the forest old
 the host of egypt comes vafrin the spy
 entereth their camp stout crafty wise and bold
 sharp is the fight about the bulwarks high
 and ports of zion to assault the hold
 godfrey hath aid from heaven by force the town
 is won the pagans slain walls beaten down


 i
 arrived where godfrey to embrace him stood
 "my sovereign lord" rinaldo meekly said
 "to venge my wrongs against gernando proud
 my honor's care provoked my wrath unstayed
 but that i you displeased my chieftain good
 my thoughts yet grieve my heart is still dismayed
 and here i come prest all exploits to try
 to make me gracious in your gracious eye"

 ii
 to him that kneeled folding his friendly arms
 about his neck the duke this answer gave
 "let pass such speeches sad of passed harms
 remembrance is the life of grief his grave
 forgetfulness and for amends in arms
 your wonted valor use and courage brave
 for you alone to happy end must bring
 the strong enchantments of the charmed spring

 iii
 "that aged wood whence heretofore we got
 to build our scaling engines timber fit
 is now the fearful seat but how none wot
 where ugly fiends and damned spirits sit
 to cut one twist thereof adventureth not
 the boldest knight we have nor without it
 this wall can battered be where others doubt
 there venture thou and show thy courage stout"

 iv
 thus said he and the knight in speeches few
 proffered his service to attempt the thing
 to hard assays his courage willing flew
 to him praise was no spur words were no sting
 of his dear friends then he embraced the crew
 to welcome him which came for in a ring
 about him guelpho tancred and the rest
 stood of the camp the greatest chief and best

 v
 when with the prince these lords had iterate
 their welcomes oft and oft their dear embrace
 toward the rest of lesser worth and state
 he turned and them received with gentle grace
 the merry soldiers bout him shout and prate
 with cries as joyful and as cheerful face
 as if in triumph's chariot bright as sun
 he had returned afric or asia won

 vi
 thus marched to his tent the champion good
 and there sat down with all his friends around
 now of the war he asked now of the wood
 and answered each demand they list propound
 but when they left him to his ease up stood
 the hermit and fit time to speak once found
 "my lord" he said "your travels wondrous are
 far have you strayed erred wandered far

 vii
 "much are you bound to god above who brought
 you safe from false armida's charmed hold
 and thee a straying sheep whom once he bought
 hath now again reduced to his fold
 and gainst his heathen foes these men of naught
 hath chosen thee in place next godfrey bold
 yet mayest thou not polluted thus with sin
 in his high service war or fight begin

 viii
 "the world the flesh with their infection vile
 pollute the thoughts impure thy spirit stain
 not po not ganges not sevenmouthed nile
 not the wide seas can wash thee clean again
 only to purge all faults which thee defile
 his blood hath power who for thy sins was slain
 his help therefore invoke to him bewray
 thy secret faults mourn weep complain and pray"

 ix
 this said the knight first with the witch unchaste
 his idle loves and follies vain lamented
 then kneeling low with heavy looks downcast
 his other sins confessed and all repented
 and meekly pardon craved for first and last
 the hermit with his zeal was well contented
 and said "on yonder hill next morn go pray
 that turns his forehead gainst the morning ray

 x
 "that done march to the wood whence each one brings
 such news of furies goblins fiends and sprites
 the giants monsters and all dreadful things
 thou shalt subdue which that dark grove unites
 let no strange voice that mourns or sweetly sings
 nor beauty whose glad smile frail hearts delights
 within thy breast make ruth or pity rise
 but their false looks and prayers false despise"

 xi
 thus he advised him and the hardy knight
 prepared him gladly to this enterprise
 thoughtful he passed the day and sad the night
 and ere the silver morn began to rise
 his arms he took and in a coat him dight
 of color strange cut in the warlike guise
 and on his way sole silent forth he went
 alone and left his friends and left his tent

 xii
 it was the time when gainst the breaking day
 rebellious night yet strove and still repined
 for in the east appeared the morning gray
 and yet some lamps in jove's high palace shined
 when to mount olivet he took his way
 and saw as round about his eyes he twined
 night's shadows hence from thence the morning's shine
 this bright that dark that earthly this divine

 xiii
 thus to himself he thought how many bright
 and splendent lamps shine in heaven's temple high
 day hath his golden sun her moon the night
 her fixed and wandering stars the azure sky
 so framed all by their creator's might
 that still they live and shine and ne'er shall die
 till in a moment with the last day's brand
 they burn and with them burn sea air and land

 xiv
 thus as he mused to the top he went
 and there kneeled down with reverence and fear
 his eyes upon heaven's eastern face he bent
 his thoughts above all heavens uplifted were
 "the sins and errors which i now repent
 of mine unbridled youth o father dear
 remember not but let thy mercy fall
 and purge my faults and mine offences all"

 xv
 thus prayed he with purple wings upflew
 in golden weed the morning's lusty queen
 begilding with the radiant beams she threw
 his helm his harness and the mountain green
 upon his breast and forehead gently blew
 the air that balm and nardus breathed unseen
 and o'er his head let down from clearest skies
 a cloud of pure and precious clew there flies

 xvi
 the heavenly dew was on his garments spread
 to which compared his clothes pale ashes seem
 and sprinkled so that all that paleness fled
 and thence of purest white bright rays outstream
 so cheered are the flowers late withered
 with the sweet comfort of the morning beam
 and so returned to youth a serpent old
 adorns herself in new and native gold

 xvii
 the lovely whiteness of his changed weed
 the prince perceived well and long admired
 toward the forest marched he on with speed
 resolved as such adventures great required
 thither he came whence shrinking back for dread
 of that strange desert's sight the first retired
 but not to him fearful or loathsome made
 that forest was but sweet with pleasant shade

 xviii
 forward he passed mid in the grove before
 he heard a sound that strange sweet pleasing was
 there rolled a crystal brook with gentle roar
 there sighed the winds as through the leaves they pass
 there did the nightingale her wrongs deplore
 there sung the swan and singing died alas
 there lute harp cittern human voice he heard
 and all these sounds one sound right well declared

 xix
 a dreadful thunderclap at last he heard
 the aged trees and plants wellnigh that rent
 yet heard the nymphs and sirens afterward
 birds winds and waters sing with sweet consent
 whereat amazed he stayed and well prepared
 for his defence heedful and slow forth went
 nor in his way his passage aught withstood
 except a quiet still transparent flood

 xx
 on the green banks which that fair stream inbound
 flowers and odors sweetly smiled and smelled
 which reaching out his stretched arms around
 all the large desert in his bosom held
 and through the grove one channel passage found
 that in the wood in that the forest dwelled
 trees clad the streams streams green those trees aye made
 and so exchanged their moisture and their shade

 xxi
 the knight some way sought out the flood to pass
 and as he sought a wondrous bridge appeared
 a bridge of gold a huge and weighty mass
 on arches great of that rich metal reared
 when through that golden way he entered was
 down fell the bridge swelled the stream and weared
 the work away nor sign left where it stood
 and of a river calm became a flood

 xxii
 he turned amazed to see it troubled so
 like sudden brooks increased with molten snow
 the billows fierce that tossed to and fro
 the whirlpools sucked down to their bosoms low
 but on he went to search for wonders mo
 through the thick trees there high and broad which grow
 and in that forest huge and desert wide
 the more he sought more wonders still he spied

 xxiii
 whereso he stepped it seemed the joyful ground
 renewed the verdure of her flowery weed
 a fountain here a wellspring there he found
 here bud the roses there the lilies spread
 the aged wood o'er and about him round
 flourished with blossoms new new leaves new seed
 and on the boughs and branches of those treen
 the bark was softened and renewed the green

 xxiv
 the manna on each leaf did pearled lie
 the honey stilled from the tender rind
 again he heard that wondrous harmony
 of songs and sweet complaints of lovers kind
 the human voices sung a triple high
 to which respond the birds the streams the wind
 but yet unseen those nymphs those singers were
 unseen the lutes harps viols which they bear

 xxv
 he looked he listened yet his thoughts denied
 to think that true which he both heard and see
 a myrtle in an ample plain he spied
 and thither by a beaten path went he
 the myrtle spread her mighty branches wide
 higher than pine or palm or cypress tree
 and far above all other plants was seen
 that forest's lady and that desert's queen

 xxvi
 upon the trees his eyes rinaldo bent
 and there a marvel great and strange began
 an aged oak beside him cleft and rent
 and from his fertile hollow womb forth ran
 clad in rare weeds and strange habiliment
 a nymph for age able to go to man
 an hundred plants beside even in his sight
 childed an hundred nymphs so great so dight

 xxvii
 such as on stages play such as we see
 the dryads painted whom wild satyrs love
 whose arms halfnaked locks untrussed be
 with buskins laced on their legs above
 and silken robes tucked short above their knee
 such seemed the sylvan daughters of this grove
 save that instead of shafts and boughs of tree
 she bore a lute a harp or cittern she

 xxviii
 and wantonly they cast them in a ring
 and sung and danced to move his weaker sense
 rinaldo round about environing
 as centres are with their circumference
 the tree they compassed eke and gan to sing
 that woods and streams admired their excellence
 "welcome dear lord welcome to this sweet grove
 welcome our lady's hope welcome her love

 xxix
 "thou com'st to cure our princess faint and sick
 for love for love of thee faint sick distressed
 late black late dreadful was this forest thick
 fit dwelling for sad folk with grief oppressed
 see with thy coming how the branches quick
 revived are and in new blosoms dressed"
 this was their song and after from it went
 first a sweet sound and then the myrtle rent

 xxx
 if antique times admired silenus old
 that oft appeared set on his lazy ass
 how would they wonder if they had behold
 such sights as from the myrtle high did pass
 thence came a lady fair with locks of gold
 that like in shape in face and beauty was
 to sweet armide rinaldo thinks he spies
 her gestures smiles and glances of her eyes

 xxxi
 on him a sad and smiling look she cast
 which twenty passions strange at once bewrays
 "and art thou come" quoth she "returned at last
 to her from whom but late thou ran'st thy ways
 com'st thou to comfort me for sorrows past
 to ease my widow nights and careful days
 or comest thou to work me grief and harm
 why nilt thou speakwhy not thy face disarm

 xxxii
 "com'st thou a friend or foe i did not frame
 that golden bridge to entertain my foe
 nor opened flowers and fountains as you came
 to welcome him with joy that brings me woe
 put off thy helm rejoice me with the flame
 of thy bright eyes whence first my fires did grow
 kiss me embrace me if you further venture
 love keeps the gate the fort is eath to enter"

 xxxiii
 thus as she woos she rolls her rueful eyes
 with piteous look and changeth oft her cheer
 an hundred sighs from her false heart upflies
 she sobs she mourns it is great ruth to hear
 the hardest breast sweet pity mollifies
 what stony heart resists a woman's tear
 but yet the knight wise wary not unkind
 drew forth his sword and from her careless twined

 xxxiv
 toward the tree he marched she thither start
 before him stepped embraced the plant and cried
 "ah never do me such a spiteful part
 to cut my tree this forest's joy and pride
 put up thy sword else pierce therewith the heart
 of thy forsaken and despised armide
 for through this breast and through this heart unkind
 to this fair tree thy sword shall passage find"

 xxxv
 he lift his brand nor cared though oft she prayed
 and she her form to other shape did change
 such monsters huge when men in dreams are laid
 oft in their idle fancies roam and range
 her body swelled her face obscure was made
 vanished her garments her face and vestures strange
 a giantess before him high she stands
 like briareus armed with an hundred hands

 xxxvi
 with fifty swords and fifty targets bright
 she threatened death she roared cried and fought
 each other nymph in armor likewise dight
 a cyclops great became he feared them naught
 but on the myrtle smote with all his might
 that groaned like living souls to death nigh brought
 the sky seemed pluto's court the air seemed hell
 therein such monsters roar such spirits yell

 xxxvii
 lightened the heavens above the earth below
 roared loud that thundered and this shook
 blustered the tempests strong the whirlwinds blow
 the bitter storm drove hailstones in his look
 but yet his arm grew neither weak nor slow
 nor of that fury heed or care he took
 till low to earth the wounded tree down bended
 then fled the spirits all the charms all ended

 xxxviii
 the heavens grew clear the air waxed calm and still
 the wood returned to his wonted state
 of withcrafts free quite void of spirits ill
 of horror full but horror there innate
 he further proved if aught withstood his will
 to cut those trees as did the charms of late
 and finding naught to stop him smiled and said
 "o shadows vain o fools of shades afraid"

 xxxix
 from thence home to the campward turned the knight
 the hermit cried upstarting from his seat
 "now of the wood the charms have lost their might
 the sprites are conquered ended is the feat
 see where he comes" in glistering white all dight
 appeared the man bold stately high and great
 his eagle's silver wings to shine begun
 with wondrous splendor gainst the golden sun

 xl
 the camp received him with a joyful cry
 a cry the dales and hills about that flied
 then godfrey welcomed him with honors high
 his glory quenched all spite all envy killed
 "to yonder dreadful grove" quoth he "went i
 and from the fearful wood as me you willed
 have driven the sprites away thither let be
 your people sent the way is safe and free"

 xli
 sent were the workmen thither thence they brought
 timber enough by good advice select
 and though by skilless builders framed and wrought
 their engines rude and rams were late elect
 yet now the forts and towers from whence they fought
 were framed by a cunning architect
 william of all the genoese lord and guide
 which late ruled all the seas from side to side

 xlii
 but forced to retire from him at last
 the pagan fleet the seas moist empire won
 his men with all their stuff and store in haste
 home to the camp with their commander run
 in skill in wit in cunning him surpassed
 yet never engineer beneath the sun
 of carpenters an hundred large he brought
 that what their lord devised made and wrought

 xliii
 this man began with wondrous art to make
 not rams not mighty brakes not slings alone
 wherewith the firm and solid walls to shake
 to cast a dart or throw a shaft or stone
 but framed of pines and firs did undertake
 to build a fortress huge to which was none
 yet ever like whereof he clothed the sides
 against the balls of fire with raw bull's hides

 xliv
 in mortices and sockets framed just
 the beams the studs and puncheons joined he fast
 to beat the city's wall beneath forth brust
 a ram with horned front about her waist
 a bridge the engine from her side out thrust
 which on the wall when need she cast
 and from her top a turret small up stood
 strong surely armed and builded of like wood

 xlv
 set on an hundred wheels the rolling mass
 on the smooth lands went nimbly up and down
 though full of arms and armed men it was
 yet with small pains it ran as it had flown
 wondered the camp so quick to see it pass
 they praised the workmen and their skill unknown
 and on that day two towers they builded more
 like that which sweet clorinda burned before

 xlvi
 yet wholly were not from the saracines
 their works concealed and their labors hid
 upon that wall which next the camp confines
 they placed spies who marked all they did
 they saw the ashes wild and squared pines
 how to the tents trailed from the grove they slid
 and engines huge they saw yet could not tell
 how they were built their forms they saw not well

 xlvii
 their engines eke they reared and with great art
 repaired each bulwark turret port and tower
 and fortified the plain and easy part
 to bide the storm of every warlike stoure
 till as they thought no sleight or force of mart
 to undermine or scale the same had power
 and false ismeno gan new balls prepare
 of wicked fire wild wondrous strange and rare

 xlviii
 he mingled brimstone with bitumen fell
 fetched from that lake where sodom erst did sink
 and from that flood which nine times compassed hell
 some of the liquor hot he brought i think
 wherewith the quenchless fire he tempered well
 to make it smoke and flame and deadly stink
 and for his wood cut down the aged sire
 would thus revengement take with flame and fire

 xlix
 while thus the camp and thus the town were bent
 these to assault these to defend the wall
 a speedy dove through the clear welkin went
 straight o'er the tents seen by the soldiers all
 with nimble fans the yielding air she rent
 nor seemed it that she would alight or fall
 till she arrived near that besieged town
 then from the clouds at last she stooped down

 l
 but lo from whence i nolt a falcon came
 armed with crooked bill and talons long
 and twixt the camp and city crossed her game
 that durst nor bide her foe's encounter strong
 but right upon the royal tent down came
 and there the lords and princes great among
 when the sharp hawk nigh touched her tender head
 in godfrey's lap she fell with fear half dead

 li
 the duke received her saved her and spied
 as he beheld the bird a wondrous thing
 about her neck a letter close was tied
 by a small thread and thrust under her wing
 he loosed forth the writ and spread it wide
 and read the intent thereof "to judah's king"
 thus said the schedule "honors high increase
 the egyptian chieftain wisheth health and peace

 lii
 "fear not renowned prince resist endure
 till the third day or till the fourth at most
 i come and your deliverance will procure
 and kill your coward foes and all their host"
 this secret in that brief was closed up sure
 writ in strange language to the winged post
 given to transport for in their warlike need
 the east such message used oft with good speed

 liii
 the duke let go the captive dove at large
 and she that had his counsel close betrayed
 traitress to her great lord touched not the marge
 of salem's town but fled far thence afraid
 the duke before all those which had or charge
 or office high the letter read and said
 "see how the goodness of the lord foreshows
 the secret purpose of our crafty foes

 liv
 "no longer then let us protract the time
 but scale the bulwark of this fortress high
 through sweat and labor gainst those rocks sublime
 let us ascend which to the southward lie
 hard will it be that way in arms to climb
 but yet the place and passage both know i
 and that high wall by site strong on that part
 is least defenced by arms by work and art

 lv
 "thou raymond on this side with all thy might
 assault the wall and by those crags ascend
 my squadrons with mine engines huge shall fight
 and gainst the northern gate my puissance bend
 that so our foes beguiled with the sight
 our greatest force and power shall there attend
 while my great tower from thence shall nimbly slide
 and batter down some worse defended side

 lvi
 "camillo thou not far from me shalt rear
 another tower close to the walls ybrought"
 this spoken raymond old that sate him near
 and while he talked great things tossed in his thought
 said "to godfredo's counsel given us here
 naught can be added from it taken naught
 yet this i further wish that some were sent
 to spy their camp their secret and intent

 lvii
 "that may their number and their squadrons brave
 describe and through their tents disguised mask"
 quoth tancred "lo a subtle squire i have
 a person fit to undertake this task
 a man quick ready bold sly to deceive
 to answer wise and well advised to ask
 well languaged and that with time and place
 can change his look his voice his gait his grace"

 lviii
 sent for he came and when his lord him told
 what godfrey's pleasure was and what his own
 he smiled and said forthwith he gladly would
 "i go" quoth he "careless what chance be thrown
 and where encamped be these pagans bold
 will walk in every tent a spy unknown
 their camp even at noonday i enter shall
 and number all their horse and footmen all

 lix
 "how great how strong how armed this army is
 and what their guide intends i will declare
 to me the secrets of that heart of his
 and hidden thoughts shall open lie and bare"
 thus vafrine spoke nor longer stayed on this
 but for a mantle changed the coat he ware
 naked was his neck and bout his forehead bold
 of linen white full twenty yards he rolled

 lx
 his weapons were a syrian bow and quiver
 his gestures barbarous like the turkish train
 wondered all they that heard his tongue deliver
 of every land the language true and plain
 in tyre a born phoenician by the river
 of nile a knight bred in the egyptian main
 both people would have thought him forth he rides
 on a swift steed o'er hills and dales that glides

 lxi
 but ere the third day came the french forth sent
 their pioneers to even the rougher ways
 and ready made each warlike instrument
 nor aught their labor interrupts or stays
 the nights in busy toll they likewise spent
 and with long evenings lengthened forth short days
 till naught was left the hosts that hinder might
 to use their utmost power and strength in fight

 lxii
 that day which of the assault the day forerun
 the godly duke in prayer spent wellnigh
 and all the rest because they had misdone
 the sacrament receive and mercy cry
 then oft the duke his engines great begun
 to show where least he would their strength apply
 his foes rejoiced deluded in that sort
 to see them bent against their surest port

 lxiii
 but after aided by the friendly night
 his greatest engine to that side he brought
 where plainest seemed the wall where with their might
 the flankers least could hurt them as they fought
 and to the southern mountain's greatest height
 to raise his turret old raymondo sought
 and thou camillo on that part hadst thine
 where from the north the walls did westward twine

 lxiv
 but when amid the eastern heaven appeared
 the rising morning bright as shining glass
 the troubled pagans saw and seeing feared
 how the great tower stood not where late it was
 and here and there tofore unseen was reared
 of timber strong a huge and fearful mass
 and numberless with beams with ropes and strings
 they view the iron rams the barks and slings

 lxv
 the syrian people now were no whit slow
 their best defences to that side to bear
 where godfrey did his greatest engine show
 from thence where late in vain they placed were
 but he who at his back right well did know
 the host of egypt to be proaching near
 to him called guelpho and the roberts twain
 and said "on horseback look you still remain

 lxvi
 "and have regard while all our people strive
 to scale this wall where weak it seems and thin
 lest unawares some sudden host arrive
 and at our backs unlookedfor war begin"
 this said three fierce assaults at once they give
 the hardy soldiers all would die or win
 and on three parts resistance makes the king
 and rage gainst strength despair gainst hope doth bring

 lxvii
 himself upon his limbs with feeble eild
 that shook unwieldy with their proper weight
 his armor laid and long unused shield
 and marched gainst raymond to the mountain's height
 great solyman gainst godfrey took the field
 fornenst camillo stood argantes straight
 where tancred strong he found so fortune will
 that this good prince his wonted foe shall kill

 lxviii
 the archers shot their arrows sharp and keen
 dipped in the bitter juice of poison strong
 the shady face of heaven was scantly seen
 hid with the clouds of shafts and quarries long
 yet weapons sharp with greater fury been
 cast from the towers the pagan troops among
 for thence flew stones and clifts of marble rocks
 trees shod with iron timber logs and blocks

 lxix
 a thunderbolt seemed every stone it brake
 his limbs and armors on whom so it light
 that life and soul it did not only take
 but all his shape and face disfigured quite
 the lances stayed not in the wounds they make
 but through the gored body took their flight
 from side to side through flesh through skin and rind
 they flew and flying left sad death behind

 lxx
 but yet not all this force and fury drove
 the pagan people to forsake the wall
 but to revenge these deadly blows they strove
 with darts that fly with stones and trees that fall
 for need so cowards oft courageous prove
 for liberty they fight for life and all
 and oft with arrows shafts and stones that fly
 give bitter answer to a sharp reply

 lxxi
 this while the fierce assailants never cease
 but sternly still maintain a threefold charge
 and gainst the clouds of shafts draw nigh at ease
 under a pentise made of many a targe
 the armed towers close to the bulwarks press
 and strive to grapple with the battled marge
 and launch their bridges out meanwhile below
 with iron fronts the rams the walls down throw

 lxxii
 yet still rinaldo unresolved went
 and far unworthy him this service thought
 if mongst the common sort his pains he spent
 renown so got the prince esteemed naught
 his angry looks on every side he bent
 and where most harm most danger was he fought
 and where the wall high strong and surest was
 that part would he assault and that way pass

 lxxiii
 and turning to the worthies him behind
 all hardy knights whom dudon late did guide
 "oh shame" quoth he "this wall no war doth find
 when battered is elsewhere each part each side
 all pain is safety to a valiant mind
 each way is eath to him that dares abide
 come let us scale this wall though strong and high
 and with your shields keep off the darts that fly"

 lxxiv
 with him united all while thus he spake
 their targets hard above their heads they threw
 which joined in one an iron pentise make
 that from the dreadful storm preserved the crew
 defended thus their speedy course they take
 and to the wall without resistance drew
 for that strong penticle protected well
 the knights from all that flew and all that fell

 lxxv
 against the fort rinaldo gan uprear
 a ladder huge an hundred steps of height
 and in his arm the same did easily bear
 and move as winds do reeds or rushes light
 sometimes a tree a rock a dart or spear
 fell from above yet forward clomb the knight
 and upward fearless pierced careless still
 though mount olympus fell or ossa hill

 lxxvi
 a mount of ruins and of shafts a wood
 upon his shoulders and his shield he bore
 one hand the ladder held whereon he stood
 the other bare his targe his face before
 his hardy troop by his example good
 provoked with him the place assaulted sore
 and ladders long against the wall they clap
 unlike in courage yet unlike in hap

 lxxvii
 one died another fell he forward went
 and these he comforts and he threateneth those
 now with his hand outstretched the battlement
 wellnigh he reached when all his armed foes
 ran thither and their force and fury bent
 to throw him headlong down yet up he goes
 a wondrous thing one knight whole armed bands
 alone and hanging in the air withstands

 lxxviii
 withstands and forceth his great strength so far
 that like a palm whereon huge weight doth rest
 his forces so resisted stronger are
 his virtues higher rise the more oppressed
 till all that would his entrance bold debar
 he backward drove upleaped and possessed
 the wall and safe and easy with his blade
 to all that after came the passage made

 lxxix
 there killing such as durst and did withstand
 to noble eustace that was like to fall
 he reached forth his friendly conquering hand
 and next himself helped him to mount the wall
 this while godfredo and his people land
 their lives to greater harms and dangers thrall
 for there not man with man nor knight with knight
 contend but engines there with engines fight

 lxxx
 for in that place the paynims reared a post
 which late had served some gallant ship for mast
 and over it another beam they crossed
 pointed with iron sharp to it made fast
 with ropes which as men would the dormant tossed
 now out now in now back now forward cast
 in his swift pulleys oft the men withdrew
 the tree and oft the ridingbalk forth threw

 lxxxi
 the mighty beam redoubted oft his blows
 and with such force the engine smote and hit
 that her broad side the tower wide open throws
 her joints were broke her rafters cleft and split
 but yet gainst every hap whence mischief grows
 prepared the piece gainst such extremes made fit
 launch forth two scythes sharp cutting long and broad
 and cut the ropes whereon the engine rode

 lxxxii
 as an old rock which age or stormy wind
 tears from some craggy hill or mountain steep
 doth break doth bruise and into dust doth grind
 woods houses hamlets herds and folds of sheep
 so fell the beam and down with it all kind
 of arms of weapons and of men did sweep
 wherewith the towers once or twice did shake
 trembled the walls the hills and mountains quake

 lxxxiii
 victorious godfrey boldly forward came
 and had great hope even then the place to win
 but lo a fire with stench with smoke and flame
 withstood his passage stopped his entrance in
 such burning aetna yet could never frame
 when from her entrails hot her fires begin
 nor yet in summer on the indian plain
 such vapors warm from scorching air down rain

 lxxxiv
 there balls of wildfire there fly burning spears
 this flame was black that blue this red as blood
 stench wellnigh choked them noise deafs their ears
 smoke blinds their eyes fire kindleth on the wood
 nor those raw hides which for defence it wears
 could save the tower in such distress it stood
 for now they wrinkle now it sweats and fries
 now burns unless some help come down from skies

 lxxxv
 the hardy duke before his folk abides
 nor changed he color countenance or place
 but comforts those that from the scaldered hides
 with water strove the approaching flames to chase
 in these extremes the prince and those he guides
 half roasted stood before fierce vulcan's face
 when lo a sudden and unlookedfor blast
 the flames against the kindlers backward cast

 lxxxvi
 the winds drove back the fire where heaped lie
 the pagans' weapons where their engines were
 which kindling quickly in that substance dry
 burnt all their store and all their warlike gear
 o glorious captain whom the lord from high
 defends whom god preserves and holds so dear
 for thee heaven fights to thee the winds from far
 called with thy trumpet's blast obedient are

 lxxxvii
 but wicked ismen to his harm that saw
 how the fierce blast drove back the fire and flame
 by art would nature change and thence withdraw
 those noisome winds else calm and still the same
 'twixt two false wizards without fear or awe
 upon the walls in open sight he came
 black grisly loathsome grim and ugly faced
 like pluto old betwixt two furies placed

 lxxxviii
 and now the wretch those dreadful words begun
 which trouble make deep hell and all her flock
 now trembled is the air the golden sun
 his fearful beams in clouds did close and lock
 when from the tower which ismen could not shun
 out fled a mighty stone late half a rock
 which light so just upon the wizards three
 that driven to dust their bones and bodies be

 lxxxix
 to less than naught their members old were torn
 and shivered were their heads to pieces small
 as small as are the bruised grains of corn
 when from the mill dissolved to meal they fall
 their damned souls to deepest hell down borne
 far from the joy and light celestial
 the furies plunged in the infernal lake
 o mankind at their ends ensample take

 xc
 this while the engine which the tempest cold
 had saved from burning with his friendly blast
 approached had so near the battered hold
 that on the walls her bridge at ease she cast
 but solyman ran thither fierce and bold
 to cut the plank whereon the christians passed
 and had performed his will save that upreared
 high in the skies a turret new appeared

 xci
 far in the air up clomb the fortress tall
 higher than house than steeple church or tower
 the pagans trembled to behold the wall
 and city subject to her shot and power
 yet kept the turk his stand though on him fall
 of stones and darts a sharp and deadly shower
 and still to cut the bridge he hopes and strives
 and those that fear with cheerful speech revives

 xcii
 the angel michael to all the rest
 unseen appeared before godfredo's eyes
 in pure and heavenly armor richly dressed
 brighter than titan's rays in clearest skies
 "godfrey" quoth he "this is the moment blest
 to free this town that long in bondage lies
 see see what legions in thine aid i bring
 for heaven assists thee and heaven's glorious king

 xciii
 "lift up thine eyes and in the air behold
 the sacred armies how they mustered be
 that cloud of flesh in which for times of old
 all mankind wrapped is i take from thee
 and from thy senses their thick mist unfold
 that face to face thou mayest these spirits see
 and for a little space right well sustain
 their glorious light and view those angels plain

 xciv
 "behold the souls of every lord and knight
 that late bore arms and died for christ's dear sake
 how on thy side against this town they fight
 and of thy joy and conquest will partake
 there where the dust and smoke blind all men's sight
 where stones and ruins such an heap do make
 there hugo fights in thickest cloud imbarred
 and undermines that bulwark's groundwork hard

 xcv
 "see dudon yonder who with sword and fire
 assails and helps to scale the northern port
 that with bold courage doth thy folk inspire
 and rears their ladders gainst the assaulted fort
 he that high on the mount in grave attire
 is clad and crowned stands in kingly sort
 is bishop ademare a blessed spirit
 blest for his faith crowned for his death and merit

 xcvi
 "but higher lift thy happy eyes and view
 where all the sacred hosts of heaven appear"
 he looked and saw where winged armies flew
 innumerable pure divine and clear
 a battle round of squadrons three they show
 and all by threes those squadrons ranged were
 which spreading wide in rings still wider go
 moved with a stone calm water circleth so

 xcvii
 with that he winked and vanished was and gone
 that wondrous vision when he looked again
 his worthies fighting viewed he one by one
 and on each side saw signs of conquest plain
 for with rinaldo gainst his yielding lone
 his knights were entered and the pagans slain
 this seen the duke no longer stay could brook
 but from the bearer bold his ensign took

 xcviii
 and on the bridge he stepped but there was stayed
 by solyman who entrance all denied
 that narrow tree to virtue great was made
 the field as in few blows right soon was tried
 "here will i give my life for sion's aid
 here will i end my days" the soldan cried
 "behind me cut or break this bridge that i
 may kill a thousand christians first then die"

 xcix
 but thither fierce rinaldo threatening went
 and at his sight fled all the soldan's train
 "what shall i do if here my life be spent
 i spend and spill" quoth he "my blood in vain"
 with that his steps from godfrey back he bent
 and to him let the passage free remain
 who threatening followed as the soldan fled
 and on the walls the purple cross dispread

 c
 about his head he tossed he turned he cast
 that glorious ensign with a thousand twines
 thereon the wind breathes with his sweetest blast
 thereon with golden rays glad phoebus shines
 earth laughs for joy the streams forbear their haste
 floods clap their hands on mountains dance the pines
 and sion's towers and sacred temples smile
 for their deliverance from that bondage vile

 ci
 and now the armies reared the happy cry
 of victory glad joyful loud and shrill
 the hills resound the echo showereth high
 and tancred bold that fights and combats still
 with proud argantes brought his tower so nigh
 that on the wall against the boaster's will
 in his despite his bridge he also laid
 and won the place and there the cross displayed

 cii
 but on the southern hill where raymond fought
 against the townsmen and their aged king
 his hardy gascoigns gained small or naught
 their engine to the walls they could not bring
 for thither all his strength the prince had brought
 for life and safety sternly combating
 and for the wall was feeblest on that coast
 there were his soldiers best and engines most

 ciii
 besides the tower upon that quarter found
 unsure uneasy and uneven the way
 nor art could help but that the rougher ground
 the rolling mass did often stop and stay
 but now of victory the joyful sound
 the king and raymond heard amid their fray
 and by the shout they and their soldiers know
 the town was entered on the plain below

 civ
 which heard raymondo thus bespake this crew
 "the town is won my friends and doth it yet
 resist are we kept out still by these few
 shall we no share in this high conquest get"
 but from that part the king at last withdrew
 he strove in vain their entrance there to let
 and to a stronger place his folk he brought
 where to sustain the assault awhile he thought

 cv
 the conquerors at once now entered all
 the walls were won the gates were opened wide
 now bruised broken down destroyed fall
 the ports and towers that battery durst abide
 rageth the sword death murdereth great and small
 and proud 'twixt woe and horror sad doth ride
 here runs the blood in ponds there stands the gore
 and drowns the knights in whom it lived before



 nineteenth book

 the argument
 tancred in single combat kills his foe
 argantes strong the king and soldan fly
 to david's tower and save their persons so
 erminia well instructs vafrine the spy
 with him she rides away and as they go
 finds where her lord for dead on earth doth lie
 first she laments then cures him godfrey hears
 ormondo's treason and what marks he bears


 i
 now death or fear or care to save their lives
 from their forsaken walls the pagans chase
 yet neither force nor fear nor wisdom drives
 the constant knight argantes from his place
 alone against ten thousand foes he strives
 yet dreadless doubtless careless seemed his face
 nor death nor danger but disgrace he fears
 and still unconquered though o'erset appears

 ii
 but mongst the rest upon his helmet gay
 with his broad sword tancredi came and smote
 the pagan knew the prince by his array
 by his strong blows his armor and his coat
 for once they fought and when night stayed that fray
 new time they chose to end their combat hot
 but tancred failed wherefore the pagan knight
 cried "tancred com'st thou thus thus late to fight

 iii
 "too late thou com'st and not alone to war
 but yet the fight i neither shun nor fear
 although from knighthood true thou errest far
 since like an engineer thou dost appear
 that tower that troop thy shield and safety are
 strange kind of arms in single fight to bear
 yet shalt thou not escape o conqueror strong
 of ladies fair sharp death to avenge that wrong"

 iv
 lord tancred smiled with disdain and scorn
 and answerd thus "to end our strife" quoth he
 "behold at last i come and my return
 though late perchance will be too soon for thee
 for thou shalt wish of hope and help forlorn
 some sea or mountain placed twixt thee and me
 and well shalt know before we end this fray
 no fear of cowardice hath caused my stay

 v
 "but come aside thou by whose prowess dies
 the monsters knights and giants in all lands
 the killer of weak women thee defies"
 this said he turned to his fighting bands
 and bids them all retire "forbear" he cries
 "to strike this knight on him let none lay hands
 for mine he is more than a common foe
 by challenge new and promise old also"

 vi
 "descend" the fierce circassian gan reply
 "alone or all this troop for succor take
 to deserts waste or place frequented high
 for vantage none i will the fight forsake"
 thus given and taken was the bold defy
 and through the press agreed so they brake
 their hatred made them one and as they went
 each knight his foe did for despite defend

 vii
 great was his thirst of praise great the desire
 that tancred had the pagan's blood to spill
 nor could that quench his wrath or calm his ire
 if other hand his foe should foil or kill
 he saved him with his shield and cried "retire"
 to all he met "and do this knight none ill"
 and thus defending gainst his friends his foe
 through thousand angry weapons safe they go

 vii
 they left the city and they left behind
 godfredo's camp and far beyond it passed
 and came where into creeks and bosoms blind
 a winding hill his corners turned and cast
 a valley small and shady dale they find
 amid the mountains steep so laid and placed
 as if some theatre or closed place
 had been for men to fight or beasts to chase

 ix
 there stayed the champions both with rueful eyes
 argantes gan the fortress won to view
 tancred his foe withouten shield espies
 and said "whereon doth thy sad heart devise
 think'st thou this hour must end thy life untrue
 if this thou fear and dost foresee thy fate
 thy fear is vain thy foresight comes too late"

 x
 "i think" quoth he "on this distressed town
 the aged queen of judah's ancient land
 now lost now sacked spoiled and trodden down
 whose fall in vain i strived to withstand
 a small revenge for sion's fort o'erthrown
 that head can be cut off by my strong hand"
 this said together with great heed they flew
 for each his foe for bold and hardy knew

 xi
 tancred of body active was and light
 quick nimble ready both of hand and foot
 but higher by the head the pagan knight
 of limbs far greater was of heart as stout
 tancred laid low and traversed in his fight
 now to his ward retired now struck out
 oft with his sword his foe's fierce blows he broke
 and rather chose to wardthan bear his stroke

 xii
 but bold and bolt upright argantes fought
 unlike in gesture like in skill and art
 his sword outstretched before him far he brought
 nor would his weapon touch but pierce his heart
 to catch his point prince tancred strove and sought
 but at his breast or helm's unclosed part
 he threatened death and would with stretchedout brand
 his entrance close and fierce assaults withstand

 xiii
 with a tall ship so doth a galley fight
 when the still winds stir not the unstable main
 where this in nimbleness as that in might
 excels that stands this goes and comes again
 and shifts from prow to poop with turnings light
 meanwhile the other doth unmoved remain
 and on her nimble foe approaching nigh
 her weighty engines tumbleth down from high

 xiv
 the christian sought to enter on his foe
 voiding his point which at his breast was bent
 argantes at his face a thrust did throw
 which while the prince awards and doth prevent
 his ready hand the pagan turned so
 that all defence his quickness far o'erwent
 and pierced his side which done he said and smiled
 "the craftsman is in his own craft beguiled"

 xv
 tancredi bit his lip for scorn and shame
 nor longer stood on points of fence and skill
 but to revenge so fierce and fast he came
 as if his hand could not o'ertake his will
 and at his visor aiming just gan frame
 to his proud boast an answer sharp but still
 argantes broke the thrust and at halfsword
 swift hardy bold in stepped the christian lord

 xvi
 with his left foot fast forward gan he stride
 and with his left the pagan's right arm bent
 with his right hand meanwhile the man's right side
 he cut he wounded mangled tore and rent
 "to his victorious teacher" tancred cried
 "his conquered scholar hath this answer sent"
 argantes chafed struggled turned and twined
 yet could not so his captive arm unbind

 xvii
 his sword at last he let hang by the chain
 and griped his hardy foe in both his hands
 in his strong arms tancred caught him again
 and thus each other held and wrapped in bands
 with greater might alcides did not strain
 the giant antheus on the lybian sands
 on holdfast knots their brawny arms they cast
 and whom he hateth most each held embraced

 xviii
 such was their wrestling such their shocks and throws
 that down at once they tumbled both to ground
 arganteswere it hap or skill who knows
 his better hand loose and in freedom found
 but the good prince his hand more fit for blows
 with his huge weight the pagan underbound
 but he his disadvantage great that knew
 let go his hold and on his feet up flew

 xix
 far slower rose the unwieldy saracine
 and caught a rap ere he was reared upright
 but as against the blustering winds a pine
 now bends his top now lifts his head on height
 his courage so when it 'gan most decline
 the man reinforced and advanced his might
 and with fierce change of blows renewed the fray
 where rage for skill horror for art bore sway

 xx
 the purple drops from tancred's sides down railed
 but from the pagan ran whole streams of blood
 wherewith his force grew weak his courage quailed
 as fires die which fuel want or food
 tancred that saw his feeble arm now failed
 to strike his blows that scant he stirred or stood
 assuaged his anger and his wrath allayed
 and stepping back thus gently spoke and said

 xxi
 "yield hardy knight and chance of war or me
 confess to have subdued thee in this fight
 i will no trophy triumph spoil of thee
 nor glory wish nor seek a victor's right
 more terrible than erst" herewith grew he
 and all awaked his fury rage and might
 and said "dar'st thou of vantage speak or think
 or move argantes once to yield or shrink

 xxii
 "use use thy vantage thee and fortune both
 i scorn and punish will thy foolish pride"
 as a hot brand flames most ere it forth go'th
 and dying blazeth bright on every side
 so he when blood was lost with anger wroth
 revived his courage when his puissance died
 and would his latest hour which now drew nigh
 illustrate with his end and nobly die

 xxiii
 he joined his left hand to her sister strong
 and with them both let fall his weighty blade
 tancred to ward his blow his sword up slung
 but that it smote aside nor there it stayed
 but from his shoulder to his side along
 it glanced and many wounds at once it made
 yet tancred feared naught for in his heart
 found coward dread no place fear had no part

 xxiv
 his fearful blow he doubled but he spent
 his force in waste and all his strength in vain
 for tancred from the blow against him bent
 leaped aside the stroke fell on the plain
 with thine own weight o'erthrown to earth thou went
 argantes stout nor could'st thyself sustain
 thyself thou threwest down o happy man
 upon whose fall none boast or triumph can

 xxv
 his gaping wounds the fall set open wide
 the streams of blood about him made a lake
 helped with his left hand on one knee he tried
 to rear himself and new defence to make
 the courteous prince stepped back and "yield thee" cried
 no hurt he proffered him no blow he strake
 meanwhile by stealth the pagan false him gave
 a sudden wound threatening with speeches brave

 xxvi
 herewith tancredi furious grew and said
 "villain dost thou my mercy so despise"
 therewith he thrust and thrust again his blade
 and through his ventil pierced his dazzled eyes
 argantes died yet no complaint he made
 but as he furious lived he careless dies
 bold proud disdainful fierce and void of fear
 his motions last last looks last speeches were

 xxvii
 tancred put up his sword and praises glad
 gave to his god that saved him in this fight
 but yet this bloody conquest feebled had
 so much the conqueror's force strength and might
 that through the way he feared which homeward led
 he had not strength enough to walk upright
 yet as he could his steps from thence he bent
 and foot by foot a heavy pace forthwent

 xxviii
 his legs could bear him but a little stound
 and more he hastes more tired less was his speed
 on his right hand at last laid on the ground
 he leaned his hand weak like a shaking reed
 dazzled his eyes the world on wheels ran round
 day wrapped her brightness up in sable weed
 at length he swooned and the victor knight
 naught differed from his conquered foe in fight

 xxix
 but while these lords their private fight pursue
 made fierce and cruel through their secret hate
 the victor's ire destroyed the faithless crew
 from street to street and chased from gate to gate
 but of the sacked town the image true
 who can describe or paint the woful state
 or with fit words this spectacle express
 who can or tell the city's great distress

 xxx
 blood murder death each street house church defiled
 there heaps of slain appear there mountains high
 there underneath the unburied hills uppiled
 of bodies dead the living buried lie
 there the sad mother with her tender child
 doth tear her tresses loose complain and fly
 and there the spoiler by her amber hair
 draws to his lust the virgin chaste and fair

 xxxi
 but through the way that to the westhill yood
 whereon the old and stately temple stands
 all soiled with gore and wet with lukewarm blood
 rinaldo ran and chased the pagan bands
 above their heads he heaved his curtlax good
 life in his grace and death lay in his hands
 nor helm nor target strong his blows off bears
 best armed there seemed he no arms that wears

 xxxii
 for gainst his armed foes he only bends
 his force and scorns the naked folk to wound
 them whom no courage arms no arms defends
 he chased with his looks and dreadful sound
 oh who can tell how far his force extends
 how these he scorns threats those lays them on ground
 how with unequal harm with equal fear
 fled all all that well armed or naked were

 xxxiii
 fast fled the people weak and with the same
 a squadron strong is to the temple gone
 which burned and builded oft still keeps the name
 of the first founder wise king solomon
 that prince this stately house did whilom frame
 of cedar trees of gold and marble stone
 now not so rich yet strong and sure it was
 with turrets high thick walls and doors of brass

 xxxiv
 the knight arrived where in warklike sort
 the men that ample church had fortified
 and closed found each wicket gate and port
 and on the top defences ready spied
 he left his frowning looks and twice that fort
 from his high top down to the groundwork eyed
 and entrance sought and twice with his swift foot
 the mighty place he measured about

 xxxv
 like as a wolf about the closed fold
 rangeth by night his hoped prey to get
 enraged with hunger and with malice old
 which kind 'twixt him and harmless sheep hath set
 so searched he high and low about that hold
 where he might enter without stop or let
 in the great court he stayed his foes above
 attend the assault and would their fortune prove

 xxxvi
 there lay by chance a posted tree thereby
 kept for some needful use whate'er it were
 the armed galleys not so thick nor high
 their tall and lofty masts at genes uprear
 this beam the knight against the gates made fly
 from his strong hands all weights which lift and bear
 like a light lance that tree he shook and tossed
 and bruised the gate the threshold and the post

 xxxvii
 no marble stone no metal strong outbore
 the wondrous might of that redoubled blow
 the brazen hinges from the wall it tore
 it broke the locks and laid the doors down low
 no iron ram no engine could do more
 nor cannons great that thunderbolts forth throw
 his people like a flowing stream inthrong
 and after them entered the victor strong

 xxxviii
 the woful slaughter black and loathsome made
 that house sometime the sacred house of god
 o heavenly justice if thou be delayed
 on wretched sinners sharper falls thy rod
 in them this place profaned which invade
 thou kindled ire and mercy all forbode
 until with their hearts' blood the pagans vile
 this temple washed which they did late defile

 xxxix
 but solyman this while himself fast sped
 up to the fort which david's tower is named
 and with him all the soldiers left he led
 and gainst each entrance new defences framed
 the tyrant aladine eke thither fled
 to whom the soldan thus far off exclaimed
 thyself within this fortress safe uplock

 xl
 "for well this fortress shall thee and thy crown
 defend awhile here may we safe remain"
 "alas" quoth he "alas for this fair town
 which cruel war beats down even with the plain
 my life is done mine empire trodden down
 i reigned i lived but now nor live nor reign
 for now alas behold the fatal hour
 that ends our life and ends our kingly power"

 xli
 "where is your virtue where your wisdom grave
 and courage stout" the angry soldan said
 "let chance our kingdoms take which erst she gave
 yet in our hearts our kingly worth is laid
 but come and in this fort your person save
 refresh your weary limbs and strength decayed"
 thus counselled he and did to safety bring
 within that fort the weak and aged king

 xlii
 his iron mace in both his hands he hent
 and on his thigh his trusty sword he tied
 and to the entrance fierce and fearless went
 and kept the strait and all the french defied
 the blows were mortal which he gave or lent
 for whom he hit he slew else by his side
 laid low on earth that all fled from the place
 where they beheld that great and dreadful mace

 xliii
 but old raymondo with his hardy crew
 by chance came thither to his great mishap
 to that defended path the old man flew
 and scorned his blows and him that kept the gap
 he struck his foe his blow no blood forth drew
 but on the front with that he caught a rap
 which in a swoon low in the dust him laid
 wide open trembling with his arms displayed

 xliv
 the pagans gathered heart at last though fear
 their courage weak had put to flight but late
 so that the conquerors repulsed were
 and beaten back else slain before the gate
 the soldan mongst the dead beside him near
 that saw lord raymond lie in such estate
 cried to his men "within these bars" quoth he
 "come draw this knight and let him captive be"

 xlv
 forward they rushed to execute his word
 but hard and dangerous that emprise they found
 for none of raymond's men forsook their lord
 but to their guide's defence they flocked round
 thence fury fights hence pity draws the sword
 nor strive they for vile cause or on light ground
 the life and freedom of that champion brave
 those spoil these would preserve those kill these save

 xlvi
 but yet at last if they had longer fought
 the hardy soldan would have won the field
 for gainst his thundering mace availed naught
 or helm of temper fine or sevenfold shield
 but from each side great succor now was brought
 to his weak foes now fit to faint and yield
 and both at once to aid and help the same
 the sovereign duke and young rinaldo came

 xlvii
 as when a shepherd raging round about
 that sees a storm with wind hail thunder rain
 when gloomy clouds have day's bright eye put out
 his tender flocks drives from the open plain
 to some thick grove or mountain's shady foot
 where heaven's fierce wrath they may unhurt sustain
 and with his hook his whistle and his cries
 drives forth his fleecy charge and with them flies

 xlviii
 so fled the soldan when he gan descry
 this tempest come from angry war forthcast
 the armor clashed and lightened gainst the sky
 and from each side swords weapons fire outbrast
 he sent his folk up to the fortress high
 to shun the furious storm himself stayed last
 yet to the danger he gave place at length
 for wit his courage wisdom ruled his strength

 xlix
 but scant the knight was safe the gate within
 scant closed were the doors when having broke
 the bars rinaldo doth assault begin
 against the port and on the wicket stroke
 his matchless might his great desire to win
 his oath and promise doth his wrath provoke
 for he had sworn nor should his word be vain
 to kill the man that had prince sweno slain

 l
 and now his armed hand that castle great
 would have assaulted and had shortly won
 nor safe pardie the soldan there a seat
 had found his fatal foes' sharp wrath to shun
 had not godfredo sounded the retreat
 for now dark shades to shroud the earth begun
 within the town the duke would lodge that night
 and with the morn renew the assault and fight

 li
 with cheerful look thus to his folk he said
 "high god hath holpen well his children dear
 this work is done the rest this night delayed
 doth little labor bring less doubt no fear
 this tower our foe's weak hope and latest aid
 we conquer will when sun shall next appear
 meanwhile with love and tender ruth go see
 and comfort those which hurt and wounded be

 lii
 "go cure their wounds which boldly ventured
 their lives and spilt their bloods to get this hold
 that fitteth more this host for christ forth led
 than thirst of vengeance or desire of gold
 too much ah too much blood this day is shed
 in some we too much haste to spoil behold
 but i command no more you spoil and kill
 and let a trumpet publish forth my will"

 liii
 this said he went where raymond panting lay
 waked from the swoon wherein he late had been
 nor solyman with countenance less gay
 bespake his troops and kept his grief unseen
 "my friends you are unconquered this day
 in spite of fortune still our hope is green
 for underneath great shows of harm and fear
 our dangers small our losses little were

 liv
 "burnt are your houses and your people slain
 yet safe your town is though your walls be gone
 for in yourselves and in your sovereign
 consists your city not in lime and stone
 your king is safe and safe is all his train
 in this strong fort defended from their fone
 and on this empty conquest let them boast
 till with this town again their lives be lost

 lv
 "and on their heads the loss at last will light
 for with good fortune proud and insolent
 in spoil and murder spend they day and night
 in riot drinking lust and ravishment
 and may amid their preys with little fight
 at ease be overthrown killed slain and spent
 if in this carelessness the egyptian host
 upon them fall which now draws near this coast

 lvi
 "meanwhile the highest buildings of this town
 we may shake down with stones about their ears
 and with our darts and spears from engines thrown
 command that hill christ's sepulchre that bears"
 thus comforts he their hopes and hearts cast down
 awakes their valors and exiles their fears
 but while the things hapt thus vafrino goes
 unknown amid ten thousand armed foes

 lvii
 the sun nigh set had brought to end the day
 when vafrine went the pagan host to spy
 he passed unknown a close and secret way
 a traveller false cunning crafty sly
 past ascalon he saw the morning gray
 step o'er the threshold of the eastern sky
 and ere bright titan half his course had run
 that camp that mighty host to show begun

 lviii
 tents infinite and standards broad he spies
 this red that white that blue this purple was
 and hears strange tongues and stranger harmonies
 of trumpets clarions and wellsounding brass
 the elephant there brays the camel cries
 the horses neigh as to and fro they pass
 which seen and heard he said within his thought
 hither all asia is all afric brought

 lix
 he viewed the camp awhile her site and seat
 what ditch what trench it had what rampire strong
 nor close nor secret ways to work his feat
 he longer sought nor hid him from the throng
 but entered through the gates broad royal great
 and oft he asked and answered oft among
 in questions wise in answers short and sly
 bold was his look eyes quick front lifted high

 lx
 on every side he pried here and there
 and marked each way each passage and each tent
 the knights he notes their steeds and arms they bear
 their names their armor and their government
 and greater secrets hopes to learn and hear
 their hidden purpose and their close intent
 so long he walked and wandered till he spied
 the way to approach the great pavilions' side

 lxi
 there as he looked he saw the canvas rent
 through which the voice found eath and open way
 from the close lodgings of the regal tent
 and inmost closet where the captain lay
 so that if emireno spake forth went
 the sound to them that listen what they say
 there vafrine watched and those that saw him thought
 to mend the breach that there he stood and wrought

 lxii
 the captain great within bareheaded stood
 his body armed and clad in purple weed
 two pages bore his shield and helmet good
 he leaning on a bending lance gave heed
 to a big man whose looks were fierce and proud
 with whom he parleyed of some haughty deed
 godfredo's name as vafrine watched he heard
 which made him give more heed take more regard

 lxiii
 thus spake the chieftain to that surly sir
 "art thou so sure that godfrey shall be slain"
 "i am" quoth he "and swear ne'er to retire
 except he first be killed to court again
 i will prevent those that with me conspire
 nor other guerdon ask i for my pain
 but that i may hang up his harness brave
 at gair and under them these words engrave

 lxiv
 "'these arms ormondo took in noble fight
 from godfrey proud that spoiled all asia's lands
 and with them took his life and here on high
 in memory thereof this trophy stands'"
 the duke replied "ne'er shall that deed bold knight
 pass unrewarded at our sovereign's hands
 what thou demandest shall he gladly grant
 nor gold nor guerdon shalt thou wish or want

 lxv
 "those counterfeited armors then prepare
 because the day of fight approacheth fast"
 "they ready are" quoth he then both forbare
 from further talk these speeches were the last
 vafrine these great things heard with grief and care
 remained astound and in his thoughts oft cast
 what treason false this was how feigned were
 those arms but yet that doubt he could not clear

 lxvi
 from thence he parted and broad waking lay
 all that long night nor slumbered once nor slept
 but when the camp by peep of springing day
 their banner spread and knights on horseback leapt
 with them he marched forth in meet array
 and where they pitched lodged and with them kept
 and then from tent to tent he stalked about
 to hear and see and learn this secret out

 lxvii
 searching about on a rich throne he fand
 armida set with dames and knights around
 sullen she sat and sighed it seemed she scanned
 some weighty matters in her thoughts profounds
 her rosy cheek leaned on her lily hand
 her eyes love's twinkling stars she bent to ground
 weep she or no he knows not yet appears
 her humid eyes even great with child with tears

 lxviii
 he saw before her set adrastus grim
 that seemed scant to live move or respire
 so was he fixed on his mistress trim
 so gazed he and fed his fond desire
 but tisiphern beheld now her now him
 and quaked sometime for love sometime for ire
 and in his cheeks the color went and came
 for there wrath's fire now burnt now shone love's flame

 lxix
 then from the garland fair of virgins bright
 mongst whom he lay enclosed rose altamore
 his hot desire he hid and kept from sight
 his looks were ruled by cupid's crafty lore
 his left eye viewed her hand her face his right
 both watched her beauties hid and secret store
 and entrance found where her thin veil bewrayed
 the milkenway between her breasts that laid

 lxx
 her eyes armida lift from earth at last
 and cleared again her front and visage sad
 midst clouds of woe her looks which overcast
 she lightened forth a smile sweet pleasant glad
 "my lord" quoth she "your oath and promise passed
 hath freed my heart of all the griefs it had
 that now in hope of sweet revenge it lives
 such joy such ease desired vengeance gives"

 lxxi
 "cheer up thy looks" answered the indian king
 "and for sweet beauty's sake appease thy woe
 cast at your feet ere you expect the thing
 i will present the head of thy strong foe
 else shall this hand his person captive bring
 and cast in prison deep" he boasted so
 his rival heard him well yet answered naught
 but bit his lips and grieved in secret thought

 lxxii
 to tisipherne the damsel turning right
 "and what say you my noble lord" quoth she
 he taunting said "i that am slow to fight
 will follow far behind the worth to see
 of this your terrible and puissant knight"
 in scornful words this bitter scoff gave he
 "good reason" quoth the king "thou come behind
 nor e'er compare thee with the prince of ind"

 lxxiii
 lord tisiphernes shook his head and said
 "oh had my power free like my courage been
 or had i liberty to use this blade
 who slow who weakest is soon should be seen
 nor thou nor thy great vaunts make me afraid
 but cruel love i fear and this fair queen"
 this said to challenge him the king forth leapt
 but up their mistress start and twixt them stepped

 lxxiv
 "will you thus rob me of that gift" quoth she
 "which each hath vowed to give by word and oath
 you are my champions let that title be
 the bond of love and peace between you both
 he that displeased is is displeased with me
 for which of you is grieved and i not wroth"
 thus warned she them their hearts for ire nigh broke
 in forced peace and rest thus bore love's yoke

 lxxv
 all this heard vafrine as he stood beside
 and having learned the truth he left the tent
 that treason was against the christian's guide
 contrived he wist yet wist not how it went
 by words and questions far off he tried
 to find the truth more difficult more bent
 was he to know it and resolved to die
 or of that secret close the intent to spy

 lxxvi
 of sly intelligence he proved all ways
 all crafts all wiles that in his thoughts abide
 yet all in vain the man by wit assays
 to know that false compact and practice hid
 but chance what wisdom could not tell bewrays
 fortune of all his doubt the knots undid
 so that prepared for godfrey's last mishap
 at ease he found the net and spied the trap

 lxxvii
 thither he turned again where seated was
 the angry lover 'twixt her friends and lords
 for in that troop much talk he thought would pass
 each great assembly store of news affords
 he sided there a lusty lovely lass
 and with some courtly terms the wench he boards
 he feigns acquaintance and as bold appears
 as he had known that virgin twenty years

 lxxviii
 he said "would some sweet lady grace me so
 to chose me for her champion friend and knight
 proud godfrey's or rinaldo's head i trow
 should feel the sharpness of my curtlax bright
 ask me the head fair mistress of some foe
 for to your beauty wooed is my might"
 so he began and meant in speeches wise
 further to wade but thus he broke the ice

 lxxix
 therewith he smiled and smiling gan to frame
 his looks so to their old and native grace
 that towards him another virgin came
 heard him beheld him and with bashful face
 said "for thy mistress choose no other dame
 but me on me thy love and service place
 i take thee for my champion and apart
 would reason with thee if my knight thou art"

 lxxx
 withdrawn she thus began "vafrine pardie
 i know thee well and me thou knowest of old"
 to his last trump this drove the subtle spy
 but smiling towards her he turned him bold
 "ne'er that i wot i saw thee erst with eye
 yet for thy worth all eyes should thee behold
 thus much i know right well for from the same
 which erst you gave me different is my name

 lxxxi
 "my mother bore me near bisertus wall
 her name was lesbine mine is almansore"
 "i knew long since" quoth she "what men thee call
 and thine estate dissemble it no more
 from me thy friend hide not thyself at all
 if i betray thee let me die therefore
 i am erminia daughter to a prince
 but tancred's slave thy fellowservant since

 lxxxii
 "two happy months within that prison kind
 under thy guard rejoiced i to dwell
 and thee a keeper meek and good did find
 the same the same i am behold me well"
 the squire her lovely beauty called to mind
 and marked her visage fair "from thee expel
 all fear" she says "for me live safe and sure
 i will thy safety not thy harm procure

 lxxxiii
 "but yet i pray thee when thou dost return
 to my dear prison lead me home again
 for in this hateful freedom even and morn
 i sigh for sorrow mourn and weep for pain
 but if to spy perchance thou here sojourn
 great hap thou hast to know these secrets plain
 for i their treasons false false trains can say
 which few beside can tell none will betray"

 lxxxiv
 on her he gazed and silent stood this while
 armida's sleights he knew and trains unjust
 women have tongues of craft and hearts of guile
 they will they will not fools that on them trust
 for in their speech is death hell in their smile
 at last he said "if hence depart you lust
 i will you guide on this conclude we here
 and further speech till fitter time forbear"

 lxxxv
 forthwith ere thence the camp remove to ride
 they were resolved their flight that season fits
 vafrine departs she to the dames beside
 returns and there on thorns awhile she sits
 of her new knight she talks till time and tide
 to scape unmarked she find then forth she gets
 thither where vafrine her unseen abode
 there took she horse and from the camp they rode

 lxxxvi
 and now in deserts waste and wild arrived
 far from the camp far from resort and sight
 vafrine began "gainst godfrey's life contrived
 the false compacts and trains unfold aright"
 then she those treasons from their spring derived
 repeats and brings their hid deceits to light
 "eight knights" she says "all courtiers brave there are
 but ormond strong the rest surpasseth far

 lxxxvii
 "these whether hate or hope of gain them move
 conspired have and framed their treason so
 that day when emiren by fight shall prove
 to win lost asia from his christian foe
 these with the cross scored on their arms above
 and armed like frenchmen will disguised go
 like godfrey's guard that gold and white do wear
 such shall their habit be and such their gear

 lxxxviii
 "yet each will bear a token in his crest
 that so their friends for pagans may them know
 but in close fight when all the soldiers best
 shall mingled be to give the fatal blow
 they will keep near and pierce godfredo's breast
 while of his faithful guard they bear false show
 and all their swords are dipped in poison strong
 because each wound shall bring sad death ere long

 lxxxix
 "and for their chieftain wist i knew your guise
 what garments ensigns and what arms you carry
 those feigned arms he forced me to devise
 so that from yours but small or naught they vary
 but these unjust commands my thoughts despise
 within their camp therefore i list not tarry
 my heart abhors i should this hand defile
 with spot of treason or with act of guile

 xc
 "this is the cause but not the cause alone"
 and there she ceased and blushed and on the main
 cast down her eyes these last words scant outgone
 she would have stopped nor durst pronounce them plain
 the squire what she concealed would know as one
 that from her breast her secret thoughts could strain
 "of little faith" quoth he "why would'st thou hide
 those causes true from me thy squire and guide"

 xci
 with that she fetched a sigh sad sore and deep
 and from her lips her words slow trembling came
 "fruitless" she said "untimely hard to keep
 vain modesty farewell and farewell shame
 why hope you restless love to bring on sleep
 why strive you fires to quench sweet cupid's flame
 no no such cares and such respects beseem
 great ladies wandering maids them naught esteem

 xcii
 "that night fatal to me and antioch town
 then made a prey to her commanding foe
 my loss was greater than was seen or known
 there ended not but thence began my woe
 light was the loss of friends of realm or crown
 but with my state i lost myself also
 ne'er to be found again for then i lost
 my wit my sense my heart my soul almost

 xciii
 "through fire and sword through blood and death vafrine
 which all my friends did burn did kill did chase
 thou know'st i ran to thy dear lord and mine
 when first he entered had my father's place
 and kneeling with salt ears in my swollen eyne
 'great prince' quoth i 'grant mercy pity grace
 save not my kingdom not my life i said
 but save mine honor let me die a maid'

 xciv
 "he lift me by the trembling hand from ground
 nor stayed he till my humble speech was done
 but said 'a friend and keeper hast thou found
 fair virgin nor to me in vain you run'
 a sweetness strange from that sweet voice's sound
 pierced my heart my breast's weak fortress won
 which creeping through my bosom soft became
 a wound a sickness and a quenchless flame

 xcv
 "he visits me with speeches kind and grave
 he sought to ease my grief and sorrows' smart
 he said 'i give thee liberty receive
 all that is thine and at thy will depart'
 alas he robbed me when he thought he gave
 free was erminia but captived her heart
 mine was the body his the soul and mind
 he gave the cage but kept the bird behind

 xcvi
 "but who can hide desire or love suppress
 oft of his worth with thee in talk i strove
 thou by my trembling fit that well could'st guess
 what fever held me saidst 'thou art in love'
 but i denied for what can maids do less
 and yet my sighs thy sayings true did prove
 instead of speech my looks my tears mine eyes
 told in what flame what fire thy mistress fries

 xcvii
 "unhappy silence well i might have told
 my woes and for my harms have sought relief
 since now my pains and plaints i utter bold
 where none that hears can help or ease my grief
 from him i parted and did close upfold
 my wounds within my bosom death was chief
 of all my hopes and helps till love's sweet flame
 plucked off the bridle of respect and shame

 xcviii
 "and caused me ride to seek my lord and knight
 for he that made me sick could make me sound
 but on an ambush i mischanced to light
 of cruel men in armour clothed round
 hardly i scaped their hand by mature flight
 and fled to wilderness and desert ground
 and there i lived in groves and forests wild
 with gentle grooms and shepherds' daughters mild

 xcix
 "but when hot love which fear had late suppressed
 revived again there nould i longer sit
 but rode the way i came nor e'er took rest
 till on like danger like mishap i hit
 a troop to forage and to spoil addressed
 encountered me nor could i fly from it
 thus was i ta'en and those that had me caught
 egyptians were and me to gaza brought

 c
 "and for a present to their captain gave
 whom i entreated and besought so well
 that he mine honor had great care to save
 and since with fair armida let me dwell
 thus taken oft escaped oft i have
 ah see what haps i passed what dangers fell
 so often captive free so oft again
 still my first bands i keep still my first chain

 ci
 "and he that did this chain so surely bind
 about my heart which none can loose but he
 let him not say 'go wandering damsel find
 some other home thou shalt not bide with me'
 but let him welcome me with speeches kind
 and in my wonted prison set me free"
 thus spake the princess thus she and her guide
 talked day and night and on their journey ride

 cii
 through the highways vafrino would not pass
 a path more secret safe and short he knew
 and now close by the city's wall he was
 when sun was set night in the east upflew
 with drops of blood besmeared he found the grass
 and saw where lay a warrior murdered new
 that all bebled the ground his face to skies
 he turns and seems to threat though dead he lies

 ciii
 his harness and his habit both betrayed
 he was a pagan forward went the squire
 and saw whereas another champion laid
 dead on the land all soiled with blood and mire
 "this was some christian knight" vafrino said
 and marking well his arms and rich attire
 he loosed his helm and saw his visage plain
 and cried "alas here lies tancredi slain"

 civ
 the woful virgin tarried and gave heed
 to the fierce looks of that proud saracine
 till that high cry full of sad fear and dread
 pierced through her heart with sorrow grief and pine
 at tancred's name thither she ran with speed
 like one half mad or drunk with too much wine
 and when she saw his face pale bloodless dead
 she lighted nay she stumbled from her steed

 cv
 her springs of tears she looseth forth and cries
 "hither why bring'st thou me ah fortune blind
 where dead for whom i lived my comfort lies
 where war for peace travail for rest i find
 tancred i have thee see thee yet thine eyes
 looked not upon thy love and handmaid kind
 undo their doors their lids fast closed sever
 alas i find thee for to lose thee ever

 cvi
 "i never thought that to mine eyes my dear
 thou couldst have grievous or unpleasant been
 but now would blind or rather dead i were
 that thy sad plight might be unknown unseen
 alas where is thy mirth and smiling cheer
 where are thine eyes' clear beams and sparkles sheen
 of thy fair cheek where is the purple red
 and forehead's whiteness are all gone all dead

 cvii
 "though gone though dead i love thee still behold
 death wounds but kills not love yet if thou live
 sweet soul still in his breast my follies bold
 ah pardon love's desires and stealths forgive
 grant me from his pale mouth some kisses cold
 since death doth love of just reward deprive
 and of thy spoils sad death afford me this
 let me his mouth pale cold and bloodless kiss

 cviii
 "o gentle mouth with speeches kind and sweet
 thou didst relieve my grief my woe and pain
 ere my weak soul from this frail body fleet
 ah comfort me with one dear kiss or twain
 perchance if we alive had happed to meet
 they had been given which now are stolen o vain
 o feeble life betwixt his lips out fly
 oh let me kiss thee first then let me die

 cix
 "receive my yielding spirit and with thine
 guide it to heaven where all true love hath place"
 this said she sighed and tore her tresses fine
 and from her eyes two streams poured on his face
 the man revived with those showers divine
 awaked and opened his lips a space
 his lips were open but fast shut his eyes
 and with her sighs one sigh from him upflies

 cx
 the dame perceived that tancred breathed and sighed
 which calmed her grief somedeal and eased her fears
 "unclose thine eyes" she says "my lord and knight
 see my last services my plaints and tears
 see her that dies to see thy woful plight
 that of thy pain her part and portion bears
 once look on me small is the gift i crave
 the last which thou canst give or i can have"

 cxi
 tancred looked up and closed his eyes again
 heavy and dim and she renewed her woe
 quoth vafrine "cure him first and then complain
 medicine is life's chief friend plaint her most foe"
 they plucked his armor off and she each vein
 each joint and sinew felt and handled so
 and searched so well each thrust each cut and wound
 that hope of life her love and skill soon found

 cxii
 from weariness and loss of blood she spied
 his greatest pains and anguish most proceed
 naught but her veil amid those deserts wide
 she had to bind his wounds in so great need
 but love could other bands though strange provide
 and pity wept for joy to see that deed
 for with her amber locks cut off each wound
 she tied o happy man so cured so bound

 cxiii
 for why her veil was short and thin those deep
 and cruel hurts to fasten roll and blind
 nor salve nor simple had she yet to keep
 her knight on live strong charms of wondrous kind
 she said and from him drove that deadly sleep
 that now his eyes he lifted turned and twined
 and saw his squire and saw that courteous dame
 in habit strange and wondered whence she came

 cxiv
 he said "o vafrine tell me whence com'st thou
 and who this gentle surgeon is disclose"
 she smiled she sighed she looked she wist not how
 she wept rejoiced she blushed as red as rose
 "you shall know all" she says "your surgeon now
 commands you silence rest and soft repose
 you shall be sound prepare my guerdon meet"
 his head then laid she in her bosom sweet

 cxv
 vafrine devised this while how he might bear
 his master home ere night obscured the land
 when lo a troop of soldiers did appear
 whom he descried to be tancredi's band
 with him when he and argant met they were
 but when they went to combat hand for hand
 he bade them stay behind and they obeyed
 but came to seek him now so long he stayed

 cxvi
 besides them many followed that enquest
 but these alone found out the rightest way
 upon their friendly arms the men addressed
 a seat whereon he sat he leaned he lay
 quoth tancred "shall the strong circassian rest
 in this broad field for wolves and crows a prey
 ah no defraud not you that champion brave
 of his just praise of his due tomb and grave

 cxvii
 "with his dead bones no longer war have i
 boldly he died and nobly was he slain
 then let us not that honor him deny
 which after death alonely doth remain"
 the pagan dead they lifted up on high
 and after tancred bore him through the plain
 close by the virgin chaste did vafrine ride
 as he that was her squire her guard her guide

 cxviii
 "not home" quoth tancred "to my wonted tent
 but bear me to this royal town i pray
 that if cut short by human accident
 i die there i may see my latest day
 the place where christ upon his cross was rent
 to heaven perchance may easier make the way
 and ere i yield to death's and fortune's rage
 performed shall be my vow and pilgrimage"

 cxix
 thus to the city was tancredi borne
 and fell on sleep laid on a bed of down
 vafrino where the damsel might sojourn
 a chamber got close secret near his own
 that done he came the mighty duke beforn
 and entrance found for till his news were known
 naught was concluded mongst those knights and lords
 their counsel hung on his report and words

 cxx
 where weak and weary wounded raymond laid
 godfrey was set upon his couch's side
 and round about the man a ring was made
 of lords and knights that filled the chamber wide
 there while the squire his late discovery said
 to break his talk none answered none replied
 "my lord" he said "at your command i went
 and viewed their camp each cabin booth and tent

 cxxi
 "but of that mighty host the number true
 expect not that i can or should descry
 all covered with their armies might you view
 the fields the plains the dales and mountains high
 i saw what way soe'er they went and drew
 they spoiled the land drunk floods and fountains dry
 for not whole jordan could have given them drink
 nor all the grain in syria bread i think

 cxxii
 "but yet amongst them many bands are found
 both horse and foot of little force and might
 that keep no order know no trumpet's sound
 that draw no sword but far off shoot and fight
 but yet the persian army doth abound
 with many a footman strong and hardy knight
 so doth the king's own troop which all is framed
 of soldiers old the immortal squadron named

 cxxiii
 "immortal called is that band of right
 for of that number never wanteth one
 but in his empty place some other knight
 steps in when any man is dead or gone
 this army's leader emireno hight
 like whom in wit and strength are few or none
 who hath in charge in plain and pitched field
 to fight with you to make you fly or yield

 cxxiv
 "and well i know their army and their host
 within a day or two will here arrive
 but thee rinaldo it behoveth most
 to keep thy noble head for which they strive
 for all the chief in arms or courage boast
 they will the same to queen armida give
 and for the same she gives herself in price
 such hire will many hands to work entice

 cxxv
 "the chief of these that have thy murder sworn
 is altamore the king of samarcand
 adrastus then whose realm lies near the morn
 a hardy giant bold and strong of hand
 this king upon an elephant is borne
 for under him no horse can stir or stand
 the third is tisipherne as brave a lord
 as ever put on helm or girt on sword"

 cxxvi
 this said from young rinaldo's angry eyes
 flew sparks of wrath flames in his visage shined
 he longed to be amid those enemies
 nor rest nor reason in his heart could find
 but to the duke vafrine his talk applies
 "the greatest news my lord are yet behind
 for all their thoughts their crafts and counsels tend
 by treason false to bring thy life to end"

 cxxvii
 then all from point to point he gan expose
 the false compact how it was made and wrought
 the arms and ensigns feigned poison close
 ormondo's vaunt what praise what thank he sought
 and what reward and satisfied all those
 that would demand inquire or ask of aught
 silence was made awhile when godfrey thus
 "raymondo say what counsel givest thou us"

 cxxviii
 "not as we purposed late next morn" quoth he
 "let us not scale but round besiege this tower
 that those within may have no issue free
 to sally out and hurt us with their power
 our camp well rested and refreshed see
 provided well gainst this last storm and shower
 and then in pitched field fight if you will
 if not delay and keep this fortress still

 cxxix
 "but lest you be endangered hurt or slain
 of all your cares take care yourself to save
 by you this camp doth live doth win doth reign
 who else can rule or guide these squadrons brave
 and for the traitors shall be noted plain
 command your guard to change the arms they have
 so shall their guile be known in their own net
 so shall they fall caught in the snare they set"

 cxxx
 "as it hath ever" thus the duke begun
 "thy counsel shows thy wisdom and thy love
 and what you left in doubt shall thus be done
 we will their force in pitched battle prove
 closed in this wall and trench the fight to shun
 doth ill this camp beseem and worse behove
 but we their strength and manhood will assay
 and try in open field and open day

 cxxxi
 "the fame of our great conquests to sustain
 or bide our looks and threats they are not able
 and when this army is subdued and slain
 then is our empire settled firm and stable
 the tower shall yield or but resist in vain
 for fear her anchor is despair her cable"
 thus he concludes and rolling down the west
 fast set the stars and called them all to rest



 twentieth book

 the argument
 the pagan host arrives and cruel fight
 makes with the christians and their faithful power
 the soldan longs in field to prove his might
 with the old king quits the besieged tower
 yet both are slain and in eternal night
 a famous hand gives each his fatal hour
 rinald appeased armida first the field
 the christians win then praise to god they yield


 i
 the sun called up the world from idle sleep
 and of the day ten hours were gone and past
 when the bold troop that had the tower to keep
 espied a sudden mist that overcast
 the earth with mirksome clouds and darkness deep
 and saw it was the egyptian camp at last
 which raised the dust for hills and valleys broad
 that host did overspread and overload

 ii
 therewith a merry shout and joyful cry
 the pagans reared from their besieged hold
 the cranes from thrace with such a rumor fly
 his hoary frost and snow when hyems old
 pours down and fast to warmer regions hie
 from the sharp winds fierce storms and tempests cold
 and quick and ready this new hope and aid
 their hands to shoot their tongues to threaten made

 iii
 from whence their ire their wrath and hardy threat
 proceeds the french well knew and plain espied
 for from the walls and ports the army great
 they saw her strength her number pomp and pride
 swelled their breasts with valor's noble heat
 battle and fight they wished "arm arm" they cried
 the youth to give the sign of fight all prayed
 their duke and were displeased because delayed

 iv
 till morning next for he refused to fight
 their haste and heat he bridled but not brake
 nor yet with sudden fray or skirmish light
 of these new foes would he vain trial make
 "after so many wars" he says "good right
 it is that one day's rest at least you take"
 for thus in his vain foes he cherish would
 the hope which in their strength they have and hold

 v
 to see aurora's gentle beam appear
 the soldiers armed prest and ready lay
 the skies were never half so fair and clear
 as in the breaking of that blessed day
 the merry morning smiled and seemed to wear
 upon her silver crown sun's golden ray
 and without cloud heaven his redoubled light
 bent down to see this field this fray this fight

 vi
 when first he saw the daybreak show and shine
 godfrey his host in good array brought out
 and to besiege the tyrant aladine
 raymond he left and all the faithful rout
 that from the towns was come of palestine
 to serve and succor their deliverer stout
 and with them left a hardy troop beside
 of gascoigns strong in arms well proved oft tried

 vii
 such was godfredo's countenance such his cheer
 that from his eye sure conquest flames and streams
 heaven's gracious favors in his looks appear
 and great and goodly more than erst he seems
 his face and forehead full of noblesse were
 and on his cheek smiled youth's purple beams
 and in his gait his grace his acts his eyes
 somewhat far more than mortal lives and lies

 viii
 he had not marched far ere he espied
 of his proud foes the mighty host draw nigh
 a hill at first he took and fortified
 at his left hand which stood his army by
 broad in the front behind more strait uptied
 his army ready stood the fight to try
 and to the middle ward well armed he brings
 his footmen strong his horsemen served for wings

 ix
 to the left wing spread underneath the bent
 of the steep hill that saved their flank and side
 the roberts twain two leaders good he sent
 his brother had the middle ward to guide
 to the right wing himself in person went
 down where the plain was dangerous broad and wide
 and where his foes with their great numbers would
 perchance environ round his squadrons bold
 x
 there all his lorrainers and men of might
 all his best armed he placed and chosen bands
 and with those horse some footmen armed light
 that archers were used to that service stands
 the adventurers then in battle and in fight
 well tried a squadron famous through all lands
 on the right hand he set somedeal aside
 rinaldo was their leader lord and guide

 xi
 to whom the duke "in thee our hope is laid
 of victory thou must the conquest gain
 behind this mighty wing so far displayed
 thou with thy noble squadron close remain
 and when the pagans would our backs invade
 assail them then and make their onset vain
 for if i guess aright they have in mind
 to compass us and charge our troops behind"

 xii
 then through his host that took so large a scope
 he rode and viewed them all both horse and foot
 his face was bare his helm unclosed and ope
 lightened his eyes his looks bright fire shot out
 he cheers the fearful comforts them that hope
 and to the bold recounts his boasting stout
 and to the valiant his adventures hard
 these bids he look for praise those for reward

 xiii
 at last he stayed where of his squadrons bold
 and noblest troops assembled was best part
 there from a rising bank his will he told
 and all that heard his speech thereat took heart
 and as the mountain snow from mountains cold
 runs down in streams with eloquence and art
 so from his lips his words and speeches fell
 shrill speedy pleasant sweet and placed well

 xiv
 "my hardy host you conquerors of the east
 you scourge wherewith christ whips his heathen fone
 of victory behold the latest feast
 see the last day for which you wished alone
 not without cause the saracens most and least
 our gracious lord hath gathered here in one
 for all your foes and his assembled are
 that one day's fight may end seven years of war

 xv
 "this fight shall bring us many victories
 the danger none the labor will be small
 let not the number of your enemies
 dismay your hearts grant fear no place at all
 for strife and discord through their army flies
 their bands ill ranked themselves entangle shall
 and few of them to strike or fight shall come
 for some want strength some heart some elbowroom

 xvi
 "this host with whom you must encounter now
 are men half naked without strength or skill
 from idleness or following the plough
 late pressed forth to war against their will
 their swords are blunt shields thin soon pierced through
 their banners shake their bearers shrink for ill
 their leaders heard obeyed or followed be
 their loss their flight their death i will foresee

 xvii
 "their captain clad in purple armed in gold
 that seems so fierce so hardy stout and strong
 the moors or weak arabians vanquish could
 yet can he not resist your valors long
 what can he do though wise though sage though bold
 in that confusion trouble thrust and throng
 ill known he is and worse he knows his host
 strange lords ill feared are ill obeyed of most

 xviii
 "but i am captain of this chosen crew
 with whom i oft have conquered triumphed oft
 your lands and lineages long since i knew
 each knight obeys my rule mild easy soft
 i know each sword each dart each shaft i view
 although the quarrel fly in skies aloft
 whether the same of ireland be or france
 and from what bow it comes what hand perchance

 xix
 "i ask an easy and a usual thing
 as you have oft this day so win the field
 let zeal and honor be your virtue's sting
 your lives my fame christ's faith defend and shield
 to earth these pagans slain and wounded bring
 tread on their necks make them all die or yield
 what need i more exhort you from your eyes
 i see how victory how conquest flies"

 xx
 upon the captain when his speech was done
 it seemed a lamp and golden light down came
 as from night's azure mantle oft doth run
 or fall a sliding star or shining flame
 but from the bosom of the burning sun
 proceeded this and garlandwise the same
 godfredo's noble head encompassed round
 and as some thought foreshowed he should be crowned

 xxi
 perchance if man's proud thought or saucy tongue
 have leave to judge or guess at heavenly things
 this was the angel which had kept him long
 that now came down and hid him with his wings
 while thus the duke bespeaks his armies strong
 and every troop and band in order brings
 lord emiren his host disposed well
 and with bold words whet on their courage fell

 xxii
 the man brought forth his army great with speed
 in order good his foes at hand he spied
 like the new moon his host two horns did spreed
 in midst the foot the horse were on each side
 the right wing kept he for himself to lead
 great altamore received the left to guide
 the middle ward led muleasses proud
 and in that battle fair armida stood

 xxiii
 on the right quarter stood the indian grim
 with tisipherne and all the king's own band
 but when the left wing spread her squadrons trim
 o'er the large plain did altamoro stand
 with african and persian kings with him
 and two that came from meroe's hot sand
 and all his crossbows and his slings he placed
 where room best served to shoot to throw to cast

 xxiv
 thus emiren his host put in array
 and rode from band to band from rank to rank
 his truchmen now and now himself doth say
 what spoil his folk shall gain what praise what thank
 to him that feared "look up ours is the day"
 he says "vile fear to bold hearts never sank
 how dareth one against an hundred fight
 our cry our shade will put them all to flight"

 xxv
 but to the bold "go hardy knight" he says
 "his prey out of this lion's paws go tear"
 to some before his thoughts the shape he lays
 and makes therein the image true appear
 how his sad country him entreats and prays
 his house his loving wife and children dear
 "suppose" quoth he "thy country doth beseech
 and pray thee thus suppose this is her speech

 xxvi
 "defend my laws uphold my temples brave
 my blood from washing of my streets withhold
 from ravishing my virgins keep and save
 thine ancestors' dead bones and ashes cold
 to thee thy fathers dear and parents grave
 show their uncovered heads white hoary old
 to thee thy wifeher breasts with tears o'erspread
 thy sons their cradles shows thy marriage bed"

 xxvii
 to all the rest "you for her honor's sake
 whom asia makes her champions by your might
 upon these thieves weak feeble few must take
 a sharp revenge yet just deserved and right"
 thus many words in several tongues he spake
 and all his sundry nations to sharp fight
 encouraged but now the dukes had done
 their speeches all the hosts together run

 xxviii
 it was a great a strange and wondrous sight
 when front to front those noble armies met
 how every troop how in each troop each knight
 stood prest to move to fight and praise to get
 loose in the wind waved their ensigns light
 trembled the plumes that on their crests were set
 their arms impresses colors gold and stone
 against the sunbeams smiled flamed sparkled shone

 xxix
 of dry topped oaks they seemed two forests thick
 so did each host with spears and pikes abound
 bent were their bows in rests their lances stick
 their hands shook swords their slings held cobbles round
 each steed to run was ready prest and quick
 at his commander's spur his hand his sound
 he chafes he stamps careers and turns about
 he foams snorts neighs and fire and smoke breathes out

 xxx
 horror itself in that fair fight seemed fair
 and pleasure flew amid sad dread and fear
 the trumpets shrill that thundered in the air
 were music mild and sweet to every ear
 the faithful camp though less yet seemed more rare
 in that strange noise more warlike shrill and clear
 in notes more sweet the pagan trumpets jar
 these sung their armors shined these glistered far

 xxxi
 the christian trumpets give the deadly call
 the pagans answer and the fight accept
 the godly frenchmen on their knees down fall
 to pray and kissed the earth and then up leapt
 to fight the land between was vanished all
 in combat close each host to other stepped
 for now the wings had skirmish hot begun
 and with their battles forth the footmen run

 xxxii
 but who was first of all the christian train
 that gave the onset first first won renown
 gildippes thou wert she for by thee slain
 the king of orms hircano tumbled down
 the man's breastbone thou clov'st and rent in twain
 so heaven with honor would thee bless and crown
 pierced through he fell and falling hard withal
 his foe praised for her strength and for his fall

 xxxiii
 her lance thus broke the hardy dame forth drew
 with her strong hand a fine and trenchant blade
 and gainst the persians fierce and bold she flew
 and in their troop wide streets and lanes she made
 even in the girdlingstead divided new
 in pieces twain zopire on earth she laid
 and then alarco's head she swept off clean
 which like a football tumbled on the green

 xxxiv
 a blow felled artaxerxes with a thrust
 was argeus slain the first lay in a trance
 ismael's left hand cut off fell in the dust
 for on his wrist her sword fell down by chance
 the hand let go the bridle where it lust
 the blow upon the courser's ears did glance
 who felt the reins at large and with the stroke
 half mad the ranks disordered troubled broke

 xxxv
 all these and many mo by time forgot
 she slew and wounded when against her came
 the angry persians all cast on a knot
 for on her person would they purchase fame
 but her dear spouse and husband wanted not
 in so great need to aid the noble dame
 thus joined the haps of war unhurt they prove
 their strength was double double was their love

 xxxvi
 the noble lovers use well might you see
 a wondrous guise till then unseen unheard
 to save themselves forgot both he and she
 each other's life did keep defend and guard
 the strokes that gainst her lord discharged be
 the dame had care to bear to break to ward
 his shield kept off the blows bent on his dear
 which if need be his naked head should bear

 xxxvii
 so each saved other each for other's wrong
 would vengeance take but not revenge their own
 the valiant soldan artabano strong
 of boecan isle by her was overthrown
 and by his hand the bodies dead among
 alvante that durst his mistress wound fell down
 and she between the eyes hit arimont
 who hurt her lord and cleft in twain his front

 xxxviii
 but altamore who had that wing to lead
 far greater slaughter on the christians made
 for where he turned his sword or twined his steed
 he slew or man and beast on earth down laid
 happy was he that was at first struck dead
 that fell not down on live for whom his blade
 had speared the same cast in the dusty street
 his horse tore with his teeth bruised with his feet

 xxxix
 by this brave persian's valor killed and slain
 were strong brunello and ardonia great
 the first his head and helm had cleft in twain
 the last in strangerwise he did intreat
 for through his heart he pierced and his seat
 where laughter hath his fountain and his seat
 so that a dreadful thing believed uneath
 he laughed for pain and laughed himself to death

 xl
 nor these alone with that accursed knife
 of this sweet light and breath deprived lie
 but with that cruel weapon lost their life
 gentonio guascar rosimond and guy
 who knows how many in that fatal strife
 he slew what knights his courser fierce made die
 the names and countries of the people slain
 who tells their wounds and deaths who can explain

 xli
 with this fierce king encounter durst not one
 not one durst combat him in equal field
 gildippes undertook that task alone
 no doubt could make her shrink no danger yield
 by thermodont was never amazone
 who managed steeled axe or carried shield
 that seemed so bold as she so strong so light
 when forth she run to meet that dreadful knight

 xlii
 she hit him where with gold and rich anmail
 his diadem did on his helmet flame
 she broke and cleft the crown and caused him veil
 his proud and lofty top his crest down came
 strong seemed her arm that could so well assail
 the pagan shook for spite and blushed for shame
 forward he rushed and would at once requite
 shame with disgrace and with revenge despite

 xliii
 right on the front he gave that lady kind
 a blow so huge so strong so great so sore
 that out of sense and feeling down she twined
 but her dear knight his love from ground upbore
 were it their fortune or his noble mind
 he stayed his hand and strook the dame no more
 a lion so stalks by and with proud eyes
 beholds but scorns to hurt a man that lies

 xliv
 this while ormondo false whose cruel hand
 was armed and prest to give the trait'rous blow
 with all his fellows mongst godfredo's band
 entered unseen disguised that few them know
 the thievish wolves when night o'ershades the land
 that seem like faithful dogs in shape and show
 so to the closed folds in secret creep
 and entrance seek to kill some harmless sheep

 xlv
 he proached nigh and to godfredo's side
 the bloody pagan now was placed near
 but when his colors gold and white he spied
 and saw the other signs that forged were
 "see see this traitor false" the captain cried
 "that like a frenchman would in show appear
 behold how near his mates and he are crept"
 this said upon the villain forth he leapt

 lxvi
 deadly he wounded him and that false knight
 nor strikes nor wards nor striveth to be gone
 but as medusa's head were in his sight
 stood like a man new turned to marble stone
 all lances broke unsheathed all weapons bright
 all quivers emptied were on them alone
 in parts so many were the traitors cleft
 that those dead men had no dead bodies left

 lxvii
 when godfrey was with pagan blood bespread
 he entered then the fight and that was past
 where the bold persian fought and combated
 where the close ranks he opened cleft and brast
 before the knight the troops and squadrons fled
 as afric dust before the southern blast
 the duke recalled them in array them placed
 stayed those that fled and him assailed that chased

 lxviii
 the champions strong there fought a battle stout
 troy never saw the like by xanthus old
 a conflict sharp there was meanwhile on foot
 twixt baldwin good and muleasses bold
 the horsemen also near the mountains rout
 and in both wings a furious skirmish hold
 and where the barbarous duke in person stood
 twixt tisiphernes and adrastus proud

 xlix
 with emiren robert the norman strove
 long time they fought yet neither lost nor won
 the other robert's helm the indian clove
 and broke his arms their fight would soon be done
 from place to place did tisiphernes rove
 and found no match against him none dust run
 but where the press was thickest thither flew
 the knight and at each stroke felled hurt or slew
 l
 thus fought they long yet neither shrink nor yield
 in equal balance hung their hope and fear
 all full of broken lances lay the field
 all full of arms that cloven and shattered were
 of swords some to the body nail the shield
 some cut men's throats and some their bellies tear
 of bodies some upright some grovelling lay
 and for themselves eat graves out of the clay

 li
 beside his lord slain lay the noble steed
 there friend with friend lay killed like lovers true
 there foe with foe the live under the dead
 the victor under him whom late he slew
 a hoarse unperfect sound did eachwhere spread
 whence neither silence nor plain outcries flew
 there fury roars ire threats and woe complains
 one weeps another cries he sighs for pains

 lii
 the arms that late so fair and glorious seem
 now soiled and slubbered sad and sullen grow
 the steel his brightness lost the gold his beam
 the colors had no pride nor beauty's show
 the plumes and feathers on their crests that stream
 are strowed wide upon the earth below
 the hosts both clad in blood in dust and mire
 had changed their cheer their pride their rich attire

 liii
 but now the moors arabians ethiops black
 of the left wing that held the utmost marge
 spread forth their troops and purposed at the back
 and side their heedless foes to assail and charge
 slingers and archers were not slow nor slack
 to shoot and cast when with his battle large
 rinaldo came whose fury haste and ire
 seemed earthquake thunder tempest storm and fire

 liv
 the first he met was asimire his throne
 that set in meroe's hot sunburnt land
 he cut his neck in twain flesh skin and bone
 the sable head down tumbled on the sand
 but when by death of this black prince alone
 the taste of blood and conquest once he fand
 whole squadrons then whole troops to earth he brought
 things wondrous strange incredible he wrought

 lv
 he gave more deaths than strokes and yet his blows
 upon his feeble foes fell oft and thick
 to move three tongues as a fierce serpent shows
 which rolls the one she hath swift speedy quick
 so thinks each pagan each arabian trows
 he wields three swords all in one hilt that stick
 his readiness their eyes so blinded hath
 their dread that wonder bred fear gave it faith

 lvi
 the afric tyrants and the negro kings
 fell down on heaps drowned each in other's blood
 upon their people ran the knights he brings
 pricked forward by their guide's example good
 killed were the pagans broke their bows and slings
 some died some fell some yielded none withstood
 a massacre was this no fight these put
 their foes to death those hold their throats to cut

 lvii
 small while they stood with heart and hardy face
 on their bold breasts deep wounds and hurts to bear
 but fled away and troubled in the chase
 their ranks disordered be with too much fear
 rinaldo followed them from place to place
 till quite discomfit and dispersed they were
 that done he stays and all his knights recalls
 and scorns to strike his foe that flies or falls

 lviii
 like as the wind stopped by some wood or hill
 grows strong and fierce tears boughs and trees in twain
 but with mild blasts more temperate gentle still
 blows through the ample field or spacious plain
 against the rocks as seawaves murmur shrill
 but silent pass amid the open main
 rinaldo so when none his force withstood
 assuaged his fury calmed his angry mood

 lix
 he scorned upon their fearful backs that fled
 to wreak his ire and spend his force in vain
 but gainst the footmen strong his troops he led
 whose side the moors had open left and plain
 the africans that should have succored
 that battle all were run away or slain
 upon their flank with force and courage stout
 his men at arms assailed the bands on foot

 lx
 he brake their pikes and brake their close array
 entered their battle felled them down around
 so wind or tempest with impetuous sway
 the ears of ripened corn strikes flat to ground
 with blood arms bodies dead the hardened clay
 plastered the earth no grass nor green was found
 the horsemen running through and through their bands
 kill murder slay few scape not one withstands

 lxi
 rinaldo came where his forlorn armide
 sate on her golden chariot mounted high
 a noble guard she had on every side
 of lords of lovers and much chivalry
 she knew the man when first his arms she spied
 love hate wrath sweet desire strove in her eye
 he changed somedeal his look and countenance bold
 she changed from frost to fire from heat to cold

 lxii
 the prince passed by the chariot of his dear
 like one that did his thoughts elsewhere bestow
 yet suffered not her knights and lovers near
 their rival so to scape withouten blow
 one drew his sword another couched his spear
 herself an arrow sharp set in her bow
 disdain her ire new sharped and kindled hath
 but love appeased her love assuaged her wrath

 lxiii
 love bridled fury and revived of new
 his fire not dead though buried in displeasure
 three times her angry hand the bow updrew
 and thrice again let slack the string at leisure
 but wrath prevailed at last the reed outflew
 for love finds mean but hatred knows no measure
 outflew the shaft but with the shaft this charm
 this wish she sent heaven grant it do no harm

 lxiv
 she bids the reed return the way it went
 and pierce her heart which so unkind could prove
 such force had love though lost and vainly spent
 what strength hath happy kind and mutual love
 but she that gentle thought did straight repent
 wrath fury kindness in her bosom strove
 she would she would not that it missed or hit
 her eyes her heart her wishes followed it

 lxv
 but yet in vain the quarrel lighted not
 for on his hauberk hard the knight it hit
 too hard for woman's shaft or woman's shot
 instead of piercing there it broke and split
 he turned away she burnt with fury hot
 and thought he scorned her power and in that fit
 shot oft and oft her shafts no entrance found
 and while she shot love gave her wound on wound

 lxvi
 "and is he then unpierceable" quoth she
 "that neither force nor foe he needs regard
 his limbs perchance armed with that hardness be
 which makes his heart so cruel and so hard
 no shot that flies from eye or hand i see
 hurts him such rigor doth his person guard
 armed or disarmed his foe or mistress kind
 despised alike like hate like scorn i find

 lxvii
 "but what new form is left device or art
 by which to which exchanged i might find grace
 for in my knights and all that take my part
 i see no help no hope no trust i place
 to his great prowess might and valiant heart
 all strength is weak all courage vile and base"
 this said she for she saw how through the field
 her champions fly faint tremble fall and yield

 lxviii
 nor left alone can she her person save
 but to be slain or taken stands in fear
 though with a bow a javelin long she have
 yet weak was phebe's bow blunt pallas' spear
 but as the swan that sees the eagle brave
 threatening her flesh and silver plumes to tear
 falls down to hide her mongst the shady brooks
 such were her fearful motions such her looks

 lxix
 but altamore this while that strove and sought
 from shameful flight his persian host to stay
 that was discomfit and destroyed to nought
 whilst he alone maintained the fight and fray
 seeing distressed the goddess of his thought
 to aid her ran nay flew and laid away
 all care both of his honor and his host
 if she were safe let all the world be lost

 lxx
 to the illguarded chariot swift he flew
 his weapon made him way with bloody war
 meanwhile lord godfrey and rinaldo slew
 his feeble bands his people murdered are
 he saw their loss but aided not his crew
 a better lover than a leader far
 he set armida safe then turned again
 with tardy succor for his folk were slain

 lxxi
 and on that side the woful prince beheld
 the battle lost no help nor hope remained
 but on the other wing the christians yield
 and fly such vantage there the egyptians gained
 one of the roberts was nigh slain in field
 the other by the indian strong constrained
 to yield himself his captive and his slave
 thus equal loss and equal foil they have

 lxxii
 godfredo took the time and season fit
 to bring again his squadrons in array
 and either camp well ordered ranged and knit
 renewed the furious battle fight and fray
 new streams of blood were shed new swords them hit
 new combats fought new spoils were borne away
 and unresolved and doubtful on each side
 did praise and conquest mars and fortune ride

 lxxiii
 between the armies twain while thus the fight
 waxed sharp hot cruel though renewed but late
 the soldan clomb up to the tower's height
 and saw far off their strife and fell debate
 as from some stage or theatre the knight
 saw played the tragedy of human state
 saw death blood murder woe and horror strange
 and the great acts of fortune chance and change

 lxxiv
 at first astonished and amazed he stood
 then burnt with wrath and selfconsuming ire
 swelled his bosom like a raging flood
 to be amid that battle such desire
 such haste he had he donned his helmet good
 his other arms he had before entire
 "up up" he cried "no more no more within
 this fortress stay come follow die or win"

 lxxv
 whether the same were providence divine
 that made him leave the fortress he possessed
 for that the empire proud of palestine
 this day should fall to rise again more blessed
 or that he breaking felt the fatal line
 of life and would meet death with constant breast
 furious and fierce he did the gates unbar
 and sudden rage brought forth and sudden war

 lxxvi
 nor stayed he till the folk on whom he cried
 assemble might but out alone he flies
 a thousand foes the man alone defied
 and ran among a thousand enemies
 but with his fury called from every side
 the rest run out and aladine forth hies
 the cowards had no fear the wise no care
 this was not hope nor courage but despair

 lxxvii
 the dreadful turk with sudden blows down cast
 the first he met nor gave them time to plain
 or pray in murdering them he made such haste
 that dead they fell ere one could see them slain
 from mouth to mouth from eye to eye forth passed
 the fear and terror that the faithful train
 of syrian folk not used to dangerous fight
 were broken scattered and nigh put to flight

 lxxviii
 but with less terror and disorder less
 the gascoigns kept array and kept their ground
 though most the loss and peril them oppress
 unwares assailed they were unready found
 no ravening tooth or talon hard i guess
 of beast or eager hawk doth slay and wound
 so many sheep or fowls weak feeble small
 as his sharp sword killed knights and soldiers tall

 lxxix
 it seemed his thirst and hunger 'suage he would
 with their slain bodies and their blood poured out
 with him his troops and aladino old
 slew their besiegers killed the gascoign rout
 but raymond ran to meet the soldan bold
 nor to encounter him had fear or doubt
 though his right hand by proof too well he know
 which laid him late for dead at one huge blow

 lxxx
 they met and raymond fell amid the field
 this blow again upon his forehead light
 it was the fault and weakness of his eild
 age is not fit to bear strokes of such might
 each one lift up his sword advanced his shield
 those would destroy and these defend the knight
 on went the soldan for the man he thought
 was slain or easily might be captive brought

 lxxxi
 among the rest he ran he raged he smote
 and in small space small time great wonders wrought
 and as his rage him led and fury hot
 to kill and murder matter new he sought
 as from his supper poor with hungry throat
 a peasant hastes to a rich feast ybrought
 so from this skirmish to the battle great
 he ran and quenched with blood his fury's heat

 lxxxii
 where battered was the wall he sallied out
 and to the field in haste and heat he goes
 with him went rage and fury fear and doubt
 remained behind among his scattered foes
 to win the conquest strove his squadron stout
 which he unperfect left yet loth to lose
 the day the christians fight resist and die
 and ready were to yield retire and fly

 lxxxiii
 the gascoign bands retired but kept array
 the syrian people ran away outright
 the fight was near the place where tancred lay
 his house was full of noise and great affright
 he rose and looked forth to see the fray
 though every limb were weak faint void of might
 he saw the country lie his men o'erthrown
 some beaten back some killed some felled down

 lxxxiv
 courage in noble hearts that ne'er is spent
 yet fainted not though faint were every limb
 but reinforced each member cleft and rent
 and want of blood and strength supplied in him
 in his left hand his heavy shield he hent
 nor seemed the weight too great his curtlax trim
 his right hand drew nor for more arms he stood
 or stayed he needs no more whose heart is good

 lxxxv
 but coming forth cried "whither will you run
 and leave your leader to his foes in prey
 what shall these heathen of his armor won
 in their vile temples hang up trophies gay
 go home to gascoign then and tell his son
 that where his father died you ran away"
 this said against a thousand armed foes
 he did his breast weak naked sick oppose

 lxxxvi
 and with his heavy strong and mighty targe
 that with seven hard bulls' hides was surely lined
 and strengthened with a cover thick and large
 of stiff and wellattempered steel behind
 he shielded raymond from the furious charge
 from swords from darts from weapons of each kind
 and all his foes drove back with his sharp blade
 that sure and safe he lay as in a shade

 lxxxvii
 thus saved thus shielded raymond 'gan respire
 he rose and reared himself in little space
 and in his bosom burned the double fire
 of vengeance wrath his heart shame filled his face
 he looked around to spy such was his ire
 the man whose stroke had laid him in that place
 whom when he sees not for disdain he quakes
 and on his people sharp revengement takes

 lxxxviii
 the gascoigns turn again their lord in haste
 to venge their loss his hand recorded brings
 the troop that durst so much now stood aghast
 for where sad fear grew late now boldness springs
 now followed they that fled fled they that chased
 so in one hour altereth the state of things
 raymond requites his loss shame hurt and all
 and with an hundred deaths revenged one fall

 lxxxix
 whilst raymond wreaked thus his just disdain
 on the proudheads of captains lords and peers
 he spies great sion's king amid the train
 and to him leaps and high his sword he rears
 and on his forehead strikes and strikes again
 till helm and head he breaks he cleaves he tears
 down fell the king the guiltless land he bit
 that now keeps him because he kept not it

 xc
 their guides one murdered thus the other gone
 the troops divided were in diverse thought
 despair made some run headlong gainst their fone
 to seek sharp death that comes uncalled unsought
 and some that laid their hope on flight alone
 fled to their fort again yet chance so wrought
 that with the flyers in the victors pass
 and so the fortress won and conquered was

 xci
 the hold was won slain were the men that fled
 in courts halls chambers high above below
 old raymond fast up to the leads him sped
 and there of victory true sign and show
 his glorious standard to the wind he spread
 that so both armies his success might know
 but solyman saw not the town was lost
 for far from thence he was and near the host

 xcii
 into the field he came the lukewarm blood
 did smoke and flow through all the purple field
 there of sad death the court and palace stood
 there did he triumphs lead and trophies build
 an armed steed fast by the soldan yood
 that had no guide nor lord the reins to wield
 the tyrant took the bridle and bestrode
 the courser's empty back and forth he rode

 xciii
 great yet but short and sudden was the aid
 that to the pagans faint and weak he brought
 a thunderbolt he was you would have said
 great yet that comes and goes as swift as thought
 and of his coming swift and flight unstayed
 eternal signs in hardest rocks hath wrought
 for by his hand a hundred knights were slain
 but time forgot hath all their names but twain

 xciv
 gildippes fair and edward thy dear lord
 your noble death sad end and woful fate
 if so much power our vulgar tongue afford
 to all strange wits strange ears let me dilate
 that ages all your love and sweet accord
 your virtue prowess worth may imitate
 and some kind servant of true love that hears
 may grace your death my verses with some tears

 xcv
 the noble lady thither boldly flew
 where first the soldan fought and him defied
 two mighty blows she gave the turk untrue
 one cleft his shield the other pierced his side
 the prince the damsel by her habit knew
 "see see this mankind strumpet see" he cried
 "this shameless whore for thee fit weapons were
 thy neeld and spindle not a sword and spear"

 xcvi
 this said full of disdain rage and despite
 a strong a fierce a deadly stroke he gave
 and pierced her armor pierced her bosom white
 worthy no blows but blows of love to have
 her dying hand let go the bridle quite
 she faints she falls 'twixt life and death she strave
 her lord to help her came but came too late
 yet was not that his fault it was his fate

 xcvii
 what should he do to diverse parts him call
 just ire and pity kind one bids him go
 and succor his dear lady like to fall
 the other calls for vengeance on his foe
 love biddeth both love says he must do all
 and with his ire joins grief with pity woe
 what did he then with his left hand the knight
 would hold her up revenge her with his right

 xcviii
 but to resist against a knight so bold
 too weak his will and power divided were
 so that he could not his fair love uphold
 nor kill the cruel man that slew his dear
 his arm that did his mistress kind enfold
 the turk cut off pale grew his looks and cheer
 he let her fall himself fell by her side
 and for he could not save her with her died

 xcix
 as the high elm whom his dear vine hath twined
 fast in her hundred arms and holds embraced
 bears down to earth his spouse and darling kind
 if storm or cruel steel the tree down cast
 and her full grapes to naught doth bruise and grind
 spoils his own leaves faints withers dies at last
 and seems to mourn and die not for his own
 but for her death with him that lies o'erthrown

 c
 so fell he mourning mourning for the dame
 whom life and death had made forever his
 they would have spoke but not one word could frame
 deep sobs their speech sweet sighs their language is
 each gazed on other's eyes and while the same
 is lawful join their hands embrace and kiss
 and thus sharp death their knot of life untied
 together fainted they together died

 ci
 but now swift fame her nimble wings dispread
 and told eachwhere their chance their fate their fall
 rinaldo heard the case by one that fled
 from the fierce turk and brought him news of all
 disdain goodwill woe wrath the champion led
 to take revenge shame grief for vengeance call
 but as he went adrastus with his blade
 forestalled the way and show of combat made

 cii
 the giant cried "by sundry signs i note
 that whom i wish i search thou thou art he
 i marked each worthy's shield his helm his coat
 and all this day have called and cried for thee
 to my sweet saint i have thy head devote
 thou must my sacrifice my offering be
 come let us here our strength and courage try
 thou art armida's foe her champion i"

 ciii
 thus he defied him on his front before
 and on his throat he struck him yet the blow
 his helmet neither bruised cleft nor tore
 but in his saddle made him bend and bow
 rinaldo hit him on the flank so sore
 that neither art nor herb could help him now
 down fell the giant strong one blow such power
 such puissance had so falls a thundered tower

 civ
 with horror fear amazedness and dread
 cold were the hearts of all that saw the fray
 and solyman that viewed that noble deed
 trembled his paleness did his fear bewray
 for in that stroke he did his end areed
 he wist not what to think to do to say
 a thing in him unused rare and strange
 but so doth heaven men's hearts turn alter change

 cv
 as when the sick or frantic men oft dream
 in their unquiet sleep and slumber short
 and think they run some speedy course and seem
 to move their legs and feet in hasty sort
 yet feel their limbs far slower than the stream
 of their vain thoughts that bears them in this sport
 and oft would speak would cry would call or shout
 yet neither sound nor voice nor word send out

 cvi
 so run to fight the angry soldan would
 and did enforce his strength his might his ire
 yet felt not in himself his courage old
 his wonted force his rage and hot desire
 his eyes that sparkled wrath and fury bold
 grew dim and feeble fear had quenched that fire
 and in his heart an hundred passions fought
 yet none on fear or base retire he thought

 cvii
 while unresolved he stood the victor knight
 arrived and seemed in quickness haste and speed
 in boldness greatness goodliness and might
 above all princes born of human seed
 the turk small while resists not death nor fight
 made him forget his state or race through dreed
 he fled no strokes he fetched no groan nor sigh
 bold were his motions last proud stately high

 cviii
 now when the soldan in these battles past
 that antheuslike oft fell oft rose again
 evermore fierce more fell fell down at last
 to lie forever when this prince was slain
 fortune that seld is stable firm or fast
 no longer durst resist the christian train
 but ranged herself in row with godfrey's knights
 with them she serves she runs she rides she fights

 cix
 the pagan troops the king's own squadron fled
 of all the east the strength the pride the flower
 late called immortal now discomfited
 it lost that title proud and lost all power
 to him that with the royal standard fled
 thus emireno said with speeches sour
 "art not thou he to whom to bear i gave
 my king's great banner and his standard brave

 cx
 "this ensign rimedon i gave not thee
 to be the witness of thy fear and flight
 coward dost thou thy lord and captain see
 in battle strong and runn'st thyself from fight
 what seek'st thou safety come return with me
 the way to death is path to virtue right
 here let him fight that would escape for this
 the way to honor way to safety is"

 cxi
 the man returned and swelled with scorn and shame
 the duke with speeches grave exhorts the rest
 he threats he strikes sometime till back they came
 and rage gainst force despair gainst death addressed
 thus of his broken armies gan he frame
 a battle now some hope dwelt in his breast
 but tisiphernes bold revived him most
 who fought and seemed to win when all was lost

 cxii
 wonders that day wrought noble tisipherne
 the hardy normans all he overthrew
 the flemings fled before the champion stern
 gernier rogero gerard bold he slew
 his glorious deeds to praise and fame etern
 his life's short date prolonged enlarged and drew
 and then as he that set sweet life at nought
 the greatest peril danger most he sought

 cxiii
 he spied rinaldo and although his field
 of azure purple now and sanguine shows
 and though the silver bird amid his shield
 were armed gules yet he the champion knows
 and says "here greatest peril is heavens yield
 strength to my courage fortune to my blows
 that fair armida her revenge may see
 help macon for his arms i vow to thee"

 cxiv
 thus prayed he but all his vows were vain
 mahound was deaf or slept in heavens above
 and as a lion strikes him with his train
 his native wrath to quicken and to move
 so he awaked his fury and disdain
 and sharped his courage on the whetstone love
 himself he saved behind his mighty targe
 and forward spurred his steed and gave the charge

 cxv
 the christian saw the hardy warrior come
 and leaped forth to undertake the fight
 the people round about gave place and room
 and wondered on that fierce and cruel sight
 some praised their strength their skill and courage some
 such and so desperate blows struck either knight
 that all that saw forgot both ire and strife
 their wounds their hurts forgot both death and life

 cxvi
 one struck the other did both strike and wound
 his arms were surer and his strength was more
 from tisipheme the blood streamed down around
 his shield was deft his helm was rent and tore
 the dame that saw his blood besmear the ground
 his armor broke limbs weak wounds deep and sore
 and all her guard dead fled and overthrown
 thought now her field lay waste her hedge lay down

 cxvii
 environed with so brave a troop but late
 now stood she in her chariot all alone
 she feared bondage and her life did hate
 all hope of conquest and revenge was gone
 half mad and half amazed from where she sate
 she leaped down and fled from friends' and fone
 on a swift horse she mounts and forth she rides
 alone save for disdain and love her guides

 cxviii
 in days of old queen cleopatra so
 alone fled from the fight and cruel fray
 against augustus great his happy foe
 leaving her lord to loss and sure decay
 and as that lord for love let honor go
 followed her flying sails and lost the day
 so tisipherne the fair and fearful dame
 would follow but his foe forbids the same

 cxix
 but when the pagan's joy and comfort fled
 it seemed the sun was set the day was night
 gainst the brave prince with whom he combated
 he turned and on the forehead struck the knight
 when thunders forged are in typhoius' bed
 not brontes' hammer falls so swift so right
 the furious stroke fell on rinaldo's crest
 and made him bend his head down to his breast

 cxx
 the champion in his stirrups high upstart
 and cleft his hauberk hard and tender side
 and sheathed his weapon in the pagan's heart
 the castle where man's life and soul do bide
 the cruel sword his breast and hinder part
 with double wound unclosed and opened wide
 and two large doors made for his life and breath
 which passed and cured hot love with frozen death

 cxxi
 this done rinaldo stayed and looked around
 where he should harm his foes or help his friends
 nor of the pagans saw he squadron sound
 each standard falls ensign to earth descends
 his fury quiet then and calm he found
 there all his wrath his rage and rancor ends
 he called to mind how far from help or aid
 armida fled alone amazed afraid

 cxxii
 well saw he when she fled and with that sight
 the prince had pity courtesy and care
 he promised her to be her friend and knight
 when erst he left her in the island bare
 the way she fled he ran and rode aright
 her palfrey's feet signs in the grass outware
 but she this while found out an ugly shade
 fit place for death where naught could life persuade

 cxxiii
 well pleased was she with those shadows brown
 and yet displeased with luck with life with love
 there from her steed she lighted there laid down
 her bow and shafts her arms that helpless prove
 "there lie with shame" she says "disgraced o'erthrown
 blunt are the weapons blunt the arms i move
 weak to revenge my harms or harm my foe
 my shafts are blunt ah love would thine were so

 cxxiv
 alas among so many could not one
 not one draw blood one wound or rend his skin
 all other breasts to you are marble stone
 dare you then pierce a woman's bosom thin
 see see my naked heart on this alone
 employ your force this fort is eath to win
 and love will shoot you from his mighty bow
 weak is the shot that dripile falls in snow

 cxxv
 "i pardon will your fear and weakness past
 be strong mine arrows cruel sharp gainst me
 ah wretch how is thy chance and fortune cast
 if placed in these thy good and comfort be
 but since all hope is vain all help is waste
 since hurts ease hurts wounds must cure wounds in thee
 then with thine arrow's stroke cure stroke of love
 death for thy heart must salve and surgeon prove

 cxxvi
 "and happy me if being dead and slain
 i bear not with me this strange plague to hell
 love stay behind come thou with me disdain
 and with my wronged soul forever dwell
 or else with it turn to the world again
 and vex that knight with dreams and visions fell
 and tell him when twixt life and death i strove
 my last wish was revengelast word was love"

 cxxvii
 and with that word half mad half dead she seems
 an arrow poignant strong and sharp she took
 when her dear knight found her in these extremes
 now fit to die and pass the stygian brook
 now prest to quench her own and beauty's beams
 now death sat on her eyes death in her look
 when to her back he stepped and stayed her arm
 stretched forth to do that service last last harm

 cxxviii
 she turns and ere she knows her lord she spies
 whose coming was unwished unthought unknown
 she shrieks and twines away her sdainful eyes
 from his sweet face she falls dead in a swoon
 falls as a flower half cut that bending lies
 he held her up and lest she tumble down
 under her tender side his arm he placed
 his hand her girdle loosed her gown unlaced

 cxxix
 and her fair face fair bosom he bedews
 with tears tears of remorse of ruth of sorrow
 as the pale rose her color lost renews
 with the fresh drops fallen from the silver morrow
 so she revives and cheeks empurpled shows
 moist with their own tears and with tears they borrow
 thrice looked she up her eyes thrice closed she
 as who say "let me die ere look on thee"

 cxxx
 and his strong arm with weak and feeble hand
 she would have thrust away loosed and untwined
 oft strove she but in vain to break that band
 for he the hold he got not yet resigned
 herself fast bound in those dear knots she fand
 dear though she feigned scorn strove and repined
 at last she speaks she weeps complains and cries
 yet durst not did not would not see his eyes

 cxxxi
 "cruel at thy departure at return
 as cruel say what chance thee hither guideth
 would'st thou prevent her death whose heart forlorn
 for thee for thee death's strokes each hour divideth
 com'st thou to save my life alas what scorn
 what torment for armida poor abideth
 no no thy crafts and sleights i well descry
 but she can little do that cannot die

 cxxxii
 "thy triumph is not great nor well arrayed
 unless in chains thou lead a captive dame
 a dame now ta'en by force before betrayed
 this is thy greatest glory greatest fame
 time was that thee of love and life i prayed
 let death now end my love my life my shame
 yet let not thy false hand bereave this breath
 for if it were thy gift hateful were death

 cxxxiii
 "cruel myself an hundred ways can find
 to rid me from thy malice from thy hate
 if weapons sharp if poisons of all kind
 if fire if strangling fail in that estate
 yet ways enough i know to stop this wind
 a thousand entries hath the house of fate
 ah leave these flatteries leave weak hope to move
 cease cease my hope is dead dead is my love"

 cxxxiv
 thus mourned she and from her watery eyes
 disdain and love dropped down rolled up in tears
 from his pure fountains ran two streams likewise
 wherein chaste pity and mild ruth appears
 thus with sweet words the queen he pacifies
 "madam appease your grief your wrath your fears
 for to be crowned not scorned your life i save
 your foe nay but your friend your knight your slave

 cxxxv
 "but if you trust no speech no oath no word
 yet in mine eyes my zeal my truth behold
 for to that throne whereof thy sire was lord
 i will restore thee crown thee with that gold
 and if high heaven would so much grace afford
 as from thy heart this cloud this veil unfold
 of paganism in all the east no dame
 should equalize thy fortune state and fame"

 cxxxvi
 thus plaineth he thus prays and his desire
 endears with sighs that fly and tears that fall
 that as against the warmth of titan's fire
 snowdrifts consume on tops of mountains tall
 so melts her wrath but love remains entire
 "behold" she says "your handmaid and your thrall
 my life my crown my wealth use at your pleasure"
 thus death her life became loss proved her tensure

 cxxxvii
 this while the captain of the egyptian host
 that saw his royal standard laid on ground
 saw rimedon that ensign's prop and post
 by godfrey's noble hand killed with one wound
 and all his folk discomfit slain and lost
 no coward was in this last battle found
 but rode about and sought nor sought in vain
 some famous hand of which he might be slain

 cxxxviii
 against lord godfrey boldly out he flew
 for nobler foe he wished not could not spy
 of desperate courage showed he tokens true
 where'er he joined or stayed or passed by
 and cried to the duke as near he drew
 "behold of thy strong hand i come to die
 yet trust to overthrow thee with my fall
 my castle's ruins shall break down thy wall"

 cxxxix
 this said forth spurred they both both high advance
 their swords aloft both struck at once both hit
 his left arm wounded had the knight of france
 his shield was pierced his vantbrace cleft and split
 the pagan backward fell half in a trance
 on his left ear his foe so hugely smit
 and as he sought to rise godfredo's sword
 pierced him through so died that army's lord

 cxl
 of his great host when emiren was dead
 fled the small remnant that alive remained
 godfrey espied as he turned his steed
 great altamore on foot with blood all stained
 with half a sword half helm upon his head
 gainst whom a hundred fought yet not one gained
 "cease cease this strife" he cried "and thou brave knight
 yield i am godfrey yield thee to my might"

 cxli
 he that till then his proud and haughty heart
 to act of humbleness did never bend
 when that great name he heard from the north part
 of our wide world renowned to aethiop's end
 answered "i yield to thee thou worthy art
 i am thy prisoner fortune is thy friend
 on altamoro great thy conquest bold
 of glory shall be rich and rich of gold

 cxlii
 "my loving queen my wife and lady kind
 shall ransom me with jewels gold and treasure"
 "god shield" quoth godfrey "that my noble mind
 should praise and virtue so by profit measure
 all that thou hast from persia and from inde
 enjoy it still therein i take no pleasure
 i set no rent on life no price on blood
 i fight and sell not war for gold or good"

 cxliii
 this said he gave him to his knights to keep
 and after those that fled his course he bent
 they to their rampiers fled and trenches deep
 yet could not so death's cruel stroke prevent
 the camp was won and all in blood doth steep
 the blood in rivers streamed from tent to tent
 it soiled defiled defaced all the prey
 shields helmets armors plumes and feathers gay

 cxliv
 thus conquered godfrey and as yet the sun
 dived not in silver waves his golden wain
 but daylight served him to the fortress won
 with his victorious host to turn again
 his bloody coat he put not off but run
 to the high temple with his noble train
 and there hung up his arms and there he bows
 his knees there prayed and there performed his vows

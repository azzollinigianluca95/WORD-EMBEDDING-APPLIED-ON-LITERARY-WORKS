 kind peer who mid the tempest of debate
 hast gladly wooed and won the southern muse
 where crowned with fruit and flower of mingling hues
 she in a grove of myrtle keeps her state

 hadst thou not shewn a better entrance late

 that portal led me to morgana's* towers
 where fierce orlando found the dame at play
 and though too fast for me from fields of flowers
 she flies to savage waste and will not stay
 it will content me but to paint her bowers

 introduction



 it is many years since i first entertained a vague idea of
 translating the _orlando furioso_ and circumstances of little
 importance to the reader led me more recently to undertake it in
 earnest this work was again laid down and afterwards resumed at
 the instance of a distinguished friend and by an odd coincidence
 i am indebted also to the suggestion of another eminent person for
 the idea of the present translation of the _orlando innamorato_
 which i should observe is intended to be auxiliary to that my
 first and greater undertaking though i need scarcely say that
 the story of boiardo is a necessary prologue to the poem of
 ariosto

 it was my intention to have translated the first mentioned work
 exactly upon the model adopted by tressan in his version of the
 french romances a scheme afterwards executed with so much better
 success by my late excellent friend mr george ellis in his
 english work of the same description a further consideration of
 the subject however induced me to imitate them only in their
 general plan of illustrating a compendious prose translation by
 extracts without seeking to add poignancy to this by what might
 give a false idea of the tone of my original i recollected that i
 stood in a very different predicament from that of either of these
 authors that to compare my work with the one which is most
 likely to be familiar to my readers the 'specimens of early
 english romances' the originals are composed in a spirit of
 gravity which can hardly be confused with the gay style of the
 translator and therefore nobody can be misled by the vein of
 pleasantry which runs through mr ellis's work and which is sure
 to be exclusively ascribed to the author of the _rifacimento_
 this however would possibly not be the case with me as the
 _innamorato_ is in a great measure a humourous work of which i
 might give a false impression by infusing into it a different
 species of wit from that which distinguishes it�a
 consideration which induced me to adopt the scheme i have pursued
 in the following sheets

 this project is to give a mere groundplan of the gothic edifice
 of boiardo upon a small scale accompanied with some elevations
 and sections of the chambers which i have sought to colour after
 my original or to speak more plainly the reader is to look
 for the mere story in my prose abridgement while he may form some
 notion of its tone and style from the stanzas with which it is
 interspersed

 the _story_ indeed which seems most likely to interest the
 english reader is that which took a strong possession of the
 imagination of milton who refers with more apparent enthusiasm to
 the _innamorato_ than to the _furioso_ and whose apparent
 preference is justifiable if a richer stream of invention and
 more consummate art in its distribution are legitimate titles to
 admiration

 in this latter qualification more especially boiardo however
 inferior as a poet must be considered as a superior artist to
 ariosto and weaving as complicated a web as his successor it is
 curious to observe how much he excels him as a storyteller the
 tales indeed of ariosto and the want of connexion among these
 is in my eyes his most essential defect are so many loose
 episodes which may be compared to parallel streams flowing
 towards one reservoir but through separate and independent
 channels those of boiardo on the contrary are like waters
 that however they may diverge preserve their relation to the
 parent river to which their accession always seems necessary and
 with which they reunite previous to its discharging its contents
 into their common restingplace a short example may serve to
 illustrate what i have laid down a damsel in the _innamorato_
 relates to rinaldo the adventures of two worthies named iroldo and
 prasildo a narration which is interrupted and which though good
 in itself at first appears to be an insulated episode rinaldo
 however afterwards falls in with iroldo and his friend and this
 history thus resumed unites itself naturally with that of the
 paladin it is thus that all the stories are dovetailed one into
 the other and form a mosaic as striking from the nice union of
 its parts as from the brilliancy of its colours

 boiardo's art though here indeed he cannot be said to excel
 ariosto is as conspicuous also in the direction of the strange
 undercurrent of allegory which pervades his poem as it is in the
 distribution of his stream of story while the sort of esoteric
 doctrines conveyed by it gives a mysterious interest even to what
 we imperfectly comprehend

 such indeed is the case with many of the fables of the odyssey
 and even of the iliad where the allegory moreover is always
 subservient to poetry and poetry is never made subservient to
 allegory this remarkable piece of judgment in the greek poet has
 i think been well imitated both by boiardo and ariosto and it is
 the neglect of this principle which has made allegory so often
 offensive in the _faery queene_ of spenser the obtrusive nature
 of this has been well compared by mr george ellis in his
 specimens of the early english poets to a ghost in daylight it
 is moreover destructive to all character for spenser's heroes
 being mere abstract personifications of some virtue or vice we
 almost always know what they are to do though their actions are
 often unnatural if considered as the actions of human beings
 hence it is that we are never entertained with pictures of manners
 in the _faery queen_ while these form one of the great charms of
 the poems with which i am contrasting it

 it may however be said with justice that we are to ascribe this
 more picturesque effect of allegory rather to the spirit of the
 age than to that of the fabulist for it is perhaps true that all
 early fable is purely allegorical that this is by degrees mixed
 up with other circumstances and it is in this mixed character
 that it is most conducive to poetical effect but in a later age
 and later process of refinement when there is a greater tendency
 to abstract allegory is stript of her adventitious ornaments and
 is at last forced upon us in poetry painting and sculpture
 unveiled or unencompassed by that sort of pleasing halo which is
 necessary to give her effect

 but whether we are to ascribe boiardo's success in this particular
 to the character of his age or to his own superior judgment
 there is i think no doubt about the fact and there is i think
 as little difficulty in conceding to my author upon other
 grounds the praise of skill in executing the singular work of
 which he was the architect

 this extraordinary man was matteo maria boiardo count of
 scandiano and a native of reggio in the modenese who flourished
 in the beginning of the sixteenth century these are circumstances
 the more worthy of mention as some of them tend to explain what
 may seem most strange in the composition of the _innamorato_ such
 as the provincial character of the diction and more especially
 that careless and almost contemptuous tone between jest and
 earnest which distinguishes his poem it is doubtless on this
 account that ugo foscolo observes in an ingenious critique on the
 italian romantic poets in the _quarterly review_* that he tells
 his story in the tone of a feudal baron thus applying to him more
 justly what m de balzac has objected to another of whom he says
 "qu'il s'est comport� dans son po�me comme un prince dans ses
 �tats c'est en vertu de cette souveraint� qu'il ne reconnoit
 point les lois et qu'il se met au dessus du droit commun"

 * in an article purporting to be a review of _whistlecraft's
 poem_ now entitled _the monks and giants_ and _the court and
 parliament of beasts_

 after speaking of the mode in which he arranged his work it is a
 natural transition to the substance with which boiardo built this
 shews strong internal evidence* of having been taken in the main
 from the old french romances of charlemagne or rather from
 italian works raised upon their foundation hoole mentions one of
 these called _aspramonte_ &c of uncertain date and we have
 the titles of two others which were anterior to the _innamorato_
 one called _li fatti di carlo magno e dei paladini di francia_
 printed in 1481 the other printed in 1491 and entitled _la
 historia real di francia che tratta dei fatti dei paladini e di
 carlo magno in set libri_ some indeed would seem to deny that
 boiardo had dug in these mines and would wish us to believe that
 he not only compounded but manufactured the materials with which
 he wrought such at least would appear to have been the drift of
 one who observes that agramant sacripant and gradassso were
 names of certain of the vassals of scandiano but if he means to
 insinuate by this that boiardo was not also indebted to the other
 source for his fictions and characters as well might a critic of
 today contend that the author of the _monks and giants_ who
 writes under the name of _whistlecraft_ had not borrowed the idea
 of their cause of quarrel from pulci because he has given
 ridiculous modern names to some of his giants or that he had not
 taken the leaders amongst his _dramatis person�_ from the romances
 of the _round table_ because he has conferred "two leopards'
 faces" that is his own arms on the single knight who perishes
 in sir tristram's successful expedition

 * a single circumstance which i cite because it can be
 appreciated by every body would convince me that such stories as
 are to be found in the _innamorato_ were not the growth of
 boiardo's century no author of that age could have imagined the
 friendly ties of alliance and consanguinity between christians and
 paynims though such fictions are justified by facts thus we
 learn from gibbon that like relations existed between greeks and
 turks and as we are informed by mr lockhart in the preface to
 his _spanish ballads_ a work which presents a striking pictures
 of manners as of passion between spaniards and moors nor need
 such things surprise us though the barriers which now separate
 christian and mahomedan render them impossible nations are like
 individuals and when they are brought into close and constant
 intercourse of whatever kind their passions good or bad must
 be kindled by the contact

 but if boiardo has apparently taken his principal fictions from
 the romances of charlemagne he has also resorted to other known
 quarries and ransacked classical as well as romantic fable for
 materials

 this edifice so constructed which boiardo did not live to
 finish soon underwent alteration and repairs the first were made
 by niccolo degli agostini and later in the same century a second
 and more celebrated _rifacimento_ of it from which this
 translation is composed was produced by francesco berni whose
 name has given a distinctive epithet to the style of poetry in
 which he excelled and of which he is vulgarly supposed to have
 been the inventor

 this man was born of poor but noble parents in a small town of
 tuscany he entered the church to which he had evidently no
 disposition as a means of livelihood and though as unqualified
 for servitude as for the discharge of his clerical duties spent
 the better part of his life in dependence he appears however to
 have been blessed with a vein of cheerfulness which seconded by
 a lively imagination enabled him to beguile the wearisome nature
 of occupations which were uncongenial to him and of this he has
 left many monuments in sonnets and pieces in _terza rima_ styled
 in italian _capitoli_ consisting of satires and various species
 of ludicrous composition the titles of many of these sufficiently
 attest their whimsicality such as his _capitoli sugli orinali
 sulle anguille_ his _eulogy of the plague_ &c &c but the mode
 in which he has handled this last subject will give the best
 insight into the character of his humour having premised that
 different persons gave a preference to different seasons�as the
 poet to the spring and the reveller to the autumn�he observes
 that one may well like the season of flowers or the other that of
 fruits but that for his part he preferred the time of plague
 he then backs his predilection by a rehearsal of the advantages
 attending this visitation observing that a man is in such times
 free from solicitations of borrowers or creditors and safe from
 disagreeable companions that he has elbowroom at church and
 market and can then only be said to be in the full possession of
 his natural liberty he has rung all sorts of changes on this
 theme and nothing can be more humorous than his details

 these are worked up with singular powers of diction set off by
 great apparent facility of style and are no less remarkable for
 music of rythm richness of rhyme and a happy boldness of
 expression in this respect there is some analogy though no
 likeness between berni and dryden and the real merits of both
 are therefore imperfectly estimated by foreigners and even by the
 generality of their own countrymen many italians indeed
 consider berni as a mere buffoon which the english reader will
 think less extraordinary when he hears as lord glenbervie*
 observes i think in his notes to ricciardetto that such an
 opinion has been entertained in italy even with regard to
 ariosto

 * i state this on lord glenbervie's sole authority which is
 however a weighty one such an opinion was probably current when
 he first knew italy but i should imagine it could hardly be
 entertained at present

 better reasons may seem to palliate such a mistake of the real
 poetical character of berni than of that of ariosto some of
 these are of a general description and others of a nature more
 peculiarly applicable to his case we may observe as to the
 first that whoever indulges his wit in whatever species of
 composition is usually misjudged for wit in the sight of the
 world overlays all the other qualities of an author in whatever
 act or pursuit he may be engaged thus a great english painter
 single in his walk and distinguished by his various powers is
 looked upon by the multitude as a mere caricaturist even where
 caricature is intended by him only as a foil to beauty and
 orators have for the same reason sunk into jesters in the opinion
 of the mob though they may have been equally distinguished for
 argumentative discussion or pathetic effect

 but other and more particular circumstances have tended to fix
 this character upon berni few men have a delicate perception of
 familiar expression and still fewer yet have a nice feeling of
 the delicacies of prosody

 untwisting all the links that tie
 the secret chain of harmony

 now it is for the bold however dexterous use of language and
 rythm that berni is principally distinguished and hence as the
 means through which he works are imperfectly understood by the
 majority of his readers his object has been frequently mistaken
 i should cite in illustration of this his description of a storm
 at sea which has been often deemed burlesque but in which the
 poet would be more justly considered as working a fine effect by
 unwonted means

 let us try this question by the rules of analogy men in all
 countries resemble one another in the main and where they are not
 guided by a natural taste and judgment lean upon some rule which
 is to direct them as an infallible guide depending upon this
 they seldom consider that it may be narrow or of insufficient
 support thus an englishman who has learned to think about verse
 by the help of a few simple precepts* which he believes to be
 absolute is taught to look upon the double rhyme as suited only
 to burlesque poetry yet drummond's

 "methought desponding nightingales did borrow
 plaint of my plaint and sorrow of my sorrow"

 and the description of him who

 "saw with wonder
 vast magazines of ice and piles of thunder"**

 might be cited to prove what widely different effects are produced
 by the same weapon as it is differently wielded but impressed
 with the notions of the laws of verse which i have specified that
 is not knowing that almost all such metrical rules as have been
 alluded to are merely conditional some italians*** and
 certainly almost all english readers of italian poetry suppose
 the triple rhyme _la rima sdrucciola_ or dactyl as it is
 called by us to be as exclusively applied to ludicrous
 composition in italian as the double rhyme is imagined to be in
 english and this is perhaps one cause why some of berni's
 stanzas which abound in triple rhymes have been so utterly
 misconceived in england yet berni and ariosto have frequently
 employed the _versi sdruccioli_ where they have aimed at a bold or
 pathetic effect though they have also undoubtedly been used by
 them to heighten that of comic or satirical composition caro the
 cotemporary of berni is even profuse of triple rhymes in his
 translation of the �neid lyric poets after the example of
 chiabrera often insert them in the sublimest of their odes and
 one who lately died full of years managed the _rime sdrucciole_
 so easily as to compose whole poems with them and with such
 dignity both of versification and expression as in the opinion
 of a distinguished italian friend already cited to vie with tasso
 and petrarch

 * for example there is no rule deemed more absolute and yet
 there is none which admits more exceptions than the maxim
 forbidding a line of ten monosyllables for monosyllables in
 french and english are often such only to the eye such words
 being frequently in both languages melted into each other hence
 many good english verses consist of ten words as that of dryden
 which will be in the recollection of every body

 "arms and the man i sing &c"

 and the french cite as beautiful a line of racine which is
 composed of twelve

 "lej ur n'est pas plus pur que le fond de mon c�ur"

 ** i quote from memory

 *** thus goldoni in one of his comedies introduces a man
 improvising in triple rhymes for the sake of producing a ludicrous
 effect goldoni however it must be confessed is no authority
 in questions of language or of versification

 now let a man keep such doctrines in mind let him come to the
 consideration of berni's storm with a memory imbued with the
 sights and sounds seen and heard in one let him consider all
 circumstances of metre not absolutely but conditionally that
 is in their relation to each other and the thing described and
 he will then i believe enter into the real spirit in which the
 poet executed this description and contemplate him with very
 different eyes from those with which he viewed him before

 another cause of misconception to which i have already alluded
 has probably more misled the mob of readers of italian poetry
 natives as well as foreigners i mean the language of berni and
 as to this certainly few very few are capable of appreciating
 his skill or even of making out his track there is indeed i
 believe no poet of any country who has attempted so difficult a
 flight a flight of unwearied wing struck out with courage and
 maintained only by the most incessant exertion and care

 traces of these are seen in what may be called the charts on which
 he has pricked out his course and which i understand witness as
 much to his diligence as ariosto's attest the care with which he
 accomplished his most extraordinary voyage the documents to which
 i allude are the original mss of the _innamorato_ preserved at
 brescia as i was ignorant of the existence of these during two
 residences which i made in italy i can only speak of them on the
 testimony of others but an italian critic whom i have often
 quoted and from whose authority upon such points i would almost
 say there was no appeal once assured me these are as much blotted
 as those of ariosto at ferrara and that berni seems to have
 usually clothed his thoughts in ornate language at first which he
 rejected on afterconsideration simplifying but at the same time
 improving his diction as he proceeded till he arrived at that
 exquisite happiness of expression that _curiosa felicitas_ which
 makes his principal charm it is hence that he is the most
 untranslatable of authors since in copying him it is not only a
 question of imitating colours but the fine and more elaborate
 touches of a peculiar pencil

 while however it is clear that the versification and diction
 make the great charms of the _innamorato_ these beauties should
 not throw his other excellencies into shade and the openings of
 the different cantos which he has engrafted on the original work
 of boiardo sometimes original and sometimes imitated from the
 older poets are not greatly inferior to those which ariosto has
 prefixed to the several cantos of the furioso in imitation of
 him no not even in the higher claims of poetical merit

 these sometimes consist of moral reflections arising out of the
 narrative and the following may remind the reader of one of those
 little gems scattered through the plays of shakspeare�

 who steals a buglehorn a ring a steed
 or such like worthless thing has some discretion
 'tis petty larceny�not such his deed
 who robs us of our fame our best possession
 and he who takes our labour's worthiest meed
 may well be deemed a felon by profession
 who so much more our hate and scourge deserves
 as from the rule of right he wider swerves

 sometimes indulging in a declamation against vices or follies he
 makes his satire more poignant by allusions to some prevalent
 practice of the day thus in a sally against avarice he attacks
 those who masqued it under the disguise of hypocrisy in the
 following stanza

 this other under show of an adviser
 and practiser of what is strict and right
 but being in effect a rogue and miser
 cloisters a dozen daughters out of sight
 and fain would have the pretty creatures wiser
 than their frail sisters but mistakes them quite
 for they are like the rest and set the group
 of monks and priests and abbots cockahoop

 the following extract illustrating a philosophical dogma of his
 age taken from the opening of the fortysixth canto is of
 another description and may serve as a specimen of the variety of
 his vein and the odd ingenuity with which he winds in and out of
 his argument sometimes bearing up for his harbour when in the
 middle of a digression and then when he seems to feel himself
 sure of a retreat indulging in a new sally in which he however
 never entirely loses sight of his port

 1
 he who the name of little world applied
 to man in this approved his subtle wit
 since save it is not round all things beside
 exactly with this happy symbol fit
 and i may say that long and deep and wide
 and middling good and bad are found in it
 here too the various elements combined
 are dominant snow rain and mist and wind

 2
 now clear now overcast 'tis there its land
 will yield no fruit here bears a rich supply
 as the mixt soil is marle or barren sand
 and haply here too moist or there too dry
 here foaming hoarse and there with murmur bland
 streams glide or torrents tumble from on high
 such of man's appetites convey the notion
 since these are infinite and still in motion

 3
 two solid dikes the invading streams repel
 the one is reason arid the other shame
 the torrents if above their banks they swell
 wit and discretion are too weak to tame
 the crystal waters which so smoothly well
 are appetites of things devoid of blame
 those winds and rains and snows and night and day
 ye learned clerks divine them as ye may


 4
 among these elements misfortune wills
 our nature should have most of earth for she
 moved by what influence heaven or sun instils
 is subject to their power nor less are we
 in her this star or that in barren hills
 produces mines in rich variety
 and those who human nature wisely scan
 may this discern peculiarly in man

 5
 who would believe that various minerals grew
 and many metals in our rugged mind
 from gold to nitre yet the thing is true
 but out alas the rub is how to find
 this ore some letters and some wealth pursue
 some fancy steeds some dream at ease reclined
 these song delights and those the cittern's sound
 such are the mines which in our world abound

 6
 as these are worthier more or less so they
 abound with lead or gold and practised wight
 the various soil accustomed to survey
 is fitted best to find the substance bright
 and such in our apulia is the way
 they heal those suffering from the spider's bite
 who strange vagaries play like men possessed
 _tarantulated_* as 'tis there express'd

 * the tarantula is now known to be harmless the cause of its
 supposed mischievous effects and the efficacy of the mode of
 curing them are perhaps easily explained people are in all
 countries though they are imagined to be peculiarly so in
 england exposed to attacks of melancholy which arise out of some
 physical cause whether indigestion or other bodily complaint
 the doctors of calabria attributed this to the sting of the
 tarantula which is assuredly not more extravagant than a popular
 english medical author's ascribing jaundice to the bite of a mad
 dog the patient delighted to find a cause for his complaint was
 easily by leading questions brought to recollect that he had at
 some time or other felt a prick which probably proceeded from
 the sting of a tarantula dancing was the remedy prescribed and
 this as exciting the animal spirits &c may very well have
 operated a cure of the real disease the patients were to be
 played to as berni states till a tune was struck which pleased
 their fancy and animated them to exertion the tarantella an air
 supposed to be particularly stimulating in such a case is still a
 popular dance in the south of italy modern philosophers have
 found out that the tarantula has no venom

 7
 for this 'tis needful touching sharp or flat
 to seek a sound which may the patients please
 who when they find the merry music pat
 dance till they sweat away the foul disease
 and thus who should allure _this_ man or _that_
 and still with various offer tempt and tease
 i wot in little time would ascertain
 and sound each different mortal's mine and vein

 8
 'twas so brunello with rogero wrought
 who offered him the armour and the steed
 thus by the cunning greek _his_ aid was bought
 who laid fair ilion smoking on the mead
 which was of yore in clearer numbers taught
 nor shall i now repeat upon my reed
 who from the furrow let my ploughshare stray
 unheeding how the moments glide away

 9
 as the first pilot by the shore did creep
 who launched his boat upon the billows dark
 and where the liquid ocean was least deep
 and without sails impelled his humble barque
 but seaward next where foaming waters leap
 by little and by little steered his ark
 with nothing but the wind and stars to guide
 and round about him glorious wonders spied

 10
 thus i who still have sung a humble strain
 and kept my little barque within its bounds
 now find it fit to launch into the main
 and sing the fearful warfare which resounds
 where africa pours out her swarthy train
 and the wide world with mustered troops abounds
 and fanning fire and forge each land and nation
 sends forth the dreadful note of preparation

 the next extract i shall give though it commences with his
 favourite figure of the barque will serve as a specimen of a
 different style it forms the opening of the second book the two
 first lines the reader will trace to dante and will find in the
 remainder a translation of the �neadum genetrix of lucretius

 1
 launched on a deeper sea my pinnace rear
 thy sail prepared to plough the billows dark
 and you ye lucid stars by whom i steer
 my feeble vessel to its destined mark
 shine forth upon her course benign and clear
 and beam propitious on the daring barque
 about to stem an ocean so profound
 while i your praises and your works resound

 2
 o holy mother of �neas o
 daughter of jove thou bliss of gods above
 and men beneath venus who makest grow
 green herb and plant and fillest all with love
 thou creatures that would else be cold and slow
 dost with thy sovereign instinct warm and move
 thou dost all jarring things in peace unite�
 the world's eternal spirit life and light

 3
 at thine appearance storm and rain have ceased
 and zephyr has unlocked the genial ground
 leap the wild herds�'tis wanton nature's feast�
 and the green woods with singing birds resound
 while by strange pleasure stung the savage beast
 lives but for love what time their greenwood round
 all creatures rove or couch upon the sward
 discord and hate forgot in sweet accord

 4
 thee kind and gentle star thy suppliant prays
 to thee i sue by every bolt which flies
 thro' the fifth planet* melting with thy rays
 when panting on thy lap the godhead lies
 and lock'd within thine arms with upward gaze
 feeds on thy visage his desiring eyes
 that thou wilt gain for me his grace and grown
 propitious with _his_ grace accord thine own

 * mars

 5
 since 'tis of thee i sing as i have said
 and only of thy praise and pleasures dream
 well pleased i to this fruitful field was led
 and sure i could not choose a sweeter theme
 thou too that down thy clear and ample bed
 dost run with grateful murmur rapid stream
 awhile from thine impetuous course refrain
 while on thy banks i tune my mingled strain

 in the concluding address to the river he apostrophizes the
 adige on whose banks he might be said to be writing as he was
 then living in the town of verona which is watered by it in the
 service of the cardinal di bibbiena

 one more specimen of his poetical prefaces and i have done it is
 the introduction to his third book and in this too the reader
 who will recognize a passage of the _ars poetica_ of horace may
 observe how well berni translates and applies his classical
 recollections

 1
 as they who their unhappy task fulfil
 in mines of england hungary and spain
 the deeper that they dig the mountain still
 find richer treasure and securer gain
 and as wayfaring man who climbs a hill
 surveys as he ascends a wider plain
 and shores and oceans open on his eye
 exalted nearer to the starry sky

 2
 so in this book indited for your pleasure
 if you believe and listen to my lore
 you in advancing shall discern new treasure
 and catch new lights and landscapes evermore
 then by no former scale my promise measure
 nor judge this strain by that which went before
 since still my caves and rugged rocks unfold
 a richer vein of jewels pearls and gold

 3
 and he who winds about my mountain's side
 still spies new lands and seas a glorious sight
 if patient industry and courage guide
 him from the valley to the frowning height
 like prospect was the poet's who supplied
 flame out of smoke instead of smoke from light
 with wise ulysses' acts to fill our ears
 to the more wonderment of him who hears

 so much for the poetry of berni his life was not such as
 reflected any lustre on his works this if we reject some foul
 imputations cast upon him was to say the least of it
 disreputable it is however certain that being at last
 established in a canonry at florence he lived there in high and
 accomplished society this fact however in a profligate age
 like that in which he flourished proves nothing in his favour
 and if we listened to the stories of his biographers we might
 suppose him even to have been courted for some of his vicious
 propensities for one of these writers tells us he was excited by
 the cardinal ippolito de' medici to poison the duke alexander
 against whom he had a private pique another would have us
 believe that he was tempted by the duke to poison the cardinal
 and to complicate the matter yet more that the cardinal or the
 duke or both had poison administered to berni himself upon his
 refusal the dates however of their respective deaths are at
 variance with these strange assertions and if such certain means
 of contradiction were wanting the internal evidence of berni's
 character however vicious might be almost sufficient to refute
 such improbable calumnies it may be said indeed that perhaps no
 one was ever selected as a probable agent of guilt who seems to
 have been so little capable of engaging in the sort of crimes
 which were expected of him

 as a proof of this we might almost refer to the picture which he
 has given of himself and which carries with it every warrant of
 resemblance in one of the cantos of the last book of the
 _innamorato_ he describes a number of persons as having become
 the victims of a fairy of whom they afterwards remain the
 voluntary prisoners among these he has in imitation of certain
 painters introduced himself with another known character of the
 day a circumstance which together with the nature of the
 episode might lead one to suspect that thomson was indebted to
 this fiction for his _castle of indolence_ he has however given
 the tenants of his "bowers of ease" a character so much more
 intellectual than that of berni's actors that he may very fairly
 pretend to the praise of original composition even if his work be
 an imitation instead of a mere accidental coincidence which i am
 more tempted to believe* but i draw the curtain of berni's
 picture

 * i do not recollect any authority for thomson's having been
 conversant with italian poetry and i think that a view of his
 works would lead to a contrary supposition thus i should say that
 though no man could copy what he actually saw with a nicer hand or
 eye no man had more need of study in the italian school of ideal
 picture than this english poet in his drawings from nature his
 colouring is as inimitable as his design and his bird who

 "shivers every feather with desire"

 is painted with the precision as well as the force of the flemish
 pencil yet he has personified autumn as

 "_crowned with the sickle_ and the wheaten sheaf"

 thus putting on his head what should have been in his hand and
 presenting us a ludicrous figure surmounted by a "crumpled horn"
 no italian poet would have painted from nature with thomson's
 marvellous precision and no italian poet would have committed
 such gross offences against propriety as he has in his imaginary
 pictures

 book iii canto vii

 36
 a boon companion to increase this crew
 by chance a gentle florentine was led
 a florentine altho' the father who
 begot him in the casentine was bred
 who nigh become a burgher of his new
 domicile there was well content to wed
 and so in bibbiena wived which ranks
 among the pleasant towns on arno's banks

 37
 at lamporecchio he of whom i write
 was born for dumb masetto* fam'd of yore
 thence roam'd to florence and in piteous plight
 there sojourned till nineteen like pilgrim poor
 and shifted thence to rome with second flight
 hoping some succour from a kinsman's store
 a cardinal allied to him by blood
 and one that neither did him harm nor good

 * see boccaccio

 38
 he to the nephew passed this patron dead
 who the same measure as his uncle meted
 and then again in search of better bread
 with empty bowels from his house retreated
 and hearing for his name and fame were spread
 the praise of one who serv'd the pope repeated
 and in the roman court datario hight
 he hired himself to him to read and write

 39
 this trade the unhappy man believed he knew
 but this belief was like the rest a bubble
 since he could never please the patron who
 fed him nor ever once was out of trouble
 the worse he did the more he had to do
 and only made his pain and penance double
 and thus with sleeves and bosom stuffed with papers
 wasted his wits and lived oppressed with vapours

 40
 add for his mischief whether 'twas his little
 merit misfortune or his want of skill
 some cures he farmed produced him not a tittle
 and only were a source of plague and ill
 fire water storm or devil sacked vines and victual
 whether the luckless wretch would tythe or till
 some pensions too which he possessed were nought
 and like the rest produced him not a groat

 41
 this notwithstanding he his miseries slighted
 like happy man who not too deeply feels
 and all but most the roman lords delighted
 content in spite of tempests writs or seals
 and oftentimes to make them mirth recited
 strange chapters upon urinals and eels*
 and other mad vagaries would rehearse
 that he had hitched heaven help him into verse

 * see his _capitoli sugli orinali sulle anquille etc_

 42
 his mood was choleric and his tongue was vicious
 but he was praised for singleness of heart
 not taxed as avaricious or ambitious
 affectionate and frank and void of art
 a lover of his friends and unsuspicious
 but where he hated knew no middle part
 and men his malice by his love might rate
 but then he was more prone to love than hate

 43
 to paint his person this was thin and dry
 well sorting it his legs were spare and lean
 broad was his visage and his nose was high
 while narrow was the space that was between
 his eyebrows sharp and blue his hollow eye
 which for his bushy beard had not been seen
 but that the master kept this thicket clear'd
 at mortal war with moustache and with beard

 44
 no one did ever servitude detest
 like him though servitude was still his dole
 since fortune or the devil did their best
 to keep him evermore beneath controul
 while whatsoever was his patron's hest
 to execute it went against his soul
 his service would he freely yield unasked
 but lost all heart and hope if he were tasked

 45
 nor musick huntingmatch nor mirthful measure
 nor play nor other pastime moved him aught
 and if 'twas true that horses gave him pleasure
 the simple sight of them was all he sought
 too poor to purchase and his only treasure
 his naked bed his pastime to do nought
 but tumble there and stretch his weary length
 and so recruit his spirits and his strength

 46
 worn with the trade he long was used to slave in
 so heartless and so broken down was he
 he deemed he could not find a readier haven
 or safer port from that tempestuous sea
 nor better cordial to recruit his craven
 and jaded spirit when he once was free
 than to betake himself to bed and do
 nothing and mind and matter so renew

 47
 on this as on an art he would dilate
 in good set terms and styled his bed a vest
 which as the wearer pleased was small or great
 and of whatever fashion liked him best
 a simple mantle or a robe of state
 with that a gown of comfort and of rest
 since whosoever slipt his daily clothes
 for this put off with these all worldly woes

 48
 he by the noise and lights and music jaded
 of that long revel and the tramp and tread
 since every guest in his desires was aided
 and knaves performed their will as soon as said
 found out a chamber which was uninvaded
 and bade those varlets there prepare a bed
 garnished with bolsters and with pillows fair
 at its four borders and exactly square

 49
 this was six yards across by mensuration
 with sheets and curtains bleached by wave and breeze
 with a silk quilt for farther consolation
 and all things fitting else tho' hard to please
 six souls therein had found accommodation
 but this man sighed for elbowroom and ease
 and here as in a sea was fain to swim
 extending at his pleasure length and limb

 50
 by chance with him to join the fairy's train
 a frenchman and a cook was thither brought
 one that had served in court with little gain
 though he with sovereign care and cunning wrought
 for him prepared with sheet and counterpane
 another bed was like his fellow's sought
 and 'twixt the two sufficient space was seen
 for a fair table to be placed between

 51
 upon this table for the pair to dine
 were savoury viands piled prepared with art
 all ordered by this mastercook divine
 boiled roast ragouts and jellies paste and tart
 but soups and syrups pleased the florentine
 who loathed fatigue like death and for his part
 brought neither teeth nor fingers into play
 but made two varlets feed him as he lay

 52
 here couchant nothing but his head was spied
 sheeted and quilted to the very chin
 and needful food a serving man supplied
 thro' pipe of silver placed the mouth within
 meantime the sluggard moved no part beside
 holding all motion else were shame and sin
 and so his spirits and his health were broke
 not to fatigue this organ seldom spoke

 53
 the cook was master peter hight and he
 had tales at will to while away the day
 to him the florentine "those fools pardie
 "have little wit who dance that endless hay"
 and peter in return "i think with thee"
 then with some merry story backed the say
 swallowed a mouthful and turned round in bed
 and so by starts talked turned and slept and fed

 54
 and so the time these careless comrades cheated
 and still without a change ate drank and slept
 nor by the calendar their seasons meeted
 nor register of days or sennights kept
 no dial told the passing hours which fleeted
 nor bell was heard nor servant overstept
 the threshold so the pair proclaimed their will
 to bring them tale or tidings good or ill

 55
 above all other curses pen and ink
 were by the tuscan held in hate and scorn
 who worse than any loathsome sight or stink
 detested pen and paper ink and horn
 so deeply did a deadly venom sink
 so festered in his flesh a rankling thorn
 while night and day with heart and garments rent
 seven weary years the wretch in writing spent

 56
 of all their ways to baffle time and tide
 this seems the strangest of their waking dreams
 couched on their back the two the rafters eyed
 and taxed their drowsy wits to count the beams
 'tis thus they mark at leisure which is wide
 which short or which of due proportion seems
 and which wormeaten are and which are sound
 and if the total sum is odd or round*

 * i have already given a loose translation of this part of berni's
 account of himself in the _court of beasts_

 having in the preceding part of this introduction given some
 account of the mode in which i have executed my task as a
 translator it may be expected that i should give some information
 respecting my labours as an editor to speak frankly i have none
 to give having annexed no commentary or at least nothing
 worthy of being called a commentary to this work some readers
 may perhaps think i have in this neglected my duty and reproach
 me with not having pointed out the sources from which many of the
 fictions in the _innamorato_ are borrowed or at least the points
 of resemblance which may be found between many of these and other
 ancient stories it appeared however to me that my readers were
 as likely as myself to be conversant with incidents to be found in
 the _spectator_ _persian tales_ _arabian nights_ and
 _biblioth�que orientale_ others who will perhaps thank me for
 sparing them such a display of commonplace knowledge may
 however think i have erred in having done nothing to illustrate
 the allegory of the _innamorato_ if i have not the omission has
 arisen from a conviction of the inutility of such an attempt i
 have read much that has been written upon the allegory of the
 _furioso_ yet never met with any explanation of it which i
 considered as satisfactory to myself though i was persuaded that
 the commentators were right holding obscurity to be one source of
 the sublime in this branch of imagination though i will not
 venture to extend the position further it appears to me that the
 reader always best fills up an indistinct outline according to
 his own fancy and is more likely to derive pleasure from doing
 so than from a solution which usually presents him with something
 very different from what he had preconceived it is this
 consideration which has restrained me from doing more than
 throwing out a few ideas which suggested themselves on some parts
 of boiardo's allegory and no wish to avoid any trouble which i
 might have thought satisfactorily bestowed on it still less have
 i been influenced by any fear of that ridicule which is so readily
 discharged upon italian commentators or those who report their
 lucubrations for i can safely say that i should have pursued the
 research to which i have alluded if i had thought i could have
 done so with any satisfaction to myself though i had met with no
 better recompence than that of being compared to the ass who
 carried off the dead body of the sphynx after her enigma had been
 unriddled and she herself slain by �dipus


 the orlando innamorato
 book i
 argument

 gradasso king of sericane meditates the invasion of france in
 order to obtain bayardo and durindana in the mean time
 charlemagne is holding a court plenar at paris where the
 appearance of angelica excites much confusion amid the assembled
 knights she returns towards her own kingdom pursued by orlando
 and rinaldo rinaldo having however drunk of the waters of
 disdain while she has unfortunately tasted those of love is
 seized with loathing for the damsel and is in his turn followed
 in vain by her whom he before pursued he is now sent by
 charlemagne in defence of marsilius king of spain whose
 territories were invaded by gradasso in his progress towards
 france he is here separated from his army by a device of
 malagigi his own brother who is become the tool of angelica and
 his troops left without their leader return home marsilius in
 consequence of this desertion buys peace of gradasso by
 assisting him in his invasion of france here charlemagne and his
 paladins are made prisoners in a thorough rout of the christian
 army gradasso however offers him peace and liberty for himself
 and followers on the delivery of bayardo who had been brought
 back from spain by the french troops and on his promise to send
 him durindana as soon as it is in his power charlemagne of course
 consents and sends to paris for the horse this is however
 refused by astolpho who had taken upon himself the government of
 the city and who sends a defiance to gradasso they meet and the
 indian king is unhorsed who in compliance with the conditions of
 a previous agreement frees his prisoners and returns to sericana
 astolpho too dissatisfied with the conduct of charlemagne
 departs from france he now enrolls himself amongst the defenders
 of angelica besieged by agrican in albracca in which warfare he
 is made prisoner orlando with other puissant knights takes the
 same side and slays agrican in single combat on the other part
 rinaldo whose hatred to angelica equals his former love joins
 the camp of the besiegers and a desperate battle is fought
 between him and orlando angelica however still enamoured of
 rinaldo separates them and dispatches orlando upon a perilous
 quest many other adventures are achieved by these and other
 knights and many episodes are connected with the two principal
 actions of the book viz the invasion of france and the war
 before albracca


 book i

 the story says that there reigned formerly in parts beyond india
 a mighty monarch who was moreover so valiant and powerful in war
 that no one could stand against him he was named gradasso he had
 the face and heart of a dragon and was in stature a giant but
 as it often happens to the greatest and to the richest to long
 for what they cannot have and thus to lose what they already
 possess this king could not rest content without durindana the
 sword of orlando and bayardo the horse of rinaldo to obtain
 which he determined to war upon france and for this expedition
 chose one hundred and fifty thousand horsemen

 but the author suspends the further mention of this monarch of
 whom we shall soon again hear to speak of charlemagne who had
 ordered magnificent jousts and summoned thither all and singular
 his barons and to this court plenar besides his paladins and
 greater and lesser vassals of the crown were bid all strangers
 baptized or infidel then sojourning at paris amongst the guests
 were the giant grandonio ferrau the king balugantes a relation
 of charlemagne isolier and serpentin who were companions and
 many others

 and now was the day when the great festival was to begin with a
 sumptuous banquet made by charlemagne who assisted at it in his
 royal robes and entertained between christians and pagans
 twentytwo thousand and thirty guests

 the tables spread right and left were ordered with due
 discrimination at the first were seated the kings of christendom
 an english a lombard and a breton to wit otho desiderius and
 salamon and next these all others according to their dignity and
 the esteem in which they were held at the second table were
 placed the dukes and marquisses and at the third the counts and
 simple knights those of the house of maganza were especially
 honoured and above all the others gano of poictiers rinaldo saw
 this with eyes of fire the more so that these traitors laughing
 amongst themselves were mocking him as not equally
 distinguished by the king accordingly we are told

 yet while his heart with smothered fury beats
 he feigns to trifle with the cups and glasses
 but inly murmuring to himself repeats
 "false ribald crew before tomorrow passes
 "this arm shall prove if you can keep your seats
 "spawn of a nest of vipers idiots asses
 "and well i wot to have you on the hip
 "unless my weapon swerve or courser slip"

 king balugantes marked his discontent
 and reading as he weened his secret thought
 to him his trucheman with a message sent
 to wot if it was true as he was taught
 that honour not by worth and wisdom went
 but in this christian court was sold and bought
 that he a stranger and a turk if true
 might render each and all the honour due

 the good rinaldo smiled and to the sable
 reporter of the royal message said�
 "to solve the question as i best am able
 "if i in rules of court am rightly read
 "honour and place to glutton at the table
 "are duly yielded as to dame in bed
 "but in the field where warriors spur their steeds
 "the worth of man is measured by his deeds"

 while this conversation is passing music sounds the meats are
 served up and the feast is commenced with all the pomp and
 circumstance of chivalric magnificence

 in the middle of this their merriment four giants enter the
 further end of the hall having between them a damsel of
 incomparable beauty attended by a single knight many ladies
 some of whose names are specified were seated at the different
 tables but all were outshone by the beautiful stranger the
 christians lords or simple knights swarm about the damsel and
 every pagan is in an instant on his feet she smiles upon all but
 forthwith addresses herself to charlemagne after a complimentary
 preface

 "sir king" said the damsel "before i show the motive which has
 brought us hither learn that this knight is my brother uberto
 and that i am his sister angelica both of us banished without
 reason from the paternal mansion upon the tanais where we dwelt
 two hundred days' journey from hence news were brought us of
 this feast and we have traversed so many provinces to see your
 magnificence and if possible to gain the wreath of roses which
 is said to be the guerdon of the jousts

 "for this purpose my brother awaits all comers christian or
 saracen at the stair of merlin* it being premised that the war
 is to be conducted on the following conditions whoever is
 unseated in the tilt shall be allowed no further course or trial
 but remain the prisoner of him by whom he was unhorsed while
 whoever flings my brother shall have me for his reward and uberto
 shall depart with his giants"

 * it may be observed that the abode of merlin and the tomb of
 merlin are always placed by the first romancers to wit those of
 the round table in britain and their constantly laying their
 scene in our island and choosing their actors from thence has
 led m de la rue and after him mr george ellis to suppose that
 these earliest romancers were subjects of english kings who wrote
 for the amusement of their court the language of which was
 norman the romancers however who celebrated charlemagne and
 who were doubtless french very naturally chose their heroes from
 france and transferred the scene to that country to these i
 have already said that boiardo and ariosto arc mainly indebted
 for their fictions

 she remains kneeling awhile before charles as waiting his answer
 all behold the damsel in mute admiration but above all orlando
 approaching her with downcast eyes gives the first signs of the
 passion which was destined to be his ruin while orlando is thus
 lovestricken he is not single in his folly and even the greyhaired
 namus and charles himself participate in it but while
 these and all the rest gaze upon her in silence ferrau is so
 transported with passion as to be about to snatch her up in his
 arms and transport her away from the presence respect for
 charlemagne however restrains him while this is passing
 malagigi brother to rinaldo a puissant magician closely
 observes the strangers and reads in them some mysterious purpose
 different from what they pretended to be the object of their
 expedition charlemagne had now recovered from his embarrassment
 sufficiently to speak and plied angelica with different subjects
 of discourse for the purpose of detaining her but at length not
 being able to prolong the interview with decency gave her a
 dismissal by according the request

 the damsel has scarce left the city when malagigi

 still fearing for the king and full of care
 flies to his book retiring from the revel
 to know the secret purpose of the pair
 and at what aim the knight and damsel level
 he reads and as he reads in upper air
 is heard a voice and next appears a devil
 who bids in haughty tone the wise magician
 proclaim his will and give him his dismission

 malagigi having proposed his questions the fiend informs him that
 angelica is an enemy come to put a notable scorn upon charlemagne
 and that her father who is an ancient indian king called
 galaphron of catay has dispatched her for this object
 accompanied by her brother argalia and not uberto as she
 falsely designated him that she is full of malice and read in
 every sort of magic whilst her brother is as valiant in arms
 gifted with a courser of marvellous swiftness and armed with an
 enchanted lance the virtue of this is such that no knight no
 not even orlando or rinaldo could resist its push nor are his
 other arms inferior to his spear to this he has received from
 his father a ring which when on the finger makes enchantment of
 no effect and when placed between the lips renders the wearer
 invisible galaphron it is added reckons much upon these gifts
 but yet more upon the beauty of his daughter hence he has
 dispatched argalia with the damsel in trust that she shall
 entice the paladins into duel with her brother who unhorsing
 them will send them prisoners to catay malagigi is much
 disturbed at the devil's news and determines to seek the damsel
 in person and frustrate her design argalia was already reposing
 himself under a fair pavilion pitched near the stair of merlin
 while

 angelica beneath a pine was sleeping
 her long light tresses scattered on the grass
 beside a limpid font whose waters leaping
 fell back into a pool as clear as glass
 a giant had the damsel in his keeping
 who might for a reposing angel pass
 her brother's ring the sleeping lady wore
 whose hidden virtues were described before

 false malagigi borne on fiendish steed
 meantime through fields of air in silence swept
 and now dismounting on the flow'ry mead
 approached the weary damsel where she slept
 by that grim giant watched who for her need
 good guard upon the sleeping lady kept
 while others of her following paced the sward
 and such their charge kept wider watch and ward

 the necromancer smiles at seeing the whole party as it were
 delivered over into his hands and opens his books for the purpose
 of beginning his operations whilst he reads a heavy slumber
 falls upon the watchers and having drawn his sword for he was
 a belted knight he approaches the princess with the intention of
 putting her to death he yields however to the enchantment of
 beauty and determines to make a different use of the opportunity
 not aware that the enchanted ring was on her finger which she had
 accidentally received from argalia he conceives he has rendered
 her sleep as fast as that of her followers and clasps her in his
 arms but the ring which is proof against all spells does its
 duty angelica wakes with a shriek and argalia rushes to her
 assistance being unprovided with other weapon he avenges the
 insult offered to his sister with a cudgel but as he is bruising
 the unfortunate malagigi angelica cries to him to bind the
 ravisher fast while she holds him as he is a potent necromancer
 who but for the assistance of the ring would laugh at chains
 argalia runs immediately to wake the giant but finding after
 some time that this was a fruitless attempt he himself binds
 malagigi hands and feet the damsel this while possesses herself
 of the magician's book and having evoked his fiends bids them
 convey her prisoner instantly to king galaphron and inform him
 that her project goes well since she has mastered the only enemy
 whom she had reason to fear malagigi is confined by galaphron in
 a dungeon under the sea in the mean time angelica dissolves the
 enchanted sleep of her followers

 while these things are going on all is uproar at paris since
 orlando insists upon being the first to try the adventure at the
 stair of merlin this is resented by the other pretenders to
 angelica and all contest his right to the precedency the tumult
 is stilled by the usual expedient of casting lots and the first
 prize is drawn by astolpho ferrau has the second and the giant
 grandonio the third next to these came berlinghier and otho then
 charles himself and as his ill fortune would have it after
 thirty more the indignant orlando

 the character of the holder of the first lot is now developed who
 is to play a considerable part in the romance

 astolpho who the winning ticket bore
 was nimble and with youthful beauty blest
 and for these gentle gifts was prized before
 christian or pagan princes east or west
 with that was rich and full of courteous lore
 and always loved to go in gilded vest
 one only fault the prince's pride might humble
 sir turpin tells us he was given to tumble

 astolpho goes forth upon his adventure with great gaiety of dress
 and manner and argalia and he encounter after having with much
 courtesy renewed the engagements which were before specified as
 regulating the duel they engage when astolpho is immediately
 tilted out of his saddle his rage and surprise are excessive but
 his painful feelings receive some relief from the kindness of
 angelica who moved to compassion for his misfortune and
 somewhat touched by his gallantry and grace grants him the
 liberty of the pavilion where he is treated with every sort of
 kindness and respect here he is assigned a magnificent bed the
 others retreat to _their_ couches and thus passes the night

 the sleepers are awakened at dawn by ferrau's bugle who as next
 upon the list claims the second course argalia goes forth to
 meet him clad in his enchanted arms and mounted on his horse
 rabican who is described as blacker than a crow save that three
 of his legs were pieballed and that his forehead was marked with
 a star

 ferrau undergoes the fate of astolpho but when unhorsed refuses
 to abide like him the established conditions and springing upon
 his feet in despite of the protest of argalia renews the battle
 with his sword argalia's giants now rush between the combatants
 and attack him their master however in courtesy retires from
 such unequal fray and stands apart till his giants are
 overthrown he then renews the contest and astolpho who had been
 waked by the disturbance in vain seeks to allay it ferrau says
 that he is no vassal of charles's and therefore is not bound by
 any pact respecting the duel which he may have made with
 angelica and that he is resolved to win her and wear her in
 answer to the observation of argalia that he is without a helmet
 which had been beat off and broken by the golden lance he
 observes that without one he is a fair match for his opposite

 this dispute had been carried on by the combatants on foot but
 they now remount in order to decide it on horseback when argalia
 in his fury forgets his lance which he has left leaning against a
 pine many blows had been given and taken without effect when the
 two knights paused in mutual astonishment and argalia informed
 ferrau that his efforts were fruitless as his armour was
 enchanted a communication which ferrau repaid by observing that
 his skin was invulnerable with the exception of one side the
 recital of these gifts which produces a sort of reciprocal
 respect leads them to a further parley in which argalia agrees
 to give ferrau angelica to wife provided she consents to the
 arrangement but angelica who is startled by ferrau's ugliness
 and fierceness and more especially by his illshaped head and
 black hair her favour being especially set upon a lighthaired
 lover entreats her brother rather than sacrifice her to such a
 man to renew his battle which had been suspended while she
 transports herself by magic to catay she then observes he may
 watch his opportunity to escape and follow her to the wood of
 arden where she will wait his arrival

 he in consequence communicates to ferrau the refusal of his
 sister the battle is renewed and upon its renewal angelica
 disappears she is soon followed by argalia who turns his back
 upon his adversary ferrau pursues but sees no traces either of
 the damsel or the knight in the meantime astolpho who finds
 himself at liberty puts on his armour and his own lance having
 been splintered in the joust takes unconscious of its virtues
 that of argalia which was left leaning against the pine
 returning home he meets rinaldo who had wandered out to the
 wood to learn the fortune of ferrau he too hearing of the
 disappearance of angelica gallops away in pursuit while astolpho
 continues his road to paris

 here orlando seeks him and learns all that has passed distracted
 with the news and above all jealous of rinaldo he too waits
 only till evening to join in the pursuit when he makes his secret
 sally and rides towards the wood of arden thus three champions
 to wit ferrau rinaldo and orlando are entered in the chase

 this while charlemagne is proceeding in his preparations for the
 tournament the prize of which was to be the _crown of roses_
 many fair feats had already been wrought and the knights are in
 the heat of the jousts when astolpho pricks forth into the
 medley* but his courser falls with him and dislocates his foot
 all regret this accident of the english prince who is carried to
 his palace where his foot is set the jousts are continued by the
 others from whom grandonio the giant bears away the honours of
 the field wounding and unhorsing knights on all sides in the
 meantime

 * mischia mel�e

 astolpho was return'd into the square
 his single faulchion to his girdle tied
 and rode in gallant guise an ambling mare
 unarm'd and weaponless in all beside
 and laugh'd and loiter'd with the ladies there
 and jested with the circle far and wide
 while he thus idly chatted gryphon fell
 thrust by grandonio from his lofty sell

 all who contend with grandonio suffer the same destiny while the
 outrageous pagan overwhelms charles and his paladins with
 invective on the other hand charles vents threats and
 imprecations upon the absent orlando rinaldo and gano
 expressing at the same time his earnest desire to be revenged upon
 the saracens

 astolpho hearing this retreats unobserved to his palace arms
 himself at all points and reappears amongst the combatants not
 as the author observes that he expects to do himself much honour
 in which opinion he seems to have agreed with the multitude who
 hailed his entrance with smiles and whispers but with the
 intention of doing his duty to his lord and leaving the event to
 heaven accordingly

 firm on his prancing steed he louted low
 in graceful act and "know sir king" he cried
 "i come to venge thee of thy pagan foe
 "knowing that thou such wish hast signified"
 as one whose mood was still fastidious "go
 "go in the name of god" king charles replied
 then turning to the lords that hemm'd his seat
 "there lack'd but this to make our shame complete"

 astolpho thus dismissed pours a volley of abuse upon grandonio
 and tilts at him in fury the golden lance works an unexpected
 miracle and the giant tumbles like a tower that is undermined
 king charlemagne and all are in amazement while astolpho though
 no less surprized at his own prowess pursues his fortune and
 clears the field these events were immediately recounted to gan
 who was in his own house and who having armed a party of his
 kinsmen and retainers comes before the king and alleges some
 frivolous pretext for his tardy appearance which whether
 believed or not is accepted by the sovereign he now sends a
 message to astolpho proposing to close the tournament as the
 paynims are defeated to which the english prince replies 'that
 he considers him every whit as false a pagan as the others' and
 immediately attacks him with his lance gan pinabello and all
 their household are unhorsed but while astolpho is in full
 career a traitor assails him from behind and bears him to the
 ground he rises in fury tilts at friends and foes and outrages
 all king charlemagne among the rest by whose order he is at last
 surrounded mastered and carried off to prison

 he was here ill bested yet not so ill says the author as the
 other three who suffered the pains of love for angelica these
 all arrived by different roads and at different times in the wood
 of arden the first comer was rinaldo who penetrating into the
 forest beheld a beautiful fountain in the shade

 the alabaster vase was wrought with gold
 and the white ground o'erlaid with curious care
 while he who look'd within it might behold
 green grove and flowers and meadow pictur'd there
 wise merlin made it it is said of old
 for tristan when he sigh'd for yseult fair
 that drinking of its wave he might forego
 the peerless damsel and forget his woe

 but he to his misfortune never found
 that fountain built beneath the greenwood tree
 altho' the warrior pac'd a weary round
 encompassing the world by land and sea
 the waves which in the magic bason bound
 make _him_ unlove who loves nor only he
 foregoes his former love but that which late
 was his chief pride and pleasure has in hate

 mount alban's lord whose strength and spirits sink
 for yet the sun was high and passing hot
 stood gazing on the pearly fountain's brink
 rapt with the sight of that delicious spot
 at length he can no more but stoops to drink
 and thirst and love are in the draught forgot
 for such the virtue those cold streams impart
 changed in an instant is the warrior's heart

 him with that forest's wonders unacquainted
 some paces to a second water bring
 of chrystal wave with rain or soil untainted
 with all the flowers that wreathe the brows of spring
 kind nature had the verdant margin painted
 and there a pine and beech and olive fling
 their boughs above the stream and form a bower
 a grateful shelter from the noontide hour

 this was the stream of love upon whose shore
 he chanced where merlin no enchantments shed
 but nature here unchanged by magic lore
 the fountain with such sovereign virtue fed
 that all who tasted loved whence many sore
 lamenting their mistake were illbested
 rinaldo wandered to this water's brink
 but sated had no further wish to drink

 yet the delicious trees and banks produce
 desire to try the grateful shade and needing
 repose he 'lights and turns his courser loose
 who roam'd the forest at his pleasure feeding
 and there rinaldo cast him down at truce
 with care and slumber to repose succeeding
 thus slept supine when spiteful fortune brought
 her* to the spot whom least the warrior sought

 * angelica

 she thirsts and lightly leaping from her steed
 ties the gay palfrey to the lofty pine
 then plucking from the stream a little reed
 sips as a man might savour muscat wine
 and feels while yet she drinks such marvel breed
 the waters fraught with properties divine
 she is no longer what she was before
 and next beholds the sleeper on the shore

 enamoured of the slumbering knight she hesitates long between
 love and shame but at length no longer mistress of herself
 pulls a handful of flowers and flings them in his face the
 gallantry is lost upon rinaldo who wakes and flies from her with
 loathing she pursues and entreats his compassion in vain and
 at length wearied with the chace sinks down upon the turf and
 weeps herself asleep ferrau now arrives in the forest in the
 hope of finding angelica or wreaking his vengeance upon her
 brother occupied with these thoughts he lights upon argalia who
 having followed his sister had dismounted and was also sleeping
 under a tree ferrau unties the sleeper's horse and drives him
 into the thicket his adversary's means of escape thus
 intercepted he watches till the sleeping man should wake nor is
 his patience put to a long trial argalia soon opens his eyes and
 is in great distress at finding his horse gone but ferrau who is
 as quickly on his feet tells him not to think of his loss as one
 of them must not quit the place alive and his own horse will
 remain the prize of the survivor

 the two warriors now again engage in battle and closing ferrau
 through a chink in his armour strikes argalia to the heart
 argalia sinks beneath the blow and dying entreats his adversary
 to have regard to his honor and cast him and his armour into the
 river that his memory may not be disgraced by the knowledge of
 his having been vanquished in enchanted arms ferrau who
 compassionates his fate promises compliance with the reservation
 of wearing his helmet till he can provide himself with another
 argalia consents by a sign and soon after expires

 ferrau who had waited by him till he drew his last sigh now puts
 on the helmet which he had previously taken from his wounded
 adversary's head in order to give him air and having razed off
 the crest places it upon his own he then with the dead body
 under his arm having remounted his horse proceeds sadly towards
 the neighbouring river into which he casts argalia all armed as
 he was conformably to his dying request he then pursues his
 melancholy way through the wood

 this while orlando had arrived on this theatre of adventures and
 comes suddenly upon angelica who is described as sleeping in act
 so exquisitely graceful that he gazes on the vision in stupid
 wonderment and at last to contemplate her more closely throws
 himself down by her side

 ferrau arrives at this juncture and supposing orlando whom he
 had not recognized to be angelica's guard insults and defies
 him the paladin starts up and declares himself when ferrau
 though somewhat surprized making a virtue of necessity stands to
 his arms a desperate duel follows during this angelica wakes and
 flies orlando proposes a truce to his adversary that he may
 follow her but ferrau whose courage was now up tells him she
 shall be the prize of the conqueror and refuses the battle is
 therefore renewed with more fury than before the author here
 exclaims�

 gifted with odd half lights i often wonder
 how i should think of love if well or ill
 for whether 'tis a thing above or under
 the rule of reason foils my little skill
 if we go guided by some god or blunder
 into the snare which warps our better will
 if we by line and rule our actions measure
 and 'tis a thing we take or leave at pleasure

 when we behold two bulls each other tear
 a cow the cause of strife with mutual wound
 it looks as if such foolish fury were
 in nature and controlling instinct found
 but when we see that absence prudence care
 and occupation can preserve us sound
 from such a charm or if you will infection
 love seems to be the fruit of pure election

 of this so many men have sung and told
 in hebrew latin and in heathen greek
 in egypt athens and in rome of old
 who govern'd by such different judgments speak
 that i can ill decide with whom to hold
 and cannot waste my time the truth to seek
 let it suffice that love's a wayward god
 and so heav'n keep us from the tyrant's rod

 the truth of these reflections the author considers as strikingly
 exemplified by the combat between the champions which is
 interrupted by the appearance of a strange damsel upon a panting
 palfrey who clamours eagerly for ferrau she perceiving him
 entreats orlando to forbear his blows which he immediately does
 upon the damsel's request addressing herself to the paynim she
 informs him that she is his relation flordespina and dispatched
 in search of him to say that gradasso king of sericane a fiend
 incarnate has invaded the spanish dominions that king falsiron
 is taken valencia ravaged arragon destroyed and barcelona
 besieged that poor marsilius is broken down by so many
 calamities and that his last hopes rest on him in pursuit of
 whom she was wandering ferrau balances for a moment between love
 and duty but at length determines to suspend his combat with the
 permission of orlando who agrees to the proposal and who himself
 follows angelica ferrau on the other hand departs with
 flordespina for spain the author here leaves each to pursue his
 separate quest and returns to charles this monarch calls a
 council in consequence of intelligence received which was similar
 to that brought by flordespina to ferrau he observes in this
 council that marsilius is his neighbour and relation and is yet
 more entitled to succour from a consideration of common danger
 and in consequence with the consent of his peers dispatches
 rinaldo with a great charge of men at arms against gradasso who
 had crossed the streights of gibraltar into spain he at the same
 time constitutes rinaldo lieutenant of his southern provinces who
 departs for the seat of war and all the knights present at the
 tournament assemble under his banner his coming as well as that
 of ferrau now arrived is highly gratifying to marsilius who
 had sheltered himself in gerona the greatest part of spain as
 stated had been already sacked and all the spanish warriors
 with the exception of ferrau who had returned to the defence of
 their country were killed or prisoners even the giantking
 grandonio who we lately saw braving charlemagne and all his
 peerage had sought refuge in barcelona marsilius on the arrival
 of the french succours now marches to his relief the banners of
 the allied army are no sooner distinguished by gradasso where he
 lay camped and served by giantkings than he issues extravagant
 orders to his various vassals four of these he dispatches with
 their followers against barcelona with orders not leave a soul
 alive in that city with the exception of grandonio whom he
 wishes as he says to take alive that he may bait him with his
 dogs others are sent forth with orders to take or destroy the
 most distinguished amongst the captains of the confederates this
 last command is given to faraldo king of arabia who is enjoined
 to bring him rinaldo and the banner of charlemagne which it
 seems was also one of the principal objects of his expedition

 the battle now rages in the field and within the city of
 barcelona in which the army of gradasso had previously made
 lodgements while the warfare within the town is still doubtful
 the bands dispatched against the confederates under rinaldo are
 after a long contest defeated and one of the surviving giantkings
 reports their discomfiture to gradasso who immediately arms
 and goes forth against the conquerors his first object of attack
 is rinaldo but bayardo startled by the appearance of the alfana
 a monstrous mare on which gradasso rode made a leap of twenty
 feet into the air and thus evaded the charge gradasso though
 somewhat surprized gallops on and unhorses many of the best
 amongst the confederates who are immediately taken and bound by
 alfrera one of his giantkings who serves him as a lacquey

 rinaldo now wheels bayardo round and spurs him at gradasso and
 both charge with such fury that the alfana and bayardo crumble
 under their riders who however preserve their seats gradasso
 who first recollects himself gives immediate orders to alfrera
 who was following him upon a camelopard to secure rinaldo and his
 horse and according to his practice himself follows up the
 pursuit of the confederates

 alfrera has however a more difficult task assigned him than
 gradasso had imagined for bayardo having regained his feet
 bears away his rider who was not yet himself the paladin
 however waking from his short stupor rides again in chase of
 gradasso himself pursued in vain by the giant alfrera

 rinaldo charges gradasso just as he has unhorsed his brother
 alardo and discharges a furious stroke upon his head gradasso
 repays the greeting in a way that would have ended the strife but
 for mambrino's helmet which saved the knight from any worse evil
 than a concussion of the brain while bayardo again galloped away
 with him in a state of half stupefaction recovering himself a
 second time and full of shame and fury he returns to seek
 gradasso and the combat is renewed with more equality than was
 promised by its commencement rinaldo counterbalancing the
 strength of his opposite by his own superior dexterity and the
 quickness and docility of bayardo the combatants are however
 separated and borne asunder by the tide of battle after
 different adventures they yet again meet when gradasso observing
 that rinaldo is surrounded by the troops of sericane courteously
 proposes that their duel should be deferred till the succeeding
 day to be fought under the following conditions by both
 combatants on foot "if rinaldo conquers he is to have back all
 the prisoners made by gradasso and if gradasso wins the day he
 is to have bayardo for his prize but is in either case to return
 home and never more set foot in europe" rinaldo willingly
 accedes to this and a place is fixed on near the sea for the
 combat to which both are to come with no other than defensive
 armour and their swords but the author while the barriers are
 preparing returns to angelica who being returned to india
 determines on setting malagigi at liberty and making him her
 mediator with the disdainful knight she accordingly frees him
 from his dungeon unlocks his fetters with her own hand and bids
 him in return to unloosen her own she then returns him his book
 explains herself more precisely and promises him final liberty
 on condition of his bringing back rinaldo

 malagigi calls up a demon with the aid of his book mounts him and
 departs he is entertained during his journey with a relation of
 gradasso's enterprise by the devil who told him as the author
 observes "all that had chanced and indeed more which was so
 much the easier in that he lied" malagigi arrived at his
 destination finds rinaldo rejoiced to see him but immoveable on
 the subject of angelica and hence after many fruitless
 endeavours vanishes with a threat having reached a spot
 convenient for his incantations he opens his book calls up a
 legion of demons and from these selects draghinazzo and
 falsetta the latter is bid to take the appearance of one of king
 marsilius's heralds the coat of arms and battoon and thus
 equipped to inform gradasso that rinaldo expects to meet him at
 midday gradasso accepts the invitation and gifts the false
 herald with a cup

 the same devil again transformed comes now to rinaldo as if
 from gradasso but with a very different appearance he has a
 turban on his head wears a flowing robe and has rings in his
 ears instead of on his fingers his object is to remind rinaldo
 on the part of gradasso to meet him in the morning which had
 been the time previously stipulated thus each on the supposed
 invitation of the other prepares for a different appointment�
 rinaldo necessarily is first at the place but sees nothing but a

 small pinnace anchor'd by the shore

 he however immediately after descries a figure on the beach in
 the garb and guise of gradasso but which was in reality no
 other than one of the fiends draghinazzo evoked by malagigi and
 thus transmogrified the combat immediately begins and rinaldo
 after some blows given and taken making a desperate twohanded
 stroke at the supposed gradasso buries his sword fusberta in the
 sand the devil avails himself of the opportunity to escape flies
 to the boat and is putting off rinaldo however follows him
 into his barque and deals a blow at him but the demon leaps from
 prow to poop

 rinaldo chas'd him back from poop to prow
 the sword fusberta flaming in his hand
 but he from side to side from stern to bow
 flits while the barque is drifting from the land
 rinaldo marks it not who thought but how
 to reach the foe with his avenging brand
 nor from his long daydream of vengeance woke
 till the false fiend was melted into smoke

 yet the paladin will not give over his hopes of finding him and
 renews a fruitless search above and below in the meantime the
 barque is seven miles from shore and rinaldo observes too late
 that she is scudding selfsteered before the wind

 the vessel at length takes the ground near a beautiful garden and
 rinaldo lands in front of a palace worthy of its grounds�here
 says the author i leave him with less compunction as he is in
 good quarters and proceed in pursuit of orlando who having
 wandered as far as the tanais in search of angelica meets an old
 man weeping the loss of his son who had been taken prisoner by a
 giant the paladin delivers the youth and the old man in
 gratitude presents him with a book which is capable he says of
 resolving the questions of any one who consults it instructed by
 this book he seeks a sphynx who appears to have been a yet
 better resolver of doubts in order to obtain information of the
 dwellingplace of angelica the monster tells him that this is in
 albracca of catay in the meantime the sphinx has her question for
 the interrogator which it is death not to interpret and plies
 orlando with the riddle solved by �dipus orlando with intent to
 cut the knot which he cannot untie draws durindana attacks the
 monster sword in hand and at length slays and tumbles her from
 the rock on which she made her abode he has now leisure to look
 in his book for the solution of the sphynx's enigma and finds
 that her question of "what animal begins his career upon four
 legs after a time continues it on two and ends it upon three"
 means man designating thus the child who crawls the man who
 walks and the old man who supports himself with a stick having
 cleared up this point he pursues his way still poring upon the
 book and soon arrives at a river dark deep and dangerous whose
 precipitous banks afford no means of passage orlando rides along
 the shore till he comes to a bridge where he dismounts this is
 kept by a giant who tells him that _he_ who arrives at that
 bridge which is justly named the bridge of death has little
 while to live for that all the roads which lead from it wind back
 to that fatal water into which either he or orlando must soon be
 plunged never to rise again orlando however who seems little
 impressed by this warning springs upon the bridge and attacks
 him a desperate combat now ensues but with the usual issue the
 giant is slain he however in falling springs a clapnet of
 iron which closing on the paladin beats his sword out of his
 hand and envelopes him in its folds

 as he lies helpless in this trap a friar arrives who after vain
 attempts to release him offers him spiritual consolation which
 is ill received but the friar having the sinner at his mercy
 continues to inculcate it and in illustration of the powers of a
 protecting providence informs him of a late miraculous escape of
 his own he was travelling with certain of his brothers when they
 were surprised by a horrible cyclops who made a feast on one of
 his companions but cast him from a rock as worthless carrion
 when he luckily lighted amongst the branches of a tree where he
 lay concealed till evening and then effected his escape he is
 yet engaged in his narration when he breaks off with a scream and
 flies

 his sudden terror was produced by the sight of the very cyclops of
 whom he spoke who came armed with a club and three darts he
 however instead of pursuing the friar stops to consider orlando
 he then takes up durindana which lies near and hews the chainnet
 in pieces without injury to the count whose skin was
 enchanted orlando instantly starts up his bones aching with the
 blows which had not been able to penetrate his flesh and seizing
 the giant's club they having thus exchanged weapons engage in a
 desperate and equal combat for if orlando's skin was
 invulnerable the giant's armour which was made of griffins'
 claws was equally impenetrable at length orlando bethinks him of
 the three shafts which the giant had laid down as well as his
 club when he possessed himself of durindana

 seizing these and launching one of them at his single eye it
 penetrates his brain and stretches him dead at this juncture the
 friar who yet trembles with fear as well as joy reappears and
 entreats orlando to accompany him towards the dead cyclops' den
 for the purpose of liberating his companions

 this done orlando rides on when arriving at a place where many
 roads cross he meets a courier and asking him news learns that
 he is dispatched by angelica to solicit the aid of sacripant
 king of circassia in favour of her father galaphron besieged by
 agrican emperor of tartary in albracca this agrican had been an
 unsuccessful suitor to the damsel whom he now pursues with arms
 orlando who learns that he is within a day's journey of albracca
 now thinks that he is secure of angelica and proceeds with
 rapture towards her seat

 thus journeying he arrives at a bridge which united two
 mountains and under which ran a foaming river here a damsel
 meets him with a goblet and informs him with much grace of
 demeanor that it is the usage of the bridge to present the
 traveller with a cup which she offers to orlando and which the
 paladin in courtesy drains he has however no sooner swallowed
 the julep which sparkles in it than his brain dances and he is
 no longer conscious of the object of his journey or even of his
 own existence under the influence of this fascination he follows
 the damsel into a magnificent and marvellous palace

 here the author leaves the count to return to gradasso who
 deceived by the false herald that appointed him to meet rinaldo
 upon the seashore at noon in vain expects his arrival he waits
 there till night when he retires full of indignation at the
 supposed cowardice of his opponent in the meantime ricciardetto
 who had been left by his brother rinaldo in charge of
 charlemagne's army on the paladin's departure for the false
 appointment according to the instructions he had received in case
 of his not returning in a given time withdraws charles's forces
 from marsilius's camp and returns to france

 gano immediately cries out upon rinaldo's treason and all is
 dismay on the other part marsilius thus deserted has no means
 of safety but in making peace with gradasso and consenting to
 hold spain as his liegeman in consequence of his so doing
 gradasso strengthened by the accession of marsilius with
 grandonio and his other vassal kings marches upon paris
 charlemagne with all his peerage sallies to encounter him but
 his army experiences a disastrous rout and he with almost all
 his paladins is captured while paris is immediately invested by
 the invaders

 gradasso however does not abuse his victory he takes charles by
 the hand seats him by his side and tells him he wars only for
 honour hence he renounces all conquests but insists on the
 monarch promising him bayardo and durindana both the property of
 his vassals the first of which as he maintained was already
 forfeited by the treason of rinaldo to this charlemagne and his
 peers in acknowledgment of their defeat were to remain his
 prisoners for a day bayardo who had been brought back by
 ricciardetto was to be forthwith delivered up and durindana
 consigned to gradasso in sericana upon the return of orlando to
 france to these terms charlemagne readily accedes and sends for
 the horse to paris

 here astolpho had assumed the command having obtained his
 freedom during the confusion which followed upon the rout of
 charlemagne's army and asserted an authority which in the
 absence of the other peers there was no one to dispute

 he receives with great indignation the messenger dispatched for
 bayardo and throws him into prison answering the embassy by a
 herald who says on the part of astolpho "that charles has no
 right in the steed but that gradasso may come and fight for him
 in which case he will meet him in the field"

 the next day the two knights encounter having previously
 established the conditions of their combat the enchanted lance
 performs a new wonder and gradasso the terrible gradasso is
 unhorsed

 according to their previous agreement gradasso is to give up his
 prisoners and return to his kingdom of sericana astolpho
 however begs him not to spoil a jest which he wishes to put upon
 charlemagne and his paladins by making them believe that the
 issue of the duel had been different from what it was and that
 they therefore in consequence of the first proffer of gradasso
 not having been acceded to were still the prisoners of that
 sovereign when astolpho has sufficiently bantered both king
 count and bishop for turpin was amongst the captives and one of
 the objects of his raillery he falls upon his knees begs pardon
 of charles for his irreverence and observes that as he is ill
 looked upon in his court he will leave the field to gano and set
 out on the morrow in search of his cousins orlando and rinaldo
 having said this charles and his peers are freed and gano is
 getting into his saddle when he is brought back by astolpho who
 observes that he only gives him his liberty since the disposal
 of all is at his option on condition of his swearing before
 charles to constitute himself his prisoner for four days
 whenever he should enjoin it charles undertakes for his
 compliance with such a requisition and seeks to detain astolpho
 with the bribe of ireland but the duke is inflexible and
 departs gradasso also returns into sericana

 the author now returns to rinaldo who was landed by the selfpiloted
 boat in what was it seems denominated _the joyous
 garden_ he is scarcely disembarked before a lady appears who
 takes him by the hand and conducts him into a palace where he is
 served by attendant damsels with every sort of luxury and
 magnificence at last the chief of the servants tells him that
 all this is his which he surveys being the present of a lady
 who to have his love has brought him out of spain while rinaldo
 stands lost in astonishment the name of angelica who is
 proclaimed by this man to be the mistress of the palace breaks
 the charm and he flies in fury through the garden till arriving
 at the landingplace he leaps again into his pinnace the bark
 however remains immoveable and he is about to cast himself into
 the sea in despair when it darts from the shore and traverses the
 waves

 arrived on the banks of a wellwooded country it again takes the
 land and rinaldo disembarking encounters a hoary and aged man
 upon the beach who has a melancholy story for the paladin of a
 ravisher who had that moment carried away his daughter pursuing
 the thief rinaldo falls into a pitfall and is carried away
 prisoner by a giant who bears him to a castle situated upon a
 promontory the walls of which were covered with maimed bodies and
 heads some of which yet quivered with the remains of life

 the giant entering the building casts rinaldo down before an old
 woman of stern and forbidding appearance who thus addresses him
 �

 "haply sir knight thou hast not heard display
 "our castle's use" exclaims the beldame old
 "in the short time thou hast to live�a day
 "is yet thine own�the story shall be told
 "then listen to the legend whilst thou may
 "and i the melancholy tale unfold
 "thou in that space may'st hear the tale of sorrow
 "and witness to its truth in blood tomorrow"

 she pursues her story* thus "know sir stranger that this castle
 was formerly held by a rich lord famous for his magnificence and
 hospitality and yet more so for the incomparable beauty of the
 lady whom he had to wife this castellan was hight gryphon his
 castle altaripa and stella was the name of his wife it was his
 favourite pleasure to disport himself in the greenwood near the
 shore where thou arrived'st this morning and roving one day
 through this he heard the huntinghorn of a stranger whom he
 invited to his castle the guest was marchino lord of aronda and
 my husband who was so smitten by the beauty of stella that he
 could not rest till he had made her his own he however
 dissembled his evil intentions and took a friendly leave of his
 entertainer this was only to return as a treacherous enemy he
 accordingly bearing some resemblance to gryphon counterfeited
 his ensigns and came back with a party of his retainers whom he
 concealed as well as those in the neighbouring wood he in the
 mean time pursued the chace unarmed gryphon again sought him
 out and finding him apparently distressed by the loss of a hound
 joined him in his search he was thus decoyed into the ambuscade
 and assassinated marchino having disposed of his rival entered
 altaripa under the disguise of gryphon's ensigns where he did not
 leave a soul alive with the exception of stella she while
 preserved by the conqueror brooded in secret over schemes of
 vengeance and after pondering some time determined to have
 recourse to that animal whose wrath is the most intolerable
 namely the wife who has been once loved and after slighted for
 another this was no other than myself and the cruelties which i
 perpetrated well justified her expectation two children whom i
 had by marchino i killed and quartered�think upon this yet
 know that i still triumph in the recollection of my vengeance
 their heads only i preserved the remainder i cooked and served
 up to the wretched father for his supper this done i departed
 secretly for the court of the king of orgagna who had long been a
 wooer to me without success him i stirred up to vengeance
 against marchino and brought in arms against his newlyacquired
 castle of altaripa

 * i have thought it the duty of a translator to preserve this
 story but i would say to my readers in the words of ariosto�

 lasciate questo canto che senz' esso
 pu� star l'istoria e non sar� men' chiara
 mettendolo turpino anch' io l'ho messo

 leave out this canto since the tale will tell
 without it and the story is as clear
 which told by turpin i relate as well

 while i was gone on this errand stella with dishevelled hair a
 smile upon her lips but bitterness in her heart presented
 herself before the murderer of her husband with the heads of his
 two children in a charger and disclosed to him the horrid
 tragedy at which he had been an unwitting assistant the traitor
 hesitated for a moment as if suspended between the desire of lust
 and vengeance and then slew the lady and satiated both nay as
 if in outrage of god and man pursued his impious loves with the
 body till i returned with the king of orgagna

 after a desperate resistance we possessed ourselves of altaripa
 and marchino having been made prisoner perished in such tortures
 as he had deserved

 the king of orgagna now departed leaving me mistress of the
 conquered castle with three giants for my defence having first
 buried the unfortunate stella together with the body of gryphon
 which had been left exposed and subjected to outrage by the
 barbarous marchino

 more than eight months had now passed when a horrid cry was heard
 from the marble sepulchre in which gryphon and stella were laid
 and we fled in dismay from the sound only one of my giants more
 daring than his fellows approached the tomb and lifted the lid
 when a monster thrust forth its claw and having dragged him into
 the grave devoured him alive we immediately walled up the space
 about the monument as a protection against its attacks and the
 monster having made its way out of the sepulchre remains thus
 enclosed between the defences which we have constructed but such
 is his rage and craving for human flesh that we supply him with
 this lest he should tear down the wall in his fury hence the
 usage of this castle which is to seize on all strangers in order
 to provide him with food the quarters which you see exposed on
 the walls are the leavings of the beast for though the custom
 sprung out of necessity my heart is become hardened with cruelty
 and i now live for no other pleasure"

 rinaldo hears the hag with stern composure and desires no other
 favour than that of being exposed to the monster clad in armour
 as he is and with fusberta in his hand this the beldam grants
 with a bitter smile of mockery and the night closes upon him in
 his dungeon

 the succeeding morning he is lowered down from the wall into the
 space tenanted by the beast the horrible fruit of marchino's
 intercourse with the body of stella a desperate combat now
 ensues rinaldo being unable to make any impression on the scales
 of the monster while he on the contrary shears away plate and
 mail from the paladin while he is engaged in this hopeless
 struggle the beast seizes fusberta with his teeth and disarms
 rinaldo who is left without defence

 the author here leaves him as he says to speak of a spirit
 hardly less afflicted though in another manner he means
 angelica who expects in trembling the effect of malagigi's
 attempt he arrives and states his failure but would comfort the
 damsel with the thoughts of vengeance relating to what a perilous
 pass he had brought the miserable rinaldo for it was by his
 stratagem that he was conveyed to altaripa she however is in
 despair at his danger and overwhelms malagigi with repoaches he
 tells her it is not yet too late to save him and furnishes her
 with the means these are a rope with a noose at the distance of
 every palm a cake of wax and a file furnished with these
 implements and instructed by malagigi in the use of them
 angelica flies through the air to the succour of rinaldo

 the miserable paladin had in the mean time sprang upon a beam
 which projected from the wall and thus remained hanging between
 heaven and earth with little hope even of present safety since
 the monster continually leapt at him and often all but reached
 him with his claws it was now evening when rinaldo was surprised
 by the shadow of a woman and soon after by the sight of angelica
 kneeling before him selfsuspended in air she reproaches herself
 for having brought him into this peril and opening her arms
 entreats him to take refuge in them and escape such however
 are the effects of the fountain of hate that rinaldo spurns at
 the proposal and vows if she does not immediately depart he will
 cast himself down from the beam after long and fruitless efforts
 to move him she at length descends throws her cake of wax to the
 monster and immediately flings her rope knotted with nooses
 before him the beast who takes the bait finding his teeth glued
 together by the wax vents his fury in bounds and leaping into
 one of the snares is noosed by angelica who leaves him thus
 entangled and departs

 though the monster is delivered over to him gagged and bound so
 invulnerable is his hide that rinaldo makes long and fruitless
 efforts to destroy him till at length leaping upon his neck he
 squeezes his eyes out of their sockets and the beast expires
 under the gripe

 another difficulty yet remained to be overcome the walls were of
 immense height and the only opening in them was a grated window
 of such strength that fusberta was unable to separate the bars in
 his distress however rinaldo perceived the file which had been
 left by angelica on the ground and with the help of this
 effected his deliverance

 he is immediately discovered and surrounded but he charges and
 slays his pursuers and the beldam having witnessed the
 destruction of her followers throws herself headlong from a
 balcony of three hundred feet in height

 departing hence rinaldo returns to the seaside but unwilling to
 trust himself again to the bark pursues his way along the shore

 the author now returns to astolpho who had set out in search of
 his cousins orlando and rinaldo splendidly dressed and equipt
 as was his use and mounted on bayardo in the intention of
 returning him to his lord having arrived in circassia he finds
 there a great army encamped under the command of sacripant the
 king of that country who was leading it to the defence of
 galaphron the father of angelica astolpho visits the camp of
 this faithful but illrequited lover of the princess and not
 having the leopard on his buckler which was of gold is known
 through the circassian army as the knight of the golden shield
 sacripant much struck by the appearance of astolpho and his
 horse accosts him affably and

 demands how his assistance may be bought
 and bids him make his price of service known
 "�with gift of this fair host whom thou hast brought
 "to war in indian fields from tower and town"
 the british duke replies "with this or nought�
 "leave me or make me at this price thine own
 "nor will i serve sir king for other pay
 "born to command unweeting to obey"

 this with other more extravagant speeches leads the circassian
 captains to consider him as a madman and astolpho is left to
 pursue his journey king sacripant however has been too much
 struck with the appearance of his horse and armour to part with
 him so easily and having divested himself of his kingly
 ornaments he determines to pursue him

 astolpho was in the meantime advanced a day's journey upon his
 road when he was overtaken by a strange warrior

 the stranger knight was named sir brandimart
 lord of the sylvan tower and its domain
 through paynim countries and in every part
 bruited for glorious feats by hill and plain
 well versed in tilt and tourney's valiant art
 in his appearance graceful and humane
 courteous with that and over and above
 his other virtues famed for constant love

 a gentle damsel had the knight for guide
 who with astolpho bold encountered there
 blooming in early youth and beauty's pride
 and in his faithful eyes as dear as fair
 him from afar the british duke* defied
 and proudly bade him for the joust prepare
 and wheel and take his ground and guard his right
 "or leave his lady love a prize to better knight"

 * astolpho

 brandimart is as ready for battle as astolpho but observes as
 the latter has no lady he may wager his horse as it was but fair
 that each should deposit his stake the proposal is acceded to
 and the knights encounter brandimart is unhorsed and his steed
 falls dead while bayardo remains uninjured by the shock

 the paynim knight observing the disconsolate looks of the damsel
 is so overwhelmed with despair that he draws his sword and is
 about to plunge it into his own bosom astolpho however holds
 his hand and exclaims that he contended but for glory and having
 won the honours of the fight was contented to leave him the lady

 while brandimart is vowing eternal service and gratitude king
 sacripant arrives and now longing for the damsel of the one as
 well as the steed and arms of the other defies them to the joust
 astolpho as mounted meets the challenger whom he instantly
 overthrows and presents brandimart with his courser leaving the
 king to return to his army on foot this disposition is scarcely
 made when brandimart's damsel changes colour and tells them they
 are approaching the waters of oblivion and advises them either to
 turn back or to change their direction both refuse and pursuing
 their path arrive at the bridge where orlando was left

 the damsel as before appears with the enchanted chalice which
 is rejected by astolpho with contumely she immediately dashes it
 to the ground and a fire blazes up which renders the bridge
 impassable upon this the damsel who accompanied them seizes
 each by the hand runs with them along the river and brings them
 to another secret and narrow bridge which they cross in safety
 and find themselves beside the enchanted garden

 brandimart instantly batters down the gate and the two warriors
 entering are attacked by sundry knights known and unknown who
 having no recollection of any thing join blindly in the defence
 of their prisonhouse while these are engaged by brandimart
 astolpho entering the garden and pursuing his career meets with
 orlando who being like the rest mindless of kindred or of
 country makes at the english duke who only escapes by the
 activity of bayardo he clears the wall and bears off his rider

 the author pauses to tell us that the enchanted water signifies
 the affection impression or opinion which man takes from others
 either at sight or upon trust and the cup which the damsel lets
 fall is that which gives its colouring to the thing seen

 bayardo this time continues to gain upon orlando's horse and
 while astolpho is thus born out of danger brandimart is overlaid
 with fearful odds in the enchanted garden and his lady trembling
 for the issue of the battle entreats him to yield to necessity
 and comply with the usage of the fairy so saying she flies and
 brandimart obeying her commands yields and drinking of the cup
 becomes as intoxicated as the rest

 orlando returns from the fruitless pursuit of astolpho and
 excuses himself to the fairy who was named dragontina for not
 having been able to overtake her enemy who pursues his way to
 albracca which agrican is about to besiege here he is welcomed
 kindly by angelica though she is somewhat outraged by his
 rhodomontades he is not long before he attempts to put them in
 practice for having one night ordered the drawbridge to be
 lowered he sallies out alone arrives in agrican's camp and
 unhorses his warriors right and left by means of the enchanted
 lance being however surrounded and taken his capture spreads
 consternation among the besieged and the author says that no one
 dared sally from the city

 relief was however at hand for as the burghers and soldiers
 are one day leaning over their walls they descry a cloud of
 dust from which horsemen are seen to prick forth as it rolls on
 towards the camp of the besiegers which lay between the town and
 the new army that was approaching

 this turns out to be the army of sacripant which arriving the
 morning after the capture of astolpho attacks that of agrican
 with the view of cutting a passage through his camp into the
 besieged city agrican however mounted on bayardo taken from
 astolpho but not armed with the lance of gold with the virtues
 of which he appears to have been unacquainted performs prodigies
 and rallies his scattered troops which had given way to the
 sudden and unexpected assault sacripant on the other hand
 encourages his own by the most desperate acts of valour and as
 an additional incentive to his courage sends a messenger to
 angelica entreating that she will appear upon the walls she not
 only complies with this invitation but sends him a sword as an
 earnest of her favour

 she arrives in time to see a single combat between the two
 leaders agrican and sacripant in this however her defender
 appears to be rather overmatched when the circassians break the
 ring and separate the two combatants who are borne asunder by
 the crowd sacripant who was severely wounded profits by the
 occasion and escapes into albracca where he is put to bed and
 carefully attended

 the duel is an omen of the event of the battle and the
 circassians who had at first penetrated within their enemies'
 lines are now routed and fly in confusion towards the town
 angelica orders the drawbridge to be lowered and the gates to be
 thrown open to the fugitives with these agrican who was not
 distinguished in the hurlyburly enters the place pell mell
 driving both circassians and catayans before him and the
 portcullis is instantly dropt

 thus shut into the besieged city the tartar king continues the
 chase regardless of his retreat being intercepted and deluges
 the streets with blood sacripant hearing the tumult and
 learning the cause leaps from bed naked and wounded as he was
 and armed only with his sword and shield opposes himself to his
 fury his example and his reproaches take effect her allies the
 flyers and fresh forces coming to his assistance and pouring in
 upon agrican from all sides the tartar king slowly and
 reluctantly retreats

 the author here suspends this story to speak of rinaldo whom we
 left issuing from the castle of altaripa and pursuing his way
 along the beach here he meets with a weeping damsel who being
 questioned as to the cause of her sorrow tells him she wanders
 upon a hopeless quest and is in search of one who will do battle
 with nine knights amongst whom is orlando this is the lady loved
 of brandimart to whom rinaldo promises his assistance trusting
 to accomplish the adventure either by valour or by skill the
 author here pauses from his narrative and exclaims

 to the grim winter and the dismal night
 succeed the balmy spring and cheerful day
 that battle had so fill'd me with affright
 that i was all confusion and dismay
 but now the strife is over and 'tis light
 of ladies and of love shall be my lay
 and i will piece my broken tale and tell
 what good rinaldo and the maid befell

 the damsel on their setting out together on the adventure
 insists upon rinaldo's taking her horse this he refuses and a
 contest of courtesy follows which is ended by rinaldo's accepting
 the palfrey on condition of her mounting upon the croup this she
 does in some fear for her honour but finding the cavalier cold
 and silent at last proposes to beguile the way with a story to
 this he consents and she begins her narration as follows

 "there lived of late in babylon a cavalier called iroldo who
 had for his wife a lady named tisbina to whom he was passionately
 attached near them dwelt a babylonian gentleman named prasildo
 rich gay courteous and valiant who making one of a party of
 both sexes in a garden where a game was played which admitted
 familiarities between them fell desperately in love with tisbina
 whom he vainly solicited by every kind of gallantry and
 magnificence

 "all his efforts were however unavailing and disappointed in his
 hope he fell into a state of melancholy which rendered life
 intolerable one only occupation seemed to afford him some little
 relief this was to brood over his sorrows in a wood situated at
 a small distance from babylon

 "as he here one day indulged his grief and it grew by
 indulgence he fell into such a fit of passion that he
 determined after a broken soliloquy to slay himself and die with
 the name of tisbina on his lips by a strange accident his
 intention was overheard by iroldo and tisbina herself who were
 walking together in the wood they were both moved to compassion
 and iroldo insisted upon tisbina's offering some consolation to
 the despairing lover

 "her husband leaving her that she may execute this purpose she
 comes upon him as if by accident pretends that though modesty
 has hitherto restrained her she has not been insensible to his
 tenderness and assures him that if he will give her an
 indubitable proof of his devotion in undertaking an adventure
 which she has at heart she will reward him with the possession of
 her person

 "she then tells him that beyond the woods of barbary there is a
 garden which is surrounded by an iron wall to be entered through
 four gates these are respectively called the gate of life of
 death of riches and of poverty

 "in the centre she said was a tree whose top was an arrow's
 flight from the ground with leaves of emerald and golden fruit
 of this tree she required a branch and again renewed her
 assurance of the price which she would pay for the acquisition
 prasildo joyfully promised it and would have promised sun moon
 and stars as easily as the achievement of the adventure upon
 which he immediately departs

 "the lady it appears dispatched him to the garden of medusa*
 for so it was called that he might find a cure for his love in
 absence and in travel or if he reached the spot might find
 there a yet surer remedy for his distemper for the sight of
 medusa who was to be found standing under the wonderful tree
 occasioned every one to forget the errand he came on and if he
 had any speech with the dame his very name and self

 * designed i suppose as the type of conscience as one "whose
 sight would make him forget the errand on which he came" &c

 "prasildo departing on this forlorn enterprise traversed egypt
 and arriving near the mountains of barca encounters an old man
 to whom he relates the object of his expedition

 "the old man assures him that fortune could not have directed him
 to a better counsellor and immediately furnishes him with his
 instructions

 "he begins by telling him that the gates of life and of death are
 never used as entrances to the enchanted enclosure and that it is
 only through the gate of poverty that man can penetrate into the
 garden of medusa he next informs him that medusa herself guards
 the marvellous tree whose appearance deprives whoever sets eyes
 on her of his memory but that she is to be terrified into flight
 by the reflection of her own face

 "he therefore counsels prasildo to provide himself with a shield
 of lookingglass being in other respects naked for such
 appearance is a fitting guise for entering the gate of poverty
 this he observes is the most terrible and the most severely
 guarded of all being watched by misery and shame cold hunger
 melancholy and scorn "there" said he "is to be seen roguery
 stretched upon the ground and covered with itch and in strange
 union industry and laziness compassion and desperation

 "having succeeded in the enterprise and torn off a branch of the
 tree you will seek the opposite gate" he pursues "by which you
 are to retreat and will there find wealth seated and on the
 watch here you are to make an offering of a portion of the
 branch that avarice who plays the porter may open to you
 quickly a wretch who asks the more the more you give here too
 you will see pomp and honour flattery and hospitality ambition
 grandeur and favour then inquietude and torment jealousy
 suspicion fear solicitude and terror behind the door stand
 hate and envy with a bow for ever bent"

 "prasildo having received his full instructions now crosses the
 desert and after thirty days' journey arrives at the garden
 here he easily passes the gate of poverty the entry of which no
 one defends on the contrary there ever stands some one near it
 to encourage and invite

 "having entered the inclosure he advances holding his shield of
 glass before his eyes and reaching the tree against which medusa
 was leaning the fairy who raises her head at his approach and
 beholds herself in the mirror takes to flight scared it seems
 by seeing reflected in it the head of a serpent though in other
 eyes her beauty is divine* prasildo hearing the fairy fly
 uncovers his eyes which were before protected by his shield and
 leaving her to escape goes directly to the tree from which he
 severs a branch then pursuing the directions received makes for
 the opposite gate where he sees wealth surrounded by her
 followers this gate which is of loadstone never opens without
 noise and is for the most part shut fatigue and fraud are the
 guides who conduct to it it is however sometimes open but
 requires both luck and courage to enable any one to profit by the
 chance it was open the day prasildo came and he made the
 offering of half the bough as he was instructed and escaped with
 the remainder of his prize

 * the circumstance of medusa not being able to contemplate the
 reflection of her own hideous appearance though beautiful in the
 sight of others the fact of no one being able to win the golden
 bough which she kept but by refraining from looking her in the
 face and other circumstances confirm the conjecture which i have
 hazarded in a preceding note

 "transported with pleasure he issues from the garden passes
 through nubia crosses the arabian gulf with a fair wind and
 journeys day and night till he arrives in babylon

 "arrived there he sends immediate news of his success to tisbina
 who is in an agony at learning the unexpected result of her
 device iroldo is rendered equally miserable but insists upon the
 necessity of her redeeming her promise though he knows he cannot
 survive its execution she feels that she can as ill survive
 iroldo and they at last resolve that faith must be kept with
 prasildo and that they will both die they accordingly send to an
 aged apothecary for a deadly draught which they divide between
 them and each having swallowed a due portion iroldo covers his
 face and throws himself on his bed while the yet more miserable
 tisbina proceeds to the residence of prasildo here she attempts
 to dissemble her sorrow and to feign a cheerfulness foreign to
 her heart but prasildo detects the imposture and at last extorts
 a full confession of the truth this declared he reproaches her
 as having little faith in his generosity with a bursting heart
 renounces the proffered happiness and dismisses her with an
 affectionate kiss

 "tisbina who had assured him that if she had known him first she
 should have loved him as devotedly as she did her husband now
 departs overflowing with gratitude and returns to iroldo who was
 still unaffected by the draught but prostrate on the bed she
 relates to him the sacrifice of her lover the husband springs
 from his couch thanks god for this last mercy and invokes every
 blessing upon the head of prasildo while he is yet praying he
 sees the countenance of tisbina change who sinks as if overcome
 by sleep the husband sees the operation of the drink with horror
 and is transported from his short fit of pleasure to a state of
 the most agonizing despair

 "the situation of prasildo is scarcely less intolerable who
 locked himself up in his chamber in order to indulge his grief in
 solitude upon the departure of tisbina while he is shut up in
 darkness the ancient apothecary calls and tells his valet that
 prasildo's life depends upon his immediate admission to him the
 valet was a native of casazzo of a merry humour and full of faith
 and attachment diligent active and experienced in all his
 duties but of a frankness which sometimes gave his master
 offence this man having a masterkey admits the apothecary who
 excusing the intrusion by his zeal for prasildo's repose informs
 him that he had that morning furnished the chambermaid of tisbina
 with a potion by her mistress's order which he believed was
 destined for his destruction as tisbina had been shortly
 afterwards traced to his house but adds that he need be under no
 apprehension even if he has swallowed the draught since in the
 apprehension of mischief he had substituted a mere sleepingpotion
 the effects of which were only calculated to last for a
 few hours

 "prasildo transported with joy immediately flies in search of
 iroldo whose stronger constitution had as yet resisted the
 soporific and informs him of the joyful tidings of the
 apothecary iroldo receives the news in such a manner as might
 have been expected and concludes with making prasildo a return
 such as he had never looked for in a transport of gratitude he
 insists on his receiving tisbina and accordingly departs from
 babylon leaving her yet asleep on waking she is combated by
 opposing feelings but at length as the generosity of prasildo
 had made more impression on her heart than she was willing to
 confess even to herself yields to iroldo's will and takes
 prasildo for her husband"

 the damsel was yet speaking when a loud cry was heard which
 filled her with consternation rinaldo however reassuring her as
 he best could pressed forward through the wood for they were
 then in the centre of one towards the quarter from which it
 proceeded

 he soon perceived a giant standing under a vaulted cavern with a
 large club in his hand and of an appearance to have struck the
 boldest spirit with dread on each side of the cavern was chained
 a griffin who together with the giant were stationed there for
 the protection of the horse which was once argalia's

 this monster of enchantment was the creature
 for of a mare composed of spark and flame
 strange wonder and beyond the laws of nature
 made pregnant by the wind the courser came
 matchless in vigour speed and form and feature
 such was his birth and rabican his name
 who with his fellowsteeds disdain'd to share
 the proffer'd corn or grass and fed on air

 this marvellous horse being driven away by ferrau in the wood of
 arden previous to his fatal encounter with argalia who had
 possessed himself of him by enchantment on finding himself at
 liberty returned to his native cavern and was here stabled under
 the protection of the giant and the griffins towards these
 rinaldo advances with deliberate valour over ground whitened with
 the bones of their victims he is the first to smite at the giant
 but his stroke is rendered of no effect by the enchanted helmet of
 his adversary in a second blow he is more fortunate but his
 adversary though wounded near the heart escapes and looses his
 griffins one of these immediately seizes the giant by a foot
 rises with him into the sky hovers over rinaldo's head and at
 length drops his burden with intent to crush the intruder
 rinaldo however who was as remarkable for his activity as for
 his strength and courage shuns the descending mischief and the
 giant falls to the ground crushed without harm to the paladin in
 the meantime the other griffin having towered in air pounces
 upon rinaldo who watching his opportunity wounds her
 desperately in her descent she has however strength enough to
 soar a second flight and swooping upon rinaldo's helmet loosens
 its circle with her claws tear it she could not since this was
 the enchanted helmet which was once the headpiece of mambrino

 in this manner the griffin repeats her attacks and rinaldo fends
 and parries as he can while the damsel stands trembling near and
 witnesses the contest

 the battle still continued rendered more terrible by the approach
 of night when rinaldo fearing he should not be able to
 distinguish his enemy determined upon a desperate expedient in
 order to bring it to a conclusion he fell as if fainting from
 his wounds and on the close approach of the griffin dealt her a
 blow which sheared away one of her wings the beast though
 sinking griped him fast with her talons digging through plate
 and mail but rinaldo plied his sword in utter desperation and at
 last accomplished her destruction

 the damsel now entreats rinaldo to mount and proceed but he
 thinks the adventure ill accomplished and proceeds towards the
 entrance of the cavern this was secured by a door

 whose marble pannel a mosaic fill'd
 of pearl and emerald sown with care so nice
 that he who saw the piece if little skill'd
 might deem it was a treasure passing price
 in the midpicture lay a damsel kill'd
 and writ in golden letters the device
 this legend bore "let whoso passes plight
 "his word to 'venge my death and do me right

 "or he shall die the death but if he swear
 "to slay the traitor who my death design'd
 "the enchanted courser shall the warrior bear
 "a courser that is swifter than the wind"
 the prince stopt not to think but plighted there
 in solemn form his promise as enjoin'd
 his promise to avenge alive or dead
 the slaughter'd damsel's blood unjustly shed

 then enters and beholds the courser tied
 with chains of gold so famous for his speed
 with footcloth of white silk he was supplied
 and all things else convenient for his need
 tho' coalblack all the rest the tail was pied
 and starred with white the forehead of the steed
 and white one foot behind bayardo's might
 was more but this had pass'd a dart in flight

 rinaldo is delighted with his adventure and while surveying the
 steed beholds a book secured by a chain in which was written in
 blood the history of the damsel's death

 the book related that truffaldino king of baldacca had a count
 for his neighbour distinguished for his virtues and
 accomplishments whom that evilminded prince misliked on that
 very account his name was orisello and montefalcon was that of
 the castle where he resided this lord had a sister as
 distinguished for her merit called albarosa who loved polindo a
 noble knight of equal virtue and daring the castle was built upon
 a rock and so well fortified that truffaldino who had warred
 upon the count though he had made several assaults upon it had
 always been defeated in his attempts

 things being in this state polindo who had a great love for
 travel and often wandered from court to court arrived at that of
 truffaldino who for his own evil views shewed him great favour
 and having acquired his confidence promised him assistance in his
 designs upon albarosa as a means of forwarding these he presents
 him with a castle of pleasure situated a day's journey from
 montefalcon and polindo having persuaded albarosa to elope with
 him carries her thither but while they are supping together
 with infinite delight truffaldino who had entered the castle by
 a subterraneous passage unknown to its new possessor breaks in
 upon them with a party of his retainers and binds them both he
 then dictates a letter to the lady which he orders her to send to
 her brother orisello in order to decoy him into his hands she
 refuses when the tyrant puts her to the torture in the presence
 of polindo before whose eyes she expires refusing compliance
 with her latest breath

 rinaldo having read this dreadful history swears anew to avenge
 the treason and mounted upon rabican issues forth from the
 cavern he and the damsel however have not ridden far when the
 light fails them in a forest where they dismount secure their
 horses and compose themselves to rest

 beside the maid with zest rinaldo sleeps
 for him nor time nor place nor beauty move
 from whence we learn the antidote which keeps
 the heart and mind from that which is above
 all other cure that he who sows and reaps
 or tilts and tourneys never dies of love
 but in this book i am ill read nor can
 bolt as i would such matters to the bran

 and now the air on every side grew light
 though the sun shew'd not yet his golden ray
 with few and fading stars the sky was dight
 and the glad birds rang out their matin lay
 such was the season neither day nor night
 when the maid view'd rinaldo where he lay
 who from her grassy couch before had crept
 and watch'd the weary warrior as he slept

 of lively visage though composed to rest
 the lusty knight in early youth appear'd
 light in the flanks and large across the chest
 and on his lip scarce bloom'd the manly beard
 on him the damsel gazed with alter'd breast
 to her by newdiscovered gifts endear'd
 for slumber ever gives the sleeper's face
 i know not what of loveliness and grace

 while the damsel is engaged in contemplating the knight she is
 startled by a loud roar and turning sees a centaur with a live
 lion which he had just taken in one hand and a club and three
 darts in the other rinaldo is at the same time awakened by the
 sound and grasping his shield or rather the remnant of it which
 had been left by the griffin advances to her assistance

 the centaur now leaves his prey and flying to a little distance
 launches his darts at the paladin these he avoids by his agility
 when the monster returns and charges him with his club rinaldo
 thus pressed shelters himself by placing his back against a
 pine and maintains the combat with fusberta the centaur who had
 at first seemed to have the advantage in being able to curvet
 about the knight and threaten him behind and before finding
 himself deprived of this double means of annoyance leaves him
 and gallops after the damsel who had in the meantime seated
 herself upon her palfrey from this he snatches her in fury
 throws her on his own croup and flies with her through the
 forest

 rinaldo who is this while engaged in mounting rabican follows
 and such is the swiftness of his horse is almost immediately up
 with the beast who being overtaken on the brink of a rapid
 river casts his burden into the stream which carries it away
 rinaldo and the centaur again join in battle at first on the
 shore and afterwards in the water the paladin at length slays
 his savage opponent but having slain the monster is in doubt
 what course to pursue

 he at last determines to proceed in the adventure in which he had
 embarked being especially moved thereto by the hope of
 delivering orlando deprived then of the guidance of the poor
 damsel he resolves to steer the same northern course in which she
 had before directed him

 here however according to the author turpin leaves the story to
 return to albracca agrican was left there surrounded and alone
 in the midst of his enemies whilst he is thus reduced to the last
 extremities he is saved by the very circumstance which threatened
 him with destruction the soldiers of angelica closing upon him
 from all parts had deserted their defences and his own besieging
 army enter these pell mell in a part where the wall is
 accessible

 in this way was agrican rescued the city taken by storm and the
 miserable inhabitants put to the sword angelica however with
 some of the kings who were her defenders and amongst whom was
 truffaldino saved herself in the citadel which was planted upon
 a rock hither also came sacripant when all beside was lost

 but though the situation of the fortress rendered it impregnable
 it was scantily victualled and ill provided with other necessaries
 besides food under these circumstances angelica announced to
 those blockaded with her in the citadel her intention to go in
 quest of assistance and having plighted her promise to come back
 within a certain period set out with the enchanted ring upon her
 finger

 mounted on her palfrey the damsel passed through the enemies'
 camp at night without having occasion to avail herself of the
 talisman and by sunrise was many miles clear of their
 encampment

 she at length arrives near orgagna in circassia and here
 encounters an old man weeping bitterly who entreats her
 assistance on behalf of his only son who is dying of a fever the
 damsel who was well skilled in medicine promises succour turns
 her palfrey and accompanies the elder

 this old man was a traitor and his story a fiction formed for
 the purpose of getting her into his hands he was it seems
 employed to inveigle and capture damsels for the king of orgagna
 and for this purpose brought those who followed him to a tower
 built over a river which served him as a dungeon for his
 prisoners angelica following him thither the door closed upon
 her and she found herself a captive with many other dames and
 damsels amongst these was flordelis the lady of brandimart who
 when cast into the river by the centaur had drifted with the
 current and was taken up more dead than alive by the wicked
 elder she now relates her adventures to angelica and tells her
 how she was going accompanied by rinaldo to the garden of
 dragontina where orlando brandimart and many other valiant
 knights were enchanted by that fairy

 angelica treasures up their history in her mind as useful to the
 purpose which she had in hand and on the door of the tower
 opening to admit a new victim slips the ring into her mouth and
 escapes

 being again at liberty she sets out for the garden of dragontina
 and entering it unseen disenchants orlando brandimart and the
 rest by a touch of her talisman these she conjures to assist her
 in the recovery of her kingdom and all depart together for
 albracca

 in the meantime a revolution had taken place in the citadel of
 that metropolis truffaldino always false had surprised
 sacripant and the other wounded princes in their beds and cast
 them into prison this done he sent a messenger to agrican with
 an offer to deliver the fortress into his hands agrican however
 received the proposal in a manner little expected by truffaldino
 whom he reviled as a traitor and a coward declared that he would
 never be indebted to fraud for that which he could have by force
 said he knew the extremities of the garrison which must soon be
 his and declared that as soon as the place was in his
 possession he would hang up truffaldino by the heels

 soon after this orlando with his friendly squadron of knights
 nine in number with angelica in the midst of them arrives
 before albracca and charging through the camp of agrican arrives
 at the foot of the citadel this is however kept against them by
 truffaldino who appears upon the walls and declares that he will
 only admit orlando and his followers on their swearing to protect
 him for ever from the vengeance of sacripant and the others whom
 for his own safety he has been under the necessity of casting
 into prison orlando indignantly refuses but conjured by
 angelica consents as do the others who accompany him and after
 the oath has been taken as enjoined the squadron enters the
 fortress

 this however is found so destitute of food that a sally is
 resolved upon for the purpose of provisioning it it is to be made
 by orlando brandimart adrian clarion and uberto of the lion
 while gryphon and aquilant remain at home for the protection of
 angelica and the citadel

 orlando and his friends having made the warder lower his
 drawbridge ride boldly towards the enemy's camp and agrican
 marking their scanty number bids his squadrons stand apart and
 leave a fair field for himself and orlando who engage in a
 desperate duel while they are employed in this with little
 vantage on either side and to their mutual astonishment at
 finding themselves so equally matched a loud larum is heard from
 the citadel which announces the arrival of succours

 this was an army raised by galaphron for the relief of albracca
 the vanguard commanded by a vassal giant the second body by
 marphisa a young indian queen who had made a vow in her infancy
 never to lay aside her armour till she had taken three kings
 prisoners to wit charlemagne gradasso and agrican while the
 rearguard was conducted by galaphron himself the vanguard led
 by the giant is immediately engaged with the besiegers and its
 leader armed with an immense hammer deals such destruction
 amongst their ranks that all is speedily in confusion and
 disarray

 agrican witnessing the rout of his followers now entreats
 orlando for his lady's love that their combat may be suspended
 till the morrow in order to give him an opportunity of rallying
 the fugitives this orlando not only grants but offers to assist
 him in his design the offer is however courteously declined by
 agrican who flying in pursuit of the giant unhorses him and
 leaves him desperately wounded to the daggers of his followers he
 himself charges the troops who come under the giant's conduct and
 the tide of battle is turned

 no attempt to stop the confusion of the vanguard is made by
 marphisa who this time was retired from the field and sleeping
 under a tree

 but first the queen her chamberwench bespoke
 "attend to my command" marphisa said
 "and when thou seest our indian army broke
 "and galaphron its royal leader dead
 "when all these things shall be 'twere time i woke
 "_then_ bring my steed and rouse me from my bed
 "but till these things shall be such care delay
 "'tis then this single arm shall change the day"

 galaphron now observing the rout of his vanguard determines to
 retrieve things or perish in the attempt with this resolution he
 spurs towards the enemy when angelica beholding his danger from
 the walls sends a messenger to orlando to entreat his assistance
 for her father reminding him that he fought beneath her eyes

 the author here leaves the story suspended and returns to
 rinaldo who journeying northward in the direction which
 flordelis the damsel of brandimart had first given him arrives
 at a fountain where he finds a cavalier weeping upon the ground
 having long observed his grief in silence he at length dismounts
 from his horse and entreats the sorrowing knight to inform him of
 its cause

 the stranger tells him that his misery is such as can find no
 remedy but in death nor does the fear of that oppress him but
 the knowledge that his death must be followed by that of another
 rinaldo entreats him to explain how this can be and prevails on
 him to relate his history at length

 this the stranger began in the following manner "about twenty
 days' journey from hence is situated the famous city of babylon
 of which tisbina was the wonder a lady alike renowned for her
 charms and virtues of this treasure i became the possessor yet
 having possessed her found it my cruel duty to yield her to
 another for two years afterwards i wandered almost deprived of
 my reason but time at last brought with it some alleviation of my
 sorrow to this common remedy of grief was united the reflection
 that i had resigned her to the most virtuous and most courteous of
 men and that however dear it might cost me it was impossible to
 repent my sacrifice

 "while i was thus wandering my evil fortune led me into orgagna
 whose rightful king poliphernus was absent with the army of
 agrican his kingdom having during his absence fallen into the
 possession of an evil woman who makes all strangers her prey
 this enchantress for such she is whose name is falerina has a
 beautiful garden which is only open towards the east where a
 serpent keeps the gate to whom falerina gives her unfortunate
 prisoners to be devoured the names of these are paired a
 cavalier and a lady according to the order of their arrival and
 a couple is thus every day offered to the monster

 "i was amongst the prisoners of falerina when tidings of my
 imprisonment for my greater misfortune reached the ears of
 prasildo the noble gentleman to whom i had relinquished tisbina
 unknown to me he immediately set out for the enchanted garden
 loaded with treasure with which he attempted to accomplish my
 release all his endeavours however were vain and desperate of
 accomplishing it in any other way he offered himself as a victim
 in my place this offer was accepted i was thrust out of the
 dungeon and he remains a prisoner in my stead this day is that
 appointed for his sacrifice which shall not be consummated
 whilst i am alive for it is my resolution when he is led out of
 prison to be conducted to the place of punishment to attack his
 guards and perish in his defence my single source of grief is
 that i shall not be able to purchase his deliverance with my
 life"

 rinaldo bids the stranger be of better cheer and offers to join
 him in the attack of prasildo's guards to which iroldo who
 conceives this will be a useless sacrifice of life very
 unwillingly accedes

 the issue of the attempt is however very different from what
 iroldo had anticipated the rabble who were conducting two
 prisoners to the place of execution are set upon by the knights
 and scattered on all sides principally by the valour of rinaldo

 in the male prisoner iroldo recognizes prasildo as he had
 expected and the damsel turns out to be flordelis rinaldo is now
 impatient to crown his victory with the destruction of the
 enchanted garden but the damsel his former guide after vainly
 seeking to terrify him by a description of the various monsters
 and enchantments by which it was guarded reminds him of the
 imprisonment of orlando and his unaccomplished promise to achieve
 the destruction of the garden of dragontina this consideration
 prevails over his anxiety to demolish that of falerina and in
 company with his two friends and the damsel who all become
 christians in admiration of his prowess and in gratitude for their
 deliverance proceeds on his journey towards the garden of
 dragontina

 this however had been previously destroyed and effaced even to
 the last vestige by the talisman of angelica

 the knights pursuing their journey towards its former situation
 meet on their way a fugitive from agrican's army who gives such
 an account of the prowess of a champion who fought upon the part
 of angelica that rinaldo is persuaded this must have been
 orlando though all are at a loss to imagine how he could have
 been freed they had not proceeded much farther when they saw a
 warrior under some trees to whom a damsel was presenting a horse
 this warrior flordelis recognized by her bearings for marphisa
 and whom she especially counselled her companions to avoid they
 however and more especially rinaldo treated the caution with
 contempt and made boldly towards the virago

 as she is just mounting to defy them to the joust she is
 approached by an elderly man all in tears who relates the
 overthrow of galaphron's vanguard and entreats her assistance
 which she promises to bestow as soon as she shall have unhorsed
 and taken the approaching strangers

 advancing against them she first encounters and overthrows iroldo
 and prasildo in succession who are made prisoners by some of
 marphisa's followers that were in waiting together with the
 attendant damsel she next meets rinaldo and breaks upon him an
 enormous lance which had never yet failed her rinaldo too breaks
 his upon the damsel and both casting away their broken spears
 encounter with their swords here rinaldo's dextrous skill in
 defence and the superior temper of fusberta give him a temporary
 advantage and in parrying a blow of his opponent he beats the
 faulchion out of her hand full of fury the virago deals him a
 deadly blow on the face with her gauntletted hand in return and
 makes him reel in his saddle while rabican wheels round and
 carries off his halfstupefied rider marphisa instantly springs
 to ground and regains her sword and rinaldo recovering himself
 again spurs his courser to the encounter

 in the mean time orlando at the command of angelica had
 galloped to the assistance of galaphron at the head of his brave
 companions and had again changed the fortune of the day he and
 agrican now meet a second time in the medley and renew the
 contest with more fury than before and agrican being at last
 convinced that it will be impossible for him to effect any thing
 against albracca but by the destruction of orlando determines to
 bring the battle to a desperate issue and in order to get his
 adversary into a place where they shall be secure from
 interruption feigns to fly and is followed by orlando to an open
 space in a wood in the middle of which is a fountain here after
 mutual reproaches they again charge each other with their swords
 and still with doubtful success night closes upon the combatants
 who have passed the greater part of the day in the interchange of
 blows

 the two champions again suspend their combat almost of necessity
 and agree upon a truce till daylight they accordingly lie down
 together and engage in a friendly conversation during this
 agrican makes out his antagonist to be orlando and orlando seizes
 the opportunity to attempt his conversion agrican however
 receives the proposal with utter contempt and observes that love
 and arms are the only subjects of conversation becoming a knight

 this change of theme almost necessarily leads to the mention of
 angelica and the rivals being kindled by the discourse which
 ensues between them into new animosity remount their horses and
 attack each other in the dark

 the contest is thus continued with various success and day breaks
 upon this desperate and unheardof duel at length however the
 fortune of orlando prevails and he after receiving many desperate
 contusions for wounded he could not be inflicts a deadly gash
 in his adversary's side

 agrican is now deserted by his lofty spirit and demands baptism
 from the hands of orlando

 while tears descending bathed his manly face
 the gentle count dismounted to his aid
 then locked the wounded knight in his embrace
 upon the fountain's grassy border laid
 and kiss'd his fading lips and sought his grace
 and of the mischief done forgiveness prayed
 the speechless tartar king his head inclin'd
 and with the cross his brows orlando sign'd

 when having to his sorrow found that he
 was breathless and all vital warmth was fled
 he weened his gallant spirit was set free
 and by the crystal fountain left him dead
 clad as he was in armour capape
 with sword in hand and crown upon his head
 then first towards his courser turn'd his view
 and in that steed the good bayardo knew

 he is assured of this by a closer examination of the gentle horse
 who comes neighing to greet the kinsman and comrade of his master

 mounted upon him and leading his own brigliadoro the count
 leaves the place but has not rode far before he hears the clash
 of weapons when having first secured brigliadoro he rides in
 the direction of the sound and guided by it discovers a damsel
 whom three giants were conducting with a camel and much treasure
 which they had carried away by force one of the giants had charge
 of the lady while the other two maintained a combat with a
 cavalier but this story is broken off by the author who hastens
 to tell the effects produced by the death of agrican

 all was rout and dismay in the tartarian army and galaphron
 entering the enemy's camp set free astolpho and the other
 prisoners who were detained there astolpho is scarcely presented
 to angelica before he demands the means of avenging himself on
 the enemy and being furnished with a horse and arms immediately
 returns into the field here he is fortunate enough to meet one
 clad in his own armour and armed with the enchanted lance

 of these he immediately repossesses himself and joins galaphron
 and his troops who had pursued the flying enemy to the banks of a
 river fast by where rinaldo and marphisa were still engaged
 marphisa was protected by enchanted harness yet was armed with
 but half a sword which as related was severed by fusberta on
 the other hand the greater part of rinaldo's defensive armour had
 been hewed away

 galaphron instantly knows marphisa by her cognizance but is at a
 loss to distinguish rinaldo till observing rabican who had
 belonged to argalia he conceived that he saw in him the murderer
 of his son under this persuasion he rode at rinaldo and smote
 him with all his force when marphisa enraged at this
 interference immediately turned her arms against her aged
 commander brandimart and others coming up rescue him from the
 hands of the virago whom they take for some warrior of the tartar
 troops when rinaldo as generous as marphisa not enduring to see
 his former enemy overlaid with odds joins her against those with
 whom she is now engaged the main body of galaphron's army coming
 up reinforces the enemies of marphisa who is on her part
 supported by the arrival of her own division by whose succour
 joined to that of rinaldo she is enabled to repel the assailants

 all this time iroldo prasildo and flordelis were standing at
 some distance and the damsel of marphisa was entertaining them
 with a history of the feats and prowess of her mistress flordelis
 is by this alarmed for the safety of brandimart one of the first
 who had assailed marphisa and goes in search of him amongst the
 warriors whom the virago and rinaldo had scattered and who were
 making in utter rout and confusion for albracca she however
 to her infinite content finds him safe and standing apart from
 the fray he having separated from the enemies of marphisa after
 she was oppressed by numbers the happy lovers thus reunited
 retire into a neighbouring wood and after giving a loose to their
 mutual tenderness fall asleep upon the grass

 here however a new and unexpected peril was impending their
 caresses were unfortunately overseen by a hermit who dabbled in
 necromancy and who excited by the beauties of flordelis
 determined on making her his prize among other secrets he was
 possessed of a root which had the faculty of throwing the person
 to whom it was applied provided it touched any part of the naked
 body into a profound and indissoluble sleep armed with this he
 approaches flordelis lifts her coats and applies it to her
 thigh having thus so riveted her natural slumber that he was
 sure she could not wake for an hour to come the hermit snatches
 her up and bears her off being afraid to try the virtues of his
 root upon brandimart lest he should awake before the charm was
 consummated

 brandimart slept soundly till he was awakened by a loud noise at
 the same moment he missed flordelis yet notwithstanding his
 unutterable grief approached the quarter from whence the sound
 proceeded in which he distinguished the cries of a woman in
 distress

 on his arrival he found three giants who were conducting a file
 of camels two of them followed and another preceded the string
 leading one on which was seated a damsel with dishevelled hair
 and weeping bitterly in her brandimart believed that he
 recognised flordelis and galloped in fury against the ravishers

 the giants instantly prepare to resist him and in the combat
 which follows he is put to great peril and loses his horse

 it is at this moment that orlando who had lately slain agrican
 comes to his succour his assistance renders the combat more
 equal but brandimart though he has killed one of the giants is
 beaten down by another orlando however avenges him on his
 enemy and clears the field he has now leisure to look to his
 bleeding friend and finding there is yet life in him consigns
 him to the care of the rescued damsel who applies the proper
 medicaments to his wounds

 marphisa and rinaldo were this while still in full pursuit of
 their enemies who found refuge within the citadel of albracca
 marphisa having chased them up to the gates menaced galaphron
 with vengeance and indeed she and rinaldo had now a common
 cause marphisa on account of her recent quarrel with her former
 leader and rinaldo since the fountain of hate had disposed him to
 enmity with angelica and the oath he had sworn on winning
 rabican bound him to take vengeance on truffaldino one of her
 defenders they accordingly sit down before the place and on the
 second day rinaldo appears beneath the walls sounds his horn and
 defies truffaldino king of baldacca by the titles of traitor
 renegade and tyrant

 there were at this time within the fortress many warriors who
 had sworn to defend him against sacripant and torindo whom he had
 imprisoned and against all others whatsoever truffaldino calls
 on these to fulfil their engagement and several knights with the
 traitor king in the midst of them descend from the citadel to do
 battle with rinaldo on his behalf

 these were the brothers gryphon and aquilant who had enchanted
 horse and armour uberto adrian and clarion they attack rinaldo
 singly and successively he soon defeats the two first comers but
 he finds himself better matched with gryphon of the enchanted
 arms with whom he engages in a long and doubtful battle after a
 fruitless expostulation and attempt to negotiate on the part of
 gryphon

 leaving these the author returns to brandimart who restored to
 life by the skill of the damsel whom he and orlando rescued from
 the giants is rendered desperate by the discovery that she is
 not flordelis he curses the hour in which he was rescued from
 death as well as that in which he was born and recapitulates all
 the circumstances of his life in the following apostrophe

 "thou took'st me fortune from a royal dome
 "such early blow thy deadly malice gave
 "and i thus ravished from my noble home
 "in other lands was sold to be a slave
 "and now long doomed in foreign climes to roam
 "but her remember to whose breasts i clave
 "my father's and my country's name effaced
 "my mother's in my mind is only traced

 "never did evil destiny so lour
 "as upon me to early bondage sold
 "with one entitled lord of the sylvan tower
 "when but to make me suffer sevenfold
 "softened awhile appear'd the faithless power
 "and the good master of the sylvan hold
 "freed me and having none his name to bear
 "of his broad lands and living made me heir

 "but fortune had so marked me for her prey
 "that to fill up the bitter cup of woe
 "fairest among the fair a damsel gay
 "she chose in her displeasure to bestow
 "simply to take the precious prize away
 "then can i choose but sink beneath the blow
 "o thou that hast renewed my fleeting breath
 "undo thy work and give me back to death"

 orlando and the charitable damsel sympathise deeply in his grief
 and the lady to prove at least that he was not single in his
 sorrows begins the narration of her own adventures

 she informs him that she was daughter and heir of the king of
 _the distant isles_ where all the treasure of the earth is
 accumulated gifted with beauty and destined to inherit such
 riches two lovers came to demand her in marriage on the same day
 ordauro and folderico the one handsome and the other more than
 seventy years old the first distinguished by his prowess the
 second by his wisdom and riches the damsel's father inclined in
 favour of folderico but the damsel hoped by a sleight to transfer
 herself to ordauro

 she had accordingly obtained a boon from the monarch and this
 was that no one should have her to wife who had not previously
 vanquished her in the footrace by this she considered herself
 as secure of success but folderico countermined her stratagem
 being paired with her in the course he had recourse to the
 expedient of dropping three golden apples and the damsel was
 distanced by the same means as atalanta thus the old man won his
 wife who however determined on taking such vengeance as was in
 her power

 here the lady who was her own historian observed brandimart's
 distraction who being charged with it confessed that he had
 neither eyes nor ears but for flordelis and that he should never
 regain possession of himself till she was found on this the
 damsel and orlando who was mounted on bayardo and had resigned
 his brigliadoro to brandimart as before related offer to
 accompany him in an attempt to recover her and they immediately
 proceed upon their search

 flordelis in the interval had been carried off by the hermit to
 a cave where she woke at the moment that a lion who harboured
 there sprang forth to punish the intrusion of the ravisher who
 instantly dropt his plunder and fled the beast however passingby
 the proffered prey follows and tears in pieces the hermit who
 had cast it down flordelis while he is thus employed escapes

 she however only gains a present respite from misfortune for
 flying at random she falls into the hands of a hairy savage in
 the forest who binds her to a tree with twigs and then gazing
 stupidly upon her casts himself down at a little distance

 brandimart was this while in pursuit of her in the same wood
 accompanied by orlando and the damsel of the golden apples who
 was seated upon his courser's croup orlando now entreats that she
 will finish her story which she continues

 folderico who had won the damsel carried her to a tower which he
 possessed upon the seashore called altamura where he kept her
 together with his treasure under lock and key and utterly
 secluded from the sight of man*

 * as the author is indebted to greek fable for the beginning so
 he is to norman story for this subsequent adventure which is
 taken with some variation from an old _fabliau_ see barbasan's
 or le grand's _fabliaux_ the story would seem to be of eastern
 origin

 but what will not love ordauro who was also rich though not so
 wealthy as folderico purchased a sumptuous palace in the
 immediate neighbourhood of altamura and at an immense cost made a
 subterraneous passage from his palace to the damsel's prison by
 which he visited and enjoyed her without danger at last however
 the lovers tired of the restraint under which they carried on
 their intercourse and emboldened by success determined to make a
 desperate effort to escape

 with this view ordauro communicates to folderico news of his
 approaching nuptials with another daughter of monodontes for so
 was called the king of the distant isles and invites him as his
 brotherinlaw to the marriage feast folderico having carefully
 secured the gates of his tower goes thither and finding his wife
 installed as bride becomes ferocious at the sight ordauro
 however with great difficulty succeeds in appeasing him by the
 assurance that she was a twinsister of his own wife to whom she
 bore a perfect resemblance and by bidding him return to his
 tower and satisfy himself of the fact the means of proof appeared
 decisive and accordingly folderico accepts them he finds his
 locks as they were left and his wife who had returned by the
 subterraneous passage and changed her dress alone and overcome
 with melancholy he again takes the way which was somewhat
 circuitous to the palace of ordauro and again finds her there
 shining in all the festivity of a bride he can no longer resist
 the conviction that the two persons whom he had seen were
 different women lays aside his distrust and even offers to
 convoy the bridegroom and his bride on a part of their journey
 towards ordauro's natural home to which he was returning

 a certain advantage was thus gained since folderico never left
 his tower though locked for above an hour and consequently
 would have soon discovered his loss if the lovers had eloped in
 secret

 the party set out together and at the end of the first day's
 journey folderico turns back and gallops to his tower he is now
 first assured of his disgrace full of rage he pursues his rival
 but does not dare make any attempt to recover his wife till he
 has separated ordauro from his adherents having effected this by
 a stratagem he attacks his retainers and repossesses himself of
 the lady he is destined to a short possession of the prize for
 he is on his return beset by giants who seize her and all his
 treasure which the wife was carrying off as a dowry to her new
 lord he himself escapes

 orlando listened with curiosity to this relation but brandimart
 who only thought upon flordelis separated from his companions in
 order to pursue a separate search whilst he is engaged in this
 he hears her cries and directed by them finds her bound to the
 tree he dismounts from his horse to assist her and is about to
 loosen her bonds when he is attacked by the savage armed with a
 rustic club and shield this strange woodman is described as
 gifted with extraordinary strength of body and distinguished by
 some strange propensities

 he dwelt in woods and on their produce fed
 and drank the limpid brook which bubbled by
 and such his nature ever it is said
 wept when he saw a clear and cloudless sky
 since fearful of the sign he lived in dread
 that tempest clouds and cold and rain were nigh
 but joy'd in thunder and in hail since he
 hoped warmer suns and happier days to see

 this savage but for the exclamation of flordelis would have
 surprised brandimart in the act of untying her being warned by
 her of his danger he guarded himself against his attacks which
 required all his skill and courage to repel he indeed hewed in
 pieces the rustic weapon with which he was armed but the monster
 closing with him grasped him in his arms and attempted to cast
 him down a precipice when he fortunately escaped from his
 embrace

 the savage finding himself foiled in this hope and weaponless
 now flew to a sapling which he was trying to pluck up by its
 roots when the knight killed him while engaged in the attempt
 brandimart now releases flordelis seats her on his horse's croup
 and goes in pursuit of orlando from whom he had separated

 whilst he is thus engaged the author resumes the story of
 albracca rinaldo was left in close combat with gryphon whom he
 at last stunned with a desperate blow when aquilant believing
 his brother killed took up the conqueror gryphon however
 reviving from the effects of the stroke returned to the charge
 marphisa seeing rinaldo thus oppressed with odds came to his
 assistance and others again of those sworn to defend truffaldino
 who was an unwilling spectator of the fray took part against her
 and rinaldo orlando was this while pursuing his way in search
 of brandimart while brandimart as vainly sought him through the
 forest

 whilst orlando is thus engaged he sees a damsel issue from a wood
 upon a palfrey who bears a book and horn addressing herself to
 the count she tells him that if he is what his countenance
 bespeaks him the fairest adventure awaits him which ever was
 achieved by knight and which indeed had hitherto foiled the
 prowess of all who had attempted it who remained prisoners in the
 enchanted garden which she invites him if he has the courage
 sufficient for such an adventure to attack orlando accepts the
 proposal with rapture the damsel presents him with the book and
 horn both necessary for the achievement of the enterprize and
 having instructed him in the use of them retires to a distance

 orlando accordingly having first disposed of the other damsel
 whom he carried behind him sounds the bugle and a rock opens
 from which issue two ferocious bulls with horns of iron and
 strangely coloured hair turned contrary to the natural grain

 and sometimes green now black now white it seemed
 now yellow and now red and ever gleamed

 orlando learned from the book by whose rules he was to proceed
 that he was to bind these beasts and this done was to enter the
 opening from which they sallied and plow with them the space
 within such was to be his first labour

 the bulls long maintained a severe fight with the champion and
 often tossed though they could not gore him at length he so
 fatigued them by repeated blows from durindana for their skin
 was as impenetrable as his own that he was enabled to master
 them seized them by their horns and bound them separately with
 bayardo's bridle to an adjoining column which was the monument
 of the king bavardo he then made a plow of durindana the point
 of which served as a share and the hilt as a handle yoked the
 bulls to the instrument and having torn off the limb of a tree
 for a whip ploughed the field as he was directed the work
 accomplished he loosed his beasts who ran roaring through the
 wood and disappeared behind a mountain

 orlando now devoutly thanks god for his first success and the
 damsel of the book and horn having dismounted from the palfrey in
 the meadow wreaths her brows with the flowers which it produced
 orlando however does not allow himself a longer truce but
 sounds a second challenge on his enchanted bugle

 upon the second sound the earth trembles and a neighbouring hill
 vomits forth flame which is followed by the appearance of a fiery
 dragon the damsel of the golden apples is now about to fly but
 she of the book and horn bids her

 ��"in faith and hope stand near
 "for only he who proves the quest need fear"

 the damsel of the golden apples who resented orlando's coldness
 during their journey through the forest observes she is glad that
 he only is in danger and that she cannot regret what may happen
 to him

 "in that there lives not a more worthless wight"

 this reproach reaches orlando's ears as he consults his book
 this guide taught him that his only means of safety consisted in
 cutting off the dragon's head before he was consumed by the flame
 and venom which issued from her mouth the head cut off he was
 to perform the labour of jason and sow the field in which he had
 laboured with the serpent's teeth from these was to spring a crop
 of armed men and if he saved himself from their swords he might
 esteem himself the flower of chivalry

 he has scarce learned his lesson when the serpent is upon him
 orlando protected himself from her assault with his shield but
 this and all his armour was consumed by the flame which she
 vomited forth he contends long with the monster enveloped in
 fire and smoke but at last separates her head at a blow he
 immediately draws the teeth puts them into his helmet and sows
 them as the book had enjoined the effect followed which had been
 foretold

 first feathers sprouting from the ground appear
 by little and by little then a crest
 and next is seen the bust of cavalier
 furnish'd with manly limbs and spreading chest
 foot in the front and horsemen in the rear
 they rise and shout and lay the lance in rest
 and drums and trumpets sounding to the charge
 level the spear and lift the covering targe

 orlando however though he had neither lance nor shield left him
 soon reaps this harvest with durindana and the seed of the
 serpent thus springs and perishes in a day

 the victory achieved he blows the third and last blast upon his
 horn which the author thus prefaces

 these dragons and these gardens made by spell
 and dog and book by witch or wizard writ
 and savage hairy man and giant fell
 and human face to monstrous form ill fit
 are food for ignorance which you may well
 decypher that are blest with shrewder wit
 then muse upon the doctrine sage and sound
 which lies conceal'd beneath this rugged ground*

 * the italian reader will here again trace some lines of dante

 such matter as is excellent and rare
 and things of scent or savour rich or fine
 in open hand we do not loosely bear
 nor cast such pearls to be defiled of swine
 nature great mistress teaches better care
 who loves the flower with fencing thorns to twine
 and covers well her fruits and things of mark
 the kernel with its stone the tree with bark

 a safe defence from bird and beast and storm
 and has conceal'd the yellow gold i' the ground
 jewels and what is rare for tint or form
 that these may be with cost and labour found
 and vain and witless is th' unwary swarm
 who show their wealth if they with wealth abound
 the mark at which knave thief and cheater level
 and so by matchless folly tempt the devil

 as duly would it seem to square with reason
 that good should be with toil and trouble bought
 and to obtain it otherwise were treason
 than by activity of deed and thought
 'tis thus we see that art and labour season
 the victual which without their aid is nought
 and simple viands in their nature good
 convert to sweeter and more savoury food

 if homer's odyssey appear compounded
 of lying legends deem not these unfit
 nor reading of some god or goddess wounded
 let this aught scandalize your weaker wit
 for who the secrets of the sage has sounded
 well knows that for the sage the poet writ
 and veils a different thing from that which lies
 open to them who see but with their eyes

 but stop not ye content at the outer rind
 be not as these but seek what is within
 for if no better nourishment you find
 you will have made small progress for your sin
 and see in these strange emblems illdivined
 but sick men's dreams and fables then begin
 a better task their secret meaning measure
 and turn the stubborn soil for hidden treasure

 returning to the story orlando sounded his horn a third time
 and on the echo dying away was disappointed by the appearance of
 a little white bitchhound

 this the damsel of the book in hopes to stay the count who was
 now disposed to depart assured him was that which was to crown
 his toils

 she explains herself by informing him that in a neighbouring
 lake is an island the residence of the fata morgana whom god
 has set over riches which she

 "distributes in the bowels of the mount
 "whence they are dug with long fatigue and pain
 "and hides them in the river and the fount
 "in india where ants work the golden vein
 "nor let the tale seem strange which i recount
 "since two fair fishes feed upon the grain
 "now good morgana the bitchhound has sent
 "to guerdon thee with treasure and content

 "the wondrous fay for various riches vaunted
 "mistress of all that seas or earth enfold
 "is owner of a hind in this enchanted
 "that she is white and armed with horns of gold
 "and that by her no forest long is haunted
 "still restless and impatient of a hold
 "her many hunters vainly seek to catch
 "but you may take her with this little brach

 "who soon shall rouse her from her secret lair
 "yelping upon the trail with questing cry
 "thou shalt pursue thro' holt or desert bare
 "though hound and hart more swift than arrow fly
 "six days shalt thou pursue the flying pair
 "but on the seventh cease the chase to ply
 "since in a fount the milkwhite hind shall soil*
 "and thou be guerdon'd for thy tedious toil

 * the technical phrase for a stag taking the water as he usually
 does when distressed hence our viewhollo of "tayo" for the
 stag is taken from the old french cry of "_taihors_" or "out of
 the swamp" as our "tally ho" for the fox is derived from
 "_taillis hors_" or "out of cover" which last etymology we learn
 from lady juliana berners all our hunting phraseology indeed is
 norman even where we should be least inclined to trace it to such
 a source thus the cry of "hiloicks hiloicks" used by us in
 trying a cover we find in her precepts to be "illocques
 illocques" or "there there" the normans indeed formed both our
 hunting code and hunting vocabulary see many well founded
 allusions to this in ivanhoe

 "six times aday such riches shalt thou measure
 "she sheds her horns which yield an hundred weight
 "and thus shalt thou collect such mighty treasure
 "as may defy the wit of man to rate
 "thrice blest if countless wealth can purchase pleasure
 "to this perchance deserve a happier fate
 "and with the hind obtain what is above
 "that precious prize the beauteous fairy's love"

 orlando however treats the temptation with contempt and
 unwillingly seating the damsel of the golden apples behind him
 casts down the book and horn and departs

 proceeding with her he arrives at a bridge where he meets with
 an armed cavalier who claims the damsel as his own this turns
 out to be ordauro to whom orlando resigns her with great
 satisfaction and pursues his journey to albracca

 here the strife was still continued between rinaldo and marphisa
 united on the one part and gryphon and aquilant and all those
 confederated to defend truffaldino on the other rinaldo having in
 this gained some advantage over his immediate opponents
 truffaldino who was present fled into the citadel this put a
 short stop to hostilities and the combat was suspended till the
 ensuing day when truffaldino was to be again produced and to
 abide its issue

 in this interval two important circumstances occur astolpho who
 was agrican's prisoner when those who entered albracca with
 angelica took the engagement to defend truffaldino learning from
 gryphon that rinaldo had been his antagonist changes sides and
 goes over to his cousin

 to counterbalance this loss to the besieged orlando arrives in
 albracca and is received with open arms by angelica

 on the ensuing day the combat is renewed between the former
 parties with the addition of astolpho on one side and of orlando
 on the other in this orlando and rinaldo single each other out
 and after bitter reproaches rinaldo reproving orlando for his
 defence of a traitour and orlando twitting rinaldo for his
 robberies and evil life engage in a furious combat but here
 orlando is ill seconded by bayardo who will not advance against
 his own master

 at this moment rinaldo sees truffaldino treacherously unhorse
 astolpho and pursuing him for the traitour flies upon his
 approach comes up with him before he is overtaken by his
 defenders makes him prisoner and ties him by the feet to
 rabican's tail with the wretch thus suspended he gallops off at
 full speed the superior swiftness of rabican rendering all
 interference on the behalf of truffaldino impossible and drags
 him at his horse's heels till he is dashed in pieces

 whilst he is running this cruel course rinaldo thunders out
 reproaches and threats against the abettors of the tyrant and
 orlando who had now obtained his own horse brigliadoro through
 the arrival of brandimart who joins him renews his battle with
 rinaldo on personal grounds the others considering themselves
 released from the necessity of fighting him by the death of
 truffaldino

 night however separates the two combatants rinaldo returning to
 marphisa's camp and orlando to the citadel of albracca

 here orlando is received with all love and honour by angelica who
 is however sighing in her heart for rinaldo and with this
 view declares she will attend the duel which was to be renewed on
 the morrow and sends sacripant delighted with the task to
 demand a safeconduct for her from marphisa previously however to
 orlando's taking the field she demands of him a boon swearing
 she will make him lord of her person if he will promise to
 undertake an adventure upon her bidding and avails herself of
 this promise the next day when the strife is at its hottest
 telling orlando that enough has been done for honour and
 entreating him now to depart upon the promised quest which was no
 other than the destruction of falerina's garden in the kingdom of
 orgagna

 the combatants being separated and orlando departed angelica
 seeks to communicate with rinaldo but in vain and returns
 disconsolate to albracca from whence she sends a damsel to
 rinaldo with bayardo whom orlando had dispatched to that fortress
 on receiving brigliadoro from brandimart but rinaldo remains
 unmoved by these various acts of kindness

 the scene is now again changed and orlando whom angelica had
 dispatched upon what she conceived a fatal enterprise pursues his
 way towards orgagna

 he arrives at a bridge on which is seen a cavalier armed at all
 points and mounted as if for its defence near this was seen a
 beautiful damsel suspended by her hair to a pine and weeping
 bitterly orlando immediately moves to her relief but is exhorted
 by the armed cavalier to leave her to a fate which she had well
 deserved by her wickedness in proof of which he proceeds to
 relate her adventures

 "my name" pursued the knight "is uldano and hers origilla we
 were both born in the city of bactria and i from earliest
 infancy conceived a passion for her which grew with my growth
 and derived strength even from her fickleness another youth of
 the name of lucrino loved her equally with myself and both were
 so well kept in play by her artifices that each believed himself
 to be favoured

 "being at length impatient of longer delay i threw myself at her
 feet and entreated her to take compassion on my torments she
 appeared to meet my passion halfway but told me there was but
 one mode in which i could gratify my desires without the sacrifice
 of her honour and suggested the following stratagem as the means

 "'you know' said the damsel 'that my brother corbino though
 scarcely arrived at manhood was slain by oringo in combat a man
 grown and trained to arms to avenge this treason my father has
 offered a large reward to him who shall take the murderer and
 would soon find one who would undertake to execute his revenge
 you shall bear the cognizance of oringo shall suffer yourself to
 be taken and thus procure admission into my father's house here
 you shall receive the reward of your constancy and i will
 afterwards effect your deliverance'

 "i senseless as i was gave into the snare and had scarce
 departed in order to assume the device and arms she suggested
 when the traitress called to her my rival lucrino and told him
 that now was the time to win her by the death or capture of the
 murderer of her brother for she knew his motions and where he
 was to be found indicating to him the place whither she had sent
 me with his borrowed ensigns

 "to complete her purpose more effectually she furnished him also
 with the ensigns of a third lover named ariantes to whom her
 father had promised her in marriage on condition of his avenging
 him on oringo

 "in the mean time this ariantes met and attacked me taking me by
 my cognizance for oringo and i yielded myself a prisoner after
 little resistance in the hope of the reward promised by origilla

 "lucrino who was this while dispatched by her in pursuit of me
 fell in with the real oringo and both were desperately wounded in
 the combat which ensued lucrino had however strength enough
 left to master his opposite and was bringing him away prisoner
 when he was met by the father of origilla who at first judged him
 to be ariantes but when undeceived on a nearer approach offered
 him his daughter in marriage whom he had previously promised to
 ariantes on the same conditions provided he would deliver up his
 prisoner

 "the offer was scarcely accepted when ariantes arrived bringing
 in me disguised in the arms of oringo and the whole stratagem
 was now apparent

 "the clearing up this led to new contests for ariantes complained
 of lucrino's having taken his bearings and oringo thought himself
 wronged in that his had been usurped by me

 "now to wear the ensigns of another is death by our law unless
 the penalty be remitted by him who has been offended and the
 cause being brought before the king we were all condemned
 oringo for having slain as before told corbino who was a youth
 scarcely capable of defending himself ariantes for having
 bargained away the life of another and lucrino and myself for
 having usurped arms and ensigns which we were not entitled to
 wear

 "origilla was condemned to a yet heavier punishment to wit to be
 hanged up by the hair till she was dead while we in the
 expectation of our sentence were to assist in the execution of
 hers and to keep watch and ward over her as she wavered in the
 wind my lot for we drew lots to determine the order of our
 guard happened to be the first and i have already slain seven
 knights that would have relieved her whose arms and bearings may
 be seen fastened to the tree"

 the knight had scarcely ended when the wretched woman gave the
 lie to his assertions and denounced him as having slain those he
 mentioned by treachery hoping by the show of these trophies to
 terrify others from attempting to defend her

 orlando believes the lady and defies and unhorses uldano he is
 no sooner conquered than a horn sounds which a dwarf winds from
 a tower's top when another knight takes up the conqueror and the
 four concerned are all successively encountered and dismounted
 by orlando who now cuts down the damsel and departs with her
 seated on his horse's croup

 thus riding together and beguiling the way with talk they
 descried in the middle of a meadow a huge rock of marble cut
 into steps and bearing an inscription in letters of gold when
 the damsel informs him they are near a notable wonder which well
 deserves his examination since if he will take the pains of
 climbing this pile which is hollow within he may from the top
 descry hell and paradise opened to the sight below orlando
 believes the tale and ascends the steps when origilla having
 possessed herself of brigliadoro laughs at him for his folly and
 departs

 orlando now examining the inscription finds it imports nothing
 more than that this was the tomb of ninus the founder of nineveh
 little satisfied with the discovery and cursing the damsel from
 the bottom of his soul he departs on foot in order to prosecute
 his adventure

 but here the author closes his first book with the promise of
 treating of higher and worthier matters in his second


 the orlando innamorato
 book ii
 argument

 agramant king of africa assembles his council for advice
 respecting an intended invasion of france and is exhorted to seek
 out rogero as necessary to the success of his enterprise
 rinaldo with astolpho iroldo and prasildo leaves the camp
 before albracca in search of orlando with whom he is impatient
 to terminate his quarrel on his way he falls in with a damsel
 in whose behalf he combats with an enchanted man who plunges with
 him into a lake in which they both disappear agramant in the
 meantime is unable to find rogero and rodomont of sarza one of
 his vassal kings determines to undertake the expedition alone
 orlando who had been dispatched by angelica on a perilous quest
 achieves this and other adventures she is in the meantime robbed
 of her magic ring by brunello who steals his horse from
 sacripant and her sword from marphisa rodomont who threatened
 to invade france alone embarks for that country in a storm and
 makes good his descent orlando now falls in with the enchanted
 man who had regained the shore after leaving rinaldo below the
 waves and a long combat ensues between them on land and under
 water orlando at length vanquishes him and makes the conquest of
 morgana's garden of which he was the champion from this orlando
 delivers all her prisoners except ziliantes son of monodontes
 her minion and more especially rinaldo to whom he is reconciled
 the christian knights delivered excepting orlando depart to the
 succour of charlemagne but rinaldo with his friends soon falls
 into a new snare orlando accompanied by brandimart returns
 towards angelica in albracca but by the way encounters
 brunello pursued by marphisa and is himself plundered by the
 fugitive of his sabre and his horn he is afterwards entrapped by
 the same spell as the others and carried prisoner to damogir in
 the empire of monodontes this adventure leads to the discovery
 that brandimart is the eldest son of monodontes for whom his
 younger son ziliantes is also recovered by orlando who a second
 time makes himself master of morgana rinaldo astolpho and the
 rest again delivered from prison by him pursue their way to
 france but astolpho is seduced from his companions by the devices
 of alcina rinaldo and rodomont meet in battle in france but are
 separated the invasion of this country is to be attempted by a
 yet more formidable force than that of rodomont for agramant
 having received from brunello the booty he had made discovers by
 help of the magic ring the abode of rogero and allures him into
 his service orlando with angelica whose covert object is the
 pursuit of rinaldo takes his way to france she drinking
 however of the fountain of disdain while rinaldo now drinks of
 the fountain of love in the forest of arden the two exchange
 passions he becomes her lover and she now mortally detests
 _him_ who is involved by his present pursuit of her in a
 desperate duel with orlando charlemagne to end the strife gives
 angelica in charge to namus duke of bavaria agramant having this
 while landed in france pursues the war with various success the
 main actions are as in the first book diversified with a great
 variety of episodes


 book ii

 the theme announced as i before stated begins with the
 threatened invasion of france to consult on which agramant calls
 a council of his tributary kings here sobrino strongly opposes
 the measure but finding his opposition useless observes that the
 only thing which can render it effectual will be to get
 possession of rogero a youth who is the cousin of agramant by the
 mother's side and now detained a prisoner by the african
 atlantes on the mountain of carena this advice is better
 listened to than the former and the council breaks up after it
 has been adopted and the king has commanded a search to be
 prosecuted for him on whose presence so much appears to depend

 the scene now again shifts to albracca from before the walls of
 which still besieged by marphisa rinaldo departs in pursuit of
 his new enemy orlando accompanied by astolpho iroldo and
 prasildo

 astolpho was at the head of this party when they fell in with a
 weeping damsel who being questioned as to her cause of sorrow
 related that on lately crossing a neighbouring bridge a wretch
 had issued from a tower which commanded it and seized upon her
 sister that accompanied her whom he made prisoner and whipt
 bitterly having first stript her and tied her naked to a
 cypress astolpho immediately places the weeping sister behind him
 on his horse and all proceed together to effect the deliverance
 of the damsel

 the damsel bridge tower and scourging warder are soon descried
 iroldo and prasildo first encounter the oppressor but are
 successively defeated and the ruffian casts their bodies into a
 lake into which the river bestrid by the bridge disembogues
 itself rinaldo now attacks him with as little success and is
 beat down with an iron mace but when the conqueror attempts to
 dispose of him like the others he makes such violent efforts to
 free himself that the savage being unable to throw him springs
 with him into the lake where they both disappear

 astolpho remains a long time in affliction upon the banks but is
 at last persuaded by the two damsels for one sister had in the
 meantime freed the other to depart

 he accordingly mounts bayardo gives rabican to one of the
 damsels and one of the babylonian knights' horses to the other
 and they both thus mounted go forth under his guidance

 at this time brandimart who it may be remembered was in
 albracca hearing of orlando's departure determines to pursue
 him

 the same resolution is taken by gryphon and aquilant and these
 arriving at the shore find a castle situated upon the beach with
 an open gallery towards the sea in this damsels are dancing and
 the brothers are informed by two maids who are passing with hawks
 upon their fists that it is their usage to detain every
 passenger who is obliged to join in their dance and to pass a
 night under their roof

 the brothers consent to submit to this joyous usage but have soon
 reason to repent their complaisance they soon see a damsel
 approaching upon brigliadoro which she had stolen from orlando
 as was told in the former book and who being interrogated as to
 the manner in which she had become mistress of him said that he
 was the horse of a knight describing his ensigns as those of
 orlando whom she had found dead upon a plain with the body of a
 giant by his side

 the two brothers are much distressed by this falsehood which
 leaves them little inclination to enjoy the festivities of the
 castle in which they had been compelled to join

 to add to their misfortune they are surprised the ensuing night
 in their beds and having been detained for some days in chains
 are together with the damsel who had also arrived mounted on
 brigliadoro led forth for execution as they are however
 conducting to the place of punishment a stranger knight is seen
 approaching but here the author breaks off and carries his
 readers back to the war before albracca

 marphisa had now encountered and worsted every one of the
 defenders of angelica in an attack which they made upon her camp
 when she was assailed by sacripant who had hitherto been confined
 to the fortress from the effects of a former wound

 a desperate combat ensues in which the circassian is much
 assisted by the speed and docility of his horse frontilatte in
 the heat of this a courier brings him news of the invasion of his
 kingdom by mandricardo the son of agrican as he and marphisa
 however cannot agree upon the conditions of a truce this
 occasions but a short interruption of the duel which is at last
 only broken off by the author that he may give some account of
 the search made for rogero in consequence of what was determined
 at the council of agramant

 the emissary of the king returns reporting the inutility of his
 journey made through the mountain of carena and rodomont
 enraged at the delay sets out with his own forces for the
 invasion of france in the mean time agramant is assured that
 rogero is upon mount carena though the garden where he is
 confined is invisible and that the possession of angelica's ring
 would enable him to succeed in his enterprise

 agramant now promises a kingdom to whoever shall obtain for him
 this prize and the theft is confidently promised by a dwarf who
 is entitled brunello

 this while orlando robbed by the damsel of brigliadoro was
 plodding upon his way afoot when he one day fell in with an
 escort of armed men leading two knights as prisoners whom he
 immediately recognized for gryphon and aquilant and the damsel
 who had carried off his courser

 the escort was it seems carrying off these to be devoured by the
 serpent of the garden of orgagna but orlando immediately routs
 the guard and sets the prisoners at liberty

 he has scarcely looked the damsel in the face when he forgets the
 wrongs he has received and gryphon who had exchanged hearts with
 her almost at sight is yet more fascinated by her graces
 orlando observing this under some pretence sends the two brothers
 away that he may keep her to himself and sitting down by her on
 the grass begins to woo her with such courtesy as he can

 while he is thus engaged another damsel approaches on a white
 palfrey who warns orlando of impending danger and informs him he
 is close to the garden of orgagna orlando is delighted at the
 intelligence and entreats her to inform him how he is to procure
 admittance

 she promises him full instructions and as the first of these
 tells him he must keep himself chaste for three days previous to
 attempting the adventure if he would preserve himself from being
 devoured by the dragon who guards the gate she then says she
 will give him a book in which he will find painted the garden and
 all it contains together with the palace of the false
 enchantress which she had only entered the day before for the
 purpose of executing a magic work in which she was engaged

 this which was the manufacture of a sword capable of cutting
 through even enchanted substances she only pursued on moonless
 nights the object of this labour was the destruction of a knight
 of the west hight orlando who she had read in the book of fate
 was destined to demolish her garden to this the damsel adds
 that the garden can only be entered at sunrise and having
 presented him with a book of instructions departs

 orlando who finds he must delay his enterprize till the next
 morning now lies down and is soon asleep in the mean time
 origilla who was still with him meditated her escape in order
 to rejoin gryphon and yielding to the impulse of her evil nature
 was about to slay orlando with his own sword which she had drawn
 for the purpose afraid however to execute her design she
 mounts brigliadoro and gallops off carrying away durindana

 orlando wakes in such indignation as may be supposed on the
 discovery of the theft but like a good knight and true is not
 to be diverted from his enterprise he tears off a huge branch of
 elm to supply the place of his sword and the sun rising takes
 his way towards the eastern gate where the dragon was on his
 watch

 this he slays by repeated blows upon the spine but finds that the
 wall of the enchanted garden which he had entered was closed
 upon him looking round him he saw a fair fountain of water
 which overflowed into a river and in the centre of the fountain
 was a figure on whose forehead was written

 "the stream which waters violet and rose
 "from hence to the enchanted palace flows"

 following the banks of this flowery stream and rapt in the
 delights of the delicious garden orlando arrives at the palace
 and entering it finds the mistress clad in white and with a
 crown of gold upon her head in the act of viewing herself in the
 surface of the fatal sword he surprises her before she can
 escape deprives her of the weapon and holding her fast by her
 long hair which floated behind threatens her with immediate
 death if she does not instruct him in the means of retreat

 falerina however was firm of purpose and refused hence
 orlando being unable to move her either by threats or kindness
 was under the necessity of binding her to a beech having thus
 secured his prisoner he renewed his questions but she still
 refused to point out the gate of the garden

 he now bethinks him of his book and consulting it finds there is
 an entrance to the south but that it is watched by a bull with
 one horn of iron and another of flame

 moreover before arriving at this there is another impediment a
 lake is to be passed pregnant with new danger but to provide
 against this he is instructed by his book according to its
 directions

 * * * *
 * * * *
 he still his path pursuing gathers posies
 of flowers which every where about him spring
 and filling well his casque and ears with roses
 lists if he hears the birds in greenwood sing
 he sees the gaping beak the swelling throat
 and ruffled plumes but cannot catch a note

 having thus proved the force of his defence he proceeds towards
 the lake which was small but deep and so clear and tranquil
 that the eye could penetrate to the bottom

 he is no sooner arrived upon the banks than the waters are seen
 to gurgle and a syren rising midway out of the pool sings so
 sweetly that birds and beasts troop to the waterside attracted
 by her song of this the count hears nothing but feigning to
 yield to the charm sinks down beside the water from which the
 syren issues with the intent to accomplish his destruction
 orlando however seizes her by the hair and while singing yet
 louder song being her only defence cuts off her head and so
 instructed by the book stains himself all over with her blood

 having done this as a protection against the horns of the bull
 and taken the roses from his helmet and ears he proceeds towards
 the southern gate

 here he is encountered by the bull whose horn of iron he severs
 at a stroke his horn of flame was however yet left and by this
 orlando but for the virtue of the syren's blood would have been
 consumed guarded by this he pursues his advantage and at last
 slaughters his enemy the bull is however no sooner slain than
 the gate of which he is the guardian disappears the wall
 closes and orlando again finds himself a prisoner without the
 means of escape

 again resorting to his book he finds that another river running
 westward leads to a gate formed of jewels which is kept by an
 enchanted ass

 taking his course towards this he arrives at a tree of surprising
 height and again consulting his book razes off his crest and
 makes a penthouse of his shield for the protection of his sight
 covering himself with it he advances with his eyes fixed upon the
 ground towards the miraculous tree

 on approaching it a harpy with a beautiful female head and
 crowned with strangely coloured plumes flutters out from the
 branches and hovering above the count squirts her ordure at his
 head this is fortunately protected by his shield on which it
 hisses like boiling oil orlando distracted by the yells of the
 harpy is often tempted to raise his eyes he however perseveres
 in keeping them fixed to the ground till he is near the tree when
 he falls as if blinded by the burning liquor the bird now swoops
 to the ground and having darted her talons into his breastplate
 attempts to drag him towards the trunk the count sees his time is
 come and dispatches her with a backhanded stroke of his sword

 the harpy demolished he readjusted his crest the gift of
 angelica braced his shield anew and took his way towards the
 western gate nothing was ever seen more beautiful than this with
 respect to the materials or the workmanship nor was the animal
 who kept it less extraordinary being an ass armed with scales of
 gold and ears of such length and strength as to be able to
 seize and drag to himself by the aid of them whatever was within
 his reach his tail cut like a trenchant sword and his bray made
 the forest tremble

 though his golden scales had resisted all other weapons they were
 not impenetrable by orlando's steel and he smote off his head at
 a blow

 a strange wonder followed the earth swallowed the carcase of the
 ass this gate too disappeared and the walls again closed upon
 orlando

 he is now directed by his instructions to a a northern entrance
 and strong in patience proceeds in this direction on his way
 thither he sees a table spread in the wilderness he is tempted by
 the viands but recurring to the book is informed of his danger
 and refrains

 from this he learns that a faun lay conceale amongst the
 neighbouring thorns and roses provided with a chain with which
 she snared whoever tasted of the banquet she fled from orlando on
 his approaching her haunt dragging after her a serpent's tail
 till then concealed which was as loathsome as her face was
 lovely being overtaken she made no defence and was slaughtered
 at a blow

 the count now arrives at the northern gate which he finds guarded
 by a giant orlando had so often been engaged with enemies of this
 description that he thought little of the combat in which he was
 going to engage in effect his expectations were in part
 justified as he slew his adversary this was however but the
 beginning of his labour for from the blood of the slaughtered
 enemy sprang a fire and from this issued two other giants yet
 fiercer than the first orlando sees that to spill the blood of
 these would be but to multiply his foes and accordingly
 changing his mode of proceeding grapples with one of the two in
 the hopes of squeezing him to death he is however still
 interrupted by the other before he can accomplish his purpose
 and at last sees the necessity of separating them

 to effect this he feigns to fly but the giants instead of
 pursuing return to keep guard over the enchanted gate if
 however orlando was disappointed in his hope of dividing them
 his stratagem was productive of another advantage he saw the
 chain lying on the ground which was spread for his destruction by
 the faun returning with this he nooses the giants and then again
 recurs to the book for his future proceedings

 this informs him that the total destruction of the garden the
 task imposed by angelica can only be accomplished by tearing off
 a certain branch of a lofty tree in which was involved the
 destiny of this fairy creation

 according to the rules which he received he returned through a
 spacious valley towards the palace passing falerina whom he had
 left fastened to the beech he soon descries the fatal tree which
 is of an immeasurable height while the stem even at the bottom
 is no more than a palm in girt

 no thicker but from this close branch and spray
 bristled whence foliage green and narrow grew
 the leaves which died and sprouted every day
 conceal'd within sharp pointed thorns from view
 apples of gold the loaded twigs display
 apples in form but burnish'd gold in hue
 suspended from small stalks so slight in show
 the man had periled life who walked below

 to obviate this danger and we are afterwards told that the fruit
 was as large as the human head orlando forms a sort of grating
 of boughs of trees and under cover of this proceeds towards the
 tree amidst a shower of the golden apples which fall loosened
 by the vibration of the soil beneath his feet having reached it
 he severs the trunk close to the root and every thing is
 instantly involved in darkness

 the cloud at length clears away and the sun shines forth upon a
 wild landscape where no vestige is to be seen of the garden or
 trace of the adventure except in the appearance of the fairy
 falerina who remains in the middle of the wilderness fastened to
 the beech

 her tone is now changed and she entreats orlando's mercy
 assuring him that many lives depend upon the preservation of hers
 she explains herself by saying that she had constructed the
 garden and a neighbouring snare in a bridge over a torrent in
 order to be revenged on a knight called ariantes and an infamous
 woman of the name of origilla who though many had fallen into
 her toils had both hitherto escaped

 "many" pursues the fairy "were entrapped in my garden and yet
 more at the bridge and here it was that i took a certain
 enchantress daughter of king galaphron who by some secret means
 escaped and effected the deliverance of her fellow prisoners
 many more however have been taken since and all these will
 perish if you are resolved on my destruction" orlando
 immediately promised her life upon her pledging herself for the
 deliverance of the captives

 with this view they proceed together towards the bridge but the
 author snaps this thread to take up that of the story of
 albracca

 here sacripant and marphisa were left engaged in a single combat
 which was still continued with mutual animosity while angelica
 surrounded by a group of warriors sate contemplating the fight
 from the ramparts of the citadel while the attention of all was
 thus engaged brunello who it will be remembered had undertaken
 to steal angelica's ring arrived beneath the walls of albracca
 scaled the rock and walls of the fortress while the crowd was
 watching the duel and disputing on its probable result
 approached the princess unobserved and slipping the ring from
 her finger escaped amid the confusion which followed

 having descended safely to the ground and swam a water by which
 the citadel was surrounded the dwarf perceived that the two
 combatants had separated for an interval of repose and
 immediately meditated a new exercise of his art with this view
 he approached sacripant who absorbed in an amorous reverie sate
 apart upon his courser and having first loosened the girths and
 supported the saddle by a piece of wood withdrew the horse from
 under him*

 * the reader will recollect the imitation of this absurd incident
 in "don quixote" whose squire's ass dapple is stolen in a
 similar manner

 marphisa who was at a little distance witnessed this with
 wonder and before she recovered from her astonishment was
 herself plundered of her sword marphisa is no sooner aware of the
 theft than she pursues the robber but he mounted upon
 frontilatte his new acquisition soon distances the pursuer

 while angelica who felt her misfortune yet more than the others
 is in despair at the loss of her treasure an alarm is given by
 the warder who reports the arrival of a new army before albracca
 this was a turkish force led by caramano brother of torindo one
 of the princes who had been seized and imprisoned by truffaldino
 and who having refused to enter into the engagement to which the
 others agreed on his delivering them from durance now brought
 this brother against albracca

 angelica's last hopes of deliverance rest upon gradasso who it
 seems was her relation and who was meditating anew the invasion
 of france hence sacripant undertakes a secret embassy to this
 prince with the view of soliciting his succour

 rodomont this while who was too impatient to wait for
 _agramant's_ attack upon charlemagne had already sailed for
 france a tremendous storm wrecked his fleet upon the coast of
 that kingdom but he landing with such force as the tempest had
 left him made good his footing and routed the christians in more
 engagements than one though the balance at last turned in their
 favour

 previous however to this gano or ganelon as he is sometimes
 called enters into a traitorous correspondence with marsilius
 whom he invites into france

 while great events are preparing in this quarter the author
 resumes the story of orlando who was journeying with falerina
 towards the bridge where so many prisoners were entrapped on
 their way thither however they arrived at a yet more perilous
 pass this was the bridge and lake into which the felon warrior
 leaped with rinaldo in his arms falerina enchantress as she was
 turned pale at the sight of this place and cursed the hour in
 which they had taken the road which conducted them thither
 informing orlando that they were approaching a snare laid by
 morgana who plotted revenge against a knight who had destroyed
 many of her spells and set at nought her riches and her power

 for this purpose she had formed the lake and selected as a
 defender of the pass a man named arridano a churl of the most
 ferocious and pitiless character she could find him she had
 clothed in invulnerable arms and charmed in such a manner that
 his strength always increased in a sixfold proportion to that of
 the adversary with whom he was matched hence no one had hitherto
 escaped from the contest since such was his strength and power
 of endurance that he could breathe freely under water hence
 having grappled with a knight and sunk with him to the bottom of
 the lake he returned bearing his arms in triumph to the top

 while falerina is explaining the danger of the enterprise orlando
 sees rinaldo's arms erected in form of a trophy amongst other
 spoils made by the villain and forgetting their late quarrel
 determines upon revenging his friend a desperate contest ensues
 between the churl and the knight during which falerina flies the
 combatants as in the case of rinaldo both grapple and sink
 together in the water arrived at the bottom orlando finds
 himself in another world upon a dry meadow with the lake
 overhead through which shone the beams of our sun the meadow
 being on all sides surrounded by a crystal wall here the battle
 was renewed and in this orlando had an advantage which none had
 hitherto possessed besides that he was himself invulnerable he
 was now in possession of the sword tempered by falerina against
 which no spells could avail thus armed and countervailing the
 strength of his adversary by his superior skill and activity he
 had the good fortune to lay him dead upon the field

 orlando having slain his foe discovers a gate in the crystal
 wall and having passed through a dark labyrinth comes at last
 where it is lighted by a carbuncle whose lustre was equal to that
 of day this discovered to his view a river little less than
 twentyyards over and beyond this was seen a field as thickly
 covered with precious stones as the sky is full of stars

 over this was thrown a bridge only half a palm wide and at each
 end was stationed an iron figure with a mace orlando no sooner
 attempted to pass this than the figures smote upon it and it was
 instantly engulphed in the stream orlando however being resolved
 to accomplish the adventure or perish in the attempt leapt the
 river and arrived in the field which contained the treasures of
 the fairy

 when he had arrived at the other extremity of this he entered a
 building where he beheld the likeness of a king surrounded by
 his peers and encompassed by all the pomp and magnificence of
 royalty the monarch appeared to be seated at a banquet with a
 naked sword suspended over his head and on the table before him
 was a live coal supported on a golden lily which gave light to
 the apartment on his left stood a figure with a bended bow in
 guise of one who waits the crossing of the stag and on the right
 the form of one who from his likeness to the king appeared to
 be his brother and who bore in one hand a writing illustrative of
 the vanity of his worldly pursuits

 the troubled countenance of the king seemed to bear witness to the
 truth of the inscription and orlando having satisfied his
 curiosity departed through the door opposite to that by which he
 had entered he was however no sooner out of the apartment than
 all was darkness

 after wandering for some time at random he bethought himself of
 the coal which was burning before the king and returned in order
 to take it he had however no sooner laid his hand upon this than
 the archer let fly his arrow which extinguished it and night
 followed this was rendered terrible by an earthquake which shook
 the world to its centre the earthquake at last ceased the light
 rekindled of itself and all was as before again orlando issued
 through the dark passage again was compelled to return in search
 of the coal and again witnessed the same effect

 a third attempt was more successful he intercepted the arrow with
 his shield and carried off the light in safety using this as a
 lamp orlando arrived where the way divided and turning to the
 left instead of the right which would have conducted him out of
 the building took the road which led to the dungeons of morgana
 here were imprisoned rinaldo dudon brandimart and others who
 had fallen into the power of morgana but the count did not
 immediately arrive at their place of confinement still guiding
 himself by his light he came to a cleft in the rock through
 which he passed into a flowery meadow planted with trees covered
 with fruit and flowers and full of all imaginable delights

 in the middle of this was a fountain and fast by it lay morgana
 asleep a lady of a lovely aspect dressed in white and vermilion
 garments her forehead well furnished with hair but with scarcely
 any behind

 while orlando stood in silence contemplating her beauty he heard
 a voice exclaim "seize the fairy by the forelock if thou hopest
 fair success" orlando turning and advancing in the direction
 from which the voice came discovered a prison of crystal in which
 he beheld the captives of morgana

 at the sight of these he raised his sabre to smite the wall but
 was advertised by a female prisoner that all attempts to release
 them would only be productive of new misery to those he sought to
 benefit unless he could take morgana herself and force from her
 the keys of their prisonhouse

 thus admonished he returned towards the fountain but the fairy
 who was awake and risen was now dancing round its border with the
 lightness of a leaf and timing her steps to the following song

 "who in this world would wealth and treasure share
 "honour delight and state and what is best
 "quick let him catch me by the lock of hair
 "which flutters from my forehead and be blest
 "but let him not the proffered good forbear
 "nor till he seize the fleeting blessing rest
 "for present loss is sought in vain tomorrow
 "and the deluded wretch is left in sorrow"

 the fairy however no sooner set eyes on the count than she
 bounded off and fled from the flowery meadow over a high and
 inhospitable mountain orlando pursued her through thorns and
 rocks though the sky on her gaining this dreary scene became
 overcast and he was assailed by tempest lightning and hail

 while orlando thus pursues enveloped in storm a pale and meagre
 woman issues from a cave armed with a whip and treading close
 upon the pursuer scourges him till his skin is raised in
 furrows she informs him while she inflicts this discipline that
 she is penitence and sent to punish him for having neglected to
 seize morgana when he found her sleeping by the fountain
 orlando determined to resist this chastisement turns upon his
 tormentor but might as well seek to wound the wind convinced at
 last of the shadowy nature of his persecutor and observing that
 morgana gained upon him while he was thus hopelessly engaged he
 determines to pursue the fairy without being diverted by the
 molestation of penitence

 chasing morgana then over rock and hill he made sundry snatches
 at her white and vermilion garments which still eluded his grasp
 on the fairy however turning her head for an instant he
 profited by the chance and seized her by the forelock in an
 instant the tempest ceased the sky became serene and penitence
 retreated into her cave

 orlando now demanded of morgana the keys of her dungeon and the
 fairy feigning a complacent aspect told him that these were at
 his disposal entreating him though he should free all her other
 prisoners to leave her a youthful son of monodontes who was her
 darling orlando consented to this and the fairy delivered up a
 key of silver bidding him be cautious in the use of it since to
 break the lock would be to involve himself and all in inevitable
 destruction a caution which gave the count room for long
 meditation and led him to consider

 how few amid the suitors who importune
 the dame know how to guide the keys of fortune

 keeping the fairy still fast by the forelock orlando proceeded
 towards the prison turned the key without occasioning the
 mischief apprehended and delivered the prisoners

 amongst these were brandimart rinaldo and all the knights
 baptized or infidel who had been taken at the bridge the only
 unhappy person amid this joyous band was ziliantes the minion of
 morgana this youth remained behind weeping and time will come
 says the author when orlando will repent of having yielded to the
 entreaties of the fairy

 the others now delivered from their captivity together with
 orlando ascending a lofty stair issued into the field of
 treasure where was to be seen the king and his court all
 composed of the richest materials in the world rinaldo on
 finding himself amid this mass of wealth could not resist the
 temptation of seizing a gold seat that stood in his way which he
 observed would feed his hungry garrison of mont albano this he
 was bearing off notwithstanding the remonstrances of orlando
 when a violent wind blew him back as often as he approached the
 gate by which they were retiring rinaldo at length yielded to
 necessity rather than to the entreaties of his comrades and cast
 away his prize all now climbing another immeasurable stair
 ascended into the upper world and found themselves in the field
 decorated with their arms

 here each knight resumed his own and all except the paladins and
 their friends separated as their inclinations or duty prompted
 it was now that dudon informed the cousins that he had been made
 prisoner by morgana when in the discharge of an embassy to them
 from charlemagne who called upon them to return to the defence of
 christendom orlando is too much fascinated by angelica to obey
 this summons and followed by the faithful brandimart returns
 towards albracca rinaldo accompanied by dudon iroldo and
 prasildo takes his way towards the west

 these though unprovided with horses for their coursers were
 lost at the bridge went laughing and talking on their way their
 journey was without adventures till the sixth day when they heard
 a horn sound from a neighbouring castle from this they were
 divided by a river and near the opposite bank was a small bark
 with a damsel in the stern who proffered them a passage

 arrived on the other shore she tells them they must account for
 this with the warder who was then approaching this was an old
 man mounted on a heavy steed and surrounded by a numerous escort
 he informs the knights that they are upon the territory of the
 king monodontes from which they will not be suffered to depart
 before they have rendered him a day's service this was to avenge
 him of a certain enemy named balisardo at once a giant and
 enchanter who kept a bridge flanked with towers near the mouth
 of the river which they had crossed and who had put many scorns
 upon that monarch and those who travelled to his realm

 nothing more agreeable could have been proposed to the warriors
 and they reimbark in the damsel's skiff for the purpose of seeking
 the necromancer

 the event of the combat was however very different from what
 they had anticipated encountering the giant singly they all
 became the victims of his enchantments and were cast into his
 dungeons already peopled with illustrious knights amongst whom
 was astolpho of england

 this prince in company with the two damsels before mentioned had
 gone about the world with bayardo and rabican weeping the loss
 of rinaldo whom he saw go to the bottom of the enchanted lake
 with arridano wandering thence he had arrived on the same spot
 where rinaldo and his comrades afterwards found themselves like
 them he had ferried the river in the damsel's boat like them had
 been dispatched against balisardo and like them had been made
 prisoner by the wizard who ensnared him under the form of a
 damsel

 in the mean time orlando who had parted company with rinaldo
 and the rest was returning with brandimart towards albracca on
 his way thither he to his surprise saw marphisa in chase of
 brunello and contemplating the two was himself robbed of his
 horn and balisarda

 as both he and brandimart were on foot to chase the robber was
 useless leaving therefore marphisa still in pursuit the two
 warriors proceeded on their way pursuing this they too arrived
 at the same ferry as rinaldo had and there found two damsels
 assailing each other with reproaches the one in a boat and the
 other on horseback orlando immediately recognized the latter for
 origilla who had stolen brigliadoro and durindana previous to
 his entering the garden of orgagna his resentment however was
 forgotten on seeing her and he received her again into his
 company embarking as the others had done for the adventure of
 balisardo

 in this his usual fortune deserted him and having been vanquished
 by the enchantments of the giant he was cast on board a miserable
 prisonship in order to be transported to some distant dungeons

 from this he is however delivered by the valour of brandimart*
 who slays the giant and rescues orlando from captivity the two
 champions now interrogate the master of the prisonship who tells
 them that the wizardgiant was the instrument of a certain king
 called monodontes who dwelt in damogir an island situated in the
 ocean where he had amassed riches which surpassed the
 imagination to conceive as something is always wanting to the
 completion of human happiness this prince was miserable in the
 loss of his two only sons the first of whom was carried off in
 his childhood by a slave of the name of bardino and the second
 taken and imprisoned by a fairy named morgana who was said to be
 enamoured of the youth

 * the reader will have remarked that a vein of allegory more or
 less apparent runs through the whole of the romance this
 observation will perhaps serve to explain the defeat of orlando
 and the subsequent triumph of brandimart orlando by his love of
 vice as figured in origilla has derogated from his natural self
 and forfeited the protection of providence while brandimart the
 model of purity and constancy is proof against all the powers of
 hell

 the shipmaster pursuing his story stated that the fairy had
 offered to surrender the stripling to his father upon his putting
 her in possession of a certain knight entitled orlando with whom
 she was at enmity on account of his having destroyed her
 enchantments this the necromancer overcome by brandimart had
 offered to effect for monodontes but had never succeeded though
 he had crowded his dungeons with champions amongst whom were
 rinaldo astolpho dudon gryphon and aquilant and others too
 many to mention

 orlando listened to the narration in silence then after some
 secret conference with the shipmaster bade him make sail for
 damogir as he and brandimart were now masters of the vessel for
 he was minded to put this orlando into the hands of monodontes he
 obeys his command and the ship after traversing the ocean
 arrives with them at the island

 here the proposal was renewed by the knights and accepted by
 monodontes who waiting the accomplishment of their promise
 lodged them in a magnificent palace near his own here too was
 guested the infamous origilla who was privy to orlando's design
 she having her mind entirely set upon gryphon who it will be
 remembered was amongst the prisoners of monodontes and thinking
 she was possessed of sure means of delivering him secretly
 presented herself before the king and informed him that orlando
 was in his power

 as the covenanted reward of her service monodontes ordered
 gryphon to be delivered up to her and he refusing freedom unless
 aquilant was at the same time freed both were set at liberty and
 departed with origilla

 to take orlando was a more difficult enterprise but this was
 accomplished through the means of a potion by which both he and
 brandimart were put to sleep and while stupefied by the liquor
 lodged in the dungeons of monodontes in the solitude of their
 prison orlando converts brandimart to the christian faith and
 this knight who appears to be the type of friendship and virtuous
 love upon the guards of the monarch coming in search of orlando
 announces himself as the person sought for and as such presents
 himself to monodontes

 this monarch tells brandimart whom he imagines to be orlando
 that he seeks the liberation of his son ziliantes and as he knows
 no method of obtaining him from the fairy but by such a
 sacrifice is reluctantly compelled to offer him in exchange for
 the royal captive to which brandimart replies that if he only
 seeks this he may obtain his end without such a breach of
 hospitality as his comrade is ready to descend to the dungeons of
 morgana where he has already been and rescue him by force that
 in the meantime he will remain as his hostage and if he whom he
 is to free does not within a month return with ziliantes the
 king can at the worst accomplish the deliverance of his son by
 giving him up the king believing him to be orlando to the
 vengeance of morgana

 monodontes accedes to this proposal and the real orlando is
 suffered to depart

 in the meantime brandimart always under the name of orlando
 remains for some time a prisoner at large when the secret is
 discovered through the indiscretion of astolpho and monodontes
 in fury orders brandimart to be cast into a dungeon preparatory
 to his expiating his imposture by death orlando this while is
 bound upon his adventure and arriving at the lake formerly kept
 by arridano finds upon its banks a beautiful lady weeping over a
 dead dragon

 while orlando contemplates this spectacle with surprise the lady
 snatches up the dragon in her arms and embarks with it in a
 little pinnace which was moored hard by she now loosens from the
 shore sets her sail and having reached the middle of the lake
 sinks to the bottom with her enchanted barque

 orlando was yet absorbed in wonder at what he had witnessed when
 another damsel arrived upon the bank mounted on a palfrey and
 accompanied by a single sergeant who called upon the count by
 name and expressed the greatest pleasure at his sight

 this damsel was no other than flordelis the ladylove of
 brandimart the damsel of the barque it will be easily divined
 was morgana

 this fairy upon the departure of orlando from her enchanted
 garden transformed ziliantes by the aid of certain witcheries
 into a dragon meaning that he should supply the place of arridano
 and keep the avenues of her territory whether however from some
 error in her enchantments or other cause the transformation was
 no sooner completed than the youth uttered a shriek and expired
 hence the fairy distracted with her loss had embarked with him
 in the pinnace and descended to the bottom of the lake in the
 hope of reanimating him in her world below

 as soon as flordelis who was immediately recognised by the count
 had set eyes upon him she conjured him to lend her his
 assistance and that he might understand for what purpose
 entreated him to listen to her story which she began in the
 following words

 "i was wandering in search of brandimart when i fell in with the
 sergeant whom you see with me and who by a strange fortune
 turned out to be one who was also in search of him his story was
 yet more extraordinary than the accident which brought us
 together and is the cause of my present distress he informed me
 that he was formerly a slave of the king monodontes and named
 bardino who to avenge himself upon the monarch for some wrong
 conveyed away from him his eldest son and sold him to the lord of
 the sylvan tower who conceived such fondness for him that he
 brought him up as his son and dying left him his possessions

 "his love of arms however carried him away from the tower of
 which he had made bardino castellan and this was attacked by a
 neighbour named rupardo in his absence with such forces as
 rendered a defence hopeless under these circumstances bardino
 had cast lots to learn the fate of brandimart and found that he
 was prisoner to morgana hence it is" pursued the damsel "that i
 entreat you to lend your assistance to recover him from her
 power"

 orlando related in return what had since happened to brandimart
 and lastly how he had left him in the power of monodontes
 meaning to redeem him by the recovery of ziliantes from the
 prisons of morgana

 the damsel heard orlando's recital with gratitude and throwing
 herself on her knees prayed devoutly for the success of his
 undertaking

 he immediately entered upon his adventure descending by the
 entrance through which he had formerly ascended into the upper
 air and which he remembered though concealed by briars and
 thorns he again traversed the field of treasure and saw the
 golden seat lying in the very place where rinaldo had been
 obliged to abandon it

 thus pursuing his old path he came upon morgana near the
 fountain where he had formerly found her disporting herself

 she was this time engaged in a very different occupation and was
 caressing ziliantes who had now resumed the human form but
 remained yet pale and terrified by the effects of the
 metamorphose the count does not again neglect his opportunity
 but seizing the fairy by the forelock compels her to abandon her
 prisoner orlando returning into light with ziliantes by the
 ancient staircase finds flordelis yet engaged in prayer and now
 all journeying to the coast which was near and embarking upon
 the ocean arrive safely at damogir

 the delight of monodontes at the recovery of his two sons when he
 had despaired of even retrieving ziliantes may be easily
 imagined king and people become christians rinaldo astolpho
 dudon and the other prisoners are set at liberty all is
 festivity and the offence of bardino is forgiven in consequence
 of his subsequent attachment to brandimart to complete the
 general joy a lady arrives at this period who is recognized as
 the daughter of monodontes and the damsel of the golden apples

 but human life is chequered by light and shade the long continued
 festivities of damogir are broken in upon by dudon the dane who
 reminds the princes of their obligation to hurry to the defence of
 christendom

 rinaldo and all the franks obey the summons with the exception of
 orlando who accompanied by brandimart his inseparable
 companion returns towards albracca in the meantime rinaldo
 iroldo prasildo and the others with astolpho in the midst
 armed with his lance of gold set forward on their return to
 france

 travelling thus north about into europe the knights found
 themselves one morning in front of a beautiful castle and garden
 on the seashore this was the domain of alcina sister of
 morgana and queen of the atarberi the fay herself was standing
 on the beach and amusing herself with taking fish which she
 inveigled by her enchantments

 she herself was ensnared by the beauties of astolpho whom she
 invited to pass into a neighbouring island in order to hear the
 music of a syren who frequented it

 astolpho crosses on horseback into the island which lay close to
 the shore but this is in motion as soon as he reaches it and
 proves to be a large whale which was a minister of the fairy
 rinaldo and dudon instantly swim off to his assistance but the
 horse of dudon sinking with his rider rinaldo is compelled to
 swim bayardo to the relief of the dane whom he succeeds in
 bringing to shore meantime the whale floats out of sight and a
 terrible tempest obscures both sky and ocean

 to succour astolpho was now impossible and the confederated
 champions continued their journey to the westward

 pursuing this they at last arrived at buda in hungary whence the
 king of that country was dispatching his son ottachiero with a
 large army to the succour of charlemagne delighted with the
 arrival of rinaldo he placed his son and troops under this
 conduct and these having after long and distant marches united
 themselves with the troops of desiderius king of lombardy passed
 the genovese alps and poured down into provence

 the confederate armies had not marched many days through this gay
 tract before they heard a crash of drums and trumpets behind the
 hills which spoke the conflict between the paynims led by
 rodomont and the christian forces

 rinaldo witnessing from a mountain the prowess of rodomont
 leaves his troops in charge of his friends and gallops towards
 him with his lance in the rest the impulse is irresistible and
 rodomont is unhorsed rinaldo however in a high spirit of
 chivalry gallops back to the hill from which he had descended
 secures bayardo amongst the baggage and returns to pursue the
 combat with his former antagonist on foot

 during this interval the battle had become general the hungarians
 were routed by rodomont and rinaldo on his return had the
 mortification to find that ottachiero was wounded and dudon a
 prisoner

 he now again engages rodomont when in the midst of their strife
 a new sound of drums and trumpets was heard and the army of
 charlemagne was descried advancing in battalia

 rodomont who had in the meantime mounted the horse of dudon
 leaves rinaldo who was on foot and gallops to the attack of the
 enemy a desperate battle ensues but night separates the
 combatants

 rodomont now thinks only of rinaldo and deceived by a false
 report sets off in pursuit of him towards the forest of arden

 rinaldo however having this time gone in search of bayardo was
 returning towards the field upon that courser when he fell in
 with the saracens engaged in carrying aboard their ships the
 plunder and the prisoners made in battle some of these had
 already sailed for africa with dudon while rinaldo still seeking
 rodomont makes a tremendous carnage among the rest

 he at last learns that his adversary following a false scent is
 gone towards merlin's fountain in the forest of arden when he
 quits the pursuit of the saracens in order to follow him

 rodomont was in the meantime far advanced upon his way when he
 fell in with a strange cavalier that proved to be ferrau who
 had it seems returned to france in search of angelica the two
 knights mixing in conversation their talk according to the
 practice of chivalry turned upon love when ferrau spoke of
 doralice daughter of stordilano king of granada as a lady to
 whom he had been a suitor rodomont kindling at this avowed his
 passion for her declared he would bear with no rival in his love
 and bade him resign all pretensions to her or take his ground and
 defend himself ferrau replied that he had loved her and left
 her but that he would now love her in his despite

 a duel ensues but the author leaves the knights engaged in order
 to pursue the story of rinaldo he still seeking his pursuer
 rodomont misses him whilst he is engaged in combat with ferrau
 and wandering into a sylvan lawn in the middle of the forest of
 arden is surprised by the vision of a beautiful child dancing
 naked with three damsels as naked and as beautiful as himself
 while he is lost in admiration at the sight the child approaches
 him and smiting on his helmet with a bunch of roses and lilies
 strikes him from his horse he is no sooner down than he is seized
 by the dancers by whom he is dragged about and scourged with
 flowers till he falls into a swoon while he is yet absorbed in
 this one of the group approaches him who says her name is
 pasiphae that his punishment is the consequence of his rebellion
 against that power before whom every thing bends and that there
 is but one remedy that can heal the wounds which have been
 inflicted and this is to drink of the waters of love

 rinaldo sore and faint drags himself into the neighbouring wood
 and being parched with thirst drinks greedily and almost
 unconsciously of a spring which he finds there after repeated
 draughts of the water which is sweet to the taste but bitter at
 the heart he recovers his strength and recollection and finds
 himself in the same place where angelica had formerly awakened him
 with a rain of flowers and whence he had fled in contempt of her
 courtesy

 his remembrance of the scene is followed by the recognition of his
 crime and repenting bitterly of his ingratitude he leaps upon
 bayardo with the intention of following angelica to india and
 soliciting his pardon at her feet he has not ridden far with this
 intention when he beholds at a distance a damsel mounted upon a
 palfrey attended by a cavalier who bore a burning mountain for
 his device but before explaining who were the damsel and knight
 the author returns to marphisa lately left in pursuit of
 brunello

 she had now hunted him for fifteen days her horse had sunk under
 her during the chase and she had cast away her arms to be the
 better able to pursue him

 her pains were thrown away brunello arrived before her at the
 seaside and finding a vessel ready to sail embarked and
 arrived at biserta in africa here he found agramant who was
 impatient for the ring which was to foil the enchantments of
 atlantes and to put rogero into his hands the dwarf now kneeling
 before the king related his story and presented him with the
 ring of angelica and the horn stolen from orlando when agramant
 delighted at the success of his mission crowned him in
 recompense king of tingitana

 all are now anxious to go in quest of rogero nor will brunello be
 left behind the cavalcade accordingly departs and having
 traversed the great desert arrives at the mountain of carena

 at the bottom of this was a fruitful and wellwooded plain
 watered by a large river which traversed it in its way to the
 sea and from this plain was descried a beautiful garden on the
 mountaintop which contained the mansion of atlantes but the
 ring which discovered what was before invisible could not
 though it revealed this paradise enable agramant or his followers
 to enter it so steep and smooth was the rock by nature that none
 could scale it and even brunello was obliged to renounce the
 attempt he did not however for this despair of accomplishing
 the object of the enterprise and having obtained agramant's
 approbation caused the assembled courtiers and knights to
 celebrate a tournament upon the plain below this was done with
 the view of seducing rogero from his fastness and the stratagem
 was attended with success

 rogero joins the tourney presented by brunello with sacripant's
 horse frontilatte whose name is afterwards changed into
 frontino and with balisarda the sword of orlando in the medley
 he is treacherously wounded but avenges himself of the traitor
 and returning to the summit of the mountain is healed by the
 skill and attention of atlantes having previously learned from
 brunello the preparations which were making for the invasion of
 france and having indeed received his horse and arms as an
 earnest for his service in the expedition

 the author now leaves him again on the mountain of carena to
 accompany orlando and brandimart

 these two having separated from rinaldo astolpho and the rest
 were pursuing their journey through india when they found
 themselves near a stone situated by a fountain where sate a
 lady having her eyes fixed upon the ground while a bridge which
 divided two roads hard by was kept by an armed knight

 while orlando and brandimart were engaged in a friendly contest
 who should first encounter him a pilgrim advanced towards the
 bridge notwithstanding the prohibition of him who kept it and
 finding that the knight approached in order to enforce his threat
 cast off his pilgrim's slough and showed that he was armed cap�pe
 a fierce combat now ensued between him and the warder of the
 bridge whom both brandimart and orlando thought they had seen
 before but could not recognise through the strangeness of his
 disguise in this strife the pilgrim at last succeeded in making
 the warder give ground and retire slowly from his post

 on the other side of the bridge and near the fountain which
 formed the stream was a monument which an inscription proclaimed
 to be the sepulchre of narcissus

 contemplating himself in the neighbouring fountain he had pined
 away and his death was productive of new calamities the fairy
 silvanella as her evil destiny would have it passing near the
 body fell in love with the dead youth whom she entombed in this
 mausoleum of alabaster here too consumed by hopeless passion
 _she_ perished and left this dying curse upon the waters that
 who contemplated them should see pourtrayed there such a vision of
 beauty that they should become incapable of departing from the
 place

 many who had arrived upon the banks of the river in consequence
 of her malediction remained gazing upon the stream till they
 expired among these was the gentle king larbino who came there
 with his leman calidora who remained inconsolable for his loss
 and took up her dwelling in the meadow where he died this is
 she who sits weeping by the waterside and whose champion
 maintains the bridge against all comers

 and such was the tale she told orlando whom she conjured in
 favour of her pious intentions to aid her cavalier hard pressed
 by the pilgrim

 orlando moved by her prayer thrust himself between the
 combatants whom he separated and recognized one for sacripant
 and the other for isoliero isoliero had accompanied the lady from
 spain to india for the purpose of rendering her this service and
 sacripant had been dispatched as was said by angelica to king
 gradasso for assistance towards whose kingdom he was now upon
 his way

 when the count had learned from this monarch the object of his
 journey and the peril of angelica he fled with brandimart from
 the dangerous water mindful of the fate of those that had
 perished there leaving isoliero who had been severely wounded by
 sacripant in the company of calidora

 while orlando took his way to albracca sacripant took up the
 pilgrim's garb and staff and pursued his towards the kingdom of
 gradasso

 orlando arriving before albracca finds it closely beleaguered
 he however makes his way into the citadel and relates his
 adventures to angelica from the time of his departure up to his
 separation from rinaldo and the rest when they departed to the
 assistance of charlemagne angelica in return described the
 distresses of the garrison and the force of the besiegers and in
 conclusion prayed orlando to favour her escape from the pressing
 danger and escort her into france orlando who did not suspect
 that love for rinaldo who had returned thither was her secret
 motive joyfully agreed to the proposal and the sally was
 resolved

 leaving lights burning in the fortress they departed at nightfall
 and passed in safety through the enemy's camp on the
 ensuing day however the besiegers discovered the deceit stormed
 and sacked the citadel and then pursued the deserters

 of these orlando went first escorting angelica and flordelis
 while brandimart covered their retreat in consequence of this
 arrangement brandimart was separated one night from his
 companions while orlando and the two damsels were advancing on
 their way

 as these last sorely tormented by hunger were entering a valley
 at sunset they saw at the other extremity a party of
 lestrigonians seated at their supper and immediately galloped
 towards them orlando first but followed by the damsels arriving
 amongst these cannibals he prayed them either for courtesy or
 hire to give them food and being received with a feigned
 hospitality had already dismounted from his horse in order to
 take some refreshment when the leader of the party coming behind
 him dealt a blow with his club that laid him senseless on the
 ground the damsels who had just come up terrified at this
 catastrophe fled different ways pursued by a party of the
 lestrigonians

 during this time the others had stript orlando of his arms and
 were handling him to see if he was fat when he was awakened by
 the operation possessing himself of durindana he soon cleared
 the field of the cannibals and was seeking an outlet from the
 valley when he recognized angelica hunted by those who had
 pursued her and flordelis to save her and avenge her of the
 miscreants was the work of a moment

 it was said that the two damsels separated in their flight in
 directing which chance conducted each towards her natural
 protector for flordelis flying east whilst angelica fled west
 galloped towards a wood where brandimart was sleeping after
 having long sought his companions in vain brandimart was as
 prompt in rescuing her as orlando was in saving angelica it is
 needless to describe his transports on this occasion these were
 however of short duration and he heard with the bitterest
 regret the narrative of flordelis who relating what she
 believed she had witnessed informed him she had left orlando dead
 upon the field

 returning with brandimart towards the spot where she had left the
 count a strange adventure for a long time delayed their search
 for they had not ridden far before they fell in with a cavalier
 on foot unarmed except as to his sword who defied brandimart to
 battle and while he in a spirit of generosity refused the
 challenge snatched flordelis from her palfrey and running up a
 steep rock with his burden threatened to throw her down a
 precipice unless brandimart ransomed her with his armour and his
 steed

 as brandimart's armour rendered it impossible for him to pursue
 he consented to the sacrifice and the stranger appropriated the
 spoils this was marphisa who had thrownby her arms in order to
 pursue brunello and who finding the chace hopeless took this
 method to equip herself anew

 brandimart now reduced to his tunick and deprived of his
 courser mounted the damsel's palfrey seated her on the croup
 and proceeded on his way

 they were doomed to experience new dangers and interruptions for
 journeying thus they fell in with a band of robbers from whom
 brandimart fled in the hope of finding some means of defence his
 hope was realized for penetrating a wood he arrived at a
 fountain near which a king lay dead who was armed capape
 providing himself with his sword brandimart turned to bay and
 soon made his pursuers repent of their temerity these slain or
 put to flight he clothed himself reluctantly in the other arms of
 the monarch leaving him his crown and regal ornaments this king
 was no other than agrican so preserved by a visible miracle

 an aftercombat with the captain of these corsairs put the knight
 in possession of a steed and thus reequipt he accompanied
 flordelis in search of orlando

 this paladin having recovered angelica as has been related had
 journeyed as far homeward as the seacoast of syria without
 impediment here he found a vessel ready to carry the king of
 damascus norandino to the island of cyprus where he was to make
 his first essay of arms

 this was to be made for love of a lady whose name was lucina and
 whose father tibiano was king of cyprus this sovereign had
 proclaimed a tournament of which the princess was to be the
 prize and thither went norandino who invited orlando to
 accompany him the count disguising his name and country and
 feigning himself a circassian called rotolante accepted the
 offer and together with angelica joined norandino who was
 accompanied by a brilliant train of adventurers he was scarcely
 on shipboard before a breeze sprang up from the land and the
 galley was under sail

 for the tournament which was preparing many greeks and many
 pagans had assembled among whom were basaldo and morbeco turks
 and gostanzo a greek this gostanzo was the son of vataron
 emperor of constantinople and had brought gryphon and aquilant in
 his company who together with origilla had sought the
 hospitality of the grecian court

 in the tourney the combatants are ranged under the banner of this
 gostanzo on the one side and that of norandino on the other
 gryphon and aquilant serve under the first and orlando under the
 second they are however disguised from each other by borrowed
 devices and gryphon only suspects a knight who bore away the
 honors of the first day to be orlando from his superior prowess
 and from the presence of angelica whom he had observed seated
 amongst the ladies that honoured the spectacle with their
 presence

 imparting his suspicions to gostanzo after the trumpets had blown
 to lodging the wily greek determined to rid himself of so
 formidable an adversary he accordingly introduced himself
 secretly to orlando and informed him of a treason which as he
 said the king of cyprus meditated against him at the instigation
 of ganelon offering him at the same time the means of escape
 this was a pinnace moored in a creek in which orlando breathing
 vengeance against the maganzese embarked with angelica for
 france

 disembarking in provence they pursued their way by land and
 arriving hot and weary in the forest of arden where rinaldo had
 lately drunk of the fountain of love chance directed angelica to
 the waters of disdain of which she drank

 issuing thence the count and damsel encountered a stranger
 knight this was no other than rinaldo who had missed rodomont
 then engaged in combat with ferrau and who on a nearer approach
 recognised angelica with joy though his new arms and ensigns
 disguised orlando who accompanied her the consequences of such a
 meeting are easily foreseen angelica views rinaldo with disgust
 and a new cause of strife is kindled between the kinsmen

 terrified at the combat which ensued angelica fled amain through
 the forest and came out upon a plain covered with tents this
 was the camp of charlemagne who led the army of reserve destined
 to support the troops which had advanced to oppose the descent of
 rodomont charles having heard the damsel's tale with difficulty
 separates the two cousins and then consigns angelica as the
 cause of quarrel to the care of namus duke of bavaria promising
 she shall be _his_ who best deserves her in the first battle with
 the saracens

 the author here returns to agramant who was left holding a
 tournament at the foot of mount carena in africa he having heard
 of the knight who was slain and _that_ contrary to his orders
 which were only to employ courteous weapons determined to take
 vengeance upon his murderer and supposing brunello to be the
 criminal since rogero had appeared with his arms and steed
 ordered him to be hanged upon the spot

 the danger of him who was about to suffer for his sake now again
 brought rogero from his retreat he routed the troops appointed to
 watch over the execution rescued brunello and then presenting
 himself to agramant related every thing as it had passed

 agramant too happy to find the object of his search in the youth
 who had performed such wonders forgave the death of the
 slaughtered cavalier knighted rogero and carried him off to
 biserta where his vassal kings and barons assembled for the
 invasion of christendom

 while they are in the midst of their revelry a messenger reports
 the return of rodomont's fleet whose followers brought with them
 as a prisoner dudon the dane but could give no account of
 rodomont their leader

 he was this while engaged in battle with ferrau with whom we left
 him quarrelling about doralice but their strife was soon
 interrupted by the arrival of a messenger who brought news that
 marsilius was at the instigation of ganelon besieging mount
 albano on hearing this the duellists make peace and ride
 together to join the besiegers

 on their way they fall in with vivian and malagigi sons of duke
 aymon of mount albano who are proceeding towards paris to
 demand succour of charlemagne and malagigi retiring with vivian
 into a wood performs a magic rite by which he ascertains the
 design of the approaching warriors rodomont and ferrau to
 frustrate this he conjures up a bevy of fiends armed and mounted
 as knights divides them into two squadrons takes the command of
 one himself and gives that of the other to vivian thus
 accompanied the christian knights charge their adversaries but
 the pagans are too strong for them take malagigi and vivian
 prisoners and send their demons howling back to hell

 here the author exclaims

 but that i would not seem with folly tainted
 i own i would have fain beheld the attack
 so great is my desire to be acquainted
 with those the wizard brought his cause to back
 and prove with my own eyes if truly painted
 the devil be so very foul and black
 more that his pictures differ as to nail
 and horn and hoof and length and breadth of tail

 to return to the story rodomont and ferrau arrive in the spanish
 camp before mount albano which is shortly afterwards attacked by
 the army of charlemagne divers feats of prowess are achieved on
 both sides but the most interesting circumstance is a single
 combat between rodomont and bradamant which the author breaks off
 in order to resume the story of brandimart

 this knight having obtained a steed and armour as has been
 before related proceeds with flordelis towards europe

 thus journeying the pair arrived in front of a magnificent
 palace here a damsel standing in a balcony motioned to them to
 take another way but in vain for brandimart feigning not to
 understand the purport of her signs rode boldly up to the gate
 he is now opposed by a giant armed with a serpent which he uses
 as a sword him the knight vanquishes after a long battle in
 which he is opposed by a variety of enchantments the giant and
 serpent exchanging forms as one or the other is slain he next
 kills a knight who kept a sepulchre in the inner court and
 opposed his further progress

 he and flordelis who had followed her lover now seek the gate by
 which they had entered but all appearance of it was lost

 while they are vainly seeking the means of escape they are
 addressed by the damsel who had at first waved them from the
 palace and who informed brandimart he must open the sepulchre
 and kiss whatever issued from it if he expected deliverance from
 his prison brandimart little terrified by the injunction
 promised compliance but started back and put his hand to his
 sword on the appearance of a dragon reproached by the damsel of
 the castle for his breach of promise he manned his spirits for
 the encounter and kissed the monster in the mouth a sudden cold
 ran through his bones at coming in contact with her but what was
 his surprise on seeing the dragon transformed into a beautiful
 damsel

 this was a fay so transmuted who grateful for her deliverance
 offered to enchant the horse and arms of brandimart at the same
 time entreating him to conduct the lady of the castle who was
 named doristella into syria

 this promised the gate reappeared the fay enchanted the steed
 and arms of brandimart and he accompanied by the two ladies
 departed upon the quest enjoined

 they had ridden some time in silence when doristella rallying
 the knight for his taciturnity proposed to beguile the way with
 the relation of her adventures the offer was gratefully received
 and the damsel began her story as follows�

 "my father king doliston" said she "had two daughters the
 eldest of whom while yet a child was carried off by a thief from
 the shore of lissa of this daughter who was the promised spouse
 of theodore the son of a neighbouring king nothing was ever
 afterwards heard"

 "and what was the name of the mother" exclaimed flordelis but
 brandimart having checked her for her interruption doristella
 continued her narrative in her own way "my intended brotherinlaw"
 said the damsel "still kept up his connection with my
 family and he and i soon became mutually enamoured of one
 another the young man at length unbosomed himself to my father
 and demanded me in marriage but my father to his mortification
 told him that he had that very day promised me to the wretch
 whom you slew in the palace

 "to this wretch named usbeck of bursa a turcoman by nation was
 i wedded a man valiant in the field but as to the rest little
 capable of winning a lady's love this man who was jealous in
 proportion to the grounds he gave me for disgust was compelled to
 join an expedition against vatarone the emperor of greece
 departing he left me in care of a slave called gambone a monster
 of deformity whom he commanded never to stir from my side he had
 not been long absent when theodore arrived at bursa and having
 corrupted gambone obtained access to my bed

 "our intercourse was long continued to our mutual satisfaction
 when usbeck arrived suddenly one night at bursa and demanded
 instant entrance into his house our courage did not desert us
 under these circumstances and theodore slipping down stairs in
 the dark escaped at the same time that usbeck was admitted our
 danger however did not end here for my husband's suspicions had
 been awakened by his detention at the door and searching every
 part of my chamber he found a mantle which my lover had left
 behind him in his retreat

 "his suspicions being now confirmed he burst into a transport of
 jealous fury and ordered the slave gambone for instant execution
 according to the custom of the country his other slaves were
 conducting him for that purpose through the city with a horn
 sounding before him when theodore met the procession and falling
 upon the criminal reproached him amid a shower of blows with
 having robbed him of his mantle this trick of theodore's who was
 unknown to usbeck saved the slave and effaced the suspicions
 which he entertained of my fidelity new offences however on my
 part for i still continued my intercourse with theodore renewed
 his jealousy and he at last shut me up in the enchanted palace
 whence you delivered me though it was not then kept by the giant
 and serpent which were the afterwork of a necromancer who wrought
 for him"

 the damsel was here interrupted by an outcry and the party was
 instantly set upon by thieves these were however beaten off
 and their leader taken prisoner by brandimart he throwing
 himself at the feet of the cavalier entreated him not to carry
 him to lissa as he dreaded the vengeance of doliston the prince
 of that country for having formerly carried off his eldest
 daughter whom he had sold to the lord of the sylvan tower

 brandimart however who has secret reasons as will be shortly
 seen for being pleased at this account insists upon carrying him
 to lissa and arriving before doliston's capital finds it
 besieged by theodore in revenge for the monarch's having refused
 him doristella all now is cleared up flordelis turns out to be
 the missing daughter of doliston who had been wooed by brandimart
 in the sylvan tower and no further obstacle existing to the union
 of theodore and doristella these two as well as brandimart and
 flordelis are united in marriage doliston and theodora having
 previously made peace

 after long festivities in honour of these double espousals
 brandimart and flordelis still anxious to pursue orlando embark
 for france with a prosperous wind this however changes
 increases to a tempest and finally drives them on the shores of
 carthage here brandimart less anxious for his own safety than
 for that of flordelis and his companions conceals his being a
 christian and announcing himself only as son of monodontes king
 of the distant isles declares that it was his purpose to visit
 agramant in biserta

 he accordingly sets off always attended by flordelis for that
 capital where he is magnificently received and is afterwards
 carried off by agramant together with rogero on his expedition
 against france

 agramant leaving dudon a prisoner at large in biserta which was
 to be governed in his absence by a viceroy embarks upon his long
 meditated enterprise disembarks in spain and arrives by forced
 marches near mount albano in the neighbourhood of which the
 armies of charlemagne and marsilius were left engaged

 the strife was still continued with unabated fury and in this
 rinaldo was matched with ferrau king grandonio with the marquis
 oliviero serpentine with ogier the dane and marsilius himself
 against charlemagne

 these duels were however of little account compared with that
 which raged between rodomont and bradamant of this desperate
 contest orlando was a witness who would not turn his arms against
 rodomont while he was engaged with so formidable an adversary

 while orlando thus played the part of a lookeron he was
 surprised by the sound of an approaching enemy and casting his
 eyes in that direction saw a plump of spears with banners and
 pennons descending the sides of a mountain he immediately
 stooped from his saddle to pick up a weighty lance which was lying
 on the ground and thus prepared himself for the encounter of what
 proved to be the army of agramant

 this sovereign had in the meantime dispatched one of his vassal
 kings named pinadoro towards the field of battle with orders to
 bring him one or more prisoners who might inform him of the state
 of the christian army pinadoro and orlando meet and tilt
 together but the feudatory king instead of accomplishing the
 orders of his sovereign remains the prisoner of the count he is
 however no sooner taken than liberated by his conqueror who bids
 him return to his army in peace the report of his ill success
 does not frighten agramant from his purpose and the moorish army
 descends like a torrent into the plain

 at the sight of these new enemies charles left marsilius who was
 closely pressed by him and ordered rinaldo also to give a respite
 to ferrau and lead a squadron against the approaching troops
 whom he divined to be what they really were other divisions of
 the army followed in support of one another and a bloody battle
 ensued with various and very doubtful success

 meantime orlando who wished such measure of misfortune to
 charlemagne as should make his assistance necessary and ensure
 him the possession of angelica as his reward had retired from the
 medley into a neighbouring wood and was praying devoutly for the
 discomfiture of the christians by accident ferrau fatigued by
 his long contest with rinaldo and lately as hard pressed by him
 as marsilius was by charlemagne had sought shelter in the same
 retreat here stooping to drink from the banks of a river he
 dropt his helmet in the water and was engaged in a vain attempt
 to recover it when he was discovered by orlando the count
 however was too generous to attack an enemy under such
 disadvantages and weakened as ferrau evidently was by the combat
 he had previously waged against rinaldo he accordingly after a
 short conference with him in which he learned the state of
 things spurred his courser in order to join the army of
 charlemagne

 here he performs high feats of valour and after the slaughter of
 many adversaries is advancing against rogero when atlantes who
 had accompanied the youth since he could not restrain him from
 following his destiny diverts orlando from his object by the
 vision of a triumphant pagan squadron and of the personal danger
 of charlemagne fascinated by this illusion he follows the
 supposed saracens into the forest of arden here the vision
 disappears and the count wearied with the fruitless chace
 lights from brigliadoro near a fountain stooping to drink he
 sees a crystal palace at the bottom through the walls of which he
 beholds a dance of ladies and unable to resist the temptation of
 an adventure plunges armed as he is into the fountain


 the orlando innamorato
 book iii
 argument

 the third book opens with the introduction of a new character
 mandricardo son of agrican the tartar king who pursuing his
 way to france in order to avenge his father's death is made the
 prisoner of a fairy he frees himself acquires the arms of
 hector and is as well as other knights involved in various
 adventures till the story returns to the invasion of france
 which is suddenly interrupted in the middle


 book iii

 the author opens this book by stating that he is called away to
 the north here a mighty storm was gathering and france already
 sorebested was suddenly threatened by a new storm from the
 remote quarter of tartary

 the emperor of this region named mandricardo having wasted it by
 his violences was proceeding in a course of imperious tyranny
 when an old man threw himself in his way and reproaching him
 with his outrages bade him desist from warring upon the innocent
 and defenceless and seek to revenge the death of his father upon
 one who was worthy of his wrath to wit upon orlando the
 murderer of king agrican

 stung to the heart by the old man's reproaches mandricardo
 determining to owe his success in the enterprise on which he
 resolved to his own individual valour leaves his kingdom
 incognito and departs without horse or arms towards the west
 travelling thus alone and afoot he had passed the confines of
 armenia when he spied upon a day a pavilion pitched near a
 fountain and imagining that he might there find what he was
 determined to win by force entered it with the view of searching
 for the horse and arms of which he stood in need there was none
 to defend the entrance and he was already within the pavilion
 when a voice was heard to murmur from the waters that he was a
 prisoner to the power whose possession he had violated

 mandricardo however heard not or else disregarded the voice
 and pursuing his search found a suit of armour disposed upon a
 carpet and a courser fastened to a neighbouring pine

 he immediately clothed himself in the arms and seized upon the
 steed with which he was departing when a fire suddenly sprang up
 before him that spreading itself destroyed the pine and left
 the fountain and pavilion alone untouched mandricardo is himself
 embraced by the flames which destroy his armour and clothing even
 to his shirt to escape the torture he leaps from his horse
 every thing which he had on him being consumed and casts himself
 into the water here he is received into the arms of a naked
 damsel of incomparable beauty who kisses him and bids him be of
 good cheer informing him that he is taken in the snare of a
 fairy but that if he has heart and discretion he may rescue not
 only himself but so many damsels and cavaliers that he shall
 reap immortal glory from the achievement

 she pursued her story informing him that the fountain was the
 work of a fairy who had imprisoned there king gradasso of
 sericane gryphon and aquilant and many other knights and ladies
 "beyond the hill" said she "which you see before you is
 situated a castle where this fairy has laid up the arms of
 hector with the exception of his sword on his being slain
 treacherously by achilles a queen named penthesilea possessed
 herself of this at her death it passed to almontes and from him
 was taken by orlando this weapon was called durindana the
 remainder of his arms was saved and carried off by �neas from
 whom they were received by her in recompence of a marvellous
 service which she had bestowed upon him if you have the courage
 to attempt the acquisition of these arms secured in yonder castle
 by enchantment i will be your guide"

 mandricardo was enraptured at the proposal and only hesitated at
 the idea of exposing himself naked this difficulty was however
 got over by the lady who letting down her hair which was bound
 about her head in braids furnished a complete covering for
 herself and the cavalier being sheltered from sight by this they
 issued linked arm in arm from the water and took their way
 together to the pavilion

 entering this which as was said remained untouched by the fire
 they reposed for some time upon flowers at length the damsel gave
 the signal for departure and having clothed mandricardo in
 armour conducted him where a courser was in waiting upon this he
 leapt all armed as he was and the lady having mounted on a
 palfrey both set forward on their enterprise

 they had ridden about a mile when the damsel explaining the
 dangers of the quest informed mandricardo that he would have to
 combat with gradasso the conqueror of gryphon who had at first
 maintained the field against all comers

 thus speaking they arrived at the castle which was of alabaster
 overlaid with gold before this on a lawn enclosed with a
 barrier of live myrtles sat an armed knight on horseback and who
 was no other than gradasso mandricardo upon seeing him dropt
 his vizor and laid his lance in the rest the champion of the
 castle was as ready and each spurred towards his opponent they
 splintered their spears with equal force and again returning to
 the charge encountered with their swords this contest was long
 and doubtful when mandricardo determining to bring it to an
 issue threw his arms about gradasso and the two horsemen
 grappling together tumbled to the ground in the struggle
 however mandricardo fell uppermost and preserving his advantage
 made gradasso prisoner the damsel now interfered proclaiming the
 victory of the new comer and consoling the vanquished as she
 could for his discomfiture

 in the meantime the sun had set upon the strife and it was too
 late for mandricardo to enter the enchanted castle which the
 damsel informed him would be only accessible after sunrise she
 invites him therefore to lie down amongst the flowers with which
 the meadow is enamelled proffering to be his guard but informs
 him that there is harbourage to be obtained at a neighbouring
 castle though it can only be purchased by exposure to notable
 peril this she says is kept by a kind and courteous lady who
 is often disturbed in the exercise of her hospitality by a giant
 named malapresa whom he would do well to avoid as he has already
 sufficient toil and danger on his hands

 mandricardo rejects this kind intimation and insists upon being
 guided to the lady's lodging

 he and the damsel accordingly set off in that direction and soon
 arrive at the palace which is illuminated with a thousand lights
 it appeared as if a watch was kept for friends or foes and a
 dwarf was posted in a gallery over the entrance whose duty it was
 to give notice of all comers on the winding of his horn if there
 were cause for suspicion the household armed with missile
 weapons assembled in the balconies but if it were an errant
 knight in search of hospitality damsels came forth to salute
 him and conduct him into the castle

 in this manner was mandricardo received who was afterwards
 magnificently entertained by the lady of the mansion their
 festivity is however interrupted by the dwarf's horn which
 sounds an alarum the signal is hardly given before malapresa has
 forced the gate and appears in the middle of the guests armed
 with an enormous mace a furious combat now ensues between him and
 the tartar king in which the giant is slain and cast into the
 castle ditch this event occasions only a short interruption of
 the festivity which is prolonged late into the night the
 revellers at length retire and mandricardo amongst the rest who
 is as magnificently lodged as he had been feasted by the lady of
 the castle

 at sunrise he starts from his couch descends into the castlegarden
 washes himself at a fountain then puts on his armour
 and guided by his former conductress proceeds upon his
 enterprise

 on arriving at the eastern entrance of the outer wall of the
 enchanted castle which was not more magnificent than extensive
 and which entrance mandricardo found undefended he was informed
 that he must plight an oath upon the threshold to touch a shield
 which was suspended there from a pilaster of gold the bearing of
 this was a white eagle on an azure field in memory of the bird of
 jove who bore away ganymede the flower of the phrygian race
 beneath was engraved the following legend

 let none with hand profane my buckler wrong
 unless he be himself as hector strong

 the damsel immediately alighting from her palfrey inclined
 herself to the ground the tartar king bent himself with equal
 reverence and afterwards passed the threshold without an
 obstacle

 advancing through the eastern entrance of the enclosure towards
 the shield mandricardo touched it with his sword an earthquake
 immediately shook the place and the way by which he had entered
 closed another and an opposite gate however opened and
 displayed a field bristling with stalks and grain of gold the
 damsel upon this told him that he who had entered had no means of
 departure but by cutting down the harvest which was before him
 and in uprooting a tree which grew in the middle of the field the
 champion without answering prepared himself for his work and
 immediately began to mow the harvest with his sword a strange
 effect followed and every grain was instantly transformed into
 some ravenous animal�lion panther or unicorn who all flew in
 fury at the reaper

 mandricardo thus assailed snatched up a stone without knowing
 what virtue resided in it and cast it amongst the herd this
 stone was partycoloured green vermilion white azure and gold
 a strange wonder followed for it no sooner lighted amongst the
 beasts than they turned their rage one against the other and
 perished by mutual wounds mandricardo did not stop to marvel at
 the miracle but proceeded to fulfil his task and uproot the
 tree this which was lofty and full of leaves he embraced by the
 trunk making vigorous efforts to tear it up by the roots at each
 of these fell a shower of leaves which were instantly changed
 into birds of prey who attacked the knight as the beasts had
 done before undismayed however by this new annoyance he
 continued to tug at the trunk till it yielded to his efforts a
 burst of wind and thunder followed and the hawks and vultures
 were dispersed

 these however only gave place to a new foe for from the hole
 made by tearing up the tree issued a furious serpent with many
 tails who darted at mandricardo wound herself about his limbs
 and was about to devour him fortune however again stood his
 friend for writhing under the folds of the monster and
 struggling to free himself he fell backwards into the hole and
 his enemy was crushed beneath his weight

 mandricardo when he had somewhat recovered from the shock and
 assured himself of the destruction of the dragon began to
 contemplate the place into which he had fallen and saw that he
 was in a vault encrusted with costly metals and illuminated by a
 live coal in the middle was a sort of ivory bier and upon this
 was extended what appeared to be a knight in armour but what was
 in truth an empty trophy composed of the rich and precious arms
 once hector's and to which nothing was wanting but the sword
 while mandricardo stood contemplating the prize a door opened
 behind him and a bevy of fair damsels entered dancing who bore
 him away to the place where the shield was suspended and where he
 found the fairy of the castle seated in state by her he was
 invested with the arms which he had won he first swearing at her
 injunction to wear no other blade but the sword durindana which
 he was to ravish from orlando and thus complete the conquest of
 hector's arms

 the adventure was now accomplished and the champion departed in
 order to achieve the great purpose for which he left his realm of
 tartary many illustrious knights issued at the same time from the
 dungeons of the fairy who had remained prisoners on a failure of
 their enterprise and who had been now liberated by his success
 amongst these were gradasso isolier sacripant gryphon and
 aquilant with many others

 mandricardo himself pursued his journey in company with gradasso
 of the others gryphon and aquilant who knew the language of the
 saracens travelled through strange countries and thus journeying
 along the seashore fell in with two damsels the one clothed in
 white and the other in black and attended by two dwarfs as the
 colour of their respective ladies such was that of their dwarfs
 and of the palfreys which they rode saving in this they were so
 alike as to be undistinguishable one from the other and were
 equals in beauty and grace

 "sister" said one of these addressing herself to her companion
 "there is no defence against destiny yet wisdom may in some sort
 controul fortune then let us detain these at least awhile from
 the fate which is reserved for them in france"�thus spoke the
 sable to the white damsel unheard of the two knights who were
 approaching and who saluted them with all the courtesy due to
 their bearing and appearance

 one of the ladies demanded a boon of the two cavaliers who both
 as instantly vowed to perform whatever was enjoined them this was
 to take the field against a miscreant named orrilo engendered of
 a goblin and fairy who inhabited a tower upon the nile where he
 kept says the story a kind of dragon termed a crocodile and
 fed it with human flesh the damsels go on to state that hitherto
 no one has been able to prevail against the wretch who in dying
 renews himself like the ph�nix this account does not discourage
 the brothers who again proffer their assistance

 aquilant accordingly encounters orrilo where he keeps the way
 against travellers and he being sore pressed flies to the tower
 and turns out his crocodile

 gryphon now deems himself justified in assisting his brother and
 the crocodile is at length slain orrilo however though often
 worsted appears to be irresistible for though he is frequently
 unhorsed and is actually severed into two parts by one of the
 brothers he constantly reunites himself and renews the contest
 the day is now closing and the two brothers are in despair

 while things are in this state a new performer appears upon the
 theatre this is a knight who dragged a giant captive but here
 the author leaves gryphon and aquilant as well as the knight and
 his prisoner and resumes the story of mandricardo and gradasso
 who were left journeying together towards france

 this pair after traversing various regions arrive upon the seacoast
 where they find a lady chained and exposed upon the beach
 on their interrogating her she tells them that she awaits the
 approach of a furious ork who will devour her alive and entreats
 them as an act of compassion rather to put her to an immediate
 death than to leave her exposed to so horrible a fate the only
 favour that she requests of them besides this dreadful grace is
 should they fall in with him to inform norandino king of
 damascus of her death and dying sentiments of affection to him

 the knights however insist on defending her and a dreadful
 conflict ensues between them and the ork who is represented as
 something indistinct monstrous and gigantic gradasso is soon
 overpowered and mandricardo who in conformity to his vow was
 unprovided with a sword is obliged to fly before the pest

 he however finds his deliverance in flight for speeding his
 steps along the cliffs he arrives at a frightful chasm at which
 he springs in utter desperation the ork following him is unable
 to clear it and tumbles down the abyss

 mandricardo quit of his foe descends to the shore in search of
 gradasso and lucina for so was named the lady chained to the
 rock and proceeds in company with them along the beach from
 this they behold a ship in the distance which bears the flag of
 tibiano king of cyprus and rhodes the father of lucina and who
 was then seeking his daughter lucina overjoyed at the sight
 makes a signal of her vest and waves the galley to the land on
 board this she embarks together with her defenders but the
 vessel has scarcely shown her stern to the shore when the ork reappears
 with a monstrous fragment of a mountain on his shoulders
 this he heaves into the sea which flashes above her topmast head
 and all cower at the bottom of the vessel for refuge but the mass
 misses the mark at which it was hurled and a loud landwind
 rising at the moment the vessel is blown off to sea

 one danger is only substituted for another the storm increases
 and all is darkness and dismay in this situation the night
 closes in during which they drift at the mercy of the winds the
 succeeding day dawns upon them under better auspices and they
 find themselves in the morning upon the shore of acquamorta
 where a mountain separates france and spain

 here they land in the neighbourhood of a cave called runa
 without having any knowledge of the coast upon which they are
 cast leaving there tibiano and lucina gradasso and mandricardo
 proceed armed and mounted in search of intelligence

 they have not proceeded far before they hear the noise of battle
 and pushing their horses towards the sound find agramant engaged
 with charlemagne

 the main story is thus brought back to the point where the
 christian and paynim armies were left and where the tide of
 conquest was fluctuating between the hostile forces retiring from
 the medley ferrau had withdrawn into a neighbouring wood and was
 fishing for his helmet in a stream in which he had lost it as he
 stooped to drink at this period fortune declares decisively in
 favour of the infidels and while rogero and rinaldo are engaged
 in a single combat on foot charlemagne's forces give way at all
 points in irreparable confusion

 the duel of the two champions is interrupted by the crowd of
 fugitives and pursuers and rinaldo now seeing bayardo loose in
 the field attempts to get possession of him the horse however
 will not be taken and rinaldo following him into a thick wood
 is left there by the author who returns to rogero

 rogero was also afoot and grieving for the loss of his own
 horse frontino whom he however recovered in the rout he now
 finds bradamant and rodomont engaged in combat though he knew not
 who they were he could distinguish that one was a paynim and the
 other a christian and moved by the spirit of courtesy
 approached them and exclaimed "let him of the two who worships
 christ pause and hear what i have to say the army of charles is
 routed and in flight so that if he wishes to follow his leader
 he has no time for delay" bradamant who is thunderstruck with
 the tidings desires immediately to leave the field but this is
 refused by her antagonist and rogero indignant at his
 discourtesy insists upon her departure while he takes up the
 quarrel with rodomont

 this long and obstinately maintained on both sides is
 interrupted by the return of bradamant who not being able to
 overtake the fugitives and being divided in her feelings as to
 what she owed on the one side to her emperor and on the other to
 the stranger who had so generously taken her part yields at last
 to what was the stronger impulse and comes back to his
 assistance

 she arrives however when he was least in need of it and when he
 had smote his enemy such a blow as obliged him to drop both his
 sword and bridle rogero however disdaining to profit by his
 defenceless situation sate apart upon his horse whilst that of
 rodomont bore his rider stunned and stupefied about the field

 rogero was at this juncture approached by bradamant who conceived
 a yet higher notion of his valour on beholding such an instance
 of forbearance she addressed him by excusing herself for leaving
 him exposed to an enemy from his interference in her cause
 pleading her attachment to her sovereign as the motive and was
 engaged in conference with him when rodomont recovered from his
 confusion his bearing was however changed and he disclaimed all
 thoughts of further contest with one "who he said had already
 vanquished him by his courtesy" so saying he quitted his
 antagonist picked up his sword and spurred out of sight

 bradamant was now again desirous of retiring from the field and
 rogero insisted on accompanying her though yet unconscious of her
 sex

 as they pursued their way she enquired the name and quality of
 her new associate and rogero informed her of his nation and
 family beginning from the destruction of troy he told her that
 astyanax who was preserved by a stratagem of the greeks having
 established the kingdom of messina in sicily perished by the
 treachery of a priest named �gystus the widow of this prince
 being then big with child flying from her enemies escaped to
 rheggio here she brought forth a son who was christened
 polydore from this polydore descended polydantes and from him
 twin branches who gave origin to two other families of renown
 from one of these sprang the royal race of pepin and charlemagne
 and from the other two illustrious houses one of which took root
 at rheggio 'once called risa' and the other at ancona "from
 that of rheggio am i derived" continued he "and am son of
 rogero the son of agolant and gallicella she flying when big
 with me from a horrible persecution which she endured during the
 absence of her husband then engaged in war brought me forth in a
 foreign land and died in giving me life it was here that a
 magician took charge of me who trained me to feats of arms amidst
 the dangers of the desert and of the chace"

 having thus ended his tale rogero entreated a similar return of
 courtesy from his companion who replied without disguise that
 she was of the race of clermont and sister to rinaldo the fame
 of whom was perhaps known to him rogero much moved by this
 intelligence entreats her to take off her helmet and at the
 discovery of her face remains transported with pleasure

 whilst he is contemplating this with rapture an unexpected danger
 hangs over the future lovers a party which was placed in a wood
 in order to intercept the retreating christians breaks from its
 ambush upon the pair and bradamant who was uncasqued is wounded
 in the head rogero is in fury at this attack and bradamant
 replacing her helmet joins him in taking speedy vengeance on
 their enemies of these they clear the field but separate in the
 pursuit and the author first resumes the story of rogero

 quitting the chace and wandering by hill and vale in search of
 her whom he had no sooner found than lost rogero now falls in
 with two knights whom he joins and who promise to assist him in
 the search of his companion whose arms he describes concealing
 from a vague feeling of jealousy her quality and sex

 it was evening when they joined company and having journeyed
 together through the night the morning was beginning to break
 when one of the strangers fixing his eyes upon rogero's shield
 demanded of him by what right he bore the device pourtrayed upon
 it rogero in return interrogated the enquirer as to his
 pretensions to the bearing of hector who proclaimed himself to be
 mandricardo declared how he had won it and proposed that arms
 should decide which of the two was most worthy to bear the symbol
 of the trojan knight

 rogero felt no other objection to this proposal than the scruple
 which rose out of the observation that his antagonist was without
 a sword mandricardo however insisted that this need be no
 impediment and then informed him of the vow which he had taken
 never to wear a sword till he had completed the acquisition of
 hector's arms by the conquest of durindana

 this was no sooner said than a new antagonist started up in
 gradasso in whom the reader will have recognised the companion of
 mandricardo gradasso now vindicates his prior right to the quest
 of durindana to obtain which he had embarked as was related in
 the beginning in that fearful war upon france a quarrel is thus
 kindled between the kings of tartary and sericane mandricardo
 uproots a young elmtree to supply the place of a sword and
 gradasso disdaining to combat with unequal weapons arms himself
 with a pine being thus furnished for offence they encounter one
 another with fury while rogero laughs and looks upon the strife

 he nevertheless several times attempts to separate the
 combatants but always without success while the conflict is thus
 raging a knight arrives upon the ground accompanied by a damsel
 to whom rogero relates the cause and progress of the strife this
 turns out to be brandimart accompanied by flordelis he also
 interposes his mediation and succeeds better in bringing the two
 champions to accord this he affects by informing them that he
 can conduct them to the presence of orlando the master of
 durindana

 "if" said he "you can heal him of a strange enchantment it is
 from him that you may claim the sword nor is he one who will
 refuse you a fair field for obtaining it two leagues from hence"
 continued brandimart "is a water called the _river of laughter_
 but which would be better entitled _the stream of tears_ here
 orlando is enchanted an african magician made this known to me
 and i had already disposed myself to free him or perish by his
 side but being insufficient by myself for such an enterprise
 heaven has willed that i should light upon you to assist me in the
 attempt"

 gradasso and mandricardo instantly make truce in order to
 accompany brandimart in his quest nor will rogero be left behind

 this resolution however gave rise to a serious difficulty for
 the number to be employed in the adventure was to be unequal as
 brandimart was instructed and one must therefore necessarily be
 rejected who should be rejected it was now determined to decide
 by lot and chance pronounced against mandricardo who departed
 with reluctance from the field and wandering long arrived at
 last in agramant's camp who had sate down before paris

 the story of orlando is now resumed where it was left by the
 author at the conclusion of the second book the count having
 plunged into the fountain termed the river of laughter is so
 delighted with the company of naiads and with the pleasures which
 he finds beneath the waters that he remains there a willing
 prisoner

 about this water extended an enchanted wood thick with evergreen
 trees and here arrived rogero gradasso brandimart and
 flordelis determined to attempt the deliverance of orlando

 this forest seemed impenetrable but by the advice of flordelis
 the knights descended from their horses and determined to cut
 themselves a passage rogero in pursuance of this resolution
 hews down a laurel with his sword the tree is no sooner
 overthrown than a beautiful damsel starts from its trunk and
 claims the compassion of the knight she informs him that the
 trees which he beholds as well as that which he has felled
 contain sister nymphs the victims of enchantment the nature of
 which is such that they remain transformed till liberated as she
 had been by the destruction of the plant in which they are
 imprisoned "this deliverance is however as yet incomplete"
 pursued the damsel "and to perfect it you must accompany me to
 the water if you would not see me again rooted in the forest"
 rogero yields to her prayer accompanies her to the water and
 seduced by the enchantment leaps hand in hand with her into the
 fountain

 in the meantime gradasso attempting to clear his way cuts down
 an ash which is converted into a courser he immediately mounts
 it when the horse transports him through the air and plunges
 with him into the enchanted stream where he remains a prisoner
 with the rest*

 * the reader will see in this adventure more especially in the
 author's fitting the temptations to the character of the knights
 the hint which tasso turned to so much better account in his
 creation of the forest of armida

 brandimart counselled by flordelis pursues the adventure with
 better success and resisting every species of temptation which is
 presented to him at length arrives at the banks of the fountain
 here however he would have yielded to the same fascination as
 the others but for the wise precautions of flordelis�

 who for a safeguard round his brow disposes
 a mystic garland of enchanted roses*

 * the idea of roses being a solvent of enchantments is as old as
 apuleius and lucian and like most of the mysticisms to be found
 in those authors is probably to be traced to a much more ancient
 source

 she had also furnished him with the same ornaments for the others
 whom he was to deliver from the pool armed with these wreaths he
 approaches the knights whom he finds in the bowers of crystal
 into which he plunged and crowns them with the garlands the
 charm forthwith operates their perverse inclination ceases and
 they gladly return with their deliverer to the surface

 they are scarcely safe from the spell when gradasso bethinks him
 of his long quest and a fierce battle ensues between him and
 orlando for the possession of durindana they are however
 induced to suspend this by the instances of their companions and
 the entreaties of a stranger dwarf who appears mounted on a
 palfrey and entreats the assistance of some of the knights

 these accordingly divide orlando attended by brandimart and
 flordelis taking his way towards paris and rogero and gradasso
 accompanying the dwarf

 the author accompanies orlando and his friends who arrive before
 paris besieged by the forces of agramant amid whose ranks were
 to be found assembled rodomont mandricardo ferrau the newly
 arrived gradasso and all the worthies of the paynim army
 flordelis now retires into a wood for safety while the two
 champions approach the camp of the besiegers at this crisis
 charlemagne makes a desperate sally which is seconded by orlando
 and brandimart and the fortune of the day seems balanced between
 the contending troops

 the author here leaves things thus suspended and takes up the
 story of bradamant who lately separated form rogero in repulsing
 the ambuscade of the paynims she journeying alone and still
 suffering from her wound at length reaches a hermitage the
 tenant of which examines her head cuts off her hair and with this
 bandages and finally heals the gash which she had received

 departing from his hermitage and still pursuing her way alone
 she alights from her horse and reposes herself in a wood where
 she is surprised sleeping by flordespina who deceived by the
 appearance of her hair takes her for a man this princess who
 was engaged with her damsels in the chase by a stratagem detains
 bradamant in the forest where they pursue their sports in
 company

 but exclaims the poet while i sing these lays of ladies and of
 loves i see france arming against italy and the horizon bright
 with flames hereafter if it shall be permitted me i will piece
 the tale which i leave unfinished

 * * * * *

 so ends the story of the orlando innamorato

 "tomorrow to fresh woods and pastures new"

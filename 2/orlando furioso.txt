 introduction

 this work is a continuation of the "orlando innamorato" of matteo
 maria boiardo which was left unfinished upon the author's death
 in 1494 it begins more or less at the point where boiardo left
 it

 this is a brief synopsis of boiardo's work omitting most of the
 numerous digressions and incidental episodes associated with
 these events

 to the court of king charlemagne comes angelica daughter to the
 king of cathay or india and her brother argalia angelica is
 the most beautiful woman any of the peers have ever seen and all
 want her however in order to take her as wife they must first
 defeat argalia in combat the two most stricken by her are
 orlando and ranaldo "rinaldo" in rose

 when argalia falls to the heathen knight ferrau angelica flees
  with orlando and ranaldo in hot pursuit along the way both
 angelica and ranaldo drink magic waters  angelica is filled
 with a burning love for ranaldo but ranaldo is now indifferent

 eventually orlando and ranaldo arrive at angelica's castle
 others also gather at angelica's castle including agricane king
 of tartary sacripant king of circassia agramante king of
 africa and marfisa "marphisa" in rose an asian warriorqueen
 except for orlando and ranaldo all are heathen

 meanwhile france is threatened by heathen invaders led by king
 gradasso of sericana whose principal reason for going to war is
 to obtain orlando's sword durindana and king rodomonte of
 sarzia a holy war between pagans and christians ensues

 ranaldo leaves angelica's castle and angelica and a very
 lovesick but very chaste and proper orlando set out for
 france in search of him again the same waters as before are
 drunk from but this time in reverse  ranaldo now burns for
 angelica but angelica is now indifferent ranaldo and orlando
 now begin to fight over her but king charlemagne fearing the
 consequences if his two best knights kill each other in combat
 intervenes and promises angelica to whichever of the two fights
 the best against the heathen he leaves her in the care of duke
 namus orlando and ranaldo arrive in paris just in time to
 repulse an attack by agramante

 namus' camp is overrun by the heathen angelica escapes with
 ranaldo in pursuit also in pursuit is ferrau who because he
 had defeated argalia considers angelica his it is at this
 point that the poem breaks off

 while the orlandoranaldoangelica triangle is going on the
 stories of other knights and their loves are mixed in most
 important of these is that of the female knight bradamante
 sister of ranaldo who falls in love with a very noble heathen
 knight named ruggiero "rogero" in rose ruggiero who is said
 to be a descendent of alexander the great and hector also falls
 in love with bradamante but because they are fighting on
 opposite sides it is felt that their love is hopeless
 nevertheless it is prophecised that they shall wed and found the
 famous este line who shall rise to become one of the major
 families of medieval and renaissance italy it is worth noting
 that the estes where the patrons of both boiardo and ariosto
 opposed to this prophecy is atlantes an african wizard who seeks
 to derail fate and keep ruggiero from becoming a christian by
 the end of the poem ruggiero is imprisoned in atlantes' castle
 however bradamante who has decided to follow her heart is in
 pursuit of her love and is not too far away it is the
 bradamanteruggiero story that eventually takes center stage in
 ariosto's work

 other characters of importance astolfo a peer and friend of
 orlando who is kidnaped by the evil witch morgana and her sister
 alcina mandricardo a fierce but hotheaded heathen and a young
 knight named brandimarte who falls in love with and wins the
 heart of the beautiful fiordelisa "flordelice" in rose all
 play major or semimajor roles in the events of ariosto's poem

 canto 1

 argument
 angelica whom pressing danger frights
 flies in disorder through the greenwood shade
 rinaldo's horse escapes he following fights
 ferrau the spaniard in a forest glade
 a second oath the haughty paynim plights
 and keeps it better than the first he made
 king sacripant regains his longlost treasure
 but good rinaldo mars his promised pleasure


 i
 of loves and ladies knights and arms i sing
 of courtesies and many a daring feat
 and from those ancient days my story bring
 when moors from afric passed in hostile fleet
 and ravaged france with agramant their king
 flushed with his youthful rage and furious heat
 who on king charles' the roman emperor's head
 had vowed due vengeance for troyano dead

 ii
 in the same strain of roland will i tell
 things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme
 on whom strange madness and rank fury fell
 a man esteemed so wise in former time
 if she who to like cruel pass has well
 nigh brought my feeble wit which fain would climb
 and hourly wastes my sense concede me skill
 and strength my daring promise to fulfil

 iii
 good seed of hercules give ear and deign
 thou that this age's grace and splendour art
 hippolitus to smile upon his pain
 who tenders what he has with humble heart
 for though all hope to quit the score were vain
 my pen and pages may pay the debt in part
 then with no jealous eye my offering scan
 nor scorn my gifts who give thee all i can

 iv
 and me amid the worthiest shalt thou hear
 whom i with fitting praise prepare to grace
 record the good rogero valiant peer
 the ancient root of thine illustrious race
 of him if thou wilt lend a willing ear
 the worth and warlike feats i shall retrace
 so thou thy graver cares some little time
 postponing lend thy leisure to my rhyme

 v
 roland who long the lady of catay
 angelica had loved and with his brand
 raised countless trophies to that damsel gay
 in india median and tartarian land
 westward with her had measured back his way
 where nigh the pyrenees with many a band
 of germany and france king charlemagne
 had camped his faithful host upon the plain

 vi
 to make king agramant for penance smite
 his cheek and rash marsilius rue the hour
 this when all trained with lance and sword to fight
 he led from africa to swell his power
 that other when he pushed in fell despite
 against the realm of france spain's martial flower
 'twas thus orlando came where charles was tented
 in evil hour and soon the deed repented

 vii
 for here was seized his dame of peerless charms
 how often human judgment wanders wide
 whom in long warfare he had kept from harms
 from western climes to eastern shores her guide
 in his own land 'mid friends and kindred arms
 now without contest severed from his side
 fearing the mischief kindled by her eyes
 from him the prudent emperor reft the prize

 viii
 for bold orlando and his cousin free
 rinaldo late contended for the maid
 enamored of that beauty rare since she
 alike the glowing breast of either swayed
 but charles who little liked such rivalry
 and drew an omen thence of feebler aid
 to abate the cause of quarrel seized the fair
 and placed her in bavarian namus' care

 ix
 vowing with her the warrior to content
 who in that conflict on that fatal day
 with his good hand most gainful succour lent
 and slew most paynims in the martial fray
 but counter to his hopes the battle went
 and his thinned squadrons fled in disarray
 namus with other christian captains taken
 and his pavilion in the rout forsaken

 x
 there lodged by charles that gentle bonnibel
 ordained to be the valiant victor's meed
 before the event had sprung into her sell
 and from the combat turned in time of need
 presaging wisely fortune would rebel
 that fatal day against the christian creed
 and entering a thick wood discovered near
 in a close path a horseless cavalier

 xi
 with shield upon his arm in knightly wise
 belted and mailed his helmet on his head
 the knight more lightly through the forest hies
 than halfclothed churl to win the cloth of red
 but not from cruel snake more swiftly flies
 the timid shepherdess with startled tread
 than poor angelica the bridle turns
 when she the approaching knight on foot discerns

 xii
 this was that paladin good aymon's seed
 who mount albano had in his command
 and late baiardo lost his gallant steed
 escaped by strange adventure from his hand
 as soon as seen the maid who rode at speed
 the warrior knew and while yet distant scanned
 the angelic features and the gentle air
 which long had held him fast in cupid's snare

 xiii
 the affrighted damsel turns her palfrey round
 and shakes the floating bridle in the wind
 nor in her panic seeks to choose her ground
 nor open grove prefers to thicket blind
 but reckless pale and trembling and astound
 leaves to her horse the devious way to find
 he up and down the forest bore the dame
 till to a sylvan river's bank he came

 xiv
 here stood the fierce ferrau in grisly plight
 begrimed with dust and bathed with sweat and blood
 who lately had withdrawn him from the fight
 to rest and drink at that refreshing flood
 but there had tarried in his own despite
 since bending from the bank in hasty mood
 he dropped his helmet in the crystal tide
 and vainly to regain the treasure tried

 xv
 thither at speed she drives and evermore
 in her wild panic utters fearful cries
 and at the voice upleaping on the shore
 the saracen her lovely visage spies
 and pale as is her cheek and troubled sore
 arriving quickly to the warrior's eyes
 though many days no news of her had shown
 the beautiful angelica is known

 xvi
 courteous and haply gifted with a breast
 as warm as either of the cousins two
 as bold as if his brows in steel were dressed
 the succour which she sought he lent and drew
 his faulchion and against rinaldo pressed
 who saw with little fear the champion true
 not only each to each was known by sight
 but each had proved in arms his foeman's might

 xvii
 thus as they are on foot the warriors vie
 in cruel strife and blade to blade oppose
 no marvel plate or brittle mail should fly
 when anvils had not stood the deafening blows
 it now behoves the palfrey swift to ply
 his feet for while the knights in combat close
 him vexed to utmost speed with goading spurs
 by waste or wood the frighted damsel stirs

 xviii
 after the two had struggled long to throw
 each other in the strife and vainly still
 since neither valiant warrior was below
 his opposite in force and knightly skill
 the first to parley with his spanish foe
 was the good master of albano's hill
 as one within whose raging breast was pent
 a reckless fire which struggled for a vent

 xix
 "thou think'st" he said "to injure me alone
 but know thou wilt thyself as much molest
 for if we fight because yon rising sun
 this raging heat has kindled in thy breast
 what were thy gain and what the guerdon won
 though i should yield my life or stoop my crest
 if she shall never be thy glorious meed
 who flies while vainly we in battle bleed

 xx
 "then how much better since our stake's the same
 thou loving like myself should'st mount and stay
 to wait this battle's end the lovely dame
 before she fly yet further on her way
 the lady taken we repeat our claim
 with naked faulchion to that peerless prey
 else by long toil i see not what we gain
 but simple loss and unrequited pain"

 xxi
 the peer's proposal pleased the paynim well
 and so their hot contention was foregone
 and such fair truce replaced that discord fell
 so mutual wrongs forgot and mischief done
 that for departure seated in his sell
 on foot the spaniard left not aymon's son
 but him to mount his courser's crupper prayed
 and both united chased the royal maid

 xxii
 oh goodly truth in cavaliers of old
 rivals they were to different faith were bred
 not yet the weary warriors' wounds were cold 
 still smarting from those strokes so fell and dread
 yet they together ride by waste and wold
 and unsuspecting devious dingle thread
 them while four spurs infest his foaming sides
 their courser brings to where the way divides

 xxiii
 and now the warlike pair at fault for they
 knew not by which she might her palfrey goad
 since both without distinction there survey
 the recent print of hoofs on either road
 commit the chase to fortune by this way
 the paynim pricked by that rinaldo strode
 but fierce ferrau bewildered in the wood
 found himself once again where late he stood

 xxiv
 beside the water where he stoop'd to drink
 and dropt the knightly helmet  to his cost
 sunk in the stream and since he could not think
 her to retrieve who late his hopes had crossed
 he where the treasure fell descends the brink
 of that swift stream and seeks the morion lost
 but the casque lies so bedded in the sands
 'twill ask no light endeavour at his hands

 xxv
 a bough he severs from a neighbouring tree
 and shreds and shapes the branch into a pole
 with this he sounds the stream and anxiously
 fathoms and rakes and ransacks shelf and hole
 while angered sore at heart and restless he
 so lingered where the troubled waters roll
 breasthigh from the mid river rose upright
 the apparition of an angry knight

 xxvi
 armed at all points he was except his head
 and in his better hand a helmet bore
 the very casque which in the river's bed
 ferrau sought vainly toiling long and sore
 upon the spanish knight he frowned and said
 "thou traitor to thy word thou perjured moor
 why grieve the goodly helmet to resign
 which due to me long since is justly mine

 xxvii
 "remember pagan when thine arm laid low
 the brother of angelica that knight
 am i  thy word was plighted then to throw
 after my other arms his helmet bright
 if fortune now compel thee to forego
 the prize and do my will in thy despite
 grieve not at this but rather grieve that thou
 art found a perjured traitor to thy vow

 xxviii
 "but if thou seek'st a helmet be thy task
 to win and wear it more to thy renown
 a noble prize were good orlando's casque
 rinaldo's such or yet a fairer crown
 almontes' or mambrino's iron masque
 make one of these by force of arms thine own
 and this good helm will fitly be bestowed
 where such thy promise it has long been owed"

 xxix
 bristled the paynim's every hair at view
 of that grim shade uprising from the tide
 and vanished was his fresh and healthful hue
 while on his lips the halfformed accents died
 next hearing argalia whom he slew
 so was the warrior hight that stream beside
 thus his unknightly breach of promise blame
 he burned all over flushed with rage and shame

 xxx
 nor having time his falsehood to excuse
 and knowing well how true the phantom's lore
 stood speechless such remorse the words infuse
 then by lanfusa's life the warrior swore
 never in fight or foray would he use
 helmet but that which good orlando bore
 from aspramont where bold almontes paid
 his life a forfeit to the christian blade

 xxxi
 and this new vow discharged more faithfully
 than the vain promise which was whilom plight
 and from the stream departing heavily
 was many days sore vexed and grieved in sprite
 and still intent to seek orlando he
 roved wheresoe'er he hoped to find the knight
 a different lot befel rinaldo who
 had chanced another pathway to pursue

 xxxii
 for far the warrior fared not ere he spied
 bounding across the path his gallant steed
 and "stay bayardo mine" rinaldo cried
 "too cruel care the loss of thee does breed"
 the horse for this returned not to his side
 deaf to his prayer but flew with better speed
 furious in chase of him rinaldo hies
 but follow we angelica who flies

 xxxiii
 through dreary woods and dark the damsel fled
 by rude unharboured heath and savage height
 while every leaf or spray that rustled bred
 of oak or elm or beech such new affright
 she here and there her foaming palfrey sped
 by strange and crooked paths with furious flight
 and at each shadow seen in valley blind
 or mountain feared rinaldo was behind

 xxxiv
 as a young roe or fawn of fallow deer
 who mid the shelter of its native glade
 has seen a hungry pard or tiger tear
 the bosom of its bleeding dam dismayed
 bounds through the forest green in ceaseless fear
 of the destroying beast from shade to shade
 and at each sapling touched amid its pangs
 believes itself between the monster's fangs

 xxxv
 one day and night and half the following day
 the damsel wanders wide nor whither knows
 then enters a deep wood whose branches play
 moved lightly by the freshening breeze which blows
 through this two clear and murmuring rivers stray
 upon their banks a fresher herbage grows
 while the twin streams their passage slowly clear
 make music with the stones and please the ear

 xxxvi
 weening removed the way by which she wends
 a thousand miles from loathed rinaldo's beat
 to rest herself a while the maid intends
 wearied with that long flight and summer's heat
 she from her saddle 'mid spring flowers descends
 and takes the bridle from her courser fleet
 and loose along the river lets him pass
 roving the banks in search of lusty grass

 xxxvii
 behold at hand a thicket she surveys
 gay with the flowering thorn and vermeil rose
 the tuft reflected in the stream which strays
 beside it overshadowing oaks enclose
 hollow within and safe from vulgar gaze
 it seemed a place constructed for repose
 with bows so interwoven that the light
 pierced not the tangled screen far less the sight

 xxxviii
 within soft moss and herbage form a bed
 and to delay and rest the traveller woo
 'twas there her limbs the weary damsel spread
 her eyeballs bathed in slumber's balmy dew
 but little time had eased her drooping head
 ere as she weened a courser's tramp she knew
 softly she rises and the river near
 armed capapie beholds a cavalier

 xxxix
 if friend or foe she nothing comprehends
 so hope and fear her doubting bosom tear
 and that adventure's issue mute attends
 nor even with a sigh disturbs the air
 the cavalier upon the bank descends
 and sits so motionless so lost in care
 his visage propt upon his arm to sight
 changed into senseless stone appeared the knight

 xl
 pensive above an hour with drooping head
 he rested mute ere he began his moan
 and then his piteous tale of sorrow said
 lamenting in so soft and sweet a tone
 he in a tiger's breast had pity bred
 or with his mournful wailings rent a stone
 and so he sighed and wept like rivers flowed
 his tears his bosom like an aetna glowed

 xli
 "thought which now makes me burn now freeze with hate
 which gnaws my heart and rankles at its root
 what's left to me" he said "arrived too late
 while one more favoured bears away the fruit
 bare words and looks scarce cheered my hopeless state
 and the prime spoils reward another's suit
 then since for me nor fruit nor blossom hangs
 why should i longer pine in hopeless pangs

 xlii
 "the virgin has her image in the rose
 sheltered in garden on its native stock
 which there in solitude and safe repose
 blooms unapproached by sheperd or by flock
 for this earth teems and freshening water flows
 and breeze and dewy dawn their sweets unlock
 with such the wistful youth his bosom dresses
 with such the enamored damsel braids her tresses

 xliii
 "but wanton hands no sooner this displace
 from the maternal stem where it was grown
 than all is withered whatsoever grace
 it found with man or heaven bloom beauty gone
 the damsel who should hold in higher place
 than light or life the flower which is her own
 suffering the spoiler's hand to crop the prize
 forfeits her worth in every other's eyes

 xliv
 "and be she cheap with all except the wight
 on whom she did so large a boon bestow
 ah false and cruel fortune foul despite
 while others triumph i am drown'd in woe
 and can it be that i such treasure slight
 and can i then my very life forego
 no let me die 'twere happiness above
 a longer life if i must cease to love"

 xlv
 if any ask who made this sorrowing
 and pour'd into the stream so many tears
 i answer it was fair circassia's king
 that sacripant oppressed with amorous cares
 love is the source from which his troubles spring
 the sole occasion of his pains and fears
 and he to her a lover's service paid
 now well remembered by the royal maid

 xlvi
 he for her sake from orient's farthest reign
 roved thither where the sun descends to rest
 for he was told in india to his pain
 that she orlando followed to the west
 he after learned in france that charlemagne
 secluded from that champion and the rest
 as a fit guerdon mewed her for the knight
 who should protect the lilies best in fight

 xlvii
 the warrior in the field had been and viewed
 short time before king charlemagne's disgrace
 and vainly had angelica pursued
 nor of the damsel's footsteps found a trace
 and this is what the weeping monarch rued
 and this he so bewailed in doleful case
 hence into words his lamentations run
 which might for pity stop the passing sun

 xlviii
 while sacripant laments him in this plight
 and makes a tepid fountain of his eyes
 and what i deem not needful to recite
 pours forth yet other plaints and piteous cries
 propitious fortune will his lady bright
 should hear the youth lament him in such wise
 and thus a moment compassed what without
 such chance long ages had not brought about

 xlix
 with deep attention while the warrior weeps
 she marks the fashion of the grief and tears
 and words of him whose passion never sleeps
 nor this the first confession which she hears
 but with his plaint her heart no measure keeps
 cold as the column which the builder rears
 like haughty maid who holds herself above
 the world and deems none worthy of her love

 l
 but her from harm amid those woods to keep
 the damsel weened she might his guidance need
 for the poor drowning caitiff who chindeep
 implores not help is obstinate indeed
 nor will she if she let the occasion sleep
 find escort that will stand her in such stead
 for she that king by long experience knew
 above all other lovers kind and true

 li
 but not the more for this the maid intends
 to heal the mischief which her charms had wrought
 and for past ills to furnish glad amends
 in that full bliss by pining lover sought
 to keep the king in play are all her ends
 his help by some device or fiction bought
 and having to her purpose taxed his daring
 to reassume as wont her haughty bearing

 lii
 an apparition bright and unforeseen
 she stood like venus or diana fair
 in solemn pageant issuing on the scene
 from out of shadowy wood or murky lair
 and "peace be with you" cried the youthful queen
 "and god preserve my honour in his care
 nor suffer that you blindly entertain
 opinion of my fame so false and vain"

 liii
 not with such wonderment a mother eyes
 with such excessive bliss the son she mourned
 as dead lamented still with tears and sighs
 since the thinned files without her boy returned
  not such her rapture as the king's surprise
 and ecstasy of joy when he discerned
 the lofty presence cheeks of heavenly hue
 and lovely form which broke upon his view

 liv
 he full of fond and eager passion pressed
 towards his lady his divinity
 and she now clasped the warrior to her breast
 who in catay had haply been less free
 and now again the maid her thoughts addressed
 towards her native land and empery
 and feels with hope revived her bosom beat
 shortly to repossess her sumptuous seat

 lv
 her chances all to him the damsel said
 since he was eastward sent to sericane
 by her to seek the martial monarch's aid
 who swayed the sceptre of that fair domain
 and told how oft orlando's friendly blade
 had saved her from dishonour death and pain
 and how she so preserved her virgin flower
 pure as it blossomed in her natal hour

 lvi
 haply the tale was true yet will not seem
 likely to one of sober sense possessed
 but sacripant who waked from worser dream
 in all without a cavil acquiesced
 since love who sees without one guiding gleam
 spies in broad day but that which likes him best
 for one sign of the afflicted man's disease
 is to give ready faith to things which please

 lvii
 "if good anglante's lord the prize forbore
 nor seized the fair occasion when he might
 the loss be his if fortune never more
 him to enjoy so fair a prize invite
 to imitate that lord of little lore
 i think not" said apart circassa's knight
 "to quit such proffered good and to my shame
 have but myself on afterthought to blame

 lviii
 "no i will pluck the fresh and morning rose
 which should i tarry may be overblown
 to woman this my own experience shows
 no deed more sweet or welcome can be done
 then whatsoever scorn the damsel shows
 though she awhile may weep and make her moan
 i will unchecked by anger false or true
 or sharp repulse my bold design pursue"

 lix
 this said he for the soft assault prepares
 when a loud noise within the greenwood shade
 beside him rang in his astounded ears
 and sore against his will the monarch stayed
 he donned his helm his other arms he wears
 aye wont to rove in steel with belted blade
 replaced the bridle on his courser fleet
 grappled his lance and sprang into his seat

 lx
 with the bold semblance of a valiant knight
 behold a warrior threads the forest hoar
 the stranger's mantle was of snowy white
 and white alike the waving plume he wore
 balked of his bliss and full of fell despite
 the monarch ill the interruption bore
 and spurred his horse to meet him in mid space
 with hate and fury glowing in his face

 lxi
 him he defies to fight approaching nigh
 and weens to make him stoop his haughty crest
 the other knight whose worth i rate as high
 his warlike prowess puts to present test
 cuts short his haughty threats and angry cry
 and spurs and lays his levelled lance in rest
 in tempest wheels circassia's valiant peer
 and at his foeman's head each aims his spear

 lxii
 not brindled bulls or tawny lions spring
 to forest warfare with such deadly will
 as those two knights the stranger and the king
 their spears alike the opposing bucklers thrill
 the solid ground at their encountering
 trembles from fruitful vale to naked hill
 and well it was the mail in which they dressed
 their bodies was of proof and saved the breast

 lxiii
 nor swerved the chargers from their destined course
 who met like rams and butted head to head
 the warlike saracen's illfated horse
 well valued while alive dropt short and dead
 the stranger's too fell senseless but perforce
 was roused by rowel from his grassy bed
 that of the paynim king extended straight
 lay on his battered lord with all his weight

 lxiv
 upright upon his steed the knight unknown
 who at the encounter horse and rider threw
 deeming enough was in the conflict done
 cares not the worthless warfare to renew
 but endlong by the readiest path is gone
 and measures pricking frith and forest through
 a mile or little less in furious heat
 ere the foiled saracen regains his feet

 lxv
 as the bewildered and astonished clown
 who held the plough the thunder storm o'erpast
 there where the deafening bolt had beat him down
 nigh his deathstricken cattle wakes aghast
 and sees the distant pine without its crown
 which he saw clad in leafy honours last
 so rose the paynim knight with troubled face
 the maid spectatress of the cruel case

 lxvi
 he sighs and groans yet not for mischief sore
 endured in wounded arm or foot which bled
 but for mere shame and never such before
 or after dyed his cheek so deep a red
 and if he rued his fall it grieved him more
 his dame should lift him from his courser dead
 he speechless had remained i ween if she
 had not his prisoned tongue and voice set free

 lxvii
 "grieve not" she said "sir monarch for thy fall
 but let the blame upon thy courser be
 to whom more welcome had been forage stall
 and rest than further joust and jeopardy
 and well thy foe the loser may i call
 who shall no glory gain for such is he
 who is the first to quit his ground if aught
 angelica of fighting fields be taught"

 lxviii
 while she so seeks the saracen to cheer
 behold a messenger with pouch and horn
 on panting hackney  man and horse appear
 with the long journey weary and forlorn
 he questions sacripant approaching near
 had he seen warrior pass by whom were borne
 a shield and crest of white in search of whom
 through the wide forest pricked the weary groom

 lxix
 king sacripant made answer "as you see
 he threw me here and went but now his way
 then tell the warrior's name that i may be
 informed whose valour foiled me in the fray"
 to him the groom  "that which you ask of me
 i shall relate to you without delay
 know that you were in combat prostrate laid
 by the tried valour of a gentle maid

 lxx
 "bold is the maid but fairer yet than bold
 nor the redoubted virgin's name i veil
 'twas bradamant who marred what praise of old
 your prowess ever won with sword and mail"
 this said he spurred again his story told
 and left him little gladdened by the tale
 he recks not what he says or does for shame
 and his flushed visage kindles into flame

 lxxi
 after the woeful warrior long had thought
 upon his cruel case and still in vain
 and found a woman his defeat had wrought
 for thinking but increased the monarch's pain
 he climbed the other horse nor spake he aught
 but silently uplifted from the plain
 upon the croup bestowed that damsel sweet
 reserved to gladder use in safer seat

 lxxii
 two miles they had not rode before they hear
 the sweeping woods which spread about them sound
 with such loud crash and trample far and near
 the forest seemed to tremble all around
 and shortly after see a steed appear
 with housings wrought in gold and richly bound
 who clears the bush and stream with furious force
 and whatsoever else impedes his course

 lxxiii
 "unless the misty air" the damsel cries
 "and boughs deceive my sight yon noble steed
 is sure bayardo who before us flies
 and parts the wood with such impetuous speed
  yes 'tis bayardo's self i recognize
 how well the courser understands our need
 two riders ill a foundered jade would bear
 but hither speeds the horse to end that care"

 lxxiv
 the bold circassian lighted and applied
 his hand to seize him by the flowing rein
 who swiftly turning with his heels replied
 for he like lightning wheeled upon the plain
 woe to the king but that he leaps aside
 for should he smite he would not lash in vain
 such are his bone and sinew that the shock
 of his good heels had split a metal rock

 lxxv
 then to the maid he goes submissively
 with gentle blandishment and humble mood
 as the dog greets his lord with frolic glee
 whom some short season past he had not viewed
 for good bayardo had in memory
 albracca where her hands prepared his food
 what time the damsel loved rinaldo bold
 rinaldo then ungrateful stern and cold

 lxxvi
 with her left hand she takes him by the bit
 and with the other pats his sides and chest
 while the good steed so marvellous his wit
 lamblike obeyed the damsel and caressed
 meantime the king who sees the moment fit
 leapt up and with his knees the courser pressed
 while on the palfrey eased of half his weight
 the lady left the croup and gained the seat

 lxxvii
 then as at hazard she directs her sight
 sounding in arms a man on foot espies
 and glows with sudden anger and despite
 for she in him the son of aymon eyes
 her more than life esteems the youthful knight
 while she from him like crane from falcon flies
 time was the lady sighed her passion slighted
 'tis now rinaldo loves as ill requited

 lxxviii
 and this effect two different fountains wrought
 whose wonderous waters different moods inspire
 both spring in arden with rare virtue fraught
 this fills the heart with amorous desire
 who taste that other fountain are untaught
 their love and change for ice their former fire
 rinaldo drank the first and vainly sighs
 angelica the last and hates and flies

 lxxix
 mixed with such secret bane the waters glide
 which amorous care convert to sudden hate
 the maid no sooner had rinaldo spied
 than on her laughing eyes deep darkness sate
 and with sad mien and trembling voice she cried
 to sacripant and prayed him not to wait
 the near approach of the detested knight
 but through the wood with her pursue his flight

 lxxx
 to her the saracen with anger hot
 "is knightly worship sunk so low in me
 that thou should'st hold my valour cheap and not
 sufficient to make yonder champion flee
 already are albracca's fights forgot
 and that dread night i singly stood for thee
 that night when i though naked was thy shield
 against king agrican and all his field"

 lxxxi
 she answers not and knows not in her fear
 what 'tis she does rinaldo is too nigh
 and from afar that furious cavalier
 threats the bold saracen with angry cry
 as soon as the known steed and damsel dear
 whose charms such flame had kindled meet his eye
 but what ensued between the haughty pair
 i in another canto shall declare


 canto 2

 argument
 a hermit parts by means of hollow sprite
 the two redoubted rivals' dangerous play
 rinaldo goes where love and hope invite
 but is dispatched by charles another way
 bradamont seeking her devoted knight
 the good rogero nigh becomes the prey
 of pinabel who drops the damsel brave
 into the dungeon of a living grave


 i
 injurious love why still to mar accord
 between desires has been thy favourite feat
 why does it please thee so perfidious lord
 two hearts should with a different measure beat
 thou wilt not let me take the certain ford
 dragging me where the stream is deep and fleet
 her i abandon who my love desires
 while she who hates respect and love inspires

 ii
 thou to rinaldo show'st the damsel fair
 while he seems hideous to that gentle dame
 and he who when the lady's pride and care
 paid back with deepest hate her amorous flame
 now pines himself the victim of despair
 scorned in his turn and his reward the same
 by the changed damsel in such sort abhorred
 she would choose death before that hated lord

 iii
 he to the pagan cries "forego thy theft
 and down false felon from that pilfer'd steed
 i am not wont to let my own be reft
 and he who seeks it dearly pays the deed
 more  i shall take from thee yon lovely weft
 to leave thee such a prize were foul misdeed
 and horse and maid whose worth outstrips belief
 were ill methinks relinquished to a thief"

 iv
 "thou liest" the haughty saracen retorts
 as proud and burning with as fierce a flame
 "a thief thyself if fame the truth reports
 but let good deeds decide our dubious claim
 with whom the steed or damsel fair assorts
 best proved by valiant deeds though for the dame
 that nothing is so precious i with thee
 search the wide world throughout may well agree"

 v
 as two fierce dogs will somtimes stand at gaze
 whom hate or other springs of strife inspire
 and grind their teeth while each his foe surveys
 with sidelong glance and eyes more red than fire
 then either falls to bites and hoarsely bays
 while their stiff bristles stand on end with ire
 so from reproach and menace to the sword
 pass sacripant and clermont's angry lord

 vi
 thus kindling into wrath the knights engage
 one is on foot the other on his horse
 small gain to this for inexperienced page
 would better rein his charger in the course
 for such baiardo's sense he will not wage
 war with his master or put out his force
 for voice nor hand nor manage will he stir
 rebellious to the rein or goading spur

 vii
 he when the king would urge him takes the rest
 or when he curbs him runs in giddy rings
 and drops his head beneath his spreading chest
 and plays his spine and runs anend and flings
 and now the furious saracen distressed
 sees 'tis no time to tame the beast and springs
 with one hand on the pummel to the ground
 clear of the restless courser at a bound

 viii
 as soon as sacripant with welltimed leap
 is from the fury of bayardo freed
 you may believe the battle does not sleep
 between those champions matched in heart and deed
 their sounding blades such changeful measure keep
 the hammerstrokes of vulcan with less speed
 descend in that dim cavern where he heats
 and jove's red thunders on his anvil beats

 ix
 sometimes they lunge then feign the thrust and parry
 deep masters of the desperate game they play
 or rise upon the furious stroke and carry
 their swords aloft or stoop and stand at bay
 again they close again exhausted tarry
 now hide now show themselves and now give way
 and where one knight an inch of ground has granted
 his foeman's foot upon that inch is planted

 x
 when lo rinaldo now impatient grown
 strikes full at sacripant with lifted blade
 and he puts forth his buckler made of bone
 and well with strong and stubborn steel inlaid
 though passing thick fusberta cleaves it groan
 greenwood and covert close and sunny glade
 the paynim's arm rings senseless with the blow
 and steel and bone like ice in shivers go

 xi
 when the fair damsel saw with timid eye
 such ruin follow from the faulchion's sway
 she like the criminal whose doom is nigh
 changed her fair countenance through sore dismay
 and deemed that little time was left to fly
 if she would not be that rinaldo's prey
 rinaldo loathed by her as much as he
 doats on the scornful damsel miserably

 xii
 so turned her horse into the gloomy chase
 and drove him through rough path and tangled ally
 and oftentimes bent back her bloodless face
 and saw rinaldo from each thicket sally
 nor flying long had urged the frantic race
 before she met a hermit in a valley
 devotion in his aspect was expressed
 and his long beard descended on his breast

 xiii
 wasted he was as much by fasts as age
 and on an ass was mounted slow and sure
 his visage warranted that never sage
 had conscience more precise or passing pure
 though in his arteries time had stilled the rage
 of blood and spake him feeble and demure
 at sight of the delighted damsel he
 was inly stirred for very charity

 xiv
 the lady prayed that kindly friar that he
 would straight conduct her to some haven near
 for that she from the land of france might flee
 and never more of loathed rinaldo hear
 the hermit who was skilled in sorcery
 ceased not to soothe the gentle damsel's fear
 and with the promise of deliverance shook
 his pocket and drew forth a secret book

 xv
 this opened quick and mighty marvel wrought
 for not a leaf is finished by the sage
 before a spirit by his bidding brought
 waits his command in likeness of a page
 he by the magic writ constrained and taught
 hastes where the warriors face to face engage
 in the cool shade  but not in cool disport 
 and steps between and stops their battle short

 xvi
 "in courtesy" he cried "let either show
 what his foe's death to either can avail
 and what the guerdon conquest will bestow
 on him who in the battle shall prevail
 if roland though he has not struck a blow
 or snapt in fight a single link of mail
 to paristown conveys the damsel gay
 who has engaged you in this bitter fray

 xvii
 "within an easy mile i saw the peer
 pricking to paris with that lady bright
 riding in merry mood with laugh and jeer
 and mocking at your fierce and fruitless fight
 sure it were better while they yet are near
 to follow peer and damsel in their flight
 for should he once in paris place his prize
 the lady never more shall meet your eyes"

 xviii
 you might have seen those angry cavaliers
 change at the demon's tale for rage and shame
 and curse themselves as wanting eyes and ears
 to let their rival cheat them of the dame
 towards his horse the good rinaldo steers
 breathing forth piteous sighs which seem of flame
 and if he joins orlando  ere they part 
 swears in his fury he will have his heart

 xix
 so passing where the prompt bayardo stood
 leaps on his back and leaves as swift as wind
 without farewell his rival in the wood
 much less invites him to a seat behind
 the goaded charger in his heat of blood
 forces whate'er his eager course confined
 ditch river tangled thorn or marble block
 he swims the river and he clears the rock

 xx
 let it not sir sound strangely in your ear
 rinaldo took the steed thus readily
 so long and vainly followed far and near
 for he endued with reasoning faculty
 had not in vice lured on the following peer
 but fled before his cherished lord that he
 might guide him whither went the gentle dame
 for whom as he had heard he nursed a flame

 xxi
 for when angelica in random dread
 from the pavilion winged her rapid flight
 bayardo marked the damsel as she fled
 his saddle lightened of mount alban's knight
 who then on foot an equal combat sped
 matched with a baron of no meaner might
 and chased the maid by woods and floods and strands
 in hopes to place her in the warrior's hands

 xxii
 and with desire to bring him to the maid
 gallopped before him still with rampant play
 but would not let his master mount afraid
 that he might make him take another way
 so luring on rinaldo through the shade
 twice brought him to his unexpected prey
 twice foiled in his endeavour once by bold
 ferrau then sacripant as lately told

 xxiii
 now good bayardo had believed the tiding
 of that fair damsel which produced the accord
 and in the devil's cunning tale confiding
 renewed his wonted service to his lord
 behold rinaldo then in fury riding
 and pushing still his courser parisward
 though he fly fast the champion's wishes go
 faster and wind itself had seemed too slow

 xxiv
 at night rinaldo rests his steed with pain
 to meet anglante's lord he burned so sore
 and lent such credit to the tidings vain
 of the false courier of that wizard hoar
 and that day and the next with flowing rein
 rode till the royal city rose before
 his eyes where charlemagne had taken post
 with the sad remnant of his broken host

 xxv
 he for he fears the afric king's pursuit
 and sap and siege upon his vassals calls
 to gather in fresh victual and recruit
 and cleanse their ditches and repair their walls
 and what may best annoy the foes and suit
 for safety without more delay forestalls
 and plans an embassy to england thence
 to gather fresher forces for defence

 xxvi
 for he is bent again to try the fate
 of arms in tented field though lately shamed
 and send rinaldo to the neighbouring state
 of britain which was after england named
 ill liked the paladin to cross the strait
 not that the people or the land he blamed
 but that king charles was sudden nor a day
 would grant the valiant envoy for delay

 xxvii
 rinaldo never executed thing
 less willingly prevented in his quest
 of that fair visage he was following
 whose charms his heart had ravished from his breast
 yet in obediance to the christian king
 prepared himself to do the royal hest
 to calais the good envoy wends with speed
 and the same day embarks himself and steed

 xxviii
 and there in scorn of cautious pilot's skill
 such his impatience to regain his home
 launched on the doubtful sea which boded ill
 and rolled its heavy billows white with foam
 the wind enraged that he opposed his will
 stirred up the waves and 'mid the gathering gloom
 so the loud storm and tempest's fury grew
 that topmasthigh the flashing waters flew

 xxix
 the watchful mariners in wary sort
 haul down the mainsail and attempt to wear
 and would put back in panic to the port
 whence in ill hour they loosed with little care
  "not so" exclaims the wind and stops them short
 "so poor a penance will not pay the dare"
 and when they fain would veer with fiercer roar
 pelts back their reeling prow and blusters more

 xxx
 starboard and larboard bears the fitful gale
 and never for a thought its ire assuages
 while the strained vessel drives with humble sail
 before the billows as the tempest rages
 but i who still pursue a varying tale
 must leave awhile the paladin who wages
 a weary warfare with the wind and flood
 to follow a fair virgin of his blood

 xxxi
 i speak of that famed damsel by whose spear
 o'erthrown king sacripant on earth was flung
 the worthy sister of the valiant peer
 from beatrix and good duke aymon sprung
 by daring deeds and puissance no less dear
 to charlemagne and france since proved among
 the first her prowess tried by many a test
 equal to good rinaldo's shone confessed

 xxxii
 a cavalier was suitor to the dame
 who out of afric passed with agramant
 rogero was his valiant father's name
 his mother was the child of agolant
 and she who not of bear or lion came
 disdained not on the child her love to plant
 though cruel fortune ill their wishes meeting
 had granted to the pair a single greeting

 xxxiii
 alone thenceforth she sought her lover he
 was named of him to whom he owed his birth
 and roved as safe as if in company
 of thousands trusting in her single worth
 she having made the king of circassy
 salute the visage of old mother earth
 traversed a wood and that wood past a mountain
 and stopt at length beside a lovely fountain

 xxxiv
 through a delicious mead the fountainrill
 by ancient trees o'ershaded glides away
 and him whose ear its pleasing murmurs fill
 invites to drink and on its banks to stay
 on the left side a cultivated hill
 excludes the fervors of the middle day
 as first the damsel thither turns her eyes
 a youthful cavalier she seated spies

 xxxv
 a cavalier who underneath the shade
 seems lost as in a melancholy dream
 and on the bank which gaudy flowers displayed
 reposing overhangs the crystal stream
 his horse beneath a spreading beech is laid
 and from a bough the shield and helmet gleam
 while his moist eyes and sad and downcast air
 speak him the broken victim of despair

 xxxvi
 urged by the passion lodged in every breast
 a restless curiosity to know
 of others' cares the gentle maid addressed
 the knight and sought the occasion of his woe
 and he to her his secret grief confessed
 won by her gentle speech and courteous show
 and by that gallant bearing which at sight
 prepared who saw her for nimble knight

 xxxvii
 "fair sir a band of horse and foot" he said
 "i brought to charlemagne and thither pressed
 where he an ambush for marsilius spread
 descending from the pyrenean crest
 and in my company a damsel led
 whose charms with fervid love had fired my breast
 when as we journey by rhone's current i
 a rider on a winged courser spy

 xxxviii
 "the robber whether he were man or shade
 or goblin damned to everlasting woe
 as soon as he beheld my dearloved maid
 like falcon who descending aims its blow
 sank in a thought and rose and soaring laid
 hands on his prize and snatched her from below
 so quick the rape that all appeared a dream
 until i heard in air the damsel's scream

 xxxix
 "the ravening kite so swoops and plunders when
 hovering above the shelterd yard she spies
 a helpless chicken near unwatchful hen
 who vainly dins the thief with after cries
 i cannot reach the mountainrobber's den
 compassed with cliffs or follow one who flies
 besides wayfoundered is my weary steed
 who 'mid these rocks has wasted wind and speed

 xl
 "but i like one who from his bleeding side
 would liefer far have seen his heart outtorn
 left my good squadrons masterless to ride
 along the cliffs and passes least forlorn
 and took the way love served me for a guide
 where it appeared the ruthless thief had born
 ascending to his den the lovely prey
 what time he snatched my hope and peace away

 xli
 "six days i rode from morn to setting sun
 by horrid cliff by bottom dark and drear
 and giddy precipice where path was none
 nor sign nor vestiges of man were near
 at last a dark and barren vale i won
 where caverned mountains and rude cliffs appear
 where in the middle rose a rugged block
 with a fair castle planted on the rock

 xlii
 "from far it shone like flame and seemed not dight
 of marble or of brick and in my eye
 more wonderful the work more fair to sight
 the walls appeared as i approached more nigh
 i after learned that it was built by sprite
 whom potent fumes had raised and sorcery
 who on this rock its towers of steel did fix
 casehardened in the stream and fire of styx

 xliii
 "each polished turret shines with such a ray
 that it defies the mouldering rust and rain
 the robber scours the country night and day
 and after harbours in this sure domain
 nothing is safe which he would bear away
 pursued with curses and with threats in vain
 there fruitless every hope to foil his art
 the felon keeps my love oh say my heart

 xliv
 "alas what more is left me but to eye
 her prison on that cliff's aerial crest
 like the shefox who hears her offspring cry
 standing beneath the ravening eagle's nest
 and since she has not wings to rise and fly
 runs round the rugged rock with hopeless quest
 so inaccessible the wild dominion
 to whatsoever has not plume and pinion

 xlv
 "while i so lingered where those rocks aspire
 i saw a dwarf guide two of goodly strain
 whose coming added hope to my desire
 alas desire and hope alike were vain
 both barons bold and fearful in their ire
 the one gradasso king of sericane
 the next of youthful vigour was a knight
 prized in the moorish court rogero hight

 xlvi
 "the dwarf exclaimed `these champions will assay
 their force with him who dwells on yonder steep
 and by such strange and unattempted way
 spurs the winged courser from his mountainkeep'
 and i to the approaching warriors say
 `pity fair sirs the cruel loss i weep
 and as i trust yon daring spoiler slain
 give my lost lady to my arms again'

 xlvii
 "then how my love was ravished i make known
 vouching with bitter tears my deep distress
 they proffer aid and down the path of stone
 which winds about the craggy mountain press
 while i upon the summit left alone
 look on and pray to god for their success
 beneath the wily wizard's castle strong
 extends a little plain two bowshots long

 xlviii
 "arrived beneath the craggy keep the two
 contend which warrior shall begin the fight
 when whether the first lot gradasso drew
 or young rogero held the honor light
 the king of sericane his bugle blew
 and the rock rang and fortress on the height
 and lo apparelled for the fearful course
 the cavalier upon his winged horse

 xlix
 "upwards by little and by little springs
 the winged courser as the pilgrim crane
 finds not at first his balance and his wings
 running and scarcely rising from the plain
 but when the flock is launched and scattered flings
 his pinions to the wind and soars amain
 so straight the necromancer's upward flight
 the eagle scarce attempts so bold a height

 l
 "when it seems fit he wheels his courser round
 who shuts his wings and falling from the sky
 shoots like a well trained falcon to the ground
 who sees the quarry duck or pigeon fly
 so through the parting air with whizzing sound
 with rested lance he darted from on high
 and while gradasso scarcely marks the foe
 he hears him swooping near and feels the blow

 li
 "the wizard on gradasso breaks his spear
 he wounds the empty air with fury vain
 this in the feathered monster breeds no fear
 who to a distance shifts and swoops again
 while that encounter made the alfana rear
 thrown back upon her haunches on the plain
 the alfana that the indian monarch rode
 the fairest was that ever man bestrode

 lii
 "up to the starry sphere with swift ascent
 the wizard soars then pounces from the sky
 and strikes the young rogero who intent
 upon gradasso deems no danger nigh
 beneath the wizard's blow the warrior bent
 which made some deal his generous courser ply
 and when to smite the shifting foe he turned
 him in the sky and out of reach discerned

 liii
 "his blows rogero now gradasso bruise
 on forehead bosom back or flanks between
 while he the warrior's empty blows eschews
 shifting so quickly that he scarce is seen
 now this now that the wizard seems to choose
 the monster makes such spacious rings and clean
 while the enchanter so deceives the knights
 they view him not and know not whence he smites

 liv
 "between the two on earth and him o' the sky
 until that hour the warfare lasted there
 which spreading wide its veil of dusky dye
 throughout the world discolours all things fair
 what i beheld i say i add not i
 a tittle to the tale yet scarcely dare
 to tell to other what i stood and saw
 so strange it seems so passing nature's law

 lv
 "well covered in a goodly silken case
 he the celestial warrior bore his shield
 but why delayed the mantle to displace
 i know not and its lucid orb concealed
 since this no sooner blazes in his face
 than his foe tumbles dazzled on the field
 and while he like a lifeless body lies
 becomes the necromancer's helpless prize

 lvi
 "like carbuncle the magic buckler blazed
 no glare was ever seen which shone so bright
 nor could the warriors choose but fall amazed
 and blinded by the clear and dazzling light
 i too that from a distant mountain gazed
 fell senseless and when i regained my sight
 after long time saw neither knights nor page
 nor aught beside a dark and empty stage

 lvii
 "this while the fell enchanter i supposed
 dragged both the warriors to his prisoncell
 and by strange virtue of the shield disclosed
 i from my hope and they from freedom fell
 and thus i to the turrets which enclosed
 my heart departing bade a last farewell
 now sum my griefs and say if love combine
 other distress or grief to match with mine"

 lviii
 the knight relapsed into his first disease
 after his melancholy tale was done
 this was count pinabel the maganzese
 anselmo d'altaripa's faithless son
 he where the blood ran foul through all degrees
 disdained to be the only virtuous one
 nor played a simple part among the base
 passing in vice the villains of his race

 lix
 with aspect changing still the beauteous dame
 hears what the mournful maganzese narrates
 and at first mention of rogero's name
 her radiant face with eager joy dilates
 but full of pity kindles into flame
 as pinabel his cruel durance states
 nor finds she though twice told the story stale
 but makes him oft repeat and piece his tale

 lx
 and after when she deemed that all was clear
 cried to the knight "repose upon my say
 to thee may my arrival well be dear
 and thou as fortunate account this day
 straight wend me to the keep sir cavalier
 which holds a jewel of so rich a ray
 nor shalt thou grudge thy labour and thy care
 if envious fortune do but play me fair"

 lxi
 the knight replied "then nought to me remains
 but that i yonder mountainpasses show
 and sure 'tis little loss to lose my pains
 where every thing is lost i prize below
 but you would climb yon cliffs and for your gains
 will find a prisonhouse and be it so
 whate'er betide you blame yourself alone
 you go forewarned to meet a fate foreshown"

 lxii
 so said the cavalier remounts his horse
 and serves the gallant damsel as a guide
 who is prepared rogero's gaol to force
 or to be slain or in his prison stied
 when lo a messenger in furious course
 called to the dame to stay and rode and cried
 this was the post who told circassa's lord
 what valiant hand had stretched him on the sward

 lxiii
 the courier who so plied his restless heel
 news of narbonne and of montpelier bore
 how both had raised the standard of castile
 all acquamorta siding with the moor
 and how marseilles' disheartened men appeal
 to her who should protect her straightened shore
 and how through him her citizens demand
 counsel and comfort at their captain's hand

 lxiv
 this goodly town with many miles of plain
 which lie 'twixt var and rhone upon the sea
 to her was given by royal charlemagne
 such trust he placed in her fidelity
 still wont with wonder on the tented plain
 the prowess of that valiant maid to see
 and now the panting courier as i said
 rode from marseilles to ask the lady's aid

 lxv
 whether or not she should the call obey
 the youthful damsel doubts some little space
 strong in one balance fame and duty weigh
 but softer thoughts both fame and duty chase
 and she at length resolved the emprize to assay
 and free rogero from the enchanted place
 or should her valour in the adventure fail
 would with the cherished lover share his jail

 lxvi
 and did with such excuse that post appay
 he was contented on her will to wait
 then turned the bridle to resume her way
 with pinabel who seemed no whit elate
 since of that line he knows the damsel gay
 held in such open and such secret hate
 and future trouble to himself foresees
 were he detected as a maganzese

 lxvii
 for 'twixt maganza's and old clermont's line
 there was an ancient and a deadly feud
 and oft to blows the rival houses came
 and oft in civil blood their hands embrued
 and hence some treason to this gentle dame
 in his foul heart the wicked county brewed
 or as the first occasion served would stray
 out of the road and leave her by the way

 lxviii
 and so the traitor's troubled fancy rack
 fear doubt and his own native rancorous mood
 that unawares he issued from the track
 and found himself within a gloomy wood
 where a rough mountain reared its shaggy back
 whose stony peak above the forest stood
 the daughter of dodona's duke behind
 dogging his footsteps through the thicket blind

 lxix
 he when he saw himself within the brake
 thought to abandon his unweeting foe
 and to the dame  " 'twere better that we make
 for shelter ere the gathering darkness grow
 and yonder mountain past save i mistake
 a tower is seated in the vale below
 do you expect me then while from the peak
 i measure the remembered place i seek"

 lxx
 so said he pushed his courser up the height
 of that lone mountain in his evil mind
 revolving as he went some scheme or sleight
 to rid him of the gentle dame behind
 when lo a rocky cavern met his sight
 amid those precipices dark and blind
 its sides descended thirty yards and more
 worked smooth and at the bottom was a door

 lxxi
 a void was at the bottom where a wide
 portal conducted to an inner room
 from thence a light shone out on every side
 as of a torch illumining the gloom
 fair bradamant pursued her faithless guide
 suspended there and pondering on her doom
 and came upon the felon where he stood
 fearing lest she might lose him in the wood

 lxxii
 when her approach the county's first intent
 made vain the wily traitor sought to mend
 his toils and some new stratagem invent
 to rid her thence or bring her to her end
 and so to meet the approaching lady went
 and showed the cave and prayed her to ascend
 and said that in its bottom he had seen
 a gentle damsel of bewitching mien

 lxxiii
 who by her lovely semblance and rich vest
 appeared a lady of no mean degree
 but melancholy weeping and distressed
 as one who pined there in captivity
 and that when he towards the entrance pressed
 to learn who that unhappy maid might be
 one on the melancholy damsel flew
 and her within that inner cavern drew

 lxxiv
 the beauteous bradamant who was more bold
 than wary gave a ready ear and bent
 to help the maid imprisoned in that hold
 sought but the means to try the deep descent
 then looking round descried an elmtree old
 which furnished present means for her intent
 and from the tree with boughs and foliage stored
 lopt a long branch and shaped it with her sword

 lxxv
 the severed end she to the count commended
 then grasping it hung down that entrance steep
 with her feet foremost by her arms suspended
 when asking if she had the skill to leap
 the traitor with a laugh his hands extended
 and plunged his helpless prey into the deep
 "and thus" exclaimed the ruffian "might i speed
 with thee each sucker of thy cursed seed"

 lxxvi
 but not as was the will of pinabel
 such cruel lot fair bradamant assayed
 for striking on the bottom of the cell
 the stout elmbough so long her weight upstayed
 that though it split and splintered where it fell
 it broked her fall and saved the gentle maid
 some while astounded there the lady lay
 as the ensuing canto will display


 canto 3

 argument
 restored to sense the beauteous bradamant
 finds sage melissa in the vaulted tomb
 and hears from her of many a famous plant
 and warrior who shall issue from her womb
 next to release rogero from the haunt
 of old atlantes learns how from the groom
 brunello hight his virtuous ring to take
 and thus the knight's and others' fetters break


 i
 who will vouchsafe me voice that shall ascend
 as high as i would raise my noble theme
 who will afford befitting words and lend
 wings to my verse to soar the pitch i scheme
 since fiercer fire for such illustrious end
 than what was wont may well my song beseem
 for this fair portion to my lord is due
 which sings the sires from whom his lineage grew

 ii
 than whose fair line 'mid those by heavenly grace
 chosen to minister this earth below
 you see not phoebus in your daily race
 one that in peace or war doth fairer show
 nor lineage that hath longer kept its place
 and still shall keep it if the lights which glow
 within me but aright inspire my soul
 while the blue heaven shall turn about the pole

 iii
 but should i seek at full its worth to blaze
 not mine were needful but that noble lyre
 which sounded at your touch the thunderer's praise
 what time the giants sank in penal fire
 yet should you instruments more fit to raise
 the votive work bestow as i desire
 all labour and all thought will i combine
 to shape and shadow forth the great design

 iv
 till when this chisel may suffice to scale
 the stone and give my lines a right direction
 and haply future study may avail
 to bring the stubborn labour to perfection
 return we now to him to whom the mail
 of hawberk shield and helm were small protection
 i speak of pinabel the maganzeze
 who hopes the damsel's death whose fall he sees

 v
 the wily traitor thought that damsel sweet
 had perished on the darksome cavern's floor
 and with pale visages hurried his retreat
 from that through him contaminated door
 and thence returning clomb into his seat
 then like one who a wicked spirit bore
 to add another sin to evil deed
 bore off with him the warlike virgin's steed

 vi
 leave we sometime the wretch who while he layed
 snares for another wrought his proper doom
 and turn we to the damsel he betrayed
 who had nigh found at once her death and tomb
 she after rising from the rock dismayed
 at her shrewd fall and gazing through the gloom
 beheld and passed that inner door which gave
 entrance to other and more spacious cave

 vii
 for the first cavern in a second ended
 fashioned in form of church and large and square
 with roof by cunning architect extended
 on shafts of alabaster rich and rare
 the flame of a clearburning lamp ascended
 before the central altar and the glare
 illuminating all the space about
 shone through the gate and lit the cave without

 viii
 touched with the sanctifying thoughts which wait
 on worthy spirit in a holy place
 she prays with eager lips and heart elate
 to the disposer of all earthly grace
 and kneeling hears a secret wicket grate
 in the opposing wall whence face to face
 a woman issuing forth the maid addresses
 barefoot ungirt and with dishevelled tresses

 ix
 "o generous bradamant" the matron cried
 "know thine arrival in this hallowed hold
 was not unauthorized of heavenly guide
 and the prophetic ghost of merlin told
 thou to this cave shouldst come by path untried
 which covers the renowned magician's mould
 and here have i long time awaited thee
 to tell what is the heavens' pronounced decree

 x
 "this is the ancient memorable cave
 which merlin that enchanter sage did make
 thou may'st have heard how that magician brave
 was cheated by the lady of the lake
 below beneath the cavern is the grave
 which holds his bones where for that lady's sake
 his limbs for such her will the wizard spread
 living he laid him there and lies there dead

 xi
 "yet lives the spirit of immortal strain
 lodged in the enchanter's corpse till to the skies
 the trumpet call it or to endless pain
 as it with dove or raven's wing shall rise
 yet lives the voice and thou shalt hear how plain
 from its sepulchral case of marble cries
 since this has still the past and future taught
 to every wight that has its counsel sought

 xii
 "long days have passed since i from distant land
 my course did to this cemetery steer
 that in the solemn mysteries i scanned
 merlin to me the truth should better clear
 and having compassed the design i planned
 a month beyond for thee have tarried here
 since merlin still with certain knowledge summing
 events prefixed this moment for thy coming"

 xiii
 the daughter of duke aymon stood aghast
 and silent listened to the speech while she
 knew not sore marvelling at all that passed
 if 'twere a dream or a reality
 at length with modest brow and eyes down cast
 replied like one that was all modesty
 "and is this wrought for me and have i merit
 worthy the workings of prophetic spirit"

 xiv
 and full of joy the adventure strange pursues
 moving with ready haste behind the dame
 who brings her to the sepulchre which mews
 the bones and spirit erst of merlin's name
 the tomb of hardest stone which masons use
 shone smooth and lucid and as red as flame
 so that although no sunbeam pierced the gloom
 its splendour lit the subterraneous room

 xv
 whether it be the native operation
 o certain stones to shine like torch i' the dark
 or whether force of spell or fumigation
 a guess that seems to come more near the mark
 or sign made under mystic constellation
 the blaze that came from the sepulchral ark
 discovered sculpture colour gems and gilding
 and whatsoever else adorned the building

 xvi
 scarcely had bradamant above the sill
 lifter her foot and trod the secret cave
 when the live spirit in clear tones that thrill
 addressed the martial virgin from the grave
 "may fortune chaste and noble maid fulfil
 thine every wish" exclaimed the wizard brave
 "since from thy womb a princely race shall spring
 whose name through italy and earth shall ring

 xvii
 "the noble blood derived from ancient troy
 mingling in thee its two most glorious streams
 shall be the ornament and flower and joy
 of every lineage on which phoebus beams
 where genial stars lend warmth or cold annoy
 where indus tagus nile or danube gleams
 and in thy progeny and long drawn line
 shall marquises counts dukes and caesers shine

 xviii
 "captains and cavaliers shall spring from thee
 who both by knightly lance and prudent lore
 shall once again to widowed italy
 her ancient praise and fame in arms restore
 and in her realms just lords shall seated be
 such numa and augustus were of yore
 who with their government benign and sage
 shall recreate on earth the golden age

 xix
 "then that the will of heaven be duly brought
 to a fair end through thee in fitting date
 which from the first to bless thy love has wrought
 and destined young rogero for thy mate
 let nothing interpose to break that thought
 but boldly tread the path perscribed by fate
 nor let aught stay thee till the thief be thrown
 by thy good lance who keeps thee from thine own"

 xx
 here merlin ceased that for the solemn feat
 melissa might prepare with fitting spell
 to show bold bradamant in aspect meet
 the heirs who her illustrious race should swell
 hence many sprites she chose but from what seat
 evoked i know not or if called from hell
 and gathered in one place so bade the dame
 in various garb and guise the shadows came

 xxi
 this done into the church she called the maid
 where she had drawn a magic ring as wide
 as might contain the damsel prostrate laid
 with the full measure of a palm beside
 and on her head lest spirit should invade
 a pentacle for more assurance tied
 so bade her hold her peace and stand and look
 then read and schooled the demons from her book

 xxii
 lo forth of that first cave what countless swarm
 presses upon the circle's sacred round
 but when they would the magic rampart storm
 finds the way barred as if by fosse or mound
 then back the rabble turns of various form
 and when it thrice with bending march has wound
 about the circle troops into the cave
 where stands that beauteous urn the wizard's grave

 xxiii
 "to tell at large the puissant acts and worth
 and name of each who figured in a sprite
 is present to our eyes before his birth"
 said sage melissa to the damsel bright
 "to tell the deeds which they shall act on earth
 were labour not to finish with the night
 hence i shall call few worthies of thy line
 as time and fair occasion shall combine

 xxiv
 "see yonder firstborn of thy noble breed
 who well reflects thy fair and joyous face
 he first of thine and of rogero's seed
 shall plant in italy thy generous race
 in him behold who shall distain the mead
 and his good sword with blood of pontier base
 the mighty wrong chastised and traitor's guilt
 by whom his princely father's blood was spilt

 xxv
 "by him king desiderius shall be pressed
 the valiant leader of the lombard horde
 and of the fiefs of calaon and este
 for this imperial charles shall make him lord
 hubert thy grandson comes behind the best
 of italy with arms and belted sword
 who shall defend the church from barbarous foes
 and more than once assure her safe repose

 xxvi
 "alberto next unconquered captain see
 whose trophies shall so many fanes array

 shall conquer milan and the snakes display
 azo that next approaching form shall be
 and his good brother dead the insubri sway

 "with him shall the imperial otho join
 in wedlock worthily his daughter fair
 and lo another hugh o noble line

 xxviii
 "see fulke who to his brother will convey
 all his italian birthright and command
 to take a mighty dukedom far away
 from his fair home in almayn's northern land
 there he the house of saxony shall stay
 and prop the ruin with his saving hand
 this in his mother's right he shall possess
 and with his progeny maintain and bless

 xxix
 "more famed for courtesy than warlike deed

 xxx
 "his virtues shall deserve so fair a flower

 to hold the half of italy in dower
 with that descendent of first henry's race
 rinaldo shall succeed him in his power
 pledge of bertoldo's wedded love and chase
 fierce frederick barbarossa's hireling bands
 saving the church from his rapacious hands

 xxxi
 "another azo rules verona's town
 with its fair fields and two great chiefs this while
 one wears the papal one the imperial crown

 but to show all who rear the gonfalon
 of the consistory amid that file

 achieved for rome by thy devoted seed

 xxxii
 "see fulke and obyson more azos hughs

 and shall spoleto's ducal crown enjoy

 i speak of the fifth azo of thy strain
 by whom shall ezelin be quelled and slain

 xxxiii
 "fierce ezelin that most inhuman lord
 who shall be deemed by men a child of hell
 and work such evil thinning with the sword
 who in ausonia's wasted cities dwell
 rome shall no more her anthony record
 her marius sylla nero cajus fell
 and this fifth azo shall to scathe and shame
 put frederick second caeser of the name

 xxxiv
 "he with his better sceptre well contented
 shall rule the city seated by the streams
 where phoebus to his plaintive lyre lamented
 the son illtrusted with the father's beams
 where cygnus spread his pinions and the scented
 amber was wept as fabling poet dreams
 to him such honour shall the church decree
 fit guerdon of his works and valour's fee

 xxxv
 "but does no laurel for his brother twine
 aldobrandino who will carry cheer
 to rome when otho with the ghibelline
 into the troubled capital strikes fear
 and make the umbri and piceni sign
 their shame and sack the cities far and near
 then hopeless to relieve the sacred hold
 sue to the neighbouring florentine for gold

 xxxvi
 "and trust a noble brother to his hands
 boasting no dearer pledge the pact to bind
 and next victorious o'er the german bands
 give his triumphant ensigns to the wind
 to the afflicted church restore her lands
 and take due vengeance of celano's kind
 then die cut off in manhood's early flower
 beneath the banners of the papal power

 xxxvii
 "he dying leaves his brother azo heir
 of pesaro and fair ancona's reign
 and all the cities which 'twixt tronto are

 with other heritage more rich and rare

 all else is fortune's in this mortal state
 but virtue soars beyond her love and hate

 xxxviii
 "in good rinaldo equal worth shall shine

 dark fate and fortune wreck not in their ire

 xxxix
 "this lord to his dominion shall unite

 and his redoubted valour lend such light
 the willing people call him to command
 sixth of the name his azo rears upright
 the church's banner in his noble hand

 xl
 "behold in yonder friendly group agreed

 xli
 "and that fair town whose produce is the rose

 "by him rebellious plans are overthrown
 and turned upon the rash contriver's head
 and so each stratagem of warfare blown
 that vainly shall the cunning toils be spread
 to the third otho this too late is known
 of parma and the pleasant reggio dread

 of his possessions and his wretched life

 xliv
 "and still the fair dominion shall increase
 and without wrong its spreading bounds augment
 nor its glad subjects violate the peace
 unless provoked some outrage to resent
 and hence its wealth and welfare shall not cease
 and the divine disposer be content
 to let it flourish such his heavenly love
 while the celestial spheres revolve above

 xlv
 "lo lionel lo borse great and kind

 who reigns secure and shall more triumphs find
 in peace than warlike princes win in fight

 the people that his sovereign rule obey

 xlvi
 "lo hercules who may reproach his neighbour
 with foot half burnt and halting gait and slow
 that at budrio with protecting sabre

 "lucania puglia and calabria's strand
 shall with the rumour of his prowess ring
 where he shall strive in duel hand to hand
 and gain the praise of catalonia's king
 him with the wisest captains of the land
 his worth shall class such fame his actions bring
 and he the fief shall win like valiant knight
 which thirty years before was his of right

 xlviii
 "to him his grateful city owes a debt
 the greatest subjects to their lord can owe
 not that he moves her from a marsh to set
 her stones where ceres' fruitful treasures grow
 nor that he shall enlarge her bounds nor yet
 that he shall fence her walls against the foe
 nor that he theatre and dome repairs
 and beautifies her streets and goodly squares

 xlix
 "not that he keeps his lordship well defended
 from the winged lions' claws and fierce attacks
 nor that when gallic ravage is extended
 and the invader all italia sacks
 his happy state alone is unoffended
 unharassed and ungalled by toll or tax
 not for these blessings i recount and more
 his grateful realm shall hercules adore

 l
 "so much as that from him shall spring a pair
 of brothers leagued no less by love than blood
 who shall be all that leda's children were
 the just alphonso hippolite the good
 and as each twin resigned the vital air
 his fellow to redeem from stygian flood
 so each of these would gladly spend his breath
 and for his brother brave perpetual death

 li
 "in these two princes' excellent affection
 their happy lieges more assurance feel
 than if their noble town for its protection
 were girded twice by vulcan's works of steel
 and so alphonso in his good direction
 justice with knowledge and with love shall deal
 astrea shall appear returned from heaven
 to this low earth to varying seasons given

 lii
 "well is it that his wisdom shines as bright
 as his good sire's nor is his valour less
 since here usurping venice arms for fight
 and her full troops his scanty numbers press
 there she i know not if more justly hight
 mother or stepmother brings new distress
 but if a mother scarce to him more mild
 than progue or medea to her child

 liii
 "this chief what time soever he shall go
 forth with his faithful crew by night or day
 by water or by land will shame the foe
 with memorable rout and disarray
 and this too late romagna's sons shall know
 led against former friends in bloody fray
 who shall bedew the campaign with their blood
 by santern po and zaniolus' flood

 liv
 "this shall the spaniard know to his dismay
 'mid the same bounds whom papal gold shall gain
 who shall from him bastia win and slay
 with cruel rage her hapless castellain
 the city taken but shall dearly pay
 his crime the town retrieved and victor slain
 since in the rescued city not a groom
 is left alive to bear the news to rome

 lv
 " 'tis he who with his counsel and his lance
 shall win the honours of romagna's plain
 and open to the chivalry of france
 the victory over julius leagued with spain
 paunchdeep in human blood shall steeds advance
 in that fierce strife and struggle through the slain
 'mid crowded fields which scarce a grace supply
 where greek italian frank and spaniard die

 lvi
 "lo who in priestly vesture clad is crowned
 with purple hat conferred in hallowed dome
 'tis he the wise the liberal the renowned
 hippolitus great cardinal of rome
 whose actions shall in every region sound
 where'er the honoured muse shall find a home
 to whose glad era by indulgent heaven
 as to augustus' is a maro given

 lvii
 "his deeds adorn his race as from his car
 the glorious sun illumes the subject earth
 more than the silver moon or lesser star
 so far all others he transcends in worth
 i see this captain ill bested for war
 go forth afflicted and return in mirth
 backed by few foot and fewer cavaliers
 he homeward barks and fifteen gallies steers

 lviii
 "two sigismonds the first the second see
 to these alphonso's five good sons succeed
 whose glories spread o'er seas and land shall be
 the first shall wed a maid of france's seed
 this is the second hercules and he
 that you may know their every name and deed
 hippolitus who with the light shall shine
 of his wise uncle gilding all his line

 lix
 "francis the third comes next the other two
 alphonsos both  but yet again i say
 thy line through all its branches to pursue
 fair virgin would too long protract thy stay
 and phoebus many times to mortal view
 would quench and light again the lamp of day
 then with thy leave 'tis time the pageant cease
 and i dismiss the shades and hold my peace"

 lx
 so with the lady's leave the volume closed
 whose precepts to her will the spirits bent
 and they where merlin's ancient bones reposed
 from the first cavern disappearing went
 then bradamant her eager lips unclosed
 since the divine enchantress gave consent
 "and who" she cried "that pair of sorrowing mien
 alphonso and hippolitus between

 lxi
 "sighing those youths advanced amid the show
 their brows with shame and sorrow overcast
 with downward look and gait subdued and slow
 i saw the brothers shun them as they passed"
 melissa heard the dame with signs of woe
 and thus with streaming eyes exclaim'd at last
 "ah luckless youths with vain illusions fed
 whither by wicked men's bad counsel led

 lxii
 "o worthy seed of hercules the good
 let not their guilt beyond thy love prevail
 alas the wretched pair are of thy blood
 so many prevailing pity turn the scale"
 and in a sad and softer tone pursued
 "i will not further press the painful tale
 chew on fair fancy's food nor deem unmeet
 i will not with a bitter chase the sweet

 lxiii
 "soon as tomorrow's sun shall gild the skies
 with his first light myself the way will show
 to where the wizard knight rogero sties
 and built with polished steel the ramparts glow
 so long as through deep woods thy journey lies
 till at the sea arrived i shall bestow
 such new instructions for the future way
 that thou no more shalt need melissa's stay"

 lxiv
 all night the maid reposes in the cave
 and the best part in talk with merlin spends
 while with persuasive voice the wizard grave
 to her rogero's honest love commends
 till from the vault goes forth that virgin brave
 as through the sky the rising sun ascends
 by path long space obscure on either side
 the weird woman still her faithful guide

 lxv
 they gain a hidden glen which heights inclose
 and mountains inaccessible to man
 and they all day toil on without repose
 where precipices frowned and torrents ran
 and what may some diversion interpose
 sweet subjects of discourse together scan
 in conference which best might make appear
 the rugged road less dismal and severe

 lxvi
 of these the greater portion served to guide
 such the wise woman's scope the warlike dame
 and teach by what device might be untied
 rogero's gyves if stedfast were her flame
 "if thou wert mars himself or pallas" cried
 the sage melissa "though with thee there came
 more than king charles or agramant command
 against the wizard foe thou could'st not stand

 lxvii
 "besides that it is walled about with steel
 and inexpugnable his tower and high
 besides that his swift horse is taught to wheel
 and caracol and gallop in mid sky
 he bears a mortal shield of power to seal
 as soon as 'tis exposed the dazzled eye
 and so invades each sense the splendour shed
 that he who sees the blaze remains as dead

 lxviii
 "and lest to shut thine eyes thou should'st suppose
 might serve contending with the wizard knight
 how would'st thou know when both in combat close
 when he strikes home or when eschews the fight
 but to escape the blaze which blinds his foes
 and render vain each necromantic sleight
 have here a speedy mean which cannot miss
 nor can the world afford a way but this

 lxix
 "king agramant of africa a ring
 thieved from an indian queen by subtle guiles
 has to a baron of his following
 consigned who now precedes us by few miles
 brunello he who wears the gift shall bring
 to nought all sorceries and magic wiles
 in thefts and cheats brunello is as well
 instructed as the sage in charm and spell

 lxx
 "brunello he so practised and so sly
 as now i tell thee by his king is sent
 that he with aid of mother wit may try
 and of this ring well proved in like event
 to take rogero from the castle high
 so has he boasted by the wizard pent
 and to his lord such promise did impart
 who has rogero's presence most at heart

 lxxi
 "that his escape to thee alone may owe
 not to the king the youthful cavalier
 how to release rogero from his foe
 and his enchanted cage prepare to hear
 three days along the shingle shalt thou go
 beside the sea whose waves will soon appear
 thee the third day shall to a hostel bring
 where he shall come who bears the virtuous ring

 lxxii
 "that thou may'st recognise the man in height
 less than six palms observe one at this inn
 of black and curly hair the dwarfish wight
 beard overgrown about the cheek and chin
 with shaggy brow swoln eyes and cloudy sight
 a nose close flattened and a sallow skin
 to this that i may make my sketch complete
 succinctly clad like courier goes the cheat

 lxxiii
 "thy conversation with this man shall turn
 upon enchantment spell and mystic pact
 and thou shalt in thy talk appear to yearn
 to prove the wizard's strength as is the fact
 but lady let him not thy knowledge learn
 of his good ring which mars all magic act
 he shall propose to bring thee as a guide
 to the tall castle whither thou would'st ride

 lxxiv
 "follow him close and viewing for a sign
 now near the fortress of the enchanter hoar
 let no false pity there thy mind incline
 to stay the execution of my lore
 give him his death but let him not divine
 thy thought nor grant him respite for before
 thine eyes concealed by it the caitiff slips
 if once he place the ring between his lips"

 lxxv
 discoursing thus they came upon the sea
 where garonne near fair bordeaux meets the tide
 here fellow travellers no more to be
 some natural tears they drop and then divide
 duke aymon's child who slumbers not till she
 release her knight holds on till eventide
 'twas then the damsel at a hostel rested
 where sir brunello was already guested

 lxxvi
 the maid brunello knows as soon as found
 so was his image on her mind impressed
 and asks him whence he came and whither bound
 and he replies and lies as he is pressed
 the dame who is forewarned and knows her ground
 feigns too as well as he and lies her best
 and changes sex and sect and name and land
 and her quick eye oft glances at his hand

 lxxvii
 oft glances at his resless hand in fear
 that he might undetected make some prize
 nor ever lets the knave approach too near
 well knowing his condition in this guise
 the couple stand together when they hear
 a sudden sound but what that sound implies
 i sir shall tell hereafter with its cause
 but first shall break my song with fitting pause


 canto 4

 argument
 the old atlantes suffers fatal wreck
 foiled by the ring and young rogero freed
 who soars in air till he appears a speck
 mounted upon the wizard's winged steed
 obediant to the royal charles's beck
 he who had followed love's imperious lead
 rinaldo disembarks on british land
 and saves genevra doomed to stake and brand


 i
 though an ill mind appear in simulation
 and for the most such quality offends
 'tis plain that this in many a situation
 is found to further beneficial ends
 and save from blame and danger and vexation
 since we converse not always with our friends
 in this less clear than clouded mortal life
 beset with snares and full of envious strife

 ii
 if after painful proof we scarcely find
 a real friend through various chances sought
 to whom we may communicate our mind
 keeping no watch upon our wandering thought
 what should the young rogero's lady kind
 do with brunello not sincere but fraught
 with treasons manifold and false and tainted
 as by the good enchantress truly painted

 iii
 she feigns as well with that deceitful scout
 fitting with him the father of all lies
 watches his thievish hands in fear and doubt
 and follows every motion with her eyes
 when lo a mighty noise is heard without
 "o mighty mother king of heaven" she cries
 "what thing is this i hear" and quickly springs
 towards the place from whence the larum rings

 iv
 and sees the host and all his family
 where one to door and one to window slips
 with eyes upturned and gazing at the sky
 as if to witness comet or eclipse
 and there the lady views with wondering eye
 what she had scarce believed from other's lips
 a feathered courser sailing through the rack
 who bore an armed knight upon his back

 v
 broad were his pinions and of various hue
 seated between a knight the saddle pressed
 clad in steel arms which wide their radiance threw
 his wonderous course directed to the west
 there dropt among the mountains lost to view
 and this was as that host informed his guest
 and true the tale a sorcerer who made
 now farther now more near his frequent raid

 vi
 "he sometimes towering soars into the skies
 then seems descending but to skim the ground
 and of all beauteous women makes a prize
 who to their mischief in these parts are found
 hence whether in their own or other's eyes
 esteemed as fair the wretched damsels round
 and all in fact the felon plunders hine
 as fearing of the sun to be descried

 vii
 "a castle on the pyrenean height
 the necromancer keeps the work of spell"
 the host relates "of steel so fair and bright
 all nature cannot match the wonderous shell
 there many cavaliers to prove their might
 have gone but none returned the tale to tell
 so that i doubt fair sir the thief enthralls
 or slays whoever in the encounter falls"

 viii
 the watchful maid attends to every thing
 glad at her heart and trusting to complete
 what she shall compass by the virtuous ring
 the downfall of the enchanter and his seat
 then to the host  "a guide i pray thee bring
 who better knows than me the thief's retreat
 so burns my heart nor can i choose but go
 to strive in battle with this wizard foe"

 ix
 "it shall not need" exclaimed the dwarfish moor
 "for i myself will serve you as a guide
 who have the road set down with other lore
 so that you shall rejoice with me to ride"
 he meant the ring but further hint forbore
 lest dearly he the avowed should abide
 and she to him  "your guidance gives me pleasure"
 meaning by this she hoped to win his treasure

 x
 what useful was to say she said and what
 might hurt her with the saracen concealed
 well suited to her ends the host had got
 a palfrey fitting for the road or field
 she bought the steed and as aurora shot
 her rosy rays rode forth with spear and shield
 and maid and courier through a valley wind
 brunello now before and now behind

 xi
 from wood to wood from mount to mountain hoar
 they clomb a summit which in cloudless sky
 discovers france and spain and either shore
 as from a peak of apennine the eye
 may tuscan and sclavonian sea explore
 there whence we journey to camaldoli
 then through a rugged path and painful wended
 which thence into a lowly vale descended

 xii
 a rock from that deep valley's centre springs
 bright walls of steel about its summit go
 and this as high that airy summit flings
 as it leaves all the neighbouring cliffs below
 he may not scale the height who has not wings
 and vainly would each painful toil bestow
 "lo where his prisoners" sir brunello cries
 "ladies and cavaliers the enchanter sties"

 xiii
 scarped smooth upon four parts the mountain bare
 seemed fashioned with the plumb by builder's skill
 nor upon any side was path or stair
 which furnished man the means to climb the hill
 the castle seemed the very nest and lair
 of animal supplied with plume and quill
 and here the damsel knows 'tis time to slay
 the wily dwarf and take the ring away

 xiv
 but deems it foul with blood of man to stain
 unarmed and of so base a sort her brand
 for well without his death she may obtain
 the costly ring and so suspends her hand
 brunello off his guard with little pain
 she seized and strongly bound with girding band
 then to a lofty fir made fast the string
 but from his finger first withdrew the ring

 xv
 neither by tears nor groans nor sound of woe
 to move the stedfast maid the dwarf had power
 she down the rugged hill descended slow
 until she reached the plain beneath the tower
 then gave her bugle breath the keep below
 to call the castled wizard to the stower
 and when the sound was finished threatening cried
 and called him to the combat and defied

 xvi
 not long within his gate the enchanter stayed
 after he heard the voice and bugle ring
 against the foe who seemed a man arrayed
 in arms with him the horse is on the wing
 but his appearance well consoled the maid
 who with small cause for fear beheld him bring
 nor mace nor rested lance nor bitting sword
 wherewith the corselet might be bruised or gored

 xvii
 on his left arm alone his shield he took
 covered all o'er with silk of crimson hue
 in his righthand he held an open book
 whence as the enchanter read strange wonder grew
 for often times to sight the lance he shook
 and flinching eyelids could not hide the view
 with tuck or mace he seemed to smite the foe
 but sate aloof and had not struck a blow

 xviii
 no empty fiction wrought by magic lore
 but natural was the steed the wizard pressed
 for him a filly to griffin bore
 hight hippogryph in wings and beak and crest
 formed like his sire as in the feet before
 but like the mare his dam in all the rest
 such on riphaean hills though rarely found
 are bred beyond the frozen ocean's bound

 xix
 drawn by enchantment from his distant lair
 the wizard thought but how to tame the foal
 and in a month instructed him to bear
 saddle and bit and gallop to the goal
 and execute on earth or in mid air
 all shifts of manege course and caracole
 he with such labour wrought this only real
 where all the rest was hollow and ideal

 xx
 this truth by him with fictions was combined
 whose sleight passed red for yellow black for white
 but all his vain enchantments could not blind
 the maid whose virtuous ring assured her sight
 yet she her blows discharges at the wind
 and spurring here and there prolongs the fight
 so drove or wheeled her steed and smote at nought
 and practised all she had before been taught

 xxi
 when she sometime had fought upon her horse
 she from the courser on her feet descends
 to compass and more freely put in force
 as by the enchantress schooled her wily ends
 the wizard to display his last resource
 unweeting the defence towards her wends
 he bares the shield secure to blind his foe
 and by the magic light astonished throw

 xxii
 the shield might have been shown at first nor he
 needed to keep the cavaliers at bay
 but that he loved some masterstroke to see
 achieved by lance or sword in single fray
 as with the captive mouse in sportive glee
 the wily cat is sometimes seen to play
 till waxing wroth or weary of her prize
 she bites and at a snap the prisoner dies

 xxiii
 to cat and mouse in battles fought before
 i liken the magician and his foes
 but the comparison holds good no more
 for with the ring the maid against him goes
 firm and attentive still and watching sore
 lest upon her the wizard should impose
 and as she sees him bare the wondrous shield
 closes her eyes and falls upon the field

 xxiv
 not that the shining metal could offend
 as wont those others from its cover freed
 but so the damsel did to make descend
 the vain enchanter from his wondrous steed
 nor was in ought defeated of her end
 for she no sooner on the grassy mead
 had laid her head than wheeling widely round
 the flying courser pitched upon the ground

 xxv
 already cased again the shield was hung
 by the magician at his sadle bow
 he lights and seeks her who like wolf among
 the bushes couched in thicket waits the roe
 she without more delay from ambush sprung
 as he drew near and grappled fast the foe
 that wretched man the volume by whose aid
 he all his battles fought on earth had laid

 xxvi
 and ran to bind her with a chain which he
 girt round about him for such a purpose wore
 because he deemed she was no less to be
 mastered and bound than those subdued before
 him hath the dame already flung by me
 excused with reason if he strove not more
 for fearful were the odds between that bold
 and puissant maid and warrior weak and old

 xxvii
 intending to behead the fallen foe
 she lifts her conquering hand but in mid space
 when she beholds his visage stops the blow
 as if disdaining a revenge so base
 she sees in him her prowess has laid low
 a venerable sire with sorrowing face
 whose hair and wrinkles speak him to her guess
 of years six score and ten or little less

 xxviii
 "kill me for love of god" afflicted sore
 the old enchanter full of wrath did cry
 but the victorious damsel was not more
 averse to kill than he was bent to die
 to know who was the necromancer hoar
 the gentle lady had desire and why
 the tower he in that savage place designed
 doing such outrage foul to all mankind

 xxix
 "nor i by malice moved alas poor wight"
 the weeping necromancer answer made
 "built the fair castle on the rocky height
 nor yet for rapine ply the robber's trade
 but only to redeem a gentle knight
 from danger sore and death by love was swayed
 who as the skies foreshow in little season
 is doomed to die a christian and by treason

 xxx
 "the sun beholds not 'twixt the poles a child
 so excellent as him and passing fair
 who from his infancy rogero styled
 atlantes i was tutored by my care
 by love of fame and evil stars beguiled
 he follows into france troyano's heir
 him in my eyes than son esteemed more dear
 i seek to snatch from france and peril near

 xxxi
 "i only built the beauteous keep to be
 rogero's dungeon safely harboured there
 who whilom was subdued in fight by me
 as i today had hoped thyself to snare
 and dames and knights and more of high degree
 have to this tower conveyed his lot to share
 that with such partners of his prison pent
 he might the loss of freedom less lament

 xxxii
 "save they should seek to break their dungeon's bound
 i grant my inmates every other pleasure
 for whatsoever in the world is found
 search its four quarters in this keep i treasure
 whatever heart can wish or tongue can sound
 cates brave attire game sport or mirthful measure
 my field well sown i well had reaped my grain
 but that thy coming makes my labour vain

 xxxiii
 "ah then unless thy heart less beauteous be
 than thy sweet face mar not my pious care
 take my steel buckler this i give to thee
 and take that horse which flies so fast in air
 nor meddle with my castle more or free
 one or two captive friends the rest forbear 
 or for i crave but this release them all
 so that rogero but remain my thrall

 xxxiv
 "or if disposed to take him from my sight
 before the youth be into france conveyed
 be pleased to free my miserable sprite
 from its now rotted bark long decayed"
 "prate as thou wilt i shall restore the knight
 to liberty" replied the martial maid
 "nor offer shield and courser to resign
 which are not in thy gift  already mine

 xxxv
 "nor were they thine to take or to bestow
 would it appear that such exchange were wise
 thou sayest to save him from what stars foreshow
 and cheat an evil influence of the skies
 rogero is confined thou canst not know
 or knowing canst not change his destinies
 for if unknown an ill so near to thee
 far less mayest thou another's fate foresee

 xxxvi
 "seek not thy death from me for the petition
 is made in vain but if for death thou sigh
 though the whole world refused the requisition
 a soul resolved would find the means to die
 but ope thy gates to give thy guests dismission
 before thine hand the knot of life untie"
 so spake the scornful dame with angry mock
 speeding her captive still towards the rock

 xxxvii
 round by the conqueror with the chain he bore
 atlantes walked the damsel following nigh
 who trusted not to the magician hoar
 although he seemed subdued in port and eye
 nor many paces went the pair before
 they at the mountain's foot the cleft espy
 with steps by which the rugged hill to round
 and climb till to the castlegate they wound

 xxxviii
 atlantes from the threshold graved by skill
 with characters and wondrous signs upturned
 a virtuous stone where underneath the sill
 pots with perpetual fire and secret burned
 the enchanter breaks them and at once the hill
 to an inhospitable rock is turned
 nor wall nor tower on any side is seen
 as if no castle there had ever been

 xxxix
 then from the lady's toils the wizard clears
 his limbs as thrush escapes the fowler's snare
 with him as well his castle disappears
 and leaves the prisoned troop in open air
 from their gay lodgings dames and cavaliers
 unhoused upon that desert bleak and bare
 and many at the freedom felt annoy
 which dispossessed them of such life of joy

 xl
 there is gradasso there is sacripant
 there is prasildo noble cavalier
 who with rinaldo came from the levant
 iroldo too prasildo's friend sincere
 and there at last the lovely bradamant
 discerns rogero long desired and dear
 who when assured it was that lady flew
 with joyful cheer to greet the damsel true

 xli
 as her he prized before his eyes his heart
 his life from that day cherished when she stood
 uncasqued for him and from the fight apart
 and hence an arrow drank her virgin blood
 'twere long to tell who launched the cruel dart
 and how the lovers wandered in the wood
 now guided by the sun and now benighted
 here first since that encounter reunited

 xlii
 now that the stripling sees her here and knows
 alone she freed him from the wizard's nest
 he deems his bosom with such joy overflows
 that he is singly fortunate and blest
 thither where late the damsel conquered goes
 the band descending from the mountain's crest
 and finds the hippogryph who bore the shield
 but in its case of crimson silk concealed

 xliii
 to take him by the rein the lady there
 approached and he stood fast till she was nigh
 then spread his pinions to the liquid air
 and at short distance lit halfmountain high
 and as she follows him with fruitless care
 not longer flight nor shorter will he try
 'tis thus the raven on some sandy beach
 lures on the dog and flits beyond his reach

 xliv
 gradasso sacripant rogero who
 with all those other knights below were met
 where'er they hope he may return pursue
 the beast and up and down each pass beset
 he having led those others as he flew
 often to rocky height and bottom wet
 among the rocks of the moist valley dropt
 and at short distance from rogero stopt

 xlv
 this was atlantes the enchanter's deed
 whose pious wishes still directed were
 to see rogero from his peril freed
 this was his only thought his only care
 who for such end dispatched the winged steed
 him out of europe by this sleight to bear
 rogero took his bridle but in vain
 for he was restive to the guiding rein

 xlvi
 now the bold youth from his frontino flings
 frontino was his gentle courser hight
 then leaps on him who towers in air and stings
 and goads his haughty heart with rowels bright
 he runs a short career then upward springs
 and through mid ether soars a fairer flight
 than hawk from which the falconer plucks away
 in time the blinding hood and points her prey

 xlvii
 when her rogero the fair dame discerned
 in fearful peril soar so high a strain
 she stood long space amazed ere she returned
 to her right judgement and sound wits again
 and what she erst of ganymede had learned
 snatched up to heaven from his paternal reign
 feared might befall the stripling born through air
 as gentle as young ganymede and fair

 xlviii
 she on rogero looks with stedfast eyes
 as long as feeble sight can serve her use
 and in her mind next tracks him through the skies
 when sight in vain the cherished youth pursues
 and still renewing tears and groans and sighs
 will not afford her sorrow peace or truce
 after the knight had vanished from her view
 her eyes she on the good frontino threw

 xlix
 and lest the courser should become the prey
 of the first traveller who passed the glen
 him will not leave but thence to bear away
 resolves in trust to see his lord again
 the griffin soars nor can rogero stay
 the flying courser while beneath his ken
 each peak and promontory sinks in guise
 that he discerns not flat from mountainrise

 l
 after the hippogryph has won such height
 that he is lessened to a point he bends
 his course for where the sun with sinking light
 when he goes round the heavenly crab descends
 and shoots through air like wellgreased bark and light
 which through the sea a wind propitious sends
 him leave we on his way who well shall speed
 and turn we to rinaldo in his need

 li
 day after day the good rinaldo fares
 forced by the wind the spacious ocean through
 now westward borne and now toward the bears
 for night and day the ceaseless tempest blew
 scotland at last her dusky coast uprears
 and gives the caledonian wood to view
 which through its shadowy groves of ancient oak
 oft echoes to the champion's sturdy stroke

 lii
 through this roves many a famous cavalier
 renowned for feat in arms of british strain
 and throng from distant land or country near
 french norse of german knights a numerous train
 let none save he be valiant venture here
 where seeking glory death may be his gain
 here arthur galahalt and gauvaine fought
 and well sir launcelot and tristram wrought

 liii
 and other worthies of the table round
 of either table whether old or new
 whose trophies yet remain upon the ground
 proof of their valiant feats rinaldo true
 forthwith his armour and bayardo found
 and landed on the woody coast the crew
 he bade with all the haste they might repair
 to berwick's neighbouring port and wait him there

 liv
 without a guide or company he went
 through that wide forest choosing now this way
 now that now other as it might present
 hope of adventurous quest or hard assay
 and ere the first day's circling sun is spent
 the peer is guested in an abbey gray
 which spends much wealth in harbouring those who claim
 its shelter warlike knight or wandering dame

 lv
 the monks and abbot to mount alban's peer
 a goodly welcome in their house accord
 who asked but not before with savoury cheer
 he amply had his wearied strength restored
 if in that tract by errant cavalier
 often adventurous quest might be explored
 in which a man might prove by dangerous deed
 if blame or glory were his fitting meed

 lvi
 they answered in those woods he might be sure
 many and strange adventures would be found
 but deeds there wrought were like the place obscure
 and for the greater part not bruited round
 "then seek they said a worthier quest secure
 your works will not be buried underground
 so that the glorious act achieved as due
 fame may your peril and your pain pursue

 lvii
 "and if you would your warlike worth assay
 prepare the worthiest enterprize to hear
 that e'er in times of old or present day
 was undertaken by a cavalier
 our monarch's daughter needs some friendly stay
 now sore bested against a puissant peer
 lurcanio is the doughty baron's name
 who would bereave her both of life and fame

 lviii
 "her he before her father does pursue
 perchance yet more for hatred than for right
 and vouches to a gallery she updrew
 a lover seen by him at dead of night
 hence death by fire will be the damsel's due
 such is our law unless some champion fight
 on her behalf and ere a month go by
 nigh spent upon the accuser prove the lie

 lix
 "our impious scottish law severe and dread
 wills that a woman whether low or high
 her state who takes a man into her bed
 except her husband for the offence shall die
 nor is there hope of ransom for her head
 unless to her defence some warrior hie
 and as her champion true with spear and shield
 maintain her guiltless in the listed field

 lx
 "the king sore grieving for geneura bright
 for such is his unhappy daughter's name
 proclaims by town and city that the knight
 who shall deliver her from death and shame
 he to the royal damsel will unite
 with dower well suited to a royal dame
 so that the valiant warrior who has stood
 in her defence be come of gentle blood

 lxi
 "but if within a month no knight appear
 or coming conquer not the damsel dies
 a like emrpize were worthier of your spear
 than wandering through these woods in lowly guise
 besides the eternal trophy you shall rear
 you by the deed shall gain a glorious prize
 the sweetest flower of all the ladies fair
 that betwixt ind and atlas' pillars are

 lxii
 "and you with wealth and state shall guerdoned be
 so that you evermore may live content
 and the king's grace if through your means he see
 his honour raised anew now wellnigh spent
 besides you by the laws of chivalry
 are bound to venge the damsel foully shent
 for she whose life is by such treason sought
 is chaste and spotless in the common thought"

 lxiii
 rinaldo mused awhile and then replied
 "and must a gentle damsel die by fire
 because she with a lover's wish complied
 and quenched within her arms his fond desire
 cursed be the law by which the dame is tried
 cursed he who would permit a doom so dire
 perish such fate were just who cruel proves
 not she that life bestows on him who loves

 lxiv
 "or true or false geneura's tale of shame
 if she her lover blessed i little heed
 for this my praise the lady well might claim
 if manifest were not that gentle deed
 my every thought is turned to aid the dame
 grant me but one to guide my steps and lead
 quickly to where the foul accuser stands
 i trust in god to loose geneura's bands

 lxv
 "i will not vouch her guiltless in my thought
 in fear to warrant what is false but i
 boldly maintain in such an act is nought
 for which the damsel should deserve to die
 and ween unjust or else of wit distraught
 who statutes framed of such severity
 which as iniquitous should be effaced
 and with a new and better code replaced

 lxvi
 "if like desire and if an equal flame
 move one and the other sex who warmly press
 to that soft end of love their goal the same
 which to the witless crowd seems rank excess
 say why shall woman  merit scathe or blame
 though lovers one or more she may caress
 while man to sin with whom he will is free
 and meets with praise not mere impunity

 lxvii
 "by this injurious law unequal still
 on woman is inflicted open wrong
 and to demonstrate it a grievous ill
 i trust in god which has been borne too long"
 to good rinaldo's sentence with one will
 deeming their sires unjust assents the throng
 their sires who such outrageous statute penned
 and king who might but does not this amend

 lxviii
 when the new dawn with streaks of red and white
 broke in the east and cleared the hemisphere
 rinaldo took his steed and armour bright
 a squire that abbey furnished to the peer
 with him for many leagues and miles the knight
 pricked through the dismal forest dark and drear
 while they towards the scottish city ride
 where the poor damsel's cause is to be tried

 lxix
 seeking their way to shorten as they wound
 they to the wider track a path preferred
 when echoing through the gloomy forest round
 loud lamentations nigh the road were heard
 towards a neighbouring vale whence came the sound
 this his bayardo that his hackney spurred
 and viewed between two grisly ruffians there
 a girl who seemed at distance passing fair

 lxx
 but woe begone and weeping was the maid
 as ever damsel dame or wight was seen
 hard by the barbarous twain prepared the blade
 to deluge with that damsel's blood the green
 she to delay her death awhile essayed
 until she pity moved with mournful mien
 this when rinaldo near approaching eyes
 he thither drives with threats and furious cries

 lxxi
 the ruffians turn their backs and take to flight
 as soon as they the distant succour view
 and squat within a valley out of sight
 nor cares the good rinaldo to pursue
 to her approaching sues mount alban's knight
 to say what on her head such evil drew
 and to save time commands his squire to stoop
 and take the damsel on his horse's croup

 lxxii
 and as the lady nearer he surveyed
 her wise behaviour marked and beauty's bloom
 though her fait countenance was all dismayed
 and by the fear of death o'erspread with gloom
 again to know the gentle knight essayed
 who had prepared for her so fell a doom
 and she began to tell in humble tone
 what to another canto i postpone


 canto 5

 argument
 lurcanio by a false report abused
 deemed by geneura's fault his brother dead
 weening the faithless duke whom she refused
 was taken by the damsel to her bed
 and her before the king and peers accused
 but to the session ariodantes led
 strives with his brother in disguise in season
 rinaldo comes to venge the secret treason


 i
 among all other animals who prey
 on earth or who unite in friendly wise
 whether they mix in peace or moody fray
 no male offends his mate in safety hies
 the she bear matched with hers through forest gray
 the lioness beside the lion lies
 wolves male and female live in loving cheer
 nor gentle heifer dreads the wilful steer

 ii
 what fury what abominable pest
 such poison in the human heart has shed
 that still 'twixt man and wife with rage possessed
 injurious words and foul reproach are said
 and blows and outrage hase their peace molest
 and bitter tears still wash the genial bed
 not only watered by the tearful flood
 but often bathed by senseless ire with blood

 iii
 not simply a rank sinner he appears
 to outrage nature and his god to dare
 who his foul hand against a woman rears
 or of her head would harm a single hair
 but who what drug the burning entrail sears
 or who for her would knife or noose prepare
 no man appears to me though such to sight
 he seem but rather some infernal sprite

 iv
 such and no other were those ruffians two
 whom good rinaldo from the damsel scared
 conducted to these valleys out of view
 that none might wot of her so foully snared
 i ended where the damsel fair of hue
 to tell the occasion of her scathe prepared
 to the good paladin who brought release
 and in conclusion thus my story piece

 v
 "of direr deed than ever yet was done"
 the gentle dame began "sir cavalier
 in thebes mycene argos or upon
 other more savage soil prepare to hear
 and i believe that if the circling sun
 to these our scottish shores approach less near
 than other land 'tis that he would eschew
 a foul ferocious race that shocks his view

 vi
 "all times have shown that man has still pursued
 with hair in every clime his natural foe
 but to deal death to those who seek our good
 does from too ill and foul a nature flow
 now that the truth be better understood
 i shall from first to last the occasion show
 why in my tender years against all right
 those caitiffs would have dome me foul despite

 vii
 " 'tis fitting you should know that in the spring
 of life i to the palace made resort
 there served long time the daughter of the king
 and grew with her in growth well placed in court
 when cruel love my fortune envying
 willed i should be his follower and his sport
 and made beyond each scottish lord and knight
 albany's duke find favour in my sight

 viii
 "and for he seemed to cherish me above
 all mean his love a love as ardent bred
 we hear indeed and see but do not prove
 man's faith nor is his bosom's purpose read
 believing still and yielding to my love
 i ceased not till i took him to my bed
 nor of all chambers in that evil hour
 marked i was in geneura's priviest bower

 ix
 "where hoarded she with careful privacy
 preserved whatever she esteemed most rare
 there many times she slept a gallery
 from thence projected into the open air
 here oft i made my lover climb to me
 and what he was to mount a hempen stair
 when him i to my longing arms would call
 from the projecting balcony let fall

 x
 "for here my passion i as often fed
 as good geneura's absence made me bold
 who with the varying season changed her bed
 to shun the burning heat or pinching cold
 and albany unseen and safely sped
 for fronting a dismantled street and old
 was built that portion of the palace bright
 nor any went that way by day or night

 xi
 "so was for many days and months maintained
 by us in secrecy the amorous game
 still grew by love and such new vigour gained
 i in my inmost bosom felt the flame
 and that he little loved and deeply feigned
 weened not so was i blinded to my shame
 though in a thousand certain signs betrayed
 the faithless knight his base deceit bewrayed

 xii
 "after some days of fair geneura he
 a suitor showed himself i cannot say
 if this began before he sighed for me
 or after of this love he made assay
 but judge alas with what supremacy
 he ruled my heart how absolute his sway
 since this he owned and thought no shame to move
 me to assist him in his second love

 xiii
 "unlike what he bore me he said indeed
 that was not true which he for her displayed
 but so pretending love he hoped to speed
 and celebrate due spousals with the maid
 he with her royal sire might well succeed
 were she consenting to the boon he prayed
 for after our good king for wealth and birth
 in all the realm was none of equal worth

 xiv
 "me he persuades if through my ministry
 he the king's soninlaw elected were
 for i must know he next the king would be
 advanced as high as subject could repair
 the merit should be mine and ever he
 so great a benefit in mind would bear
 and he would cherish me above his bride
 and more than every other dame beside

 xv
 "i who to please him was entirely bent
 who never could or would gainsay his will
 upon those days alone enjoy content
 when i find means his wishes to fulfil
 and snatch at all occasions which present
 a mode his praise and merits to instil
 and for my lover with all labour strain
 and industry geneura's love to gain

 xvi
 "with all my heart in furtherance of his suit
 i wrought what could be done god truly knows
 but with geneura this produced no friut
 nor her to grace my duke could i dispose
 for that another love had taken root
 in her whose every fond affection flows
 towards a gentle knight of courteous lore
 who sought our scotland from a distant shore

 xvii
 "and with a brother then right young to stay
 in our king's court came out of italy
 and there of knightly arms made such assay
 was none in britain more approved than he
 prized by the king who no ignoble pay
 rewarding him like his nobility
 bestowed upon the youth with liberal hand
 burghs baronies and castles woods and land

 xviii
 "dear to the monarch to the daughter still
 this lord was dearer ariodantes hight
 her with affection might his valour fill
 but knowledge of his love brought more delight
 nor old vesuvius nor sicilia's hill
 nor troytown ever with a blaze so bright
 flamed as with all his heart the damsel learned
 for love of her young ariodantes burned

 xix
 "the passion which she bore the lord preferred
 and loved with perfect truth and all her heart
 was the occassion i was still unheard
 nor hopeful answer would she e'er impart
 and still the more my lover's suit i stirred
 and to obtain his guerdon strove with art
 him she would censure still and ever more
 was strengthened in the hate she nursed before

 xx
 "my wayward lover often i excite
 so vain and bootless an emprize to quit
 nor idly hope to turn her stedfast sprite
 too deeply with another passion smit
 and make apparent to the scottish knight
 ariodantes such a flame had lit
 in the young damsel's breast that seas in flood
 would not have cooled one whit her boiling blood

 xxi
 "this polinesso many times had heard
 from me for such the scottish baron's name
 well warranted by sight as well as word
 how ill his love was cherished by the dame
 to see another to himself preferred
 not only quenched the haughty warrior's flame
 but the fond love which in his bosom burned
 into despiteful rage and hatred turned

 xxii
 "between geneura and her faithful knight
 such discord and ill will he schemed to shed
 and put betwixt the pair such foul despite
 no time should heal the quarrel he had bred
 bringing such scandal on that damsel bright
 the stain should cleave to her alive or dead
 nor bent to wreck her on this fatal shelf
 counselled with me or other but himself

 xxiii
 " `dalinda mine' he said his project brewed
 dalinda is my name `you needs must know
 that from the root although the trunk be hewed
 successive suckers many times will grow
 thus my unhappy passion is renewed
 tenacious still of life and buds although
 cut off by ill success with new increase
 nor till i compass my desire will cease

 xxiv
 " `nor hope of pleasure this so much has wrought
 as that to compass my design would please
 and if not in effect at least in thought
 to thrive would interpose some little ease
 then every time your bower by me is sought
 when in her bed geneura slumbers seize
 what she puts off and be it still your care
 to dress yourself in all her daily wear

 xxv
 " `dispose your locks and deck yourself as she
 goes decked and as you can with cunning heed
 imitate her then to the gallery
 you furnished with the corded stair shall speed
 i shall ascend it in the phantasy
 that you are she of whom you wear the weed
 and hope that putting on myself this cheat
 i in short time shall quench my amorous heat'

 xxvi
 "so said the knight and i who was distraught
 and all beside myself was not aware
 that the design in which he help besought
 was manifestly but too foul a snare
 and in geneura's clothes disguised as taught
 let down so oft i used the corded stair
 nor i the traitor's foul deceit perceived
 until the deadly mischief was achieved

 xxvii
 "the duke this while to ariodantes' ears
 had these or other words like these addressed
 for leagued in friendship were the cavaliers
 till rivals they pursued this common quest
 "i marvel since you are of all my peers
 he whom i must have honoured and caressed
 and held in high regard and cherished still
 you should my benefits repay so ill

 xxviii
 " `i am assured you comprehend and know
 mine and geneura's love and old accord
 and in legitimate espousal how
 i am about to claim her from my lord
 then why disturb my suit and why bestow
 your heart on her who offers no reward
 by heaven i should respect your claim and place
 were your condition mine and mine your case'

 xxix
 " `and i' cried ariodantes `marvel more'
 in answer to the scottish lord `at you
 since i of her enamoured was before
 that gentle damsel ever met your view
 and know you are assured how evermore
 we two have loved  was never love more true 
 are certain she alone would share my lot
 and are as well assured she loves you not

 xxx
 " `why have not i from you the same respect
 to which for friendship past you would pretend
 from me and i should bear you in effect
 if your hope stood more fair to gain its end
 no less than you to wed her i expect
 and if your fortunes here my wealth transcend
 as favoured of the king as you above
 you am i happy in his daughter's love'

 xxxi
 " `of what a strange mistake' to him replied
 the duke `your foolish passion is the root
 you think yourself beloved i on my side
 believe the same this try we by the fruit
 you of your own proceeding nothing hide
 and i will tell the secrets of my suit
 and let the man who proves least favoured yield
 provide himself elsewhere and quit the field

 xxxii
 " `i am prepared if such your wish to swear
 nothing of what is told me to reveal
 and will that you assure me for your share
 you shall what i recount as well conceal'
 uniting in the pact the rival pair
 their solemn vows upon the bible seal
 and when they had the mutual promise plighted
 ariodantes first his tale recited

 xxxiii
 "then plainly and by simple facts averred
 how with geneura stood his suit avows
 and how engaged by writing and by word
 she swore she would not be another's spouse
 how if to him the scottish king demurred
 virgin austerity she ever vows
 and other bridal bond for aye eschewed
 to pass her days in barren solitude

 xxxiv
 "then added how he hoped by worth which he
 had more than once avouched with knightly brand
 and yet might vouch to the prosperity
 and honour of the king and of his land
 to please so well that monarch as to be
 by him accounted worthy of the hand
 of his fair child espoused with his consent
 since he in this her wishes would content

 xxxv
 "then so concludes  `i stand upon this ground
 nor i intruder fear encroaching nigh
 nor seek i more 'tis here my hopes i bound
 nor striving for geneura's love would i
 seek surer sign of it than what is found
 by god allowed in wedlock's lawful tie
 and other suit were hopeless am i sure
 so excellent she is and passing pure'

 xxxvi
 "when ariodantes had with honest mind
 told what reward he hoped should quit his pain
 false polinesso who before designed
 to make geneura hateful to her swain
 began  `alas you yet are far behind
 my hopes and shall confess your own are vain
 and say as i the root shall manifest
 of my good fortune i alone am blest

 xxxvii
 " `with you geneura feigns nor pays nor prizes
 your passion which with hopes and words is fed
 and more than this your foolish love despises
 and this to me the damsel oft has said
 of hers i am assured of no surmises
 vain worthless words or idle promise bred
 and i to you the fact in trust reveal
 though this i should in better faith conceal

 xxxviii
 " `there passes not a month but in that space
 three nights four six and often ten the fair
 receives me with that joy in her embrace
 which seems to second so the warmth we share
 this you may witness and shall judge the case
 if empty hopes can with my bliss compare
 then since my happier fortune is above
 your wishes yield and seek another love'

 xxxix
 " `this will i not believe' in answer cried
 ariodantes `well assured you lie
 and that you have this string of falsehoods tied
 to scare me from the dear emprize i try
 but charge so passing foul you shall abide
 and vouch what you have said in arms for i
 not only on your tale place no reliance
 but as a traitor hurl you my defiance'

 xl
 "to him rejoined the duke 'i ween 'twere ill
 to take the battle upon either part
 since surer mean our purpose may fulfill
 and if it please my proof i can impart'
 ariodantes trembled and a chill
 went through his inmost bones and sick at heart
 had he in full believed his rival's boast
 would on the spot have yielded up the ghost

 xli
 "with wounded heart and faltering voice pale face
 and mouth of gall he answered 'when i see
 proofs of thy rare adventure and the grace
 with which the fair geneura honours thee
 i promise to forego the fruitless chase
 of one to thee so kind so cold to me
 but think not that thy story shall avail
 unless my very eyes confirm the tale'

 xlii
 " `to warn in due time shall be my care'
 said polinesso and so went his way
 two nights were scarecly passed ere his repair
 to the known bower was fixed for the assay
 and ready now to spring his secret snare
 he sought his rival on the appointed day
 and him to hide the night ensuing prayed
 i' the street which none their habitation made

 xliii
 "and to the youth a station overright
 the balcony to which he clambered shows
 ariodantes weened this while the knight
 would him to seek that hidden place dispose
 as one well suited to his fell despite
 and bent to take his life this ambush chose
 under the false pretence to make him see
 what seemed a sheer impossibility

 xliv
 "to go the peer resolved but in such guise
 he should not be with vantage overlaid
 and should he be assaulted by surprise
 he need not be by fear of death dismay'd
 he had a noble brother bold and wise
 first of the court in arms and on his aid
 lurcanio hight relied with better heart
 than if ten others fought upon his part

 xlv
 "he called him to his side and willed him take
 his arms and to the place at evening led
 yet not his secret purpose would be break
 nor this to him or other would have read
 him a stone's throw removed he placed and spake
 `  come if thou hearest he cry' the warrior said
 `but as thou lovest me whatsoe'er befall
 come not and move not brother till i call'

 xlvi
 " `doubt not' the valiant brother said `but go'
 and thither went that baron silently
 and hid within the lonely house and low
 over against my secret gallery
 on the other side approached the fraudful foe
 so pleased to work geneura's infamy
 and while i nothing of the cheat divine
 beneath my bower renews the wonted sign

 xlvii
 "and i in costly robe in which were set
 fair stripes of gold upon a snowy ground
 my tresses gathered in a golden net
 shaded with tassels of vermillion round
 mimicking fashions which were only met
 in fair geneura at the accustomed sound
 the gallery mount constructed in such mode
 as upon every side my person showed

 xlviii
 "this while lurcanio either with a view
 to snares which might beset his brother's feet
 or with the common passion to pursue
 and play the spy on other where the street
 was darkest and its deepest shadows threw
 followed him softly to his dim retreat
 and not ten paces from the knight aloof
 bestowed himself beneath the self same roof

 xlix
 "suspecting nought i seek the balcony
 in the same habits which i mentioned dressed
 as more than once or twice still happily
 i did before meanwhile the goodly vest
 was in the moonlight clearly seen and i
 in aspect not unlike her in the rest
 resembling much geneura's shape and cheer
 one visage well another might appear

 l
 "so much the more that there was ample space
 between the palace and the ruined row
 hence the two brothers posted in that place
 were lightly cheated by the lying show
 now put yourself in his unhappy case
 and figure what the wretched lover's woe
 when polinesso climbed the stair which i
 cast down to him and scaled the gallery

 li
 "arrived my arms about his neck i throw
 weening that we unseen of others meet
 and kiss his lips and face with loving show
 as him i hitherto was wont to greet
 and he assayed with more than wonted glow
 me to caress to mask his hollow cheat
 led to the shameful spectacle aghast
 that other from afar viewed all that passed

 lii
 "and fell into such fit of deep despair
 he there resolved to die and to that end
 planted the pommel of his falchion bare
 i' the ground its point against his breast to bend
 lurcanio who with marvel by that stair
 saw polinesso to my bower ascend
 but knew not who the wight with ready speed
 sprang forward when he saw his brother's deed

 liii
 "and hindered him in that fell agony
 from turning his own hand against his breast
 had the good youth been later or less nigh
 to his assistance he had vainly pressed
 then `wretched brother what insanity'
 he cried `your better sense has dispossessed
 die for a woman rather let her kind
 be scattered like the mist before the wind

 liv
 " `compass her death 'tis well deserved your own
 reserve as due to more illustrious fate
 'twas well to love before her fraud was shown
 but she once loved now more deserves your hate
 since witnessed by your eyes to you is known
 a wanton of what sort you worshipped late
 her fault before the scottish king to attest
 reserve those arms you turn against your breast'

 lv
 "ariodantes so surprised forewent
 joined by his brother the design in show
 but resolute to die in his intent
 was little shaken rising thence to go
 he bears away a heart not simply rent
 but dead and withered with excess of woe
 yet better comfort to lurcanio feigns
 as if the rage were spent which fired his veins

 lvi
 "the morn ensuing without further say
 to his good brother or to man beside
 he from the city took his reckless way
 with deadly desperation for his guide
 nor save the duke and knight for many a day
 was there who knew what moved the youth to ride
 and in the palace touching this event
 and in the realm was various sentiment

 lvii
 "but eight days past or more to scotland's court
 a traveller came and to geneura he
 related tidings of disastrous sort
 that ariodantes perished in the sea
 drowned of his own free will was the report
 no wind to blame for the calamity
 since from a rock which over ocean hung
 into the raging waves he headlong sprung

 lviii
 " `who said before he reached that frowning crest
 to me whom he encountered by the way
 come with me that your tongue may manifest
 and what betides me to geneura say
 and tell her too the occasion of the rest
 which you shall witness without more delay
 in having seen too much the occasion lies
 happy had i been born without these eyes"

 lix
 " `by chance upon a promontory we
 were standing overright the irish shore
 when speaking thus on that high headland he
 plunged from a rock amid the watery roar
 i saw him leap and left him in the sea
 and hurrying thence to you the tidings bore'
 geneura stood amazed her colour fled
 and at the fearful tale remained half dead

 lx
 "o god what said what did she when alone
 she on her faithful pillow layed her head
 she beat her bosom and she tore her gown
 and in despite her golden tresses shed
 repeating often in bewildered tone
 the last sad words which ariodantes said 
 that the sole source of such despair and such
 disaster was that he had seen too much

 lxi
 "wide was the rumour scattered that the peer
 had slain himself for grief nor was the cry
 by courtly dame or courtly cavalier
 or by the monarch heard with tearless eye
 but above all the rest his brother dear
 was whelmed with sorrow of so deep a dye
 that bent to follow him he well nigh turned
 his hand against himself like him he mourned

 lxii
 "and many times repeating in his thought
 it was geneura who his brother slew
 who was to selfdestruction moved by nought
 but her ill deed which he was doomed to view
 so on his mind the thirst of vengeance wrought
 and so his grief his season overthrew
 that he thought little graced of each estate
 to encounter king and people's common hate

 lxiii
 "and when the throng was fullest in the hall
 stood up before the scottish king and said
 `of having marred my brother's wits withal
 sir king and him to his destruction led
 your daughter only can i guilty call
 for in his inmost soul such sorrow bred
 the having seen her little chastity
 he loathed existence and preferred to die

 lxiv
 " `he was her lover and for his intent
 was honest this i seek not i to veil
 and to deserve her by his valour meant
 of thee if faithful service might avail
 but while he stood aloof and dared but scent
 the blossoms he beheld another scale
 scale the forbidden tree with happier boot
 and bear away from him the wishedfor fruit'

 lxv
 "then added how into the gallery came
 geneura and how dropped the corded stair
 and how into the chamber of the dame
 had climbed a leman of that lady fair
 who for disguise he knew not hence his name
 had changed his habits and concealed his hair
 and in conclusion vowed that every word
 so said he would avouch with lance and sword

 lxvi
 "you may divine how grieves the sire distraught
 with woe when he the accusation hears
 as well that what he never could have thought
 he of his daughter learns with wondering ears
 as that he knows if succour be not brought
 by cavalier that in her cause appears
 who may upon lurcanio prove the lie
 he cannot choose but doom the maid to die

 lxvii
 "i do not think our scottish law to you
 is yet unknown which sentences to fire
 the miserable dame or damsel who
 grants other than her wedded lord's desire
 she dies unless a champion good and true
 arm on her side before a month expire
 and her against the accuser base maintain
 unmeriting such death and free from stain

 lxviii
 "the king has made proclaim by town and tower
 for he believes her wronged his child to free
 her he shall have to wife with ample dower
 who saves the royal maid from infamy
 but each to the other looks and to this hour
 no champion yet 'tis said appears for he
 lurcanio is esteemed so fierce in fight
 it seems as he were feared of every knight

 "and evil fate has willed her brother dear
 zerbino is not here the foe to face
 since many months has roved the cavalier
 proving his matchless worth with spear and mace
 for if the valiant champion were more near
 such is his courage or in any place
 whither in time the news might be conveyed
 he would not fail to bear his sister aid

 lxx
 "the king mean time who would the quest pursue
 and by more certain proof than combat try
 if the accuser's tale be false or true
 and she deserve or merit not to die
 arrests some ladies of her retinue
 that as he weens the fact can verify
 whence i foresaw that if i taken were
 too certain risque the duke and i must share

 lxxi
 "that very night i from the palace flee
 and to the duke repair escaped from court
 and were i taken make him plainly see
 how much it either's safety would import
 he praised and bade me of good courage be
 and for his comfort prayed me to resort
 to a strong castle which he held hard by
 and gave me two to bear me company

 lxxii
 "with what full proofs sir stranger you have heard
 i of my love assured the scottish peer
 and clearly can discern if so preferred
 that lord was justly bound to hold me dear
 mark in conclusion what was my reward
 the glorious meed of my great merit hear
 and say if woman can expect to earn
 however well she love her love's return

 lxxiii
 "for this perfidious foul ungrateful man
 at length suspicious of my faith and zeal
 and apprehending that his wily plan
 in course of time i haply might reveal
 feigned that meanwhile the monarch's anger ran
 too high he would withdraw me and conceal
 within a fortress of his own where i
 such was his real end was doomed to die

 lxxiv
 "for secretly the duke enjoined the guide
 who with me through the gloomy forest went
 the worthy guerdon of a faith so tried
 to slay me and had compassed his intent
 but for your ready succour when i cried
 behold what wages love's poor slaves content"
 thus to rinaldo did dalinda say
 as they together still pursued their way

 lxxv
 above all other fortune to the knight
 was welcome to have found the gentle maid
 who the whole story of geneura bright
 and her unblemished innocence displayed
 and if he hoped although accused with right
 to furnish the afflicted damsel aid
 persuaded of the calumny's disproof
 he with more courage warred in her behoof

 lxxvi
 and for st andrew's town with eager speed
 where was the king with all his family
 and where the single fight in listed mead
 upon his daughter's quarrel was to be
 the good rinaldo pricked nor spared his steed
 until within an easy distance he
 now near the city met a squire who brought
 more recent tidings than the damsel taught

 lxxvii
 that thither had repaired a stranger knight
 to combat in geneura's quarrel bent
 with ensigns strange not known of living wight
 since ever close concealed the warrior went
 not since he had been there had bared to sight
 his visage aye within his helmet pent
 and that the very squire who with him came
 swore that he knew not what the stranger's name

 lxxviii
 not far they ride before the walls appear
 and now before the gate their coursers stand
 to advance the sad dalinda was in fear
 yet followed trusting in rinaldo's brand
 the gate was shut and to the porter near
 what this implies rinaldo makes demand
 to him was said the people one and all
 were trooped to see a fight without the wall

 lxxix
 beyond the city fought upon accord
 between lurcanio and a stranger knight
 where on a spacious meadow's level sward
 the pair already had begun the fight
 the porter opened to mount alban's lord
 and straight behind the peer the portal hight
 rinaldo through the empty city rode
 but in a hostel first the dame bestowed

 lxxx
 and will that she he will not long delay
 to seek her there till his return repose
 and quickly to the lists pursued his way
 where the two made that fell exchange of blows
 and strove and struggled yet in bloody fray
 lurcanio's heart with vengeful hatred glows
 against geneura while that other knight
 as well maintains the quarrel for her right

 lxxxi
 six knights on foot within the palisade
 stand covered with the corslet's iron case
 beneath the duke of albany arrayed
 borne on a puissant steed of noble race
 who there as lord highconstable obeyed
 was keeper of the field and of the place
 and joyed geneura's peril to espy
 with swelling bosom and exulting eye

 lxxxii
 rinaldo pierces through the parted swarm
 so wide is felt the good bayardo's sway
 and he who hears the courser come in storm
 halts not in his desire to make him way
 above is seen rinaldo's lofty form
 the flower of those who mix in martial fray
 he stops his horse before the monarch's chair
 while all to hear the paladin repair

 lxxxiii
 "dread sir" to him the good rinaldo said
 "let not the pair this combat longer ply
 since whichsoever of the two falls dead
 know that you let him perish wrongfully
 this thinks that he is right and is misled
 vouches the false and knows not 'tis a lie
 since that which brought his brother to his end
 moves him in causeless battle contend

 lxxxiv
 "that in pure gentleness with little care
 if what he here maintains be wrong or right
 because he would preserve a maid so fair
 perils his person in the furious fight
 to injured innocence i safety bear
 and to the evil man its opposite
 but first for love of god the battle stay
 then list sir king to what i shall display"

 lxxxv
 so moved the king the grave authority
 of one who seemed so worthy by his cheer
 that he made sign the battle should not be
 further continued then with sword or spear
 to whom together with his chivalry
 and barons of the realm and others near
 rinaldo all the treacherous plot displayed
 which polinesso for geneura layed

 lxxxvi
 next that he there in arms would testify
 the truth of what he vouched the warrior cried
 false polinesso called with troubled eye
 stood forth but daringly the tale denied
 to him the good rinaldo in reply
 "by deeds be now the doubtful quarrel tried"
 the field was cleared and ready armed the foes
 without more let in deadly duel close

 lxxxvii
 how was the hope to king and people dear
 the proof might show geneura innocent
 all trust that god will make the treason clear
 and show she was accused with foul intent
 for polinesso greedy and severe
 and proud was held and false and fraudulent
 so that none there of all assembled deemed
 it marvel if the knight such fraud had schemed

 lxxxviii
 false polinesso with a mien distressed
 a pallid cheek and heart which thickly beat
 at the third trumpet laid his lance in rest
 as well rinaldo spurred the knight to meet
 and levelled at his evil foeman's breast
 eager to finish at a single heat
 nor counter to his wish was the event
 since through the warrior half his weapon went

 lxxxix
 him through his breast impaled upon the spear
 more than six yards beyond his horse he bore
 with speed alighted mount albano's peer
 and ere he rose unlaced the helm he wore
 but he for mercy prayed with humble cheer
 unfit to strive in joust or warfare more
 and before king and court with faltering breath
 confessed the fraud which brought him to his death

 xc
 he brings not his confession to a close
 and pangs of death the failing accents drown
 the prince who ended saw his daughter's woes
 redeemed from death and scorn her virtue shown
 with more delight and rapture overflows
 than if he having lost his kingly crown
 then saw it first upon his head replaced
 so that he good rinaldo singly graced

 xci
 and when through his uplifted casque displaid
 features well known before the king descried
 his thanks to god with lifted hands he paid
 that he had deigned such succour to provide
 that other cavalier who bared his blade
 unknown of all upon geneura's side
 and thither came from far his aid to impart
 looked upon all that passed and stood apart

 xcii
 him the good king entreated to declare
 his name or at the least his visage shew
 that he might grace him with such guerdon fair
 as to his good intent was justly due
 the stranger after long and earnest prayer
 lifted to covering casque and bared to view
 what in the ensuing canto will appear
 if you are fain the history to hear


 canto 6

 argument
 ariodantes has a worthy meed
 with his loved bride the fief of albany
 meantime rogero on the flying steed
 arrives in false alcina's empery
 there from a myrtletree her every deed
 a human myrtle hears and treachery
 and thence would go but they who first withdrew
 him from one strife engage him in a new


 i
 wretched that evil man who lives in trust
 his secret sin is safe in his possession
 since if nought else the air the very dust
 in which the crime is buried makes confession
 and oftentimes his guilt compels the unjust
 though sometime unarraigned in worldly session
 to be his own accuser and bewray
 so god has willed deeds hidden from the day

 ii
 the unhappy polinesso hopes had nursed
 wholly his secret treason to conceal
 by taking off dalinda who was versed
 in this and only could the fact reveal
 and adding thus a second to his first
 offence but hurried on the dread appeal
 which haply he had stunned at least deferred
 but he to selfdestruction blindly spurred

 iii
 and forfeited estate and life and love
 of friends at once and honour which was more
 the cavalier unknown i said above
 long of the king and court entreated sore
 at length the covering helmet did remove
 and showed a visage often seen before
 the cherished face of ariodantes true
 of late lamented weeping scotland through

 iv
 ariodantes whom with tearful eye
 his brother and geneura wept as dead
 and king and people and nobility
 such light his goodness and his valour shed
 the pilgrim therefore might appear to lie
 in what he of the missing warrior said
 yet was it true that from a headland he
 had seen him plunge into the foaming sea

 v
 but as it oft befalls despairing wight
 who grisly death desires till he appear
 but loathes what he had sought on nearer sight
 so painful seems the cruel pass and drear
 thus in the sea engulphed the wretched knight
 repentant of his deed was touched with fear
 and matchless both for spirit and for hand
 beat back the billows and returned to land

 vi
 and now despising as of folly bred
 the fond desire which did to death impell
 thence soaked and dripping wet his way did tread
 and halted at a hermit's humble cell
 and housed within the holy father's shed
 there secretly awhile designed to dwell
 till to his ears by rumour should be voiced
 if his geneura sorrowed or rejoiced

 vii
 at first he heard that through excess of woe
 the miserable damsel wellnigh died
 for so abroad the doleful tidings go
 'twas talked of in the island far and wide
 far other proof than that deceitful show
 which to his cruel grief he thought he spied
 and next against the fair geneura heard
 lurcanio to her sire his charge preferred

 viii
 nor for his brother felt less enmity
 than was the love he lately bore the maid
 for he too foul and full of cruelty
 esteemed the deed although for him essayed
 and hearing after in her jeopardy
 that none appeared to lend the damsel aid
 because so puissant was lurcanio's might
 all dreaded an encounter with the knight

 ix
 and that who well the youthful champion knew
 believed he was so wary and discreet
 that had what he related been untrue
 he never would have risqued so rash a feat
  for this the greater part the fight eschew
 fearing in wrongful cause the knight to meet 
 ariodantes long his doubts are weighed
 will meet his brother in geneura's aid

 x
 "alas he said i cannot bear to see
 thus by my cause the royal damsel die
 my death too bitter and too dread would be
 did i before my own her death descry
 for still my lady my divinity
 she is  the light and comfort of my eye
 her right or wrong i cannot choose but shield
 and for her safety perish in the field

 xi
 "i know i choose the wrong and be it so
 and in the cause shall die nor this would move
 but that alas my death as well i know
 will such a lovely dame's destruction prove
 to death i with one only comfort go
 that if her polinesso bears her love
 to her will manifestly be displayed
 that hitherto he moves not in her aid

 xii
 "and me so wronged by her the maid shall view
 encounter death in her defence and he
 my brother who such flames of discord blew
 shall pay the debt of vengeance due to me
 for well i ween to make lurcanio rue
 informed of the event his cruelty
 who will have thought to venge me with his brand
 and will have slain me with his very hand"

 xiii
 he having this concluded in his thought
 made new provision of arms steed and shield
 black was the vest and buckler which he bought
 where green and yellow striped the sable field
 by hazard found with him a squire he brought
 a stranger in that country and concealed
 as is already told the unhappy knight
 against his brother came prepared for fight

 xv
 and yielding to his natural inclination
 and at the suit of all his court beside
 and mostly at rinaldo's instigation
 assigned the youth the damsel as his bride
 albany's duchy now in sequestration
 late polinesso's who in duel died
 could not be forfeited in happier hour
 since this the monarch made his daughter's dower

 xvi
 rinaldo for dalinda mercy won
 who from her fault's due punishment went free
 she satiate of the world and this to shun
 the damsel so had vowed to god will flee
 and hence in denmark's land to live a nun
 straight from her native scotland sailed the sea
 but it is time rogero to pursue
 who on his courser posts the welkin through

 xvii
 although rogero is of constant mind
 not from his cheek the wonted hues depart
 i ween that faster than a leaf i' the wind
 fluttered within his breast the stripling's heart
 all europe's region he had left behind
 in his swift course and issuing in that part
 passed by a mighty space the southern sound
 where great alcides fixed the sailor's bound

 xviii
 that hippogryph huge fowl and strange to sight
 bears off the warrior with such rapid wing
 he would have distanced in his airy flight
 the thunder bearing bird of aether's king
 nor other living creature soars such height
 him in his mighty swiftness equalling
 i scarce believe that bolt or lightning flies
 or darts more swiftly from the parted skies

 xix
 when the huge bird his pinions long had plied
 in a straight line without one stoop or bend
 he tired of air with sweeping wheel and wide
 began upon an island to descend
 like that fair region whither long unspied
 of him her wayward mood did long offend
 whilom in vain through strange and secret sluice
 passed under sea the virgin arethuse

 xx
 a more delightful place wherever hurled
 through the whole air rogero had not found
 and had he ranged the universal world
 would not have seen a lovelier in his round
 than that where wheeling wide the courser furled
 his spreading wings and lighted on the ground
 'mid cultivated plain delicious hill
 moist meadow shady bank and crystal rill

 xxi
 small thickets with the scented laurel gay
 cedar and orange full of fruit and flower
 myrtle and palm with interwoven spray
 pleached in mixed modes all lovely form a bower
 and breaking with their shade the scorching ray
 make a cool shelter from the noontide hour
 and nightingales among those branches wing
 their flight and safely amorous descants sing

 xxii
 amid red roses and white lilies there
 which the soft breezes freshen as they fly
 secure the cony haunts and timid hare
 and stag with branching forehead broad and high
 these fearless of the hunter's dart or snare
 feed at their ease or ruminating lie
 while swarming in those wilds from tuft or steep
 dun deer or nimble goat disporting leap

 xxiii
 when the hyppogryph above the island hung
 and had approached so nigh that landscape fair
 that if his rider from the saddle sprung
 he might the leap with little danger dare
 rogero lit the grass and flowers among
 but held him lest he should remount the air
 and to a myrtle nigh the rolling brine
 made fast between a baytree and a pine

 xxiv
 and there closeby where rose a bubbling fount
 begirt the fertile palm and cedartree
 he drops the shield the helmet from his front
 uplifts and either hand from gauntlet free
 now turning to the beach and now the mount
 catches the gales which blow from hill or sea
 and with a joyous murmur lightly stir
 the lofty top of beech or feathery fir

 xxv
 and now to bathe his burning lips he strains
 now dabbles in the crystal wave to chase
 the scorching heat which rages in his veins
 caught from the heavy corslet's burning case
 nor is it marvel if the burden pains
 no ramble his in square or marketplace
 three thousand miles without repose he went
 and still at speed in ponderous armour pent

 xxvi
 meanwhile the courser by the myrtle's side
 whom he left stabled in the cool retreat
 started at something in the wood descried
 scared by i know not what and in his heat
 so made the myrtle shake where he was tied
 he brought a shower of leaves about his feet
 he made the myrtle shake and foliage fall
 but struggling could not loose himself withal

 xxvii
 as in a stick to feed the chimney rent
 where scanty pith ill fills the narrow sheath
 the vapour in its little channel pent
 struggles tormented by the fire beneath
 and till its prisoned fury find a vent
 is heard to hiss and bubble sing and seethe
 so the offended myrtle inly pined
 groaned murmured and at last unclosed its rind

 xxviii
 and hence a clear intelligible speech
 thus issued with a melancholy sound
 "if as thy cheer and gentle presence teach
 thou courteous art and good his reign unbound
 release me from this monster i beseech
 griefs of my own inflict sufficient wound
 nor need i compassed with such ills about
 other new pain to plague me from without"

 xxix
 at the first sound rogero turns to see
 whence came the voice and in unused surprise
 stands when he finds it issues from the tree
 and swiftly to remove the courser hies
 then with a face suffused with crimson he
 in answer to the groaning myrtle cries
 "pardon and whatsoe'er thou art be good
 spirit of man or goddess of the wood

 xxx
 "unweeting of the wonderous prodigy
 of spirit pent beneath the knotty rind
 to your fair leaf and living body i
 have done this scathe and outrage undesigned
 but not the less for that to me reply
 what art thou who in rugged case confined
 dost live and speak and so may never hail
 from angry heaven your gentle boughs assail

 xxxi
 "and if i now or ever the despite
 i did thee can repair or aid impart
 i by that lady dear my promise plight
 who in her keeping has my better part
 to strive with word and deed till thou requite
 the service done with praise and grateful heart"
 rogero said and as he closed his suit
 that gentle myrtle shook from top to root

 xxxii
 next drops were seen to stand upon the bark
 as juice is sweated by the saplingspray
 newsevered when it yields to flame and spark
 sometime in vain kept back and held at bay
 and next the voice began "my story dark
 forced by thy courteous deed i shall display 
 what once i was  by whom through magic lore
 changed to a myrtle on the pleasant shore

 xxxiii
 "a peer of france astolpho was my name
 whilom a paladin sore feared in fight
 cousin i was to two of boundless fame
 orlando and rinaldo i by right
 looked to all england's crown my lawful claim
 after my royal father otho hight
 more dames than one my beauty served to warm
 and in conclusion wrought my single harm

 xxxiv
 "returning from those isles whose eastern side
 the billows of the indian ocean beat
 where good rinaldo and more knights beside
 with me were pent in dark and hollow seat
 thence rescued by illustrious brava's pride
 whose prowess freed us from that dark retreat
 westward i fared along the sandy shores
 on which the stormy north his fury pours

 xxxv
 "pursuing thus our rugged journey we
 came such our evil doom upon the strand
 where stood a mansion seated by the sea
 puissant alcina owned the house and land
 we found her where without her dwelling she
 had taken on the beach her lonely stand
 and though nor hook nor sweeping net she bore
 what fish she willed at pleasure drew to shore

 xxxvi
 "thither swift dolphins gambol inly stirred
 and openmouthed the cumbrous tunnies leap
 thither the seal or porpus' wallowing herd
 troop at her bidding roused from lazy sleep
 ravenfish salmon salpouth at her word
 and mullet hurry through the briny deep
 with monstrous backs above the water sail
 ork physeter seaserpent shark and whale

 xxxvii
 "there we behold a mighty whale of size
 the hugest yet in any water seen
 more than eleven paces to our eyes
 his back appears above the surface green
 and for still firm and motionless he lies
 and such the distance his two ends between
 we all are cheated by the floating pile
 and idly take the monster for an isle

 xxxviii
 "alcina made the ready fish obey
 by simple words and by mere magic lore
 born with morgana  but i cannot say
 if at one birth or after or before
 as soon as seen my aspect pleased the fay
 who showed it in the countenance she wore
 then wrought with art and compassed her intent
 to part me from the friends with whom i went

 xxxix
 "she came towards us with a cheerful face
 with graceful gestures and a courteous air
 and said 'so you my lodging please to grace
 sir cavalier and will with me repair
 you shall behold the wonders of my chace
 and note the different sorts of fish i snare
 shaggy or smooth or clad in scales of light
 and more in number than the stars of night

 xl
 " 'and would you hear a mermaid sing so sweet
 that the rude sea grows civil at her song
 wont at this hour her music to repeat
 with that she showed the monster huge and long
  i said it seemed an island  as her seat
 pass with me where she sings the shoals among'
 i that was always wilful at her wish
 i now lament my rashness climb the fish

 xli
 "to dudon and rinaldo's signal blind
 i go who warn me to misdoubt the fay
 with laughing face alcina mounts behind
 leaving the other two beside the bay
 the obedient fish performs the task assigned
 and through the yielding water works his way
 repentant of my deed i curse the snare
 too far from land my folly to repair

 xlii
 "to aid me swam mount alban's cavalier
 and was nigh drowned amid the waves that rise
 for a southwind sprang up that far and near
 covered with sudden darkness seas and skies
 i know not after what befel the peer
 this while alcina to console me tries
 and all that day and night which followed me
 detained upon that monster in midsea

 xliii
 "till to this isle we drifted with the morn
 of which alcina keeps a mighty share
 by that usurper from a sister torn
 who was her father's universal heir
 for that she only was in wedlock born
 and for those other two false sisters were
 so wellinstructed in the story said
 one who rehearsed the tale in incest bred

 xliv
 "as these are practised in iniquity
 and full of every vice and evil art
 so she who ever lives in chastity
 wisely on better things has set her heart
 hence leagued against her in conspiracy
 those others are to drive her from her part
 and more than once their armies have o'errun
 her realm and towns above a hundred won

 xlv
 "nor at this hour a single span of ground
 would logistilla such her name command
 but that a mountain here and there a sound
 protects the remnant from the invading band
 'tis thus the mountain and the river bound
 england and part it from the scottish land
 yet will the sisters give their foe no rest
 till of her scanty remnant dispossest

 xlvi
 "because in wickedness and vice were bred
 the pair as chaste and good they loath the dame
 but to return to what i lately said
 and to relate how i a plant became
 me full of love the kind alcina fed
 with full delights nor i a weaker flame
 for her within my burning heart did bear
 beholding her so courteous and so fair

 xlvii
 "clasped in her dainty limbs and lapt in pleasure
 i weened that i each separate good had won
 which to mankind is dealt in different measure
 little or more to some and much to none
 i evermore contemplated my treasure
 nor france nor aught beside i thought upon
 in her my every fancy every hope
 centered and ended as their common scope

 xlviii
 "by her i was as much beloved or more
 nor did alcina now for other care
 she left her every lover for before
 others in truth the fairy's love did share
 i was her close adviser evermore
 and served by her where they commanded were
 with me she counselled and to me referred
 nor night nor day to other spake a word

 xlix
 "why touch my wounds to aggravate my ill
 and that alas without the hope of cure
 why thus the good possessed remember still
 amid the cruel penance i endure
 when kindest i believed alcina's will
 and fondly deemed my happiness secure
 from me the heart she gave the fay withdrew
 and yielded all her soul to love more new

 l
 "late i discerned her light and fickle bent
 still loving and unloving at a heat
 two months i reigned not more no sooner spent
 than a new paramour assumed my seat
 and me with scorn she doomed to banishment
 from her fair grace cast out 'tis then i weet
 i share a thousand lovers' fate whom she
 had to like pass reduced all wrongfully

 li
 "and these because they should not scatter bruits
 roaming the world of her lascivious ways
 she up and down the fruitful soil transmutes
 to olive palm or cedar firs or bays
 these as you see me changed alcina roots
 while this transformed into a monster strays
 another melts into a liquid rill
 as suits that haughty fairy's wanton will

 lii
 "thou too that to this fatal isle art led
 by way unwonted and till now unknown
 that some possessor of the fairy's bed
 may be for thee transformed to wave or stone
 thou shalt with more than mortal pleasures fed
 have from alcina seigniory and throne
 but shalt be sure to join the common flock
 transformed to beast or fountain plant or rock

 liii
 "i willingly to thee this truth impart
 not that i hope with profit to advise
 yet 'twill be better that informed in part
 of her false ways she harm not by surprise
 perhaps as faces differ and in art
 and wit of man an equal difference lies
 thou may'st some remedy perchance apply
 to the ill which thousand others could not fly"

 liv
 the good rogero who from fame had learned
 that he was cousin to the dame he wooed
 lamented much the sad astolpho turned
 from his true form to barren plant and rude
 and for her love for whom so sore he burned
 would gladly serve the stripling if he cou'd
 but witless how to give the wished relief
 might but console the unhappy warrior's grief

 lv
 as best he could he strove to soothe his pain
 then asked him if to logistil's retreat
 were passage whether over hill or plain
 that he might so eschew alcina's seat
  `there was a way' the myrtle said again
  `but rough with stones and rugged to the feet 
 if he some little further to the right
 would scale the alpine mountain's very height

 lvi
 `but that he must not think he shall pursue
 the intended journey far since by the way
 he will encounter with a frequent crew
 and fierce who serve as rampart to the fay
 that block the road against the stranger who
 would break her bounds and the deserter stay'
 rogero thanked the tree for all and taught
 departed thence with full instructions fraught

 lvii
 the courser from the myrtle he untied
 and by the bridle led behind him still
 nor would he as before the horse bestride
 lest he should bear him off against his will
 he mused this while how safely he might find
 a passage to the land of logistil
 firm in his purpose every nerve to strain
 lest empire over him alcina gain

 lviii
 he to remount the steed and through the air
 to spur him to a new career again
 now thought but doubted next in fear to fare
 worse on the courser restive to the rein
 "no i will win by force the mountain stair"
 rogero said but the resolve was vain
 nor by the beach two miles his way pursued
 ere he alcina's lovely city viewed

 lix
 a lofty wall at distance meets his eye
 which girds a spacious town within its bound
 it seems as if its summit touched the sky
 and all appears like gold from top to ground
 here some one says it is but alchemy
  and haply his opinion is unsound 
 and haply he more wittily divines
 for me i deem it gold because it shines

 lx
 when he was nigh the citywalls so bright
 the world has not their equal he the straight
 and spacious way deserts the way which dight
 across the plain conducted to the gate
 and by that safer road upon the right
 strains now against the mountain but in wait
 encounters soon the crowd of evil foes
 who furiously the child's advance oppose

 lxi
 was never yet beheld a stranger band
 of mien more hideous or more monstrous shape
 formed downwards from neck like men he scanned
 some with the head of cat and some of ape
 with hoof of goat that other stamped the sand
 while some seemed centaurs quick in fight and rape
 naked or mantled in outlandish skin
 these doting sires those striplings bold in sin

 lxii
 this gallops on a horse without a bit
 this backs the sluggish ass or bullock slow
 these mounted on the croup of centaur sit
 those perched on eagle crane or estridge go
 some male some female some hermaphrodit
 these drain the cup and those the bungle blow
 one bore a corded ladder one a book
 one a dull file or bar of iron shook

 lxiii
 the captain of this crew which blocked the road
 appeared with monstrous paunch and bloated face
 who a slow tortoise for a horse bestrode
 that passing sluggishly with him did pace
 down looked some here some there sustained the load
 for he was drunk and kept him in his place
 some wipe his brows and chin from sweat which ran
 and others with their vests his visage fan

 lxiv
 one with a human shape and feet his crest
 fashioned like hound in neck and ears and head
 bayed at the gallant child with angry quest
 to turn him to the city whence he fled
 "that will i never while of strength possessed
 to brandish this" the good rogero said
 with that his trenchant faulchion he displayed
 and pointed at him full the naked blade

 lxv
 that monster would have smote him with a spear
 but swiftly at his foe rogero sprung
 thrust at his paunch and drove his faulchion sheer
 through his pierced back a palm his buckler flung
 before him and next sallied there and here
 but all too numerous was the wicked throng
 now grappled from behind now punched before
 he stands and plies the crowd with warfare sore

 lxvi
 one to the teeth another to the breast
 of that foul race he cleft since no one steeled
 in mail his brows with covering helmet dressed
 or fought secured by corslet or by shield
 yet is he so upon all quarters pressed
 that it would need the child to clear the field
 and to keep off the wicked crew which swarms
 more than briareus' hundred hands and arms

 lxvii
 if he had thought the magic shield to show
 i speak of that the necromancer bore
 which dazed the sight of the astonished foe
 left at his saddle by the wizard moor
 that hideous band in sudden overthrow
 blinded by this had sunk the knight before
 but haply he despised such mean as vile
 and would prevail by valour not by guile

 lxviii
 this as it may the child would meet his fate
 ere by so vile a band be prisoner led
 when lo forth issuing from the city's gate
 whose wall appeared like shining gold i said
 two youthful dames not born in low estate
 if measured by their mien and garb nor bred
 by swain in early wants and troubles versed
 but amid princely joys in palace nursed

 lxix
 on unicorn was seated either fair
 a beast than spotless ermine yet more white
 so lovely were the damsels and so rare
 their garb and with such graceful fashion dight
 that he who closely viewed the youthful pair
 would need a surer sense than mortal sight
 to judge between the two with such a mien
 embodied grace and beauty would be seen

 lxx
 into the mead rode this and the other dame
 where the foul crew opposed the child's retreat
 the rabble scattered as the ladies came
 who with extended hand the warrior greet
 he with a kindling visage red with shame
 thanked the two damsels for their gentle feat
 and was content upon their will to wait
 with them returning to that golden gate

 lxxi
 above a cornice round the gateway goes
 somedeal projecting from the colonnade
 in which is not a single part but glows
 with rarest gems of india overlaid
 propp'd at four points the portal did repose
 on columns of one solid diamond made
 whether what met the eye was false or true
 was never sight more fair or glad to view

 lxxii
 upon the sill and through the columns there
 ran young and wanton girls in frolic sport
 who haply yet would have appeared more fair
 had they observed a woman's fitting port
 all are arrayed in green and garlands wear
 of the fresh leaf him these in courteous sort
 with many proffers and fair mien entice
 and welcome to this opening paradise

 lxxiii
 for so with reason i this place may call
 where it is my belief that love had birth
 where life is spent in festive game and ball
 and still the passing moments fleet in mirth
 here hoaryheaded thought ne'er comes at all
 nor finds a place in any bosom dearth
 nor yet discomfort never enter here
 where plenty fills her horn throughout the year

 lxxiv
 here where with jovial and unclouded brow
 glad april seems to wear a constant smile
 troop boys and damsels one whose fountains flow
 on the green margin sings in dulcet style
 others the hill or tufted tree below
 in dance or no mean sport the hours beguile
 while this who shuns the revellers' noisy cheer
 tells his love sorrows in his comrade's ear

 lxxv
 above the laurel and pinetree's height
 through the tall beech and shaggy firtree's spray
 sport little loves with desultory flight
 these at their conquests made rejoiced and gay
 these with the welldirected shaft take sight
 at hearts and those spread nets to catch their prey
 one wets his arrows in the brook which winds
 and one on whirling stone the weapon grinds

 lxxvi
 to good rogero here was brought a steed
 puissant and nimble all of sorel hue
 who was caparisoned with costly weed
 broidered with gold and jewels bright to view
 that other winged horse which at his need
 obedient to the moorish wizard flew
 the friendly damsels to a youth consigned
 who led him at a slower pace behind

 lxxvii
 that kindly pair who by the wicked band
 offended fate had saved the youthful knight
 the wicked crew that did the child withstand
 when he the road had taken on his right
 exclaimed "fair sir your works already scanned
 by us who are instructed of your might
 embolden us in our behalf to pray
 you will the prowess of your arm assay

 lxxviii
 "we soon shall reach a bottom which divides
 the plain into two parts a cruel dame
 a bridge maintains which there a stream bestrides
 eriphila the savage beldam's name
 who cheats and robs and scathes whoever rides
 to the other shore a giantess in frame
 who has long poisonous teeth her prey to tear
 and scratches with her talons like a bear

 lxxix
 "besides that she infests the public way
 which else were free she often ranging through
 all this fair garden puts in disarray
 this thing or that of the assassin crew
 that people who without the portal gay
 lately with brutal rage assaulted you
 many her sons the whole her followers call
 as greedy and inhospitable all"

 lxxx
 "for you not only her i would assail
 but do a hundred battles well content
 then of my person where it may avail
 dispose rogero said to you intent
 silver and land to conquer plate or mail
 i swear not i in warlike cuirass pent
 but to afford my aid to others due
 and most of all to beauteous dames like you"

 lxxxi
 their grateful thanks the ladies worthily
 bestowed on such a valiant champion paid
 they talking thus the bridge and river see
 and at her post the haughty dame arraid
 sapphire and emerald decked the panoply
 in arms of gold but i awhile delay
 till other strain the issue of the fray


 canto 7

 argument
 rogero as directed by the pair
 the giantess eriphila o'erthrows
 that done he to alcina's labyrinth where
 more than one knight is tied and prisoned goes
 to him melissa sage the secret snare
 and remedy for that grave evil shows
 whence he by her advised with downcast eye
 and full of shame forthwith resolves to fly


 i
 the traveller he whom sea or mountain sunder
 from his own country sees things strange and new
 that the misjudging vulgar which lies under
 the mist of ignorance esteems untrue
 rejecting whatsoever is a wonder
 unless 'tis palpable and plain to view
 hence inexperience as i know full well
 will yield small credence to the tale i tell

 ii
 but this be great or small i know not why
 the rabble's silly judgement i should fear
 convinced you will not think the tale a lie
 in whom the light of reason shines so clear
 and hence to you it is i only try
 the fruit of my fatigues to render dear
 i ended where eriphila in guard
 of bridge and stream was seen the passage barred

 iii
 of finest metal was her armour bright
 with gems of many colours overspread
 the tawny jacinth yellow chyrsolite
 the emerald green of hue and ruby red
 mounted but not on palfrey for the fight
 in place of that she on a wolf had sped
 sped on a wolf towards the pass and rode
 on sell that rich beyond all custom showed

 iv
 no larger wolf i ween apulia roams
 more huge than bull unguided by her hand
 although upon no bit the monster foams
 docile i know not why to her command
 the accursed plague arrayed in surcoat comes
 above her arms in colour like the sand
 that saving in its dye was of the sort
 which bishops and which prelates wear at court

 v
 the giantess's crest and shield appear
 for ensign decked with swoln and poisonous toad
 her the two damsels to the cavalier
 before the bridge prepared for battle showed
 threatening as wont to some with levelled spear
 to do the warrior scorn and bar the road
 bidding him turn she to rogero cries
 a lance he takes and threats her and defies

 vi
 as quick and daring the gigantic pest
 spurred her wolf seated well for that dread game
 in mid career she laid her lance in rest
 and made earth quake beneath her as she came
 yet at the encounter fierce the champaign pressed
 for underneath the casque with stedfast aim
 so hard rogero smote her that he bore
 the beldam backward six good yards and more

 vii
 and came already with his lifted blade
 drawn for that end to take her haughty head
 to him an easy task for she was laid
 among the grass and flowers like one that's dead
 but " 'tis enough that she is vanquished" said
 the pair "no further press thy vengeance dread
 sheathe courteous cavalier thy sword anew
 pass we the river and our way pursue"

 viii
 along the path which through a forest lay
 roughish and somedeal ill to beat they went
 besides that strait and stony was the way
 this nigh directly scaled a hill's ascent
 but when arrived upon the summit they
 issued upon a mead of vast extent
 and a more pleasant palace on that green
 beheld and brighter than was ever seen

 ix
 to meet the child alcina fair of hue
 advanced some way beyond the outer gate
 and girded by a gay and courtly crew
 rogero there received in lordly state
 while all the rest to him such honour do
 and on the knight with such deep reverence wait
 they could not have displayed more zeal and love
 had jove descended from the choirs above

 x
 not so much does the palace fair to see
 in riches other princely domes excel
 as that the gentlest fairest company
 which the whole world contains within it dwell
 of either sex with small variety
 between in youth and beauty matched as well
 the fay alone exceeds the rest as far
 as the bright sun outshines each lesser star

 xi
 her shape is of such perfect symmetry
 as best to feign the industrious painter knows
 with long and knotted tresses to the eye
 not yellow gold with brighter lustre glows
 upon her tender cheek the mingled dye
 is scattered of the lily and the rose
 like ivory smooth the forehead gay and round
 fills up the space and forms a fitting bound

 xii
 two black and slender arches rise above
 two clear black eyes say suns of radiant light
 which ever softly beam and slowly move
 round these appears to sport in frolic flight
 hence scattering all his shafts the little love
 and seems to plunder hearts in open sight
 thence through mid visage does the nose descend
 where envy finds not blemish to amend

 xiii
 as if between two vales which softly curl
 the mouth with vermeil tint is seen to glow
 within are strung two rows of orient pearl
 which her delicious lips shut up or show
 of force to melt the heart of any churl
 however rude hence courteous accents flow
 and here that gentle smile receives its birth
 which opes at will a paradise on earth

 xiv
 like milk the bosom and the neck of snow
 round is the neck and full and large the breast
 where fresh and firm two ivory apples grow
 which rise and fall as to the margin pressed
 by pleasant breeze the billows come and go
 not prying argus could discern the rest
 yet might the observing eye of things concealed
 conjecture safely from the charms revealed

 xv
 to all her arms a just proportion bear
 and a white hand is oftentimes descried
 which narrow is and somedeal long and where
 no knot appears nor vein is signified
 for finish of that stately shape and rare
 a foot neat short and round beneath is spied
 angelic visions creatures of the sky
 concealed beneath no covering veil can lie

 xvi
 a springe is planted in rogero's way
 on all sides did she speak smile sing or move
 no wonder then the stripling was her prey
 who in the fairy saw such show of love
 with him the guilt and falsehood little weigh
 of which the offended myrtle told above
 nor will he think that perfidy and guile
 can be united with so sweet a smile

 xvii
 no he could now believe by magic art
 astolpho well transformed upon the plain
 for punishment of foul ungrateful heart
 and haply meriting severer pain
 and as for all he heard him late impart
 'twas prompted by revenge 'twas false and vain
 by hate and malice was the sufferer stung
 to blame and wound the fay with slanderous tongue

 xviii
 the beauteous lady whom he loved so well
 is newly banished from his altered breast
 for such the magic of alcina's spell
 she every ancient passion dispossessed
 and in his bosom there alone to dwell
 the image of her love and self impressed
 so witched rogero sure some grace deserves
 if from his faith his frail affection swerves

 xix
 at board lyre lute and harp of tuneful string
 and other sounds in mixed diversity
 made round about the joyous palace ring
 with glorious concert and sweet harmony
 nor lacked there wellaccorded voice to sing
 of love its passion and its ecstasy
 nor who with rare inventions choicely versed
 delightful fiction to the guests rehearsed

 xx
 what table spread by whatsoever heir
 of ninus though triumphant were the board
 or what more famous and more costly where
 cleopatra feasted with the latian lord
 could with this banquet's matchless joys compare
 by the fond fairy for rogero stored
 i think not such a feast is spread above
 where ganymede presents the cup to jove

 xxi
 they form a ring the board and festive cheer
 removed and sitting play a merry game
 each asks still whispering in a neighbour's ear
 what secret pleases best to knight and dame
 a fair occasion without let or fear
 their love unheard of any to proclaim
 and in conclusion the two lovers plight
 their word to meet together on that night

 xxii
 soon and much sooner than their wont was ended
 the game at which the palace inmates play
 when pages on the troop with torches tended
 and with their radiance chased the night away
 to seek his bed the paladin ascended
 girt with that goodly squadron in a gay
 and airy bower appointed for his rest
 mid all the others chosen as the best

 xxiii
 and when of comfits and of cordial wine
 a fitting proffer has been made anew
 the guests their bodies reverently incline
 and to their bowers depart the courtly crew
 he upon perfumed sheets whose texture fine
 seemed of arachne's loom his body threw
 hearkening this while with still attentive ears
 if he the coming of the lady hears

 xxiv
 at every movement heard on distant floor
 hoping 'twas her rogero raised his head
 he thinks he hears but it is heard no more
 then sighs at his mistake ofttimes from bed
 he issued and undid his chamber door
 and peeped abroad but still no better sped
 and cursed a thousand times the hour that she
 so long retarded his felicity

 xxv
 "yes now she comes" the stripling often said
 and reckoned up the paces as he lay
 which from her bower where haply to be made
 to that where he was waiting for the fay
 these thoughts and other thoughts as vain he weighed
 before she came and restless at her stay
 often believed some hinderance yet unscanned
 might interpose between the fruit and hand

 xxvi
 at length when dropping sweets the costly fay
 had put some end to her perfumery
 the time now come she need no more delay
 since all was hushed within the palace she
 stole from her bower alone through secret way
 and passed towards the chamber silently
 where on his couch the youthful cavalier
 lay with a heart long torn by hope and fear

 xxvii
 when the successor of astolpho spies
 those smiling stars above him at the sight
 a flame like that of kindled sulphur flies
 through his full veins as ravished by delight
 out of himself and now up to the eyes
 plunged in a sea of bliss he swims outright
 he leaps from bed and folds her to his breast
 nor waits until the lady he undressed

 xxviii
 though but in a light sendal clad that she
 wore in the place of farthingale or gown
 which o'er a shift of finest quality
 and white about her limbs the fay had thrown
 the mantle yielded at his touch as he
 embraced her and that veil remained alone
 which upon every side the damsel shows
 more than clear glass the lily or the rose

 xxix
 the plant no closer does the ivy clip
 with whose green boughs its stem is interlaced
 than those fond lovers each from either's lip
 the balmy breath collecting he embraced
 rich perfume this whose like no seed or slip
 bears in sweet indian or sabacan waste
 while so to speak their joys is either fixed
 that oftentimes those meeting lips are mixed

 xxx
 these things were carried closely by the dame
 and youth or if surmised were never bruited
 for silence seldom was a cause for blame
 but oftener as a virtue well reputed
 by those shrewd courtiers conscious of his claim
 rogero is with proffers fair saluted
 worshipped of all those inmates who fulfil
 in this the enamoured far alcina's will

 xxxi
 no pleasure is omitted there since they
 alike are prisoners in love's magic hall
 they change their raiment twice or thrice a day
 now for this use and now at other call
 'tis often feast and always holiday
 'tis wrestling tourney pageant bath and ball
 now underneath a hill by fountain cast
 they read the amorous lays of ages past

 xxxii
 now by glad hill or through the shady dale
 they hunt the fearful hare and now they flush
 with busy dog sagacious of the trail
 wild pheasant from the stubblefield or bush
 now where green junipers perfume the gale
 suspend the snare or lime the fluttering thrush
 and casting now for fish with net or book
 disturb their secret haunts in pleasant brook

 xxxiii
 rogero revels there in like delight
 while charles and agramant are troubled sore
 but not for him their story will i slight
 nor bradamant forget who evermore
 mid toilsome pain and care her cherished knight
 ravished from her did many a day deplore
 whom by unwonted ways transported through
 mid air the damsel saw nor whither knew

 xxxiv
 of her i speak before the royal pair
 who many days pursued her search in vain
 by shadowy wood or over champaign bare
 by farm and city and by hill and plain
 but seeks her cherished friend with fruitless care
 divided by such space of land and main
 often she goes among the paynim spears
 yet never aught of her rogero hears

 xxxv
 of hundreds questioned upon every side
 each day no answer ever gives content
 she roams from post to post and far and wide
 searches pavilion lodging booth or rent
 and this mid foot or horsemen unespied
 may safely do without impediment
 thanks to the ring whose more than mortal aid
 when in her mouth conceals the vanished maid

 xxxvi
 she cannot will not think that he is dead
 because the wreck of such a noble knight
 would from hydaspes' distant waves have spread
 to where the sun descends with westering light
 she knows not what to think nor whither sped
 he roams in earth or air yet hapless wight
 him ever seeks and for attendant train
 has sobs and sighs and every bitter pain

 xxxvii
 at length to find the wondrous cave she thought
 where the prophetic homes of merlin lie
 and there lament herself until she wrought
 upon the pitying marble to reply
 for thence if yet he lived would she be taught
 of this glad life to hard necessity
 had yielded up and when she was possessed
 of the seer's councils would pursue the best

 xxxviii
 with this intention bradamant her way
 directed thither where in poictier's wood
 the vocal tomb containing merlin's clay
 concealed in alpine place and savage stood
 but that enchantress sage who night and day
 thought of the damsel watchful for her good
 she i repeat who taught her what should be
 in that fair grotto her posterity

 xxxix
 she who preserved her with protecting care
 that same enchantress still benign and wise
 who knowing she a matchless race should bear
 of men or rather semideities
 spies daily what her thoughts and actions are
 and lots for her each day divining tries 
 she all rogero's fortune knew how freed
 then borne to india by the griffin steed

 xl
 him on that courser plainly she had eyed
 who would not the controlling rein obey
 when severed by such interval he hied
 borne through the perilous unwonted way
 and knew that he sport dance and banquet plied
 and lapt in idleness and pleasure lay
 nor memory of his lord nor of the dame
 once loved so well preserved not of his fame

 xli
 and thus such gentle knight ingloriously
 would have consumed his fairest years and best
 in long inaction afterwards to be
 body and soul destroyed and that possessed
 alone by us in perpetuity
 that flower whose sweets outlive the fragile rest
 which quickens man when he in earth is laid
 would have been plucked or severed in the blade

 xlii
 but that enchantress kind who with more care
 than for himself he watched still kept the knight
 designed to drag him by rough road and bare
 towards true virtue in his own despite
 as often cunning leech will burn and pare
 the flesh and poisonous drug employ aright
 who though at first his cruel art offend
 is thanked since he preserves us in the end

 xliii
 she not like old atlantes rendered blind
 by the great love she to the stripling bore
 set not on gifting him with life her mind
 as was the scope of that enchanter hoar
 who reckless all of fame and praise declined
 wished length of days to his rogero more
 than that to win a world's applause the peer
 should of his joyous life forego one year

 xliv
 by him he to alcina's isle had been
 dispatched that in her palace he might dwell
 forgetting arms and as enchanter seen
 in magic and the use of every spell
 the heart had fastened of that fairyqueen
 enamoured of the gentle youth so well
 that she the knot would never disengage
 though he should live to more than nestor's age

 xlv
 returning now to her that well foreknew
 whatever was to come to pass i say
 she thither did her journey straight pursue
 where she met aymon's daughter by the way
 forlorn and wandering bradamant at view
 of her enchantress erst to grief a prey
 changes it all to hope the other tells
 that with alcina her rogero dwells

 xlvi
 nigh dead the maid remains in piteous guise
 hearing of him so far removed and more
 grieves that she danger to her love descries
 save this some strong and speedy cure restore
 but her the enchantress comforts and applies
 a salve where it was needed most and swore
 that few short days should pass before anew
 rogero should return to glad her view

 xlvii
 "since thou an antidote to sorcery
 lady she said the virtuous ring dost wear
 i have no doubt if to yon island i
 this where thine every good is hidden hear
 to foil alcina's wiles and witchery
 and thence to bring thee back thy cherished care
 this evening early will i hence away
 and be in india by the break of day"

 xlviii
 and told to her the tale continuing
 the mode which she was purposing to employ
 from that effeminate soft realm to bring
 back into warlike france the cherished boy
 bradamant from her finger slipt the ring
 nor this alone would have bestowed with joy
 but heart and life would at her feet have laid
 if she had deemed they could rogero aid

 xlix
 giving the ring her cause she recommends
 to her and recommends rogero more
 countless salutes by her the damsel sends
 then of provence departing seeks the shore
 the enchantress to another quarter wends
 and for the execution of her lore
 conjures that eve a palfrey by her art
 with one foot red black every other part

 l
 some farfarello or alchino he
 i think whom in that form she raised from hell
 and with loose hair dishevelled horribly
 ungirt and barefoot mounted in the sell
 but with wise caution from her finger she
 withdrew the ring lest it should mar the spell
 and then by him was with such swiftness born
 she in alcina's isle arrived at morn

 li
 herself she changed with wonderful disguise
 adding a palm of stature to her height
 and made her limbs of a proportioned size
 and of the very measure seemed to sight
 as was she deemed the necromancer wise
 who with such care had reared the youthful knight
 with longdescending beard she clothed her chin
 and wrinkled o'er her front and other skin

 lii
 to imitate his speech and face and cheer
 she knew so well that by the youth descried
 she might the sage atlantes' self appear
 next hid and watched so long that she espied
 upon a day rare chance the cavalier
 at length detached from his alcina's side
 for still in motion or at rest the fay
 ill bore the youth should be an hour away

 liii
 alone she finds him fitting well her will
 as he enjoys the pure and morning air
 beside a brook which trickled from a hill
 streaming towards a limpid lake and fair
 his fine soft garments wove with cunning skill
 all over ease and wantonness declare
 these with her hand such subtle toil well taught
 for him in silk and gold alcina wrought

 liv
 about the stripling's neck a splendid string
 of gems descending to midbreast is wound
 on each once manly arm now glittering
 with the bright hoop a bracelet fair is bound
 pierced with golden wire in form of ring
 is either ear and from the yellow round
 depend two precious pearls not such the coast
 of araby or sumptuous india boast

 lv
 crisped into comely ringlets was his hair
 wet with the costliest odours and the best
 and soft and amorous all his gestures were
 like one who does valentian lady's hest
 in him beside his name was nothing fair
 and more than half corrupted all the rest
 so was rogero found within that dell
 changed from his former self by potent spell

 lvi
 him in the figure of atlantes sage
 she fronts who bore the enchanter's borrowed cheer
 with that grave face and reverend with age
 which he was always wonted to revere
 and with that eye which in his pupillage
 beaming with wrath he whilom so did fear
 and sternly cries "is this the fruit at last
 which pays my tedious pain and labour past

 lvii
 "the marrow of the lion and the bear
 didst thou for this thine early banquet make
 and trained by me by cliff or cavernlair
 strangle with infant hands the crested snake
 their claws from tiger and from panther tear
 and tusks from living boar in tangled brake
 that bred in such a school in thee should i
 alcina's atys or adonis spy

 lviii
 "is this the hope that stars observed by me
 signs in conjunction sacred fibres bred
 with what beside of dream or augury
 and all those lots i but too deeply read
 which while yet hanging at the breast of thee
 when these thy years should be accomplished said
 thy fears should so be bruited far and near
 thou justly should be deemed without a peer

 lix
 "this does in truth a fair beginning show
 a seed which we may hope will soon conceive
 a julius alexander scipio
 who thee alcina's bondsman could believe
 and for the world the shameful fact might know
 that all should manifest to sight perceive
 upon thy neck and arms the servile chains
 wherewith she at her will her captive trains

 lx
 "if thine own single honour move not thee
 and the high deeds which thou art called to do
 wherefore defraud thy fair posterity
 of what was oft predicted should ensue
 alas why seal the womb god willed should be
 pregnant by thee with an illustrious crew
 that far renowned and more than human line
 destined the sun in glory to outshine

 lxi
 "forbid not of the noblest souls the birth
 formed in the ideas of eternal mind
 destined from age to age to visit earth
 sprung from thy stock and clothed in corporal rind
 the spring of thousand palms and festal mirth
 through which to italy with losses pined
 and wounds thy good descendants shall restore
 the fame and honours she enjoyed of yore

 lxii
 "not only should these many souls have weight
 to bend thy purpose holy souls and bright
 which from thy fruitful tree shall vegetate
 but though alone a single couple might
 suffice a nobler feeling to create
 alphonso and his brother hyppolite
 whose like was seldom witnessed to this time
 through all the paths whence men to virtue climb

 lxiii
 "i was more wont to dwell upon this pair
 than all the rest of whom i prophesied
 as well that these a greater part should bear
 in lofty virtues as that i descried
 thee listening to my lore with closer care
 than to the tale of all thy seed beside
 i saw thee joy that such a pair would shine
 amid the heroes of thy noble line

 lxiv
 "say what has she thou makest thy fancy's queen
 more than what other courtezans possess
 who of so many concubine has been
 how used her lovers in the end to bless
 thou truly know'st but that she may be seen
 without disguise and in her real dress
 this ring returning on thy finger wear
 and thou shalt see the dame and mark how fair"

 lxv
 abashed and mute rogero listening
 in vain to her reproof an answer sought
 who on his little finger put the ring
 whose virtue to himself the warrior brought
 and such remorse and shame within him spring
 when on his altered sense the change is wrought
 a thousand fathoms deep he fain would lie
 buried in earth unseen of any eye

 lxvi
 so speaking to the natural shape she wore
 before his eyes returned the magic dame
 nor old atlantes' form was needed more
 the good effect obtained for which she came
 to tell you that which was not told before
 melissa was the sage enchantress' name
 who to rogero now her purpose said
 and told with what design she thither sped

 lxvii
 dispatched by her who him in anxious pain
 desires nor longer can without him be
 with the intent to loose him from the chain
 wherewith he was begirt by sorcery
 and had put on more credence to obtain
 atlantes de carena's form but she
 seeing his health restored now willed the youth
 through her should hear and see the very truth

 lxviii
 "that gentle lady who so loves thee who
 were well deserving love upon thy part
 to whom unless forgot thou know'st how true
 the tale thou debtor for thy freedom art
 this ring which can each magic spell undo
 sends for thy succour and would send her heart
 if with such virtue fraught her heart could bring
 thee safely in thy perils like the ring"

 lxix
 how bradamant had loved and loves she says
 continuing to rogero her relation
 to this her worth commends with fitting praise
 tempering in truth and fondness her narration
 and still employs the choicest mode and phrase
 which fits one skilful in negociation
 and on the false alcina brings such hate
 as on things horrible is wont to wait

 lxx
 brings hate on that which he so loved before
 nor let the tale astonish which you hear
 for since his love was forced by magic lore
 the ring the false enchantment served to clear
 this too unmasked the charms alcina wore
 and made all false from head to food appear
 none of her own but borrowed all he sees
 and the once sparkling cup now drugged with lees

 lxxi
 like boy who somewhere his ripe fruit bestows
 and next forgets the place where it is laid
 then after many days conducted goes
 by chance where he the rich deposit made
 and wonders that the hidden treasure shows
 not what it is but rotten and decayed
 and hates and scorns and loathes with altered eyes
 and throws away what he was used to prize

 lxxii
 rogero thus when by melissa's lore
 advised he to behold the fay returned
 and that good ring of sovereign virtue wore
 which on the finger placed all spells o'erturned
 for that fair damsel he had left before
 to his surprise so foul a dame discerned
 that in this ample world examined round
 a hag so old and hideous is not found

 lxxiii
 pale lean and wrinkled was the face and white
 and thinly clothed with hair alcina's head
 her stature reached not to six palms in height
 and every tooth was gone for she had led
 a longer life than ever mortal wight
 than hecuba or she in cuma bred
 but thus by practice to our age unknown
 appeared with youth and beauty not her own

 lxxiv
 by art she gave herself the lovely look
 which had on many like rogero wrought
 but now the ring interpreted the book
 which secrets hid for many ages taught
 no wonder then that he the dame forsook
 and banished from his mind all further thought
 of love for false alcina found in guise
 which no new means of slippery fraud supplies

 lxxv
 but as melissa counselled him he wore
 his wonted semblance for a time till he
 was with his armour many days before
 laid by again accoutred capapee
 and lest alcina should his end explore
 feigned to make proof of his agility
 feigned to make proof if for his arms he were
 too gross long time unwont the mail to bear

 lxxvi
 next balisarda to his flank he tied
 for so rogero's trenchant sword was hight
 and took the wondrous buckler which espied
 not only dazzled the beholder's sight
 but seemed when its silk veil was drawn aside
 as from the body if exhaled the sprite
 in its close cover of red sendal hung
 this at his neck the youthful warrior slung

 lxxvii
 provided thus he to the stables came
 and bade with bridle and with saddle dight
 a horse more black than pitch for so the dame
 counselled welltaught how swift the steed and light
 him rabicano those who know him name
 and he the courser was that with the knight
 who stands beside the sea the breeze's sport
 the whale of yore conducted to that port

 lxxviii
 the hippogryph he might have had at need
 who next below good rabican was tied
 but that the dame had cried to him "take heed
 thou know'st how ill that courser is to ride"
 and said the following day the winged steed
 'twas her intention from that realm to guide
 where he should be instructed at his leisure
 to rein and run him every where at pleasure

 lxxix
 nor if he took him not would he suggest
 suspicion of the intended flight the peer
 this while performed melissa's every hest
 who still invisible was at his ear
 so feigning from the wanton dome possessed
 by that old strumpet rode the cavalier
 and pricking forth drew near unto a gate
 whence the road led to logistilla's state

 lxxx
 assaulting suddenly the guardian crew
 he sword in hand the squadron set upon
 this one he wounded and that other slew
 and point by point made good the drawbridge won
 and ere of his escape alcina knew
 the gentle youth was far away and gone
 my next shall tell his route and how he gained
 at last the realm where logistilla reigned


 canto 8

 argument
 rogero flies astolpho with the rest
 to their true shape melissa does restore
 rinaldo levies knights and squadrons pressed
 in aid of charles assaulted by the moor
 angelica by ruffians found at rest
 is offered to a monster on the shore
 orlando warned in visions of his ill
 departs from paris sore against his will


 i
 how many enchantresses among us oh
 how many enchanters are there though unknown
 who for their love make man or woman glow
 changing them into figures not their own
 nor this by help of spirits from below
 nor observation of the stars is done
 but these on hearts with fraud and falsehood plot
 binding them with indissoluble knot

 ii
 who with angelica's or rather who
 were fortified with reason's ring would see
 each countenance exposed to open view
 unchanged by art or by hypocrisy
 this now seems fair and good whose borrowed hue
 removed would haply foul and evil be
 well was it for rogero that he wore
 the virtuous ring which served the truth to explore

 iii
 rogero still dissembling as i said
 armed to the gate on rabican did ride
 found the guard unprepared not let his blade
 amid that crowd hang idle at his side
 he passed the bridge and broke the palisade
 some slain some maimed then t'wards the forest hied
 but on that road small space had measured yet
 when he a servant of the fairy met

 iv
 he on his fist a ravening falcon bore
 which he made fly for pastime every day
 now on the champaign now upon the shore
 of neighbouring pool which teemed with certain prey
 and rode a hack which simple housings wore
 his faithful dog companion of his way
 he marking well the haste with which he hies
 conjectures truly what rogero flies

 v
 towards him came the knave with semblance haught
 demanding whither in such haste he sped
 to him the good rogero answers naught
 he hence assured more clearly that he fled
 within himself to stop the warrior thought
 and thus with his left arm extended said
 "what if i suddenly thy purpose balk
 and thou find no defence against this hawk"

 vi
 then flies his bird who works so well his wing
 rabican cannot distance him in flight
 the falconer from his back to ground did spring
 and freed him from the bit which held him tight
 who seemed an arrow parted from the string
 and terrible to foe with kick and bite
 while with such haste behind the servant came
 he sped as moved by wind or rather flame

 vii
 nor will the falconer's dog appear more slow
 but hunts rogero's courser as in chace
 of timid hare the pard is wont to go
 not to stand fast the warrior deems disgrace
 and turns towards the swiftlyfooted foe
 whom he sees wield a ridingwand place
 of other arms to make his dog obey
 rogero scorns his faulchion to display

 viii
 the servant made at him and smote him sore
 the dog his left foot worried while untied
 from rein the lightened horse three times and more
 lashed from the croup nor missed his better side
 the hawk oft wheeling with her talons tore
 the stripling and his horse so terrified
 the courser by the whizzing sound dismayed
 little the guiding hand or spur obeyed

 ix
 constrained at length his sword rogero drew
 to clear the rabble who his course delay
 and in the animals' or villain's view
 did now its point and now its edge display
 but with more hinderance and vexatious crew
 swarm here and there and wholly block the way
 and that dishonour will ensue and loss
 rogero sees if him they longer cross

 x
 he knew each little that he longer stayed
 would bring the fay and followers on the trail
 already drums were beat and trumpets brayed
 and larumbells rang loud in every vale
 an act too foul it seemed to use his blade
 on dog and knave unfenced with arms or mail
 a better and shorter way it were
 the buckler old atlantes' work to bare

 xi
 he raised the crimson cloth in which he wore
 the wondrous shield enclosed for many a day
 its beams as proved a thousand times before
 work as they wont when on the sight they play
 senseless the falconer tumbles on the moor
 drop dog and hackney drop the pinions gay
 which poised in air the bird no longer keep
 then glad rogero leaves a prey to sleep

 xii
 in the mean time alcina who had heard
 how he had forced the gate and in the press
 slaughtered a mighty number of her guard
 remained nigh dead o'erwhelmed with her distress
 she tore her vesture and her visage marred
 and cursed her want of wit and wariness
 then made forthwith her meiny sound to arms
 and round herself arrayed her martial swarms

 xiii
 divided next one squadron by the way
 rogero took she sent the bands were two
 she at the port embarked the next array
 and straight to sea dispatched the warlike crew
 with this good squadron went the desperate fay
 and darked by loosened sails the billows grew
 for so desire upon her bosom preyed
 of troops she left her city unpurveyed

 xiv
 without a guard she left her palace there
 which to melissa prompt her time to seize
 to loose her vassals that in misery were
 afforded all convenience and full ease
  to range at leisure through the palace fair
 and so examine all her witcheries
 to raze the seal burn images and loose
 or cancel hagknot rhomb or magic noose

 xv
 thence through the fields fast hurrying from that dome
 the former lovers changed a mighty train
 some into rock or tree to fountain some
 or beast she made assume their shapes again
 and these when they anew are free to roam
 follow rogero's footsteps to the reign
 of logistilla's sage and from that bourn
 to scythia persia greece and ind return

 xvi
 they to their several homes dispatched repair
 bound by a debt which never can be paid
 the english duke above the rest her care
 of these was first in human form arrayed
 for much his kindred and the courteous prayer
 of good rogero with melissa weighed
 beside his prayers the ring rogero gave
 that him she by its aid might better save

 xvii
 thus by rogero's suit the enchantress won
 to his first shape transformed the youthful peer
 but good melissa deemed that nought was done
 save she restored his armour and that spear
 of gold which whensoe'er at tilt he run
 at the first touch unseated cavalier
 once argalia's next astolpho's lance
 and source of mighty fame to both in france

 xviii
 the sage melissa found this spear of gold
 which now alcina's magic palace graced
 and other armour of the warrior bold
 of which he was in that ill dome uncased
 she climbed the courser of the wizard old
 and on the croup at ease astolpho placed
 and thus an hour before rogero came
 repaired to logistilla knight and dame

 xix
 meantime through rugged rocks and shagged with thorn
 rogero wends to seek the sober fay
 from cliff to cliff from path to path forlorn
 a rugged lone inhospitable way
 till he with labour huge oppressed and worn
 issued at noon upon a beach that lay
 'twixt sea and mountain open to the south
 deserted barren bare and parched with drouth

 xx
 the sunbeams on the neighbouring mountain beat
 and glare reflected from the glowing mass
 so fiercely sand and air both boil with heat
 in mode that might have more than melted glass
 the birds are silent in their dim retreat
 nor any note is heard in wood or grass
 save the bough perched cicala's wearying cry
 which deafens hill and dale and sea and sky

 xxi
 the heat and thirst and labour which he bore
 by that drear sandy way beside the sea
 along the unhabited and sunny shore
 were to rogero grievous company
 bur for i may not still pursue this lore
 nor should you busied with one matter be
 rogero i abandon in this heat
 for scotland to pursue rinaldo's beat

 xxii
 by king by daughter and by all degrees
 to sir rinaldo was large welcome paid
 and next the warrior at his better ease
 the occasion of his embassy displayed
 that he from thence and england subsidies
 of men was seeking for his monarch's aid
 in charles's name and added in his care
 the justest reasons to support his prayer

 xxiii
 the king made answer that `without delay
 taxed to the utmost of his powers and might
 his means at charlemagne's disposal lay
 for the honour of the empire and the right
 and that within few days he in array
 such horsemen as he had in arms would dight
 and save that he was now waxed old would lead
 the expedition he was prayed to speed

 xxiv
 `nor like consideration would appear
 worthy to stop him but that he possessed
 a son and for such charge that cavalier
 measured by wit and force was worthiest
 though not within the kingdom was the peer
 it was his hope as he assured his guest
 he would while yet preparing was the band
 return and find it mustered to his hand'

 xxv
 so sent through all his realm with expedition
 his treasures to levy men and steeds
 and ships prepared and warlike ammunition
 and money stores and victual for their needs
 meantime the good rinaldo on his mission
 leaving the courteous king to england speeds
 he brought him on his way to berwick's town
 and was observed to weep when he was gone

 xxvi
 the wind sat in the poop rinaldo good
 embarked and bade farewell to all the sheet
 still loosening to the breeze the skipper stood
 till where thames' waters waxing bitter meet
 salt ocean wafted thence by tide of flood
 through a sure channel to fair london's seat
 safely the mariners their course explore
 making their way with aid of sail and oar

 xxvii
 the emperor charles and he king otho grave
 who was with charles by siege in paris pressed
 a broad commission to rinaldo brave
 with letters to the prince of wales addressed
 and countersigns had given dispatched to crave
 what foot and horse were by the land possessed
 the whole to be to calais' port conveyed
 that it to france and charles might furnish aid

 xxviii
 the prince i speak of who on otho's throne
 sate in his stead the vacant helm to guide
 such honor did to aymon's valiant son
 he not with such his king had gratified
 next all to good rinaldo's wish was done
 since for his martial bands on every side
 in britain or the isles which round her lay
 to assemble near the sea he fixed a day

 xxix
 but here sir it behoves me shift my ground
 like him that makes the sprightly viol ring
 who often changes chord and varies sound
 and now a graver strikes now sharper string
 thus i  who did to good rinaldo bound
 my tale angelica remembering
 late left where saved from him by hasty flight
 she had encountered with an anchorite

 xxx
 awhile i will pursue her story i
 told how the maid of him with earnest care
 enquired how she towards the shore might fly
 who of the loathed rinaldo has such fear
 she dreads unless she pass the sea to die
 as insecure in europe far or near
 but she was by the hermit kept in play
 because he pleasure took with her to stay

 xxxi
 his heart with love of that rare beauty glowed
 and to his frozen marrow pierced the heat
 who after when he saw that she bestowed
 small care on him and thought but of retreat
 his sluggish courser stung with many a goad
 but with no better speed he plied his feet
 ill was his walk and worse his trot nor spur
 could that dull beast to quicker motion stir

 xxxii
 and for the flying maid was far before
 and he would soon have ceased to track her steed
 to the dark cave recurred the hermit hoar
 and conjured up of fiends a grisly breed
 one he selected out of many more
 and first informed the demon of his need
 then in the palfrey bade him play his part
 who with the lady bore away his heart

 xxxiii
 and as sagacious dog on mountain tried
 before accustomed fox and hare to chase
 if he behold the quarry choose one side
 the other takes and seems to slight the trace
 but at the turn arriving is espied
 already tearing what he crossed to face
 so her the hermit by a different road
 will meet wherever she her palfrey goad

 xxxiv
 what was the friar's design i well surmise
 and you shall know but in another page
 angelica now slow now faster flies
 nought fearing this while conjured by the sage
 the demon covered in the courser lies
 as fire sometimes will hide its smothered rage
 then blazes with devouring flame and heat
 unquenchable and scarce allows retreat

 xxxv
 after the flying maid had shaped her course
 by the great sea which laves the gascon shore
 still keeping to the rippling waves her horse
 where best the moistened sand the palfrey bore
 him plunged into the brine the fiend perforce
 dragged till he swam amid the watery roar
 nor what to do the timid damsel knew
 save that she closer to her saddle grew

 xxxvi
 she cannot howsoe'er the rein she ply
 govern the horse who swims the surge to meet
 her raiment she collects and holds it high
 and not to wet them gathers up her feet
 her tresses which the breeze still wantonly
 assaults dishevelled on her shoulders beat
 the louder winds are hushed perchance in duty
 intent like ocean on such sovereign beauty

 xxxvii
 landward in vain her eyes the damsel bright
 directs which water face and breast with tears
 and ever sees decreasing to her sight
 the beach she left which less and less appears
 the courser who was swimming to the right
 after a mighty sweep the lady bears
 to shore where rock and cavern shag the brink
 as night upon the land begins to sink

 xxxviii
 when in that desert which but to descry
 bred fear in the beholder stood the maid
 alone as phoebus plunged in ocean sky
 and nether earth had left obscured in shade
 she paused in guise which in uncertainty
 might leave whoever had the form surveyed
 if she were real woman or some mock
 resemblance coloured in the living rock

 xxxix
 she fixed and stupid in her wretchedness
 stood on the shifting sand with ruffled hair
 her hands were joined her lips were motionless
 her languid eyes upturned as in despair
 accusing him on high that to distress
 and whelm her all the fates united were
 astound she stood awhile when grief found vent
 through eyes and tongue in tears and in lament

 xl
 "fortune what more remains that thou on me
 shouldst not now satiate thy revengeful thirst
 what more she said can i bestow on thee
 than what thou seekest not this life accurst
 thou wast in haste to snatch me from the sea
 where i had ended its sad days immersed
 because to torture me with further ill
 before i die is yet thy cruel will

 xli
 "but what worse torment yet remains in store
 beyond i am unable to descry
 by thee from my fair throne which nevermore
 i hope to repossess compelled to fly
 i what is worse my honour lost deplore
 for if i sinned not in effect yet i
 give matter by my wanderings to be stung
 for wantonness of every carping tongue

 xlii
 "what other good is left to woman who
 has lost her honour in this earthly ball
 what profits it that whether false or true
 i am deemed beauteous and am young withal
 no thanks to heaven for such a gift are due
 whence on my head does every mischief fall
 for this my brother argalia died
 to whom small help enchanted arms supplied

 xliii
 "for this the tartar king sir agrican
 subdued my sire who galaphron was hight
 and of catay in india was great khan
 'tis hence i am reduced to such a plight
 that wandering evermore i cannot scan
 at morn where i shall lay my head at night
 if thou hast ravished what thou couldst wealth friends
 and honour say what more thy wrath intends

 xliv
 "if death by drowning in the foaming sea
 was not enough thy wrath to satiate
 send if thou wilt some beast to swallow me
 so that he keep me not in pain thy hate
 cannot devise a torment so it be
 my death but i shall thank thee for my fate"
 thus with loud sobs the weeping lady cried
 when she beheld the hermit at her side

 xlv
 from the extremest height the hermit hoar
 of that high rock above her had surveyed
 angelica arrived upon the shore
 beneath the cliff afflicted and dismayed
 he to that place had come six days before
 for him by path untrod had fiend conveyed
 and he approached her feigning such a call
 as e'er hilarion might have had or paul

 xlvi
 when him yet unagnized she saw appear
 the lady took some comfort and laid by
 emboldened by degrees her former fear
 though still her visage was of deathlike dye
 "misericord father" when the friar was near
 she said "for brought to evil pass am i"
 and told still broke by sobs in doleful tone
 the story to her hearer not unknown

 xlvii
 to comfort her some reasons full of grace
 sage and devout the approaching hermit cites
 and now his hand upon her moistened face
 in speaking now upon her bosom lights
 as her securer next he would embrace
 him kindling into pretty scorn she smites
 with one hand on his breast and backward throws
 then flushed with honest red all over glows

 xlviii
 a pocket at the ancient's side was dight
 where he a cruise of virtuous liquor wore
 and at those puissant eyes whence flashed the light
 of the most radiant torch love ever bore
 threw from the flask a little drop of might
 to make her sleep upon the sandy shore
 already the recumbent damsel lay
 the greedy elder's unresisting prey

 xlix
 stanza xlix untranslated by rose

 l
 lines 12 untranslated by rose
 hopeless at length upon the beach he lies
 and by the maid exhausted falls asleep
 when to torment him new misfortunes rise
 fortune does seldom any measure keep
 unused to cut her cruel pastime short
 if she with mortal man is pleased to sport

 li
 it here behoves me from the path i pressed
 to turn awhile ere i this case relate
 in the great northern sea towards the west
 green ireland past an isle is situate
 ebuda is its name whose shores infest
 its people wasted through the godhead's hate
 the hideous orc and proteus' other herd
 by him against that race in vengeance stirred

 lii
 old stories speak they falsely or aright
 tell how a puissant king this country swayed
 who had a daughter fair so passing bright
 and lovely 'twas no wonder if the maid
 when on the beach she stood in proteus' sight
 left him to burn amid the waves surveyed
 one day alone upon that shore inisled
 her he compressed and quitted great with child

 liii
 this was sore torment to the sire severe
 and impious more than all mankind nor he
 such is the force of wrath was moved to spare
 the maid for reason or for piety
 nor though he saw her pregnant would forbear
 to execute his sentence suddenly
 but bade together with the mother kill
 ere born his grandchild who had done no ill

 liv
 seaproteus to his flocks' wide charge preferred
 by neptune of all ocean's rule possessed
 inflamed with ire his lady's torment heard
 and against law and usage to molest
 the land no sluggard in his anger stirred
 his monsters orc and seacalf with the rest
 who waste not only herds but human haunts
 farmhouse and town with their inhabitants

 lv
 and girding them on every side the rout
 will often siege to walled cities lay
 where in long weariness and fearful doubt
 the townsmen keep their watch by night and day
 the fields they have abandoned all about
 and for a remedy their last assay
 to the oracle demanding counsel fly
 which to the suppliant's prayer made this reply

 lvi
 `that it behoved them find a damsel who
 a form as beauteous as that other wore
 to be to proteus offered up in lieu
 of the fair lady slain upon the shore
 he if he deems her an atonement due
 will keep the damsel not disturb them more
 if not another they must still present
 and so till they the deity content'

 lvii
 and this it was the cruel usage bred
 that of the damsels held most fair of face
 to proteus every day should one be led
 till one should in the godhead's sight find grace
 the first and all those others slain who fed
 all a devouring orc that kept his place
 beside the port what time into the main
 the remnant of the herd retired again

 lviii
 were the old tale of proteus' false or true
 for this in sooth i know not who can read
 with such a clause was kept by that foul crew
 the savage ancient statute which decreed
 that woman's flesh the ravening monster who
 for this came every day to land should feed
 though to be woman is a crying ill
 in every place 'tis here a greater still

 lix
 o wretched maids whom 'mid that barbarous rout
 illfortune on that wretched shore has tost
 who for the stranger damsel prowl about
 of her to make an impious holocaust
 in that the more they slaughter from without
 they less the number of their own exhaust
 but since not always wind and waves convey
 like plunder upon every strand they prey

 lx
 with frigate and with galley wont to roam
 and other sort of barks they range the sea
 and as a solace to their martyrdom
 from far or from their isle's vicinity
 bear women off with open rapine some
 these bought by gold and those by flattery
 and plundered from the different lands they scower
 crowd with their captives dungeoncell and tower

 lxi
 keeping that region close aboard to explore
 the island's lonely bank a gallery creeps
 where amid stubs upon the grassy shore
 angelica unhappy damsel sleeps
 to wood and water there the sailor's moor
 and from the bark for this a party leaps
 and there that matchless flower of earthly charms
 discovers in the holy father's arms

 lxii
 oh prize too dear oh too illustrious prey
 to glut so barbarous and so base a foe
 oh cruel fortune who believed thy sway
 was of such passing power in things below
 that thou shouldst make a hideous monster's prey
 the beauty for which agrican did glow
 brought with half scythia's people from the gates
 of caucasus in ind to find their fates

 lxiii
 the beauty by circassian sacripant
 preferred before his honour and his crown
 the beauty which made roland brava's vaunt
 sully his wholesome judgment and renown
 the beauty which had moved the wide levant
 and awed and turned its kingdom upside down
 now has not thus deserted and unheard
 one to assist it even with a word

 lxiv
 oppressed with heavy sleep upon the shore
 the lovely virgin ere awake they chain
 with her the enchanter friar the pirates bore
 on board their ship a sad afflicted train
 this done they hoisted up their sail once more
 and the bark made the fatal isle again
 where till the lot shall of their prey dispose
 her prisoned in a castle they enclose

 lxv
 but such her matchless beauty's power the maid
 was able that fierce crew to mollify
 who many days her cruel death delayed
 preserved until their last necessity
 and while they damsels from without purveyed
 spared such angelic beauty finally
 the damsel to the monstrous orc they bring
 the people all behind her sorrowing

 lxvi
 who shall relate the anguish the lament
 and outcry which against the welkin knock
 i marvel that the seashore was not rent
 when she was placed upon the rugged block
 where chained and void of help the punishment
 of loathsome death awaits her on the rock
 this will not i so sorrow moves me say
 which makes me turn my rhymes another way

 lxvii
 to find a verse of less lugubrious strain
 till i my wearied spirit shall restore
 for not the squalid snake of mottled stain
 nor wild and whelpless tiger angered more
 nor what of venomous on burning plain
 creeps 'twixt the red and the atlantic shore
 could see the grisly sight and choose but moan
 the damsel bound upon the naked stone

 lxviii
 oh if this chance to her orlando who
 was gone to paristown to seek the maid
 had been reported or those other two
 duped by a post dispatched from stygian shade
 they would have tracked her heavenly footsteps through
 a thousand deaths to bear the damsel aid
 but had the warriors of her peril known
 so far removed for what would that have done

 lxix
 this while round pariswalls the leaguer lay
 of famed troyano's son's besieging band
 reduced to such extremity one day
 that it nigh fell into the foeman's hand
 and but that vows had virtue to allay
 the wrath of heaven whose waters drenched the land
 that day had perished by the moorish lance
 the holy empire and great name of france

 lxx
 to the just plaint of aged charlemagne
 the great creator turned his eyes and stayed
 the conflagration with a sudden rain
 which haply human art had not allayed
 wise whosoever seeketh not in vain
 his help than whose there is no better aid
 well the religious king to whom 'twas given
 knew that the saving succour was from heaven

 lxxi
 all night long counsel of his weary bed
 vexed with a ceaseless care orlando sought
 now here now there the restless fancy sped
 now turned now seized but never held the thought
 as when from sun or nightly planet shed
 clear water has the quivering radiance caught
 the flashes through the spacious mansion fly
 with reaching leap right left and low and high

 lxxii
 to memory now returned his lady gay
 she rather ne'er was banished from his breast
 and fanned the secret fire which through the day
 now kindled into flame had seemed at rest
 that in his escort even from catay
 or farthest ind had journeyed to the west
 there lost of whom he had discerned no token
 since charles's power near bordeauxtown was broken

 lxxiii
 this in orlando moved great grief and he
 lay thinking on his folly past in vain
 "my heart" he said "oh how unworthily
 i bore myself and out alas what pain
 when night and day i might have dwelt with thee
 since this thou didst not in thy grace disdain
 to have let them place thee in old namus' hand
 witless a wrong so crying to withstand

 lxxiv
 "might i not have excused myself  the king
 had not perchance gainsaid my better right 
 of if he had gainsaid my reasoning
 who would have taken thee in my despite
 why not have armed and rather let them wring
 my heart out of my breast but not the might
 of charles or all his host had they been tried
 could have availed to tear thee from my side

 lxxv
 "oh had he placed her but in strong repair
 guarded in some good fort or paristown
  since he would trust her to duke namus' care
 that he should lose her in this way alone
 sorts with my wish  who would have kept the fair
 like me that would for her to death have gone
 have kept her better than my heart or sight
 who should and could yet did not what i might

 lxxvi
 "without me my sweet life beshrew me where
 art thou bestowed so beautiful and young
 as some lost lamb what time the daylight fair
 shuts in remains the wildering woods among
 and goes about lamenting here and there
 hoping to warn the shepherd with her tongue
 till the wolf hear from far the mournful strain
 and the sad shepherd weep for her in vain

 lxxvii
 "my hope where are thou where in doleful wise
 dost thou perchance yet rove thy lonely round
 art thou indeed to ravening wolf a prize
 without thy faithful roland's succour found
 and is the flower which with the deities
 me in mid heaven had placed which not to wound
 so reverent was my love thy feelings chaste
 i kept untouched alas now plucked and waste

 lxxviii
 "if this fair flower be plucked oh misery oh
 despair what more is left me but to die
 almighty god with every other woe
 rather than this thy wretched suppliant try
 if this be true these hands the fatal blow
 shall deal and doom me to eternity"
 mixing his plaint with bitter tears and sighs
 so to himself the grieved orlando cries

 lxxix
 already every where with due repose
 creatures restored their weary spirits laid
 these upon stones and upon feathers those
 or greensward in the beech or myrtle's shade
 but scarcely did thine eyes orlando close
 so on thy mind tormenting fancies preyed
 nor would the vexing thoughts which bred annoy
 let thee in peace that fleeting sleep enjoy

 lxxx
 to good orlando it appeared as he
 mid odorous flowers upon a grassy bed
 were gazing on that beauteous ivory
 which love's own hand had tinged with native red
 and those two stars of pure transparency
 with which he in love's toils his fancy fed
 of those bright eyes and that bright face i say
 which from his breast had torn his heart away

 lxxxi
 he with the fullest pleasure overflows
 that ever happy lover did content
 but lo this time a mighty tempest rose
 and wasted flowers and trees uptore and rent
 not with the rage with which this whirlwind blows
 joust warring winds north south and east unpent
 it seemed as if in search of covering shade
 he vainly wandering through a desert strayed

 lxxxii
 meanwhile the unhappy lover lost the dame
 in that dim air nor how he lost her weets
 and roving far and near her beauteous name
 through every sounding wood and plain repeats
 and while "oh wretched me" is his exclaim
 "who has to poison changed my promised sweets"
 he of his sovereign lady who with tears
 demands his aid the lamentation hears

 lxxxiii
 thither whence comes the sound he swiftly hies
 and toils now here now there with labour sore
 oh what tormenting grief to think his eyes
 cannot again the lovely rays explore
  lo other voice from other quarter cries 
 "hope not on earth to enjoy the blessing more"
 at that alarming cry he woke and found
 himself in tears of bitter sorrow drowned

 lxxxiv
 not thinking that like images are vain
 when fear or when desire disturbs our rest
 the thought of her exposed to shame and pain
 in such a mode upon his fancy pressed
 he thundering leaped from bed and with what chain
 and plate behoved his limbs all over dressed
 took brigliadoro from the stall he filled
 nor any squire attendant's service willed

 lxxxv
 and to pass every where yet not expose
 by this his dignity to stain or slight
 the old and honoured ensign he foregoes
 his ancient bearing quartered red and white
 and in its place a sable ensign shows
 perhaps as suited to his mournful plight
 that erst he from an amostantes bore
 whom he had slain in fight some time before

 lxxxvi
 at midnight he departed silently
 not to his uncle spake not to his true
 and faithful comrade brandimart whom he
 so dearly cherished even bade adieu
 but when with golden tresses streamingfree
 the sun from rich tithonus' inn withdrew
 and chased the shades and cleared the humid air
 the king perceived orlando was not there

 lxxxvii
 to charles to his displeasure were conveyed
 news that his nephew had withdrawn at night
 when most he lacked his presence and his aid
 nor could he curb his choler at the flight
 but that with foul reproach he overlaid
 and sorely threatened the departed knight
 by him so foul a fault should be repented
 save he returning home his wrath prevented

 lxxxviii
 nor would orlando's faithful brandimart
 who loved him as himself behind him stay
 whether to bring him back he in his heart
 hoped or of him ill brooked injurious say
 and scarce in his impatience to depart
 till fall of eve his sally would delay
 lest she should hinder his design of this
 he nought imparted to his flordelis

 lxxxix
 to him this was a lady passing dear
 and from whose side he unwont to stray
 endowed with manners grace and beauteous cheer
 wisdom and wit if now he went away
 and took no leave it was because the peer
 hoped to revisit her that very day
 but that befel him after as he strayed
 which him beyond his own intent delayed

 xc
 she when she has expected him in vain
 well nigh a month and nought of him discerns
 sallies without a guide or faithful train
 so with desire of him her bosom yearns
 and many a country seeks for him in vain
 to whom the story in due place returns
 no more i now shall tell you of these two
 more bent anglantes' champion to pursue

 xci
 who having old almontes' blazonry
 so changed drew nigh the gate and there the peer
 approached a captain of the guard when he
 "i am the county" whispered in his ear
 and the bridge quickly lowered and passage free
 at his commandment by the way most near
 went straight towards the foe but what befell
 him next the canto which ensues shall tell


 canto 9

 argument
 so far orlando wends he comes to where
 he of old proteus' hears the cruel use
 but feels such pity for olympia fair
 wronged by cymosco who in prison mews
 her plighted spouse that ere he makes repair
 further he gives her hope to venge the abuse
 he does so and departs and with his spouse
 departs bireno to repeat his vows


 i
 what cannot when he has a heart possess'd
 this false and cruel traitor love since he
 can banish from orlando's faithful breast
 such tried allegiance and due loyalty
 wise full of all regards and of the blest
 and glorious church the champion wont to be
 now little for himself or uncle driven
 by a vain love he cares and less for heaven

 ii
 but i excuse him well rejoiced to know
 i have like partner in my vice for still
 to seek my good i too am faint and slow
 but sound and nimble in pursuit of ill
 the count departs disguised in sable show
 nor for so many friends with froward will
 deserted cares and comes where on the plain
 are camped the hosts of afric and of spain

 iii
 rather uncamped for in less troops or more
 rains under shed and tree had driven the band
 here ten there twenty seven or eight or four
 near or further off orlando scanned
 each sleeps oppressed with toil and wearied sore
 this stretched on earth that propped upon his hand
 they sleep and many might the count have slain
 yet never bared his puissant durindane

 iv
 so generous is orlando's heart he base
 esteems it were to smite a sleeping foe
 now this he seeks and now that other place
 yet cannot track his lady high or low
 if he finds any one in waking case
 sighing to him he paints her form and show
 then prays him that for courtesy he where
 the damsel is will reach him to repair

 v
 and when the day its shining light displayed
 he wholly searched the moorish army through
 in that the gentle warrior was arrayed
 in arab weeds he this might safely do
 and of his purpose came alike in aid
 that other tongues beside the french he knew
 and in the african so well was read
 he seemed in tripoly one born and bred

 vi
 he sojourns there three days the camp to see
 still seeking nought beside next up and down
 within without both burgh and city he
 spies nor surveys the realm of france alone
 but fair auvergne and even gascony
 revisits to its farthest little town
 roves from provence to brittany's domain
 and from the picards to the bounds of spain

 vii
 between october and november's moon
 in that dull season when the leafy vest
 is stript from trembling plant whose limbs are shown
 of all their mantling foliage dispossess'd
 and in close flights the swarming birds are flown
 orlando enters on his amorous quest
 this he pursues the livelong winter through
 nor quits when gladsome spring returns anew

 viii
 as such his wont from land to land he goes
 a river's side he reaches on a day
 which to the neighbouring sea in quiet flows
 bretons and normans parting on its way
 but swoln with mountain rain and melted snows
 then thundered white with foam and flashingspray
 and with impetuous stream had overtopt
 its brim and burst the bridge and passage stopt

 ix
 the paladin this bank and the other eyed
 along the river's channel to explore
 since neither fish nor fowl if from his side
 he could gain footing on the adverse shore
 when with a damsel in the poop he spied
 a ready pinnace that towards him bore
 she steered as if she would approach the strand
 but would not let her shallop make the land

 x
 steered not to land as haply with suspicion
 to take a lading in her own despite
 to her the good orlando made petition
 to put him o'er the stream and she "no knight
 passes this ferry but upon condition
 he shall his faith and promise duly plight
 that he will do a battle at my prayer
 upon the justest quarrel and most fair

 xi
 "so that if thou on that other shore to land
 dost by my aid sir cavalier desire
 promise me ere the month which is at hand"
 the damsel so pursued her speech "expire
 that thou wilt join the hibernian monarch's hand
 who forms a fair armada in his ire
 to sack ebuda's isle of all compress'd
 by ocean's circling waves the cruellest

 xii
 "know beyond ireland in the briny flood
 an island amid many others lies
 ebuda is its name whose people rude
 such is their law in search of plunder hies
 and all the women that it takes for food
 to a voracious animal supplies
 which every day to shore for this does speed
 and finds new wife or maid whereon to feed

 xiii
 "for of these merchant still and corsair sell
 a large supply and most of those most fair
 reckoning one slain aday you thus may well
 compute what wives and maids have perished there
 but if compassion in your bosom dwell
 nor you to love an utter rebel are
 be you contented with this band to wend
 united for such profitable end"

 xiv
 to hear the whole orlando scarce could bear
 ere to be first in that emprize he swore
 as one who evil deed misliked to hear
 and with impatience like relation bore
 hence first induced to think and next to fear
 angelica is captive on that shore
 since he so long the missing maid pursues
 nor of the damsel yet can gather news

 xv
 breaking his every scheme this phantasy
 the troubled cavalier did so confound
 that will all speed to that fell island he
 resolved to navigate nor yet the round
 of a new sun was buried in the sea
 ere he a vessel at st malo's found
 in which embarking on his quest the count
 put forth and cleared that night st michael's mount

 xvi
 breac and landriglier past on the left hand
 orlando's vessel skims the breton shore
 then shapes her course towards the chalky strand
 whence england's isle the name of albion bore
 but the south wind which had her canvas fanned
 shifts to northwest and freshening blows so sore
 the mariners are fain to strike all sail
 and wear and scud before the boisterous gale

 xvii
 a distance traversed in four days in one
 backwards the ceaseless wind the frigate bore
 the helmsman kept the sea lest she should run
 aground and break like glass upon the shore
 the wind upon the fifth day changed its tune
 so loud and furious through the other four
 and let without more strife the vessel gain
 a port where antwerp's river met the main

 xviii
 as soon as harboured there in shattered plight
 the weary mariners their frigate moor
 out of a city seated on the right
 of that fair stream descends upon the shore
 as his gray hairs may warrant him a wight
 stricken in years who full of courteous lore
 turns to the county after greetings due
 reputing him the leader of that crew

 xix
 and prays him on a damsel's part `that he
 to her would think not irksome to repair
 whom of unequalled affability
 and sweetness he would find as well as fair
 or otherwise would be content that she
 should to his bark resort to seek him there
 nor prove less pliant than had been before
 all the knights errant who had sought that shore

 xx
 for hitherto by land or sea conveyed
 no cavalier had journeyed to that place
 that had refused to parlay with the maid
 and give her counsel in a cruel case'
 orlando hearing this no more delayed
 but issued from the bark with hurried pace
 and in all kind and courteous usage bred
 his way directed where the ancient led

 xxi
 with him did roland to the city go
 and at the bottom of a palacestair
 conducted by that elder full of woe
 a lady found if face may grief declare
 and sable cloth with which a mournful show
 chamber and hall and gallery furnished were
 who after honourable welcome paid
 seated the paladin and sadly said

 xxii
 "the daughter of the count of holland" cried
 the lady "know in me sir cavalier
 though not his only offspring for beside
 myself two brothers were to him so dear
 that for whatever favour i applied
 i never met refusal from the peer
 i living glady in this happy sort
 a duke by chance was guested at our court

 xxiii
 "the duke of zealand meaning for biscay
 with purpose there to war upon the moor
 his youth and beauty then in manhood's may
 and force of love unfelt by me before
 made me with little strife his easy prey
 persuaded by his outward cheer yet more
 i thought and think and still shall think the peer
 loved me and loves me yet with heart sincere

 xxiv
 "those days whenas the wind was contrary
 which fair for me if foul for others blew
 to others forty seemed an hour to me
 so upon speedy wings the moments flew
 this while we oftentimes held colloquy
 when to be given with solemn right and due
 i promised him and he to me his hand
 on his return in wedlock's holy band

 xxv
 "bireno hardly from our court was gone
 for such the name my faithful lover bore
 when friesland's king whose realm is from our own
 no further than this stream from ocean's shore
 designing to bestow me on his son
 arbantes hight the monarch had no more
 to holland sent the worthiest of his land
 me of the count my father to demand

 xxvi
 "i without power to falsify that vow
 which to my gentle lover i had plight
 nor though i had the power would love allow
 me so to play the ingrate if i might
 the treaty well on foot to overthrow
 and nigh concluded with afflicted sprite
 cried to my father i would rather shed
 my very lifeblood than in friesland wed

 xxvii
 "my gracious father he who took but pleasure
 in what pleased me nor would my will constrain
 marking my grief broke off the intended measure
 to give me comfort and relieve my pain
 at this proud friesland's sovereign such displeasure
 conceived and entertained such high disdain
 he entered holland and the war began
 in which my kin were slaughtered to a man

 xxviii
 "besides that both his puissance and his might
 are such as in our age are matched of few
 such is in evil deeds his cunning sleight
 he laughs to scorn what wit and force can do
 strange arms he bears unknown to any wight
 save him of the ancient nations or the new
 a hollow iron two yards long whose small
 channel he loads with powder and a ball

 xxix
 "he where 'tis closed behind in the iron round
 touches with fire a vent discerned with pain
 in guise that skilful surgeon tries his ground
 where need requires that he should breathe a vein
 whence flies the bullet with such deafening sound
 that bolt and lightening from the hollow cane
 appear to dart and like the passing thunder
 burn what they smite beatdown or rend asunder

 xxx
 "twice broken he our armies overthrew
 with this device my gentle brethren slain
 the first the shot in our first battle slew
 reaching his heart through broken plate and chain
 the other in the other onset who
 was flying from the fatal field in vain
 the ball his shoulder from a distance tore
 behind and issued from his breast before

 xxxi
 "my father next defending on a day
 the only fortress which he still possessed
 the others taken which about it lay
 was sent alike to his eternal rest
 who going and returning to purvey
 what lacked as this or that occasion pressed
 was aimed at from afar in privy wise
 and by the traytour struck between the eyes

 xxxii
 "and i remaining sire and brethren dead
 the isle of holland's only heir the king
 of friesland who by the desire was led
 of better there his power establishing
 to me and also to my people said
 i peace and quiet to my state might bring
 would i when i before would not accord
 now take his son arbantes for my lord

 xxxiii
 "i not so much for deadly hate i bear
 to him and all his kindred by whose spite
 my sire and both my brothers slaughtered were
 my country sacked and waste as that the knight
 i would not wrong to whom i fealty sware
 and had my solemn word already plight
 that me to wedlock man should woo in vain
 till he to holland should return from spain

 xxxiv
 "for one illborn a hundred yet behind
 will bear replied to hazard all content
  slain burnt alive to let them to the wind
 scatter my ashes rather than consent 
 my people seek to move my stedfast mind
 by prayer and by protest from this intent
 and threat to yield my city up and me
 lest all be lost through my obduracy

 xxxv
 "when in my fixt and firm resolve they read
 that prayer and protest are alike in vain
 my town and me with friesland's king agreed
 surrendered as they vowed my vassal train
 not doing by me any shameful deed
 me he assured of life and of domain
 so i would soften my obdurate mood
 and be to wed with his arbantes wooed

 xxxvi
 "i who would have consented to forego
 my life to scape from him reflection made
 that save i first avenged myself all woe
 endured would be by this regret outweighed
  long time i muse and to my misery know
 'tis only simulation which can aid
 not simple willingness i feign desire
 to win his grace and have him for my sire

 xxxvii
 " mid many in my father's service i
 select two brothers fitted for my view
 of valiant heart and great ability
 but more approved for truth as followers who
 bred in my father's court from infancy
 had with myself grown up the brothers two
 so wholly bound to me they would have thought
 my safety with their lives was cheaply bought

 xxxviii
 "to them i tell my project and the pair
 of brethren promise me their faithful aid
 to flanders this a pinnace to prepare
 i sent and that with me in holland stayed
 now while both foreigners and natives were
 of friesland's kingdom to our nuptials prayed
 bireno in biscay the tidings went
 for holland had equipt an armament

 xxxix
 "since on the issue of the earliest fray
 when in the rout one hapless brother fell
 i had dispatched a courier to biscay
 who the sad news should to bireno tell
 while he toils sore his squadron to array
 proud friesland's arms our wretched remnant quell
 bireno who knew nought of this had weighed
 and with his barks put forth to bring us aid

 xl
 "these tidings told to friesland's monarch he
 confiding to his son the wedding's care
 to meet bireno's squadron puts to sea
 and so chance willed burns sinks or routs them there
 leading him off into captivity 
 but none to us as yet the tidings bear
 this while i to the amorous youth am wed
 who when the sun sought his would seek my bed

 xli
 "behind the curtains i had hid the tried
 and faithful follower of whom i said
 who moved not till the bridegroom he descried
 yet waited not till he in bed was laid
 but raised a hatchet and so well applied
 behind the stripling's head the ponderous blade
 of speech and life it reft him i who note
 the deed leap lightly up and cut his throat

 xlii
 "as falls the bullock upon shamblesill
 thus fell the illstarred stripling in despite
 of king cymosco worst among the ill
 so was the impious king of friesland hight
 who did my brothers and my father kill
 and in my state to found a better right
 in wedlock wished to join me with his son
 haply to slay me when his end was won

 xliii
 "ere new disturbance interrupt the deed
 taking what costliest was and lightest weighed
 me my companion by a chord with speed
 drops from a window where with boat purveyed
 in flanders as related for my need
 his brother watchful of our motions stayed
 we dip the oar we loose the sail and driven
 by both escape as was the will of heaven

 xliv
 "the daring feat achieved i cannot say
 if friesland's king more sorrowed for his son
 or raged at me he there arrived the day
 ensuing where the dreadful deed was done
 proud he returned both he and his array
 of the duke taken and the victory won
 and thought to feast and nuptials he was bound
 but in his home all grief and darkness found

 xlv
 "his pity for his son the hate he fed
 towards me torment the father day and night
 but as lamenting will not raise the dead
 and vengeance is a vent for smothered spite
 that portion of his thoughts which should have led
 the king to ease by sighs his troubled sprite
 now willingly takes counsel with his hate
 to seize me and his vengeance satiate

 xlvi
 "all known or said to by my friends or who
 were friends of those that chosen from my train
 had aided me the deadly deed to do
 their goods and chattels burnt were doomed or slain
 and he had killed bireno since he knew
 no other trouble could inflict such pain
 but that he saving him in malice thought
 he had a net wherewith i might be caught

 xlvii
 "yet him a cruel proposition made
 granting a year his purpose to complete
 condemned to privy death till then delayed
 save in that time through force or through deceit
 he by his friends' and kindred's utmost aid
 doing or plotting me from my retreat
 conveyed into his prisons so that he
 can only saved by my destruction be

 xlviii
 "what for his safety could be done behold
 short of my own destruction had been tried
 six towns i had in flanders these i sold
 and great or small the produce set aside
 a part of it to wily persons told
 that it to tempt his guards might be applied
 the rest of it dispensed to move and arm
 germans or english to the miscreant's harm

 xlix
 "my agents whether they their trust betrayed
 or that they could in truth perform no more
 me with vain words instead of help have paid
 and scorn me having drained my scanty store
 and now the term is nigh expired when aid
 whether of open force or treasured ore
 no longer will arrive in time to save
 my cherished spouse from torture and the grave

 l
 "through him from me was my dominion rent
 through him my father and my brethren slain
 through him the little treasure left me spent
 what served alone existence to sustain
 to rescue him in cruel durance pent
 nor other means to succour him remain
 save i to liberate him from prison go
 and yield myself to such a cruel foe

 li
 "if nothing more be left me then to try
 nor other way for his escape appear
 than his with this my wretched life to buy
 this life i gladly will lay down one fear
 alone molests me and it is that i
 can never my conditions make so clear
 as to assure me that with new deceit
 me when his prey the tyrant will not cheat

 lii
 "i fear when i shall be in captive plight
 and he has put all tortures upon me
 he may not loose bireno and the knight
 have not to thank me for his liberty
 like perjured king and full of foul despite
 who with my murder will not satiate be
 but by bireno neither less nor more
 will do than he had done by me before

 liii
 "the occasion now that i confer with you
 and tell my case to all who seek the land
 both lords and knights is with the single view
 that taking counsel of so large a band
 some one may indicate assurance due
 that when before the cruel king i stand
 no longer he bireno shall detain
 nor after i am killed the duke be slain

 liv
 "warrior to went with me i in my need
 when i shall be to friesland given have prayed
 but so he promise that the exchange agreed
 shall be between us in such manner made
 that from his bonds bireno shall be freed
 when i am to the monarch's hands conveyed
 thus i when i am slain shall die content
 who to my spouse shall life by death have lent

 lv
 "not to this day have chanced upon a wight
 who on his faith will give me warranty
 that if the king refuse to loose the knight
 when i am offered from captivity
 he will not suffer that in my despite
 so feared those weapons i shall taken be
 so feared those weapons upon every hand
 which howsoever thick no plates withstand

 lvi
 "now if as strong herculean port and bold
 appear to vouch such worth to you belong
 and you believe to give me or withhold
 is in your power should he intend me wrong
 be with me when committed to his hold
 since i shall fear not in your convoy strong
 when you are with me that my lord though i
 be after slain shall by his order die"

 lvii
 here her discourse wherewith were interposed
 loud sobs the lady ceased and silent stood
 orlando when her lips the damsel closed
 whose ready will ne'er halts in doing good
 briefly to her replies as indisposed
 to idle speeches of his natural mood
 but plights his solemn word that better aid
 she should from him receive than that she prayed

 lviii
 'tis not his scheme to place her in the hand
 of her foul foe to have bireno freed
 he will save both the lovers if his brand
 and wonted valour fail him not at need
 embarked that very day they put from land
 with a clear sky and prosperous wind to speed
 the county hastes in his impatient heat
 eager to reach that isle the monster's seat

 lix
 through the still deeps on this or the other side
 the skipper veered his canvas to the wind
 this isle and that of zealand they descried
 one seen before and one shut in behind
 the third day from the harboured vessel's side
 in holland roland disembarks not joined
 by the complaining dame whom to descend
 he will not till she hear that tyrant's end

 lx
 armed at all points the county passed ashore
 borne on a horse 'twixt brown and black the breed
 of denmark but in flanders nurtured more
 esteemed for weight and puissance than for speed
 for when the paladin embarked before
 in brittany he left the gallant steed
 his brigliador so nimble and so fair
 that but bayardo could with him compare

 lxi
 orlando fares to dordrecht where he views
 a numerous squadron which the gate maintain
 as well because suspicion still ensues
 on the foundation of a new domain
 as that before they had received the news
 that out of zealand backed with armed train
 was coming with a fleet of many sail
 a cousin of the lord here pent in jail

 lxii
 one good orlando to the monarch's ear
 bade bear a message `that an errant knight
 oh him would prove himself with sword and spear
 but would lay down this pact before the fight 
 that if the king unhorsed the cavalier
 her who arbantes slew he as his right
 should have that at the cavalier's command
 was ready for delivery to his hand

 lxiii
 `and willed the king should on his side agree
 if him the knight in combat overbore
 forthwith released from his captivity
 bireno to full freedom to restore'
 to him the footman does his embassy
 but he who knightly worth or courteous lore
 had never known directs his whole intent
 the count by treacherous fraud to circumvent

 lxiv
 he hopes as well if he the warrior slay
 to have the dame whom so aggrieved he hates
 if in the knight's disposal and the say
 of that strange knight the footman well relates
 hence thirty men dispatched by other way
 than to the portal led where roland waits
 who with a long and privy circuit wind
 and come upon the paladin behind

 lxv
 he all this while had made his guard delay
 the knight with words till horse and foot he spied
 arrived where he this ambuscade did lay
 when from the gate he with as many hied
 as is the practised hunter's wonted way
 to circle wood and beasts on every side
 as nigh volana with his sweeping nets
 the wary fisher fish and pool besets

 lxvi
 'tis thus the king bars every path which lies
 free for the warrior's flight with armed train
 he him alive and in no other guise
 would have and lightly hopes his end to gain
 nor for the earthly thunderbolt applies
 that had so many and so many slain
 which here he deems would serve his purpose ill
 where he desires to take and not to kill

 lxvii
 as wary fowler bent on greater prey
 wisely preserves alive the game first caught
 that by the callbird and his cheating play
 more may within the circling net be brought
 such cunning art cymosco would assay
 but roland would not be so lightly bought
 like them by the first toil that springs betrayed
 and quickly forced the circle which was made

 lxviii
 where he perceives the assailants thickest stand
 he rests his lance and sticks in his career
 first one and afterwards another and
 another and another who appear
 of paste till six he of the circling band
 of foes impales upon a single spear
 a seventh left out who by the push is slain
 since the clogged weapon can no more contain

 lxix
 no otherwise upon the further shore
 of fosse or of canal the frogs we spy
 by cautious archer practised in his lore
 smote and transfixed the one the other nigh
 upon the shaft until it hold no more
 from barb to feathers full allowed to lie
 the heavy lance orlando from him flung
 and to close combat with his faulchion sprung

 lxx
 the lance now broke his sword the warrior drew
 that sword which never yet was drawn in vain
 and still with cut or thrust some soldier slew
 now horse now footman of the tyrant's train
 and ever where he dealt a stroke changed blue
 yellow green white and black to crimson stain
 cymosco grieves when most his need require
 not to have now his hollow cane and fire

 lxxi
 and with loud voice and menacing command
 bids these be brought but ill his followers hear
 for those who have found safety of his band
 to issue from the city are in fear
 he when he sees them fly on either hand
 would fly as well from that dread cavalier
 makes for the gate and would the drawbridge lift
 but the pursuing county is too swift

 lxxii
 the monarch turns his back and leaves the knight
 lord of the drawbridge and of either gate
 thanks to his swifter steed the rest in flight
 he passes good orlando will not wait
 intent the felon not his band to smite
 upon the vulgar herd to wreck his hate
 but his slow horse seems restive while the king's
 more nimble flies as if equipt with wings

 lxxiii
 from street to street before the count he made
 and vanished clean but after little stay
 came with new arms with tube and fire purveyed
 which at his hest this while his men convey
 and posted at a corner he waylaid
 his foe as hunter watches for his prey
 in forest with armed dogs and spear attending
 the boar in fury from the hill descending

 lxxiv
 who rends the branch and overthrows the stone
 and wheresoe'er he turns his haughty front
 appears so loud the deafening crash and groan
 as if he were uprending wood and mount
 intent to make him his bold deed atone
 cymosco at the pass expects the count
 as soon as he appears with ready light
 touches the hole and fires upon the knight

 lxxv
 behind the weapon flames in lightning's guise
 and vents the thunder from before the ground
 shakes under foot and city wall the skies
 the fearful echo all about rebound
 the burning bolt with sudden fury flies
 not sparing aught which in its course is found
 hissing and whizzing through the skies it went
 but smote not to the assassin's foul intent

 lxxvi
 whether it was his great desire to kill
 that baron or his hurry made him fail
 or trembling heart like leaf which flutters still
 made hand and arm together flinch and quail
 or that it was not the creator's will
 the church so soon her champion should bewail
 the glancing stroke his courser's belly tore
 outstretched on earth from thence to rise no more

 lxxvii
 to earth fall horse and rider this the knight
 scarce touched the other thundering pressed the plain
 for the first rose so ready and so light
 he from the fall seemed breath and force to gain
 as african anteus in the fight
 rose from the sand with prouder might and main
 so when orlando touched the ground to view
 he rose with doubled force and vigour new

 lxxviii
 he who has seen the thunder from on high
 discharged by jove with such a horrid sound
 descend where nitre coal and sulphur lie
 stored up for use in magazine profound
 which scarce has reached  but touched it ere the sky
 is in a flame as well as burning ground
 firm walls are split and solid marbles riven
 and flying stones cast up as high as heaven

 lxxix
 let him imagine when from earth he sprung
 such was the semblance of the cavalier
 who moved in mode to frighten mars among
 the gods so fierce and horrid was his cheer
 at this dismay'd the king of friesland stung
 his horse and turned his rein to fly the peer
 but fierce orlando was upon his foe
 faster than arrow flies from bended bow

 lxxx
 and what before he could not when possest
 of his good courser now afoot will do
 his speed outgoes all thought in every breast
 exceeds all credence save in those who view
 the tyrant shortly joined he on the crest
 smote at his head so well he cleft it through
 and to the neck divided by the blow
 sent it to shake its last on earth below

 lxxxi
 lo in the frighted city other sound
 was heard to rise and other crash of brands
 from troop who thither in his guidance bound
 followed bireno's cousin from his lands
 who since the unguarded gates he open found
 into the city's heart had poured his bands
 where the bold paladin had struck such fear
 he without let might scour it far and near

 lxxxii
 in rout the people fly who cannot guess
 who these may be or what the foes demand
 but when this man and that by speech and dress
 as zealandmen distinguishes the band
 carte blanche they proffer and the chief address
 bidding him range them under his command
 against the frieslanders to lend him aid
 who have their duke in loathsome prison stayed

 lxxxiii
 to friesland's king that people hatred bore
 with all his following who their ancient lord
 had put to death and who by them yet more
 as evil and rapacious was abhorred
 orlando interposed with kindly lore
 as friend of both the parties to accord
 by whom so joined no frieslander was left
 but was of life or liberty bereft

 lxxxiv
 they would not wait to seek the dungeonkey
 but breakingdown the gate their entrance made
 bireno to the count with courtesy
 and grateful thanks the service done repaid
 thence they together with large company
 went where olympia in her vessel stayed
 for so was the expecting lady hight
 to whom that island's crown belonged of right

 lxxxv
 she who had thither good orlando brought
 not hoping that he would have thriven so well
  enough for her if by her misery bought
 her spouse were rescued from the tyrant's cell 
 her full of love and loyal homage sought
 the people one and all twere long to tell
 how she caressed bireno he the maid 
 what thanks both lovers to the county paid

 lxxxvi
 the people throned in her paternal reign
 replace the injured dame and fealty swear
 she on the duke to whom in solid chain
 love with eternal knot had linked the fair
 the empire of herself and her domain
 conferred he called away by other care
 left in the cousin's guardian care this while
 his fortresses and all the subject isle

 lxxxvii
 since he to visit zealand's duchy planned
 his faithful consort in his company
 and thence upon the king of friesland's land
 would try his fortune as he said for he
 a pledge he rated highly had in hand
 which seemed of fair success the warranty
 the daughter of the king who here forsaken
 with many others had been prisoner taken

 lxxxviii
 to a younger brother her the duke pretends
 to be conjoined in wedlock he conveyed
 the roman senator thence parting wends
 upon the very day bireno weighed
 but he to nothing else his hand extends
 of all the many many prized made
 save to that engine found amid the plunder
 which in all points i said resembled thunder

 lxxxix
 not with intent in his defence to bear
 what he had taken of the prize possest
 for he still held it an ungenerous care
 to go with vantage on whatever quest
 but with design to cast the weapon where
 it never more should living wight molest
 and what was appertaining to it all
 bore off as well the powder and the ball

 xc
 and thus when of the tidesway he was clear
 and in the deepest sea his bark descried
 so that no longer distant signs appear
 of either shore on this or the other side
 he seized the tube and said "that cavalier
 may never vail through thee his knightly pride
 nor base be rated with a better foe
 down with thee to the darkest deep below

 xci
 "o loathed o cursed piece of enginery
 cast in tartarean bottom by the hand
 of beelzebub whose foul malignity
 the ruin of this world through thee has planned
 to hell from whence thou came i render thee"
 so said he cast away the weapon fanned
 meanwhile with flowing sheet his frigate goes
 by wind which for the cruel island blows

 xcii
 such was the paladin's desire to explore
 if in the place his missing lady were
 whom he prefers the united world before
 nor can an hour of life without her bear
 he fears if he set foot on ireland's shore
 some other chance may interrupt him there
 so that he after have in vain to say
 "why hasted i no faster on my way"

 xciii
 nor he in england nor in ireland port
 will make nor on the coast that's opposite
 but let him go the naked archer's sport
 sore smitten in the heart  ere i indite
 yet more of him to holland i resort
 and you to hear me company invite
 for well i wot that you as well as me
 'twould grieve that bridal should without us be

 xciv
 sumptuous and fair the bridal there is made
 but neither yet so sumptuous nor so fair
 as it will be in zealand it is said
 but 'tis not my design you should repair
 thither since by new accidents delayed
 the feast will be of which be it my care
 in other strain the tidings to report
 if you to hear that other strain resort


 canto 10

 argument
 another love assails bireno's breast
 who leaves one night olympia on the shore
 to logistilla's holy realm addressed
 rogero goes nor heeds alcina more
 him of that flying courser repossest
 the hippogryph on airy voyage bore
 whence he the good rinaldo's levy sees
 and next angelica beholds and frees


 i
 of all the loves of all fidelity
 yet proved of all the constant hearts and true
 of all the lovers in felicity
 or sorrow faithful found a famous crew
 to olympia i would give the first degree
 rather than second if this be not due
 i well may say that hers no tale is told
 of truer love in present times or old

 ii
 and this she by so many proofs and clear
 had made apparent to the zealand lord
 no woman's faith more certain could appear
 to man though he her open heart explored
 and if fair truth such spirits should endear
 and they in mutual love deserve reward
 bireno as himself nay he above
 himself i say should kind olympia love

 iii
 not only should he nevermore deceive
 her for another were that woman she
 who so made europe and wide asia grieve
 or fairer yet if one more fair there be
 but rather that quit her the light should leave
 and what is sweet to taste touch hear and see
 and life and fame and all beside if aught
 more precious can in truth be styled or thought

 iv
 if her bireno loved as she had loved
 bireno if her love he did repay
 with faith like hers and still with truth unmoved
 veered not his shifting sail another way
 or ingrate for such service  cruel proved
 for such fair love and faith i now will say
 and you with lips comprest and eyebrows bent
 shall listen to the tale for wonderment

 v
 and when you shall have heard the impiety
 which of such passing goodness was the meed
 woman take warning from this perfidy
 and let none make a lover's word her creed
 mindless that god does all things hear and see
 the lover eager his desires to speed
 heaps promises and vows aye prompt to swear
 which afterwards all winds disperse in air

 vi
 the promises and empty vows dispersed
 in air by winds all dissipated go
 after these lovers have the greedy thirst
 appeased with which their fevered palates glow
 in this example which i offer versed
 their prayers and tears to credit be more slow
 cheaply dear ladies mine is wisdom bought
 by those who wit at other's cost are taught

 vii
 of those in the first flower of youth beware
 whose visage is so soft and smooth to sight
 for past as soon as bred their fancies are
 like a straw fire their every appetite
 so the keen hunter follows up the hare
 in heat and cold on shore or mountainheight
 nor when 'tis taken more esteems the prize
 and only hurries after that which flies

 viii
 such is the practise of these striplings who
 what time you treat them with austerity
 love and revere you and such homage do
 as those who pay their service faithfully
 but vaunt no sooner victory than you
 from mistresses shall servants grieve to be
 and mourn to see the fickle love they owed
 from you diverted and elsewhere bestowed

 ix
 i not for this for that were wrong opine
 that you should cease to love for you without
 a lover like uncultivated vine
 would be that has no prop to wind about
 but the first down i pray you to decline
 to fly the volatile inconstant rout
 to make your choice the riper fruits among
 nor yet to gather what too long has hung

 x
 a daughter they have found above was said
 of the proud king who ruled the friesland state
 that with bireno's brother was to wed
 as far as rumour tells but to relate
 the truth a longing in bireno bred
 the sight of food so passing delicate
 and he to talk his palate deemed would be
 for other's sake a foolish courtesy

 xi
 the gentle damsel had not past fourteen
 was beautiful and fresh and like a rose
 when this first opening from its bud is seen
 and with the vernal sun expands and grows
 to say bireno loved the youthful queen
 were little with less blaze lit tinder glows
 or ripened corn wherever envious hand
 of foe amid the grain has cast a brand

 xii
 than that which on bireno's bosom fed
 and to his marrow burned when weeping sore
 the fate of her unhappy father dead
 he saw her bathed in ceaseless tears deplore
 and as cold water on the cauldron shed
 shops short the bubbling wave which boiled before
 so was the raging rife olympia blew
 within his breast extinguished by a new

 xiii
 nor feels bireno mere satiety
 he loathes her so he ill endures her sight
 and if his hope he long deferred will die
 for other such his fickle appetite
 yet till the day prefixed to satisfy
 his fond desire so feigns the wary knight
 olympia less to love than to adore
 he seems and but her pleasure to explore

 xiv
 and if the other he too much caress
 who cannot but caress her there are none
 see evil in the deed but rather guess
 it is in pity is in goodness done
 since to raise up and comfort in distress
 whom fortune's wheel beats down in changeful run
 was never blamed with glory oftener paid
  so much the more a young  a harmless maid

 xv
 almighty god how fallible and vain
 is human judgment dimmed by clouds obscure
 bireno's actions impious and profane
 by others are reputed just and pure
 already stooping to their oars the train
 have loosed his vessel from the port secure
 and with the duke and his companions steer
 for zealand through the deep with meery cheer

 xvi
 already holland and its headlands all
 are left astern and now descried no more
 since to shun friesland they to larboard hawl
 and keep their course more nigh the scottish shore
 when they are overtaken by a squall
 and drive three days the open sea before
 upon the third when now near eventide
 a barren and unpeopled isle is spied

 xvii
 as soon as they were harboured in a hight
 olympia landed and the board was spread
 she there contented with the faithless knight
 supt unsuspecting any cause for dread
 thence with bireno where a tent was pight
 in pleasant place repaired and went to bed
 the others of their train returned abroad
 and rested in their ship in haven moored

 xviii
 the fear and late sea sorrow which had weighed
 so long upon the dame and broke her rest
 the finding herself safe in greenwood shade
 removed from noise and for her tranquil breast
 knowing her lover was beside her laid
 no further thoughts no further cares molest
 olympia lap in slumber so profound
 no sheltered bear or dormouse sleeps more sound

 xix
 the lover false who hatching treason lies
 stole from his bed in silence when he knew
 she slept his clothes he in a bundle ties
 nor other raiment on his body threw
 then issuing forth from the pavilion hies
 as if on newborn wings towards his crew
 who roused unmoor without a cry as he
 commands and loosen thence and put to sea

 xx
 behind the land was left and there to pine
 olympia who yet slept the woods among
 till from her gilded wheels the frosty rhine
 aurora upon earth beneath had flung
 and the old woe beside the tumbling brine
 lamenting halcyons mournful descant sung
 when she 'twixt sleep and waking made a strain
 to reach her loved bireno but in vain

 xxi
 she no one found the dame her arm withdrew
 she tried again yet no one found she spread
 both arms now here now there and sought anew
 now either leg but yet no better sped
 fear banished sleep she oped her eyes in view
 was nothing she no more her widowed bed
 would keep but from the couch in fury sprung
 and headlong forth from the pavilion flung

 xxii
 and seaward ran her visage tearing sore
 presaging and now certain of her plight
 she beat her bosom and her tresses tore
 and looked the moon was shining if she might
 discover any thing beside the shore
 nor save the shore was any thing in sight
 she calls bireno and the caverns round
 pitying her grief bireno's name rebound

 xxiii
 on the far shore there rose a rock below
 scooped by the breaker's beating frequently
 the cliff was hollowed underneath in show
 of arch and overhung the foaming sea
 olympia mind such vigour did bestow
 sprang up the frowning crest impetuously
 and at a distance stretched by favouring gale
 thence saw her cruel lord's departing sail

 xxiv
 saw it or seemed to see for ill her eyes
 things through the air yet dim and hazy view
 she falls alltrembling on the ground and lies
 with face than snow more cold and white in hue
 but when she has again found strength to rise
 guiding her voice towards the bark which flew
 calling with all her might the unhappy dame
 calls often on her cruel consort's name

 xxv
 where unavailing was the feeble note
 she wept and clapt her hands in agony
 "without its freight" she cried "thy ship does float
  where cruel dost thou fly so swiftly  me
 receive as well  small hinderance to thy boat
 which bears my spirit would my body be"
 and she her raiment waving in her hand
 signed to the frigate to return to land

 xxvi
 but the loud wind which sweeping ocean bears
 the faithless stripling's sail across the deep
 bears off as well the shriek and moan and prayers
 of sad olympia sorrowing on the steep
 thrice cruel to herself the dame prepares
 from the high rock amid the waves to leap
 but from the water lifts at length her sight
 and there returns where she had passed the night

 xxvii
 stretched on the bed upon her face she lay
 bathing it with her tears "last night in thee
 together two found shelter" did she say
 "alas why two together are not we
 at rising false bireno cursed day
 that i was born what here remains to me
 to do what can be done  alone betrayed 
 who will console me who afford me aid

 xxviii
 "nor man i see nor see i work which shows
 that man inhabits in this isle nor i
 see ship in which a refuge from my woes
 embarking i from hence may hope to fly
 here shall i starve nor any one to close
 my eyes or give me sepulture be by
 save wolf perchance who roves this wood a tomb
 give me alas in his voracious womb

 xxix
 "i live in terror and appear to see
 rough bear or lion issue even now
 or tiger from beneath the greenwood tree
 or other beast with teeth and claws but how
 can ever cruel beast inflict on me
 o cruel beast a fouler death than thou
 enough for them to slay me once while i
 am made by thee a thousand deaths to die

 xxx
 "but grant e'en now some skipper hither fare
 who may for pity bear me hence away
 and that i so eschew wolf lion bear
 torture and dearth and every horrid way
 of death to holland shall he take me where
 for thee is guarded fortilage and bay
 or take me to the land where i was born
 if this thou hast from me by treachery torn

 xxxi
 "thou with pretence from me my state didst wrest
 of our connection and of amity
 and quickly of my land thy troops possest
 to assure the rule unto thyself shall i
 return to flanders where i sold the rest
 though little upon which i lived to buy
 thee needful succour and from prison bear
 wretch whither shall i go  i know not where

 xxxii
 "can i to friesland go where i to reign
 as queen was called and this for thee forewent
 where both my brethren and my sire were slain
 and every other good from me was rent 
 thee would i not thou ingrate with my pain
 reproach not therefore deal thee punishment
 as well as i the story dost thou know
 now see the meed thou dost for this bestow

 xxxiii
 "oh may i but escape the wild corsair
 nor taken be and after sold for slave
 rather than this may lion wolf or bear
 tiger or other beast if fiercer rave
 me with his claws and rushes rend and tear
 and drag my bleeding body to his cave"
 so saying she her golden hair offends
 and lock by lock the scattered tresses rends

 xxxiv
 she to the shore's extremest verge anew
 tossing her head with hair dishevelled run
 and seemed like maid beside herself and who
 was by ten fiends possessed instead of one
 of like the frantic hecuba at view
 of murdered polydore her infant son
 fixed on a stone she gazed upon the sea
 nor less than real stone seemed stone to be

 xxxv
 but let her grieve till my return to show
 now of the child i wish his weary way
 rogero in the noon's intensest glow
 takes by the shore the burning sunbeams play
 upon the hill and thence rebound below
 boils the white sand while heated with the ray
 little is wanting in that journey dire
 but that the arms he wears are all on fire

 xxxvi
 while to the warrior thirst and labour sore
 still toiling through that heavy sand as he
 pursued his path along the sunny shore
 were irksome and displeasing company
 beneath the shadow of a turret hoar
 which rose beside the beach amid the sea
 he found three ladies of alcina's court
 as such distinguished by their dress and port

 xxxvii
 reclined on alexandrian carpets rare
 the ladies joyed the cool in great delight
 about them various wines in vessels were
 and every sort of comfit nicely dight
 fast by and sporting with the ripple there
 lay waiting on their needs a pinnace light
 until a breeze should fill her sail anew
 for then no breath upon the waters blew

 xxxviii
 they who beheld along the shifting sand
 rogero wend upon his way intent
 and saw thirst figured on his lips and scanned
 his troubled visage all with sweat besprent
 began to pray `on what he had in hand
 he would not show his heart so deeply bent
 but that he in the cool and grateful shade
 would rest his weary limbs beside them laid'

 xxxix
 to hold the stirrup one approaching near
 would aid him to alight the other bore
 a cup of chrystal to the cavalier
 with foaming wine which raised his thirst the more
 but to the music of their speech no ear
 he lent who weened if he his way forbore
 for anything each lett would time supply
 to alcina to arrive who now was nigh

 xl
 now so saltpetre fine and sulphur pure
 touched with the fiery spark blaze suddenly
 not so loud ocean raves when the obscure
 whirlwind descends and camps in middle sea
 as viewing thus the knight proceed secure
 upon his journey and aware that he
 scorns them who yet believe they beauteous are
 kindled the third of those three damsels fair

 xli
 as loud as she could raise her voice she said
 "thou art not gentle nor art thou a knight
 and hast from other arms and horse conveyed
 which never could be thine by better right
 so be thy theft if well i guess appaid
 by death which this may worthily requite
 foul thief churl haughty ingrate may i thee
 burned gibbeted or cut in quarters see"

 xlii
 beside all these and more injurious cries
 which the proud damsel at the warrior throws
 though to her taunts rogero nought replies
 who weens small fame from such a contest flows
 she with her sisters to the frigate hies
 which waits them and aboard the tender goes
 and plying fast her oars pursues the knight
 along the sandy beach still kept in sight

 xliii
 on him with threat and curse she ever cried
 whose tongue collected still fresh cause for blame
 meanwhile where to the lovelier fairy's side
 the passage lay across a straight he came
 and there an ancient ferryman espied
 put from the other shore with punctual aim
 as if forewarned and well prepared the seer
 waited the coming of the cavalier

 xliv
 the ferryman put forth the child to meet
 to bear him to a better shore rejoicing he
 appeared as all benign and all discreet
 if of the heart the face is warranty
 giving god thanks rogero took his seat
 aboard the bark and passed the quiet sea
 discoursing with that ancient pilot fraught
 with wisdom and by long experience taught

 xlv
 he praised rogero much that he had fled
 in time from false alcina and before
 to him the dame had given the chalice dread
 her lover's final guerdon evermore
 next that he had to logistilla sped
 where he should duly witness holy lore
 and beauty infinite and grace enjoy
 which feed and nourish hearts they never cloy

 xlvi
 "her shall you struck with wonderment revere"
 he said "when first you shall behold the fay
 but better contemplate her lofty cheer
 and you no other treasure shall appay
 in this her love from other differs fear
 and hope in other on the bosom prey
 in hers desire demands not aught beside
 and with the blessing seen is satisfied

 xlvii
 "you shall in nobler studies be professed
 tutored by her than bath and costly fare
 song dance and perfumes as how fashioned best
 your thoughts may tower more high than hawks in air
 and how some of the glory of the blest
 you here may in the mortal body share"
 so speaking and yet distant from the shore
 to the safe bank approached the pilot hoar

 xlviii
 when he beholds forthissuing from the strand
 a fleet of ships which all towards him steer
 with these came wronged alcina with a band
 of many vassals gathered far and near
 to risk the ruin of herself and land
 or repossess the thing she held so dear
 love no light cause incites the dame aggrieved
 nor less the bitter injury received

 xlix
 such choler she had never felt before
 as that which now upon her bosom fed
 and hence she made her followers ply the oar
 till the white foam on either bank was shed
 the deafening noise and din o'er sea and shore
 by echo every where repeated spread
 "now  now rogero bare the magic shield
 or in the strife be slain or basely yield"

 l
 thus logistilla's pilot and beside
 so saying seized the pouch wherein was dight
 the buckler and the covering torn aside
 exposed to open view the shining light
 the enchanted splendor flashing far and wide
 so sore offends the adversaries' sight
 they from their vessels drop amazed and blind
 tumbling from prow before and poop behind

 li
 one who stood sentry on the citadel
 descried the navy of the invading dame
 and backwards rang the castle larumbell
 whence speedy succours to the haven came
 the artillery rained like storm whose fury fell
 on all who would rogero scathe and shame
 so that such aid was brought him in the strife
 as saved the warrior's liberty and life

 lii
 four ladies are arrived upon the strand
 thither by logistilla sped in haste
 leagued with the valiant anrondica stand
 fronesia sage dicilla good and chaste
 sofrosina who as she has in had
 more than the others 'mid the foremost placed
 conspicuous flames forth issues from the fort
 a matchless host and files towards the port

 liii
 beneath the castle safe from wind and swell
 of many ships and stout a squadron lay
 which in the harbour at a sound from bell 
 a word were fit for action night or day
 and thus by land and sea was battle fell
 and furious waged on part of either fay
 whence was alcina's realm turned upside down
 of which she had usurped her sister's crown

 liv
 oh of how many battles the success
 is different from what was hoped before
 not only failed the dame to repossess
 as thought her lover flying from her shore
 but out of ships even now so numberless
 that ample ocean scarce the navy bore
 from all her vessels to the flames a prey
 but with one bark escaped the wretched fay

 lv
 alcina flies and her sad troop around
 routed and taken burnt or sunk remains
 to have lost rogero sorrow more profound
 wakes in her breast than all her other pains
 and she in bitter tears for ever drowned
 of the child's loss by night and day complains
 and bent to end her woes with many a sigh
 often laments her that she cannot die

 lvi
 no fairy dies or can while overhead
 the sun shall burn or heaven preserve their stile
 or clotho had been moved to cut her thread
 touched by such grief or as on funeral pile
 fair dido she beneath the steel had bled
 or haply like the gorgeous queen of nile
 in mortal slumber would have closed her eye
 but fairies cannot at their pleasure die

 lvii
 return we where eternal fame is due
 leaving alcina in her trouble sore
 i speak of valorous rogero who
 had disembarked upon the safer shore
 he turned his back upon the waters blue
 giving god thanks for all with pious lore
 and on dry ground now landed made repair
 towards the lofty castle planted there

 lviii
 than this a stronger or more bright in show
 was never yet before of mortal sight
 or after viewed with stones the ramparts glow
 more rich than carbuncle or diamond bright
 we of like gems discourse not here below
 and he who would their nature read aright
 must thither speed none such elsewhere i ween
 except perhaps in heaven above are seen

 lix
 what gives to them superiority
 o'er every other sort of gem confessed
 is man in these his very soul may see
 his vices and his virtues see expressed
 hence shall he after heed no flattery
 nor yet by wrongful censure be depressed
 his form he in the lucid mirror eyes
 and by the knowledge of himself grows wise

 lx
 their rays which imitate the sunshine fill
 all round about with such a flood of light
 that he who has them phoebus may at will
 create himself a day in thy despite
 nor only marvellous the gems the skill
 of the artificer and substance bright
 so well contend for mastery of the two
 'tis hard to judge where preference is due

 lxi
 on arches raised whereon the firmament
 seemed to repose as props so fair in show
 are lovely gardens and of such extent
 as even would be hard to have below
 clustering 'twixt lucid tower or battlement
 green odoriferous shrubs are seen to grow
 which through the summer and the winter shoot
 and teem with beauteous blossom and ripe fruit

 lxii
 never in any place such goodly tree
 is grown except within these gardens fine
 or rose or violet of like quality
 lilies or amaranth or jessamine
 elsewhere it seems as if foredoomed to be
 born with one sun to live and to decline
 upon its widowed stalk the blossom dies
 subject to all the changes of the skies

 lxiii
 but here the verdure still is permanent
 still permanent the eternal blossoms are
 not that kind nature in her government
 so nicely tempers here the genial air
 but that unneeding any influence lent
 by planet logistilla's zeal and care
 ever keep fast what may appear a thing
 impossible her own perpetual spring

 lxiv
 that such a gentle lord had sought her rest
 did much the prudent logistilla please
 and she commanded he should be carest
 and all should seek to do him courtesies
 sometime had sir astolpho been her guest
 whom with a joyful heart rogero sees
 there in few days resorted all the crew
 changed by melissa to their shapes anew

 lxv
 when they a day or more their weariness
 had eased rogero sought the prudent fay
 with him the duke astolpho who no less
 desired to measure back his western way
 melissa was for both embassadress
 and for the warlike pair with humble say
 to favour warn and help them prayed the dame
 so that they might return from whence they came

 lxvi
 "i" said the fay "will think upon this need
 and in two days the pair will expedite"
 then thought how good rogero she should speed
 and afterwards how aid the english knight
 she wills the first shall on the griffin steed
 to the aquitanian shores direct his flight
 but first will fashion for the flyinghorse
 a bit to guide him and restrain his course

 lxvii
 she shows him what to do if he on high
 would make him soar or down to earth would bring
 and what would he in circles make him fly
 or swiftly speed or pause upon the wing
 and all that skilful horsemen use to try
 upon plain ground beneath her tutoring
 rogero learned in air and gained dominion
 over the griffinsteed of soaring pinion

 lxviii
 when at all points rogero was prepared
 he bade farewell to the protecting fay
 for ever to the loving knight endeared
 and issued from her realm upon his way
 i first of him who on his journey fared
 in happy hour and afterwards shall say
 of the english knight who spent more time and pain
 seeking the friendly court of charlemagne

 lxix
 rogero thence departs but as before
 takes not the way he took in his despite
 when him above the sea the courser bore
 and seldom was the land beneath in sight
 but taught to make him beat his wings and soar
 here there as liked him best with docile flight
 returning he another path pursued
 as magi erst who herod's snare eschewed

 lxx
 borne hither good rogero leaving spain
 had sought in level line the indian lands
 where they are watered by the eastern main
 where the two fairies strove with hostile bands
 he now resolved to visit other reign
 than that where aeolus his train commands
 and finish so the round he had begun
 circling the world beneath him like the sun

 lxxi
 here the catay and there he mangiane
 passing the great quinsay beheld in air
 above imavus turned and sericane
 left on the right and thence did ever bear
 from the north scythians to the hyrcanian main
 so reached sarmatia's distant land and where
 europe and asia's parted climes divide
 russ prussian he and pomeranian spied

 lxxii
 although the child by every wish was pressed
 quickly to seek his bradamant yet he
 with taste of roving round the world possest
 would not desist from it till hungary
 he had seen and polacks germans and the rest
 should in his wide extended circuit see
 inhabiting that horrid northern land
 and came at last to england's farthest strand

 lxxiii
 yet think not sir that in so long a flight
 the warrior is for ever on the wing
 who lodges housed in tavern every night
 as best as can through his capacious ring
 so nights and days he passes such delight
 prospects to him of land and ocean bring
 arrived one morn nigh londontown he stopt
 and over thames the flying courser dropt

 lxxiv
 where he in meadows to the city nigh
 saw troops of men at arms and footmen spread
 who to the drum and trumpet marching by
 divided into goodly bands were led
 before rinaldo flower of chivalry
 he that if you remember it was said
 to have been sent by charlemagne and made
 his envoy to these parts in search of aid

 lxxv
 rogero came exactly as the show
 of that fair host was made without the town
 and of a knight the occasion sought to know
 but from the griffinhorse first lighted down
 and he who courteous was informed him how
 of kingdoms holding of the british crown
 english scotch irish and the islands nigh
 those many banners were upreared on high

 lxxvi
 and added having ended this display
 of arms the troops would file towards the strand
 where vessels anchored in the harbour lay
 waiting to bear them to another land
 "the french beseiged rejoice in this array
 and hope he said deliverance through the band
 but that i may of all inform you well
 i of each troop shall separately tell

 lxxvii
 "lo where yon mighty banner planted stands
 which pards and flowerdeluces does unfold
 that our great captain to the wind expands
 under whose ensign are the rest enrolled
 the warrior's name renowned throughout these lands
 is leonetto flower of all the bold
 lancaster's duke and nephew to the king
 valiant in war and wise in counselling

 lxxviii
 "that next the royal gonfalon which stirred

 "a burning pine by kildare is displayed

 lxxxix
 "issued from cavern and from forest brown

 with hair like beasts lo yonder where they press
 about a standard white the level down
 of lances seems a bristling wilderness
 such moray's flag the savage squadron's head
 who means with moorish blood to paint it red"

 xc
 what time rogero sees the fair array
 whose bands to succour ravaged france prepare
 and notes and talks of ensigns they display
 and names of british lords to him repair
 one and another crowding to survey
 his courser single of its kind or rare
 all thither hasten wondering and astound
 and compassing the warrior form a round

 xci
 so that to raise more wonder in the train
 and to make better sport as him they eyed
 rogero shook the flying courser's rein
 and lightly with the rowels touched his side
 he towards heaven uprising soared amain
 and left behind each gazer stupefied
 having from end to end the english force
 so viewed he next for ireland shaped his course

 xcii
 and saw fabulous hibernia where
 the goodly sainted elder made the cave
 in which men cleansed from all offences are
 such mercy there it seems is found to save
 thence o'er that sea he spurred through yielding air
 whose briny waves the lesser britain lave
 and looking down angelica descried
 in passing to the rock with fetters tied

 xciii
 bound to the naked rock upon the strand
 in the isle of tears for the isle of tears was hight
 that which was peopled by the inhuman band
 so passing fierce and full of foul despite
 who as i told above on every hand
 cruized with their scattered fleet by day or night
 and every beauteous woman bore away
 destined to be a monster's evil prey

 xciv
 there but that morning bound in cruel wise
 where to devour a living damsel sped
 the orc that measureless seamonster hies
 which on abominable food is fed
 how on the beach the maid became the prize
 of the rapacious crew above was said
 who found her sleeping near the enchanter hoar
 who her had thither brought by magic lore

 xcv
 the cruel and inhospitable crew
 to the voracious beast the dame expose
 upon the seabeat shore as bare to view
 as nature did at first her work compose
 not even a veil she had to shade the hue
 of the white lily and vermillion rose
 which mingled in her lovely members meet
 proof to decembersnow and julyheat

 xcvi
 her would rogero have some statue deemed
 of alabaster made or marble rare
 which to the rugged rock so fastened seemed
 by the industrious sculptor's cunning care
 but that he saw distinct a tear which streamed
 amid freshopening rose and lily fair
 stand on her budding paps beneath in dew
 and that her golden hair dishevelled flew

 xcvii
 and as he fastened his on her fair eyes
 his bradamant he called to mind again
 pity and love within his bosom rise
 at once and ill he can from tears refrain
 and in soft tone he to the damsel cries
 when he has checked his flying courser's rein
 "o lady worthy but that chain to wear
 with which love's faithful servants fettered are

 xcviii
 "and most unworthy this or other ill
 what wretch has had the cruelty to wound
 and gall those snowy hands with livid stain
 thus painfully with griding fetters bound"
 at this she cannot choose but show like grain
 of crimson spreading on an ivory ground
 knowing those secret beauties are espied
 which howsoever lovely shame would hide

 xcix
 and gladly with her hands her face would hood
 were they not fastened to the rugged stone
 but with her tears for this at least she could
 bedewed it and essayed to hold it down
 sobbing some while the lovely damsel stood
 then loosed her tongue and spake in feeble tone
 but ended not arrested in midword
 by a loud noise which in the sea was heard

 c
 lo and behold the unmeasuredbeast appears
 half surging and half hidden in such sort
 as sped by roaring wind long carack steers
 from north or south towards her destined port
 so the sea monster to his food repairs
 and now the interval between is short
 half dead the lady is through fear endured
 ill by that other's comfort reassured

 ci
 rogero overhand not in the rest
 carries his lance and beats with downright blow
 the monstrous orc what this resembled best
 but a huge writhing mass i do not know
 which wore no form of animal exprest
 save in the head with eyes and teeth of sow
 his forehead 'twixt the eyes rogero smites
 but as on steel or rock the weapon lights

 cii
 when he perceives the first of no avail
 the knight returns to deal a better blow
 the orc who sees the shifting shadow sail
 of those huge pinions on the sea below
 in furious heat deserts his sure regale
 on shore to follow that deceitful show
 and rolls and reels behind it as it fleets
 rogero drops and oft the stroke repeats

 ciii
 as eagle that amid her downward flight
 surveys amid the grass a snake unrolled
 or where she smoothes upon a sunny height
 her ruffled plumage and her scales of gold
 assails it not where prompt with poisonous bite
 to hiss and creep but with securer hold
 gripes it behind and either pinion clangs
 lest it should turn and wound her with its fangs

 civ
 so the fell orc rogero does not smite
 with lance or faulchion where the tushes grow
 but aims that 'twixt the ears his blow may light
 now on the spine or now on tail below
 and still in time descends or soars upright
 and shifts his course to cheat the veering foe
 but as if beating on a jasper block
 can never cleave the hard and rugged rock

 cv
 with suchlike warfare is the mastiff vext
 by the bold fly in august's time of dust
 or in the month before or in the next
 this full of yellow spikes and that of must
 for ever by the circling plague perplext
 whose sting into his eyes or snout is thrust
 and oft the dog's dry teeth are heard to fall
 but reaching once the foe he pays for all

 cvi
 with his huge tail the troubled waves so sore
 the monster beats that they ascend heavenhigh
 and the knight knows not if he swim or soar
 upon his feathered courser in mid sky
 and oft were fain to find himself ashore
 for if long time the spray so thickly fly
 he fears it so will bathe his hippogryph
 that he shall vainly covet gourd or skiff

 cvii
 he then new counsel took and 'twas the best
 with other arms the monster to pursue
 and lifting from his shield the covering vest
 to dazzle with the light his blasted view
 landward towards the rockchained maid he pressed
 and on her little finger lest a new
 mischance should follow slipt the ring which brought
 the enchantment of the magic shield to nought

 cviii
 i say the ring which bradamant to free
 rogero from brunello's hand had rent
 and which to snatch him from alcina she
 had next to india by melissa sent
 melissa as before was said by me
 in aid of many used the instrument
 and to rogero this again had born
 by whom 'twas ever on his finger worn

 cix
 he gave it now angelica for he
 feared lest the buckler's light should be impaired
 and willed as well those beauteous eyes should be
 defended which had him already snared
 pressing beneath his paunch full half the sea
 now to the shore the monstrous whale repaired
 firm stood rogero and the veil undone
 appeared to give the sky another sun

 cx
 he in the monster's eyes the radiance throws
 which works as it was wont in other time
 as trout or grayling to the bottom goes
 in stream which mountaineer disturbs with lime
 so the enchanted buckler overthrows
 the orc reversed among the foam and slime
 rogero here and there the beast astound
 still beats but cannot find the way to wound

 cxi
 this while the lady begs him not to bray
 longer the monster's rugged scale in vain
 "for heaven's sake turn and loose me" did she say
 still weeping "ere the orc awake again
 bear me with thee and drown me in midway
 let me not this foul monster's food remain"
 by her just plaint rogero moved forebore
 untied the maid and raised her from the shore

 cxii
 upon the beach the courser plants his feet
 and goaded by the rowel towers in air
 and gallops with rogero in mid seat
 while on the croup behind him sate the fair
 who of his banquet so the monster cheat
 for him too delicate and dainty fare
 rogero turns and with thick kisses plies
 the lady's snowy breast and sparkling eyes

 cxiii
 he kept no more the way as he before
 proposed for compassing the whole of spain
 but stopt his courser on the neighbouring shore
 where lesser britain runs into the main
 upon the bank there rose an oakwood hoar
 where philomel for ever seemed to plain
 i' the middle was a meadow with a fountain
 and at each end a solitary mountain

 cxiv
 'twas here the wishful knight first checked the rein
 and dropping in the meadow made his steed
 furl yet not shut so close his wings again
 as he had spread them wide for better speed
 down lights rogero and forbears with pain
 from other leap but this his arms impede
 his arms impede a bar to his desire
 and he must doff them would he slake the fire

 cxv
 now here now there confused by different throng
 rogero did his shining arms undo
 never the task appeared to him so long
 for where he loosed one knot he fastened two
 but sir too long continued is this song
 and haply may as well have wearied you
 so that i shall delay to other time
 when it may better please my tedious rhyme


 canto 11

 argument
 assisted by the magic ring she wears
 angelica evanishes from view
 next in a damsel whom a giant bears
 beneath his arm his bride rogero true
 beholds orlando to the shore repairs
 where the fell orc so many damsels slew
 olympia frees and spoils the beast of life
 her afterwards oberto takes to wife


 i
 although a feeble rein in mid career
 will oft suffice to stop courageous horse
 'tis seldom reason's bit will serve to steer
 desire or turn him from his furious course
 when pleasure is in reach like headstrong bear
 whom from the honeyed meal 'tis ill to force
 if once he scent the tempting mess or sup
 a drop which hangs upon the luscious cup

 ii
 what reason then rogero shall withhold
 from taking with angelica delight 
 that gentle maid there naked in his hold
 in the lone forest and secure from sight
 of bradamant he thinks not who controlled
 his bosom erst and foolish were the knight
 if thinking of that damsel as before
 by this he had not set an equal store

 iii
 warmed by whose youthful beauties the severe
 xenocrates would not have been more chaste
 the impatient child had dropt both shield and spear
 and hurrying now his other arms uncased
 when casting down her eyes in shame and fear
 the virtuous ring upon her finger placed
 angelica descried and which of yore
 from her brunello in albracca bore

 iv
 this is the ring she carried into france
 when thither first the damsel took her way
 with her the brother bearer of the lance
 after the paladin astolpho's prey
 with this she malagigi's spells and trance
 made vain by merlin's stair and on a day
 orlando freed with many knights and good
 from dragontina's cruel servitude

 v
 with this passed viewless from the turretcell
 where her that bad old man had mewed but why
 recount its different wonders if as well
 you know the virtues of the ring as i
 from her this even in her citadel
 his monarch agramant to satisfy
 brunello took since where she had been crost
 by fortune till her native realm was lost

 vi
 now that she this upon her hand surveys
 she is so full of pleasure and surprise
 she doubts it is a dream and in amaze
 hardly believes her very hand and eyes
 then softly to her mouth the hoop conveys
 and quicker than the flash which cleaves the skies
 from bold rogero's sight her beauty shrowds
 as disappears the sun concealed in clouds

 vii
 yet still rogero gazed like wight distraught
 and hurried here and there with fruitless speed
 but when he had recalled the ring to thought
 foiled and astounded cursed his little heed
 and now the vanished lady whom he sought
 of that ungrateful and discourteous deed
 accusing stood wherewith she had repaid
 unfitting recompense his generous aid

 viii
 "ungrateful damsel and is this the pay
 you render for the service done" said he
 "why rather would you steal my ring away
 than have it as a welcome gift from me
 not only this but use me as you may
 i and my shield and courser yours shall be
 so you no more conceal your beauteous cheer
 cruel though answering not i know you hear"

 ix
 so saying like one blind with bootless care
 feeling his way about the fount he strayed
 how often he embraced the empty air
 hoping in this to have embraced the maid
 meanwhile now far removed the flying fair
 had halted not till to a cave conveyed
 formed in a mountain was that harbour rude
 spacious and for her need supplied with food

 x
 'twas here an aged herdsman one who tended
 a numerous troop of mares had made his won
 these seeking pasture through the valley wended
 where the green grass was fed by freshening run
 while stalls on either side the cave defended
 his charge from the oppressive noontide sun
 angelica within that livelong day
 unseen of prying eyes prolonged her stay

 xi
 and about evening when refreshed with rest
 and food she deemed her course she might renew
 in certain rustic weeds her body dressed
 how different from those robes of red or blue
 green yellow purple her accustomed vest
 so various in its fashion shape and hue
 yet her not so that habit misbecame
 but that she looked the fair and noble dame

 xii
 then phillis' and neaera's praise forbear
 and ye who sing of amaryllis cease
 or flying galataea not so fair
 tityrus and melibaeus with your peace
 'twas here the beauteous lady took a mare
 which liked her best of all that herd's increase
 then and then first conceived the thought again
 to seek in the levant her antient reign

 xiii
 this while rogero after he had passed
 long space in hope the maid might reappear
 awakened from his foolish dream at last
 and found she was not nigh and did not hear
 then to remount his griffincourser cast
 in earth and air accustomed to career
 but having slipt his bit the winged horse
 had towered and soared in air a freer course

 xiv
 to his first ill addition grave and sore
 was to have lost the bird of rapid wing
 which he no better than the mockery bore
 put on him by the maid but deeper sting
 than this or that implants and pains him more
 the thought of having lost the precious ring
 not for its power so much esteemed above
 its worth as given him by his lady love

 xv
 afflicted beyond measure he with shield
 cast on his shoulder and newcased in mail
 left the seaside and through a grassy field
 pursued his way towards a spacious vale
 where he beheld a path by wood concealed
 the widest and most beaten in the dale
 nor far had wound the closest shades within
 ere on his right he heard a mighty din

 xvi
 he heard a din and fearful clashing sound
 of arms and hurrying on with eager pace
 'twixt tree and tree two furious champions found
 waging fierce fight in close and straightened place
 who to each other warring on what ground
 i know not neither showed regard nor grace
 the one a giant was of haughty cheer
 and one a bold and gallant cavalier

 xvii
 covered with shield and sword one leaping sped
 now here now there and thus himself defended
 lest a twohanded mace upon his head
 should fall with which the giant still offended 
 on the field lay his horse already dead
 rogero paused and to the strife attended
 and straight his wishes leant towards the knight
 whom he would fain see conqueror in the fight

 xviii
 yet not for this would lend the champion aid
 but to behold the cruel strife stood nigh
 lo a twohanded stroke the giant made
 upon the lesser warrior's casque and by
 the mighty blow the knight was overlaid
 the other when astound he saw him lie
 to deal the foe his death his helm untied
 so that the warrior's face rogero spied

 xix
 of his sweet lady of his passing fair
 and dearest bradamant rogero spies
 the lovely visage of its helmet bare
 towards whom to deal her death the giant hies
 so that advancing with his sword in air
 to sudden battle him the child defies
 but he who will not wait for new alarm
 takes the halflifeless lady in his arm

 xx
 and on his shoulder flings and bears away
 as sometimes wolf a little lamb will bear
 or eagle in her crooked claws convey
 pigeon or suchlike bird through liquid air
 rogero runs with all the speed he may
 who sees how needed is his succour there
 but with such strides the giant scours the plain
 him with his eyes the knight pursues with pain

 xxi
 this flying and that following the two
 kept a close path which widened still and they
 piercing that forest issued forth to view
 on a wide meadow which without it lay
  no more of this orlando i pursue
 that bore cymosco's thunderbolt away
 and this had in the deepest bottom drowned
 that never more the mischief might be found

 xxii
 but with small boot for the impious enemy
 of human nature taught the bolt to frame
 after the shaft which darting from the sky
 pierces the cloud and comes to ground in flame
 who when he tempted eve to eat and die
 with the apple hardly wrought more scathe and shame
 some deal before or in our grandsires' day
 guided a necromancer where it lay

 xxiii
 more than a hundred fathom buried so
 where hidden it had lain a mighty space
 the infernal tool by magic from below
 was fished and born amid the german race
 who by one proof and the other taught to know
 its powers and he who plots for our disgrace
 the demon working on their weaker wit
 as last upon its fatal purpose hit

 xxiv
 to italy and france on every hand
 the cruel art among all people past
 and these the bronze in hollow mould expand
 first in the furnace melted by the blast
 others the iron bore and small or grand
 fashion the various tube they pierce or cast
 and bombard gun according to its frame
 or single cannon this or double name

 xxv
 this saker culverine or falcon hight
 i hear all names the inventor has bestowed
 which splits or shivers steel and stone outright
 and where the bullet passes makes a road
  down to the sword restore thy weapons bright
 sad soldier to the forge a useless load
 and gun or carbine on thy shoulder lay
 who without these i wot shalt touch no pay

 xxvi
 how foul and pestilent discovery
 didst thou find place within the human heart
 through thee is martial glory lost through thee
 the trade of arms became a worthless art
 and at such ebb are worth and chivalry
 that the base often plays the better part
 through thee no more shall gallantry no more
 shall valour prove their prowess as of yore

 xxvii
 through thee alas are dead or have to die
 so many noble lords and cavaliers
 before this war shall end which italy
 afflicting most has drowned the world in tears
 that if i said the word i err not i
 saying he sure the cruellest appears
 and worst of nature's impious and malign
 who did this hateful engine first design

 xxviii
 and i shall think in order to pursue
 the sin for ever god has doomed to hell
 that cursed soul amid the unhappy crew
 beside the accursed judas there to dwell
 but follow we the good orlando who
 so burns to seek ebuda's island fell
 whose foul inhabitants a monster sate
 with flesh of women fair and delicate

 xxix
 but no less slow than eager was the knight
 the winds appear which still his course delay
 who whether blowing on the left or right
 or poop so faintly in his canvas play
 his bark makes little speed and spent outright
 the breeze which wafts her sometimes dies away
 or blows so foul that he is fain to steer
 another course or to the leeward veer

 xxx
 it was the will of heaven that he before
 the king of ireland should not reach the land
 the he with greater ease upon that shore
 might act what shortly you shall understand
 "make for the isle now" said he "may'st thou moor"
 thus issuing to the pilot his command
 "and give me for my need the skiff for i
 will to the rock without more company

 xxxi
 "the biggest cable that thou hast aboard
 and biggest anchor to my hands consign
 thou shalt perceive why thus my boat is stored
 if i but meet that monster of the brine"
 he bade them lower the pinnace overboard
 with all things that befitted his design
 his arms he left behind except his blade
 and singly for the rocky island made

 xxxii
 home to his breast the count pulls either oar
 with the island at his back to which he wends
 in guise that crawling up the sandy shore
 the crooked crab from sea or marsh ascends
 it was the hour aurora gay before
 the rising sun her yellow hair extends
 his orb as yet halfseen halfhid from sight
 not without stirring jealous tithon's spite

 xxxiii
 approaching to the naked rock as near
 as vigorous hand might serve to cast a stone
 he knew not if he heard or did not hear
 a cry so faint and feeble was the moan
 when turning to the left the cavalier
 his level sight along the water thrown
 naked as born bound to a stump espied
 a dame whose feet were wetted by the tide

 xxxiv
 because she distant is and evermore
 holds down her face he ill can her discern
 both sculls he pulls amain and nears the shore
 with keen desire more certain news to learn
 but now the winding beach is heard to roar
 and wood and cave the mighty noise return
 the billows swell and lo the beast who pressed
 and nigh concealed the sea beneath his breast

 xxxv
 as cloud from humid vale is seen to rise
 pregnant with rain and storm which seems withal
 to extinguished day and charged with deeper dyes
 than night to spread throughout this earthly ball
 so swims the beast who so much occupies
 of sea he may be said to keep it all
 waves roar collected in himself the peer
 looks proudly on unchanged in heart and cheer

 xxxvi
 he as one well resolved in his intent
 moved quickly to perform the feat he planned
 and for he would the damsel's harm prevent
 and would with that assail the beast at hand
 between her and the orc the boat he sent
 leaving within the sheath his idle brand
 anchor and cable next he takes in hold
 and waits the foe with constant heart and bold

 xxxvii
 as soon as him the monster has descried
 and skiff at little interval his throat
 the fish to swallow him expands so wide
 that horse and horseman through his jaws might float
 here roland with the anchor and beside
 unless i am mistaken with the boat
 plunged and engulphed the parted teeth betwixt
 his anchor in the tongue and palate fixt

 xxxviii
 so that the monster could no longer drop
 or raise his horrid jaws which this extends
 'tis thus who digs the mine is wont to prop
 the ground and where he works the roof suspends
 lest sudden ruin whelm him from atop
 while he incautiously his task intends
 roland so far apart was either hook
 but by a leap could reach the highest crook

 xxxix
 the prop so placed orlando now secure
 that the fell beast his mouth no more can close
 unsheathes his sword and in that cave obscure
 deals here and there now thrusts now trenchant blows
 as well as citadel whose walls immure
 the assailants can defend her from her foes
 the monster harassed by the war within
 defends himself against the paladin

 xl
 now floats the monstrous beast o'ercome with pain
 whose scaly flanks upon the waves expand
 and now descends into the deepest main
 scowers at the bottom and stirs up the sand
 the rising flood ill able to sustain
 the cavalier swims forth and makes for land
 he leaves the anchor fastened in his tongue
 and grasps the rope which from the anchor hung

 xli
 so swimming till the island is attained
 with this towards the rock orlando speeds
 he hawls the anchor home a footing gained
 pricked by whose double fluke the monster bleeds
 the labouring orc to follow is constrained
 dragged by that force which every force exceeds
 which at a single sally more achieves
 than at ten turns the circling windlass heaves

 xlii
 as a wild bull about whose horn is wound
 the unexpected noose leaps here and there
 when he has felt the cord and turns him round
 and rolls and rises yet slips not the snare
 so from his pleasant seat and ancient bound
 dragged by that arm and rope he cannot tear
 with thousands of strange wheels and thousand slides
 the monster follows where the cable guides

 xliii
 this the red sea with reason would be hight
 today such streams of blood have changed its hue
 and where the monster lashed it in his spite
 the eye its bottom through the waves might view
 and now he splashed the sky and dimmed the light
 of the clear sun so high the water flew
 the noise reechoing round the distant shore
 and wood and hill rebound the deafening roar

 xliv
 forth from his grotto aged proteus hies
 and mounts above the surface at the sound
 and having seen orlando dive and rise
 from the orc and drag the monstrous fish to ground
 his scattered flock forgot o'er ocean flies
 while so the din increases that astound
 neptune bids yoke his dolphins and that day
 for distant aethiopia posts away

 xlv
 with melicerta on her shoulders weeping
 ino and nereids with dishevelled hair
 the glauci tritons and their fellows leaping
 they know not whither speed some here some there
 orlando draws to land the billows sweeping
 that horrid fish but might his labour spare
 for with the torment worn and travel sore
 the brute exhausted died ere dragged ashore

 xlvi
 of the islanders had trooped no petty throng
 to witness that strange fight who by a vain
 and miserable superstition stung
 esteemed such holy deed a work profane
 and said that this would be another wrong
 to proteus and provoke his ire again
 make him his herds pour forth upon the strand
 and with the whole old warfare vex the land

 xlvii
 and that it better were to sue for peace
 first from the injured god lest worse ensue
 and proteus from his cruel hate would cease
 if they into the sea the offender threw
 as torch to torch gives fire and lights increase
 until the flame is spread the country through
 even so from heart to heart the fury spread
 which in the waves would doom orlando dead

 xlviii
 these armed with sling or bow upon the shore
 and these supplied with spear or sword descend
 and on each side behind him and before
 distant and near as best they can offend
 at such a brutal insult wonders sore
 the peer who sees that mischief they intend
 in vengeance for the cruel monster slain
 whence he had glory hoped and praise to gain

 xlix
 but as the usage is of surly bear
 by sturdy russ or lithuanian led
 little to heed the dogs in crowded fair
 nor even at their yelps to turn his head
 the clamour of the churls assembled there
 orlando witnessed with as little dread
 who knew that he the rout which threatened death
 had power to scatter at a single breath

 l
 and speedily he made them yield him place
 when turned on them he grasped his trenchant blade
 misjudging of his worth the foolish race
 deemed that he would have short resistance made
 since him they saw no covering buckler brace
 uncuirassed nor in other arms arrayed
 but knew not that from head to foot a skin
 more hard than diamond cased the paladin

 li
 what by orlando others cannot do
 the knight by others can at half a score
 of blows in all he thirty killed by few
 he passed that measure if the strokes were more
 and had already turned him to undo
 the naked lady having cleared the shore
 when other larum sounds and other cries
 from a new quarter of the island rise

 lii
 while so the paladin had kept in play
 the barbarous islanders upon that hand
 the men of ireland without let or fray
 had poured from many quarters on the strand
 and now without remorse or pity slay
 the inhabitants through all the wasted land
 and was it justice moved or cruel rage
 slaughter without regard to sex or age

 liii
 little or no defender the islandcrew
 attempt in part as taken unaware
 in part that in the little place are few
 and that those few without a purpose are
 'mid sack and fire the wasted country through
 the islanders are slain and everwhere
 the walls are upon earth in ruin spread
 nor in the land is left a living head

 liv
 as if the mighty tumult which he hears
 and shriek and ruin had concerned him nought
 the naked rock the bold orlando nears
 where she was placed to feed the monster brought
 he looks and known to him the dame appears
 and more appears when nigher her he sought
 olympia she appears and is indeed
 olympia whose faith reaped so ill a meed

 lv
 wretched olympia whom beside the scorn
 which love put on her fortune too pursued
 who sent the corsairs fell which her had born
 that very day to the island of ebude
 she roland recollects on his return
 landward but for the damsel naked stood
 not only nought she to the warrior said
 but dared not raise her eyes and dropt her head

 lvi
 orlando asks what evil destiny
 her to that cruel island had conveyed
 from where she in as much felicity
 was with her consort left as could be said
 "i know not cried the weeping dame if i
 have thanks to render thee for death delayed
 or should lament me that through means of thee
 this day did not my woes concluded see

 lvii
 "i have to thank thee that from death too dread
 and monstrous thy good arm deliverance gave
 which would have been too monstrous had i fed
 the beast and in his belly found a grave
 but cannot thank thee that i am not dead
 since death alone can me from misery save
 well shall i thank thee for that wished relief
 which can deliver me from every grief"

 lviii
 next she related with loud sobs and sighs
 how her false spouse betrayed her as she lay
 asleep and how of pirates made the prize
 they bore her from the desert isle away
 and as she spake she turned her in the guise
 of dian framed by artists who pourtray
 her carved or painted as in liquid font
 she threw the water in actaeon's front

 lix
 for as she can her waist she hides and breast
 more liberal of flowing flank and reins
 roland desires his ship to find a vest
 to cover her delivered from her chains
 while he is all intent upon this quest
 oberto comes oberto he that reigns
 o'er ireland's people who had understood
 how lifeless lay the monster of the flood

 lx
 and swimming how amid the watery roar
 a knight a weighty anchor in his throat
 had fix'd and so had dragged him to the shore
 as men against the current track a boat
 this while oberto comes who if his lore
 who told the tale were true desires to note
 while his invading army far and wide
 ebuda burn and waste on every side

 lxi
 oberto though the paladin to sight
 was dripping and with water foul and gore
 with gore that from the orc emerged to light
 whom he had entered bodily he bore
 he for the country knew the stranger knight
 as he perused his face so much the more
 that he had thought when told the tidings none
 save roland could such mighty fear have done

 lxii
 knew him because a page of honour he
 had been in france and for the crown his right
 upon his father's death had crossed the sea
 the year before so often he the knight
 had seen and had with him held colloquy
 their times of meeting had been infinite
 he doffed his casque with festive welcome pressed
 towards the count and clasped him to the breast

 lxiii
 orlando is no less rejoined to see
 the king than is the king that champion true
 after with friendly cheer and equal glee
 had once or twice embraced the noble two
 to oberto roland told the treachery
 which had been done the youthful dame and who
 had done it  false bireno  that among
 all men should least have sought to do her wrong

 lxiv
 to him he told the many proofs and clear
 by which the dame's affection had been tried
 and how she for bireno kin and geer
 had lost and would in fine for him have died
 and how he this could warrant and appear
 to vouch for much as witness on her side
 while thus to him her griefs orlando showed
 the lady's shining eyes with tears o'erflowed

 lxv
 her face was such as sometimes in the spring
 we see a doubtful sky when on the plain
 a shower descends and the sun opening
 his cloudy veil looks out amid the rain
 and as the nightingale then loves to sing
 from branch of verdant stem her dulcet strain
 so in her beauteous tears his pinions bright
 love bathes rejoicing in the chrystal light

 lxvi
 the stripling heats his golden arrow's head
 at her bright eyes then slacks the weapon's glow
 in streams which falls between white flowers and red
 and the shaft tempered strongly draws his bow
 and roves at him o'er whom no shield is spread
 nor iron rind nor double mail below
 who gazing on her tresses eyes and brow
 feels that his heart is pierced he knows not how

 lxvii
 olympia's beauties are of those most rare
 nor is the forehead's beauteous curve alone
 excellent and her eyes and cheeks and hair
 mouth nose and throat and shoulders but so down
 descending from the lady's bosom fair
 parts which are wont to be concealed by gown
 are such as haply should be placed before
 whate'er this ample world contains in store

 lxviii
 in whiteness they surpassed unsullied snow
 smooth ivory to the touch above were seen
 two rounding paps like newpressed milk in show
 freshtaken from its crate of rushes green
 the space betwixt was like the valley low
 which oftentimes we see small hills between
 sweet in its season and now such as when
 winter with snows has newly filled the glen

 lxix
 the swelling hips and haunches' symmetry
 the waist more clear than mirror's polished grain
 and members seem of phidias' turnery
 or work of better hand and nicer pain
 as well to you of other parts should i
 relate which she to hide desired in vain
 to sum the beauteous whole from head to feet
 in her all loveliness is found complete

 lxx
 and had she in the idaean glen unveiled
 in ancient days before the phrygian swain
 by how much heavenly venus had prevailed
 i know not though her rivals strove in vain
 nor haply had the youth for sparta sailed
 to violate the hospitable reign
 but said "with menelaus let helen rest
 no other prize i seek of this possest"

 lxxi
 or in crotona dwelt where the divine
 zeuxis in days of old his work projected
 to be the ornament of juno's shrine
 and hence so many naked dames collected
 and in one form perfection to combine
 some separate charm from this or that selected
 he from no other model need have wrought
 since joined in her were all the charms he sought

 lxxii
 i do not think bireno ever viewed
 naked that beauteous form for sure it were
 he never could have been so stern of mood
 as to have left her on that desert lair
 that ireland's king was fired i well conclude
 nor hid the flame that he within him bare
 he strives to comfort her and hope instill
 that future good shall end her present ill

 lxxiii
 and her to holland promises to bear
 and vows till she is to her state restored
 and just and memorable vengeance there
 achieved upon her perjured traitor lord
 he never will unceasing war forbear
 waged with all means that ireland can afford
 and this with all his speed he up and down
 meantime bids seek for female vest and gown

 lxxiv
 now will it need to send in search of vest
 beyond the savage island's narrow bound
 since thither every day in such came dressed
 some dame to feed the beast from countries round
 nor long his followers there pursued the quest
 ere many they of various fashions found
 so was olympia clothed while sad of mood
 was he not so to clothe her as he wou'd

 lxxv
 but never silk so choice or gold so fine
 did the industrious florentine prepare
 nor whosoever broiders gay design
 though on his task be spent time toil and care
 nor lemnos' god nor pallas' art divine
 form raiment worthy of those limbs so fair
 that king oberto cannot choose but he
 recalls them at each turn to memory

 lxxvi
 to see that love so kindled by the dame
 on many grounds orlando was content
 who not alone rejoiced that such a shame
 put upon her bireno should repent
 but that in the design on which he came
 he should be freed from grave impediment
 not for olympia thither had he made
 but were his lady there to lend her aid

 lxxvii
 to him that there she was not soon was clear
 but clear it was not if she had been there
 or no since of those islesmen far and near
 one was not left the tidings to declare
 the following day they from the haven steer
 and all united in one squadron fare
 the paladin with them to ireland hies
 from whence to france the warrior's passage lies

 lxxviii
 scarcely a day in ireland's realm he spends
 and for no prayers his purposed end forbore
 love that in quest of his liegelady sends
 the knight upon this track permits no more
 departing he olympia recommends
 to the irish monarch who to serve her swore
 although this needed not since he was bent
 more than behoved her wishes to content

 lxxix
 so levied in few days his warlike band
 and league with england's kind and scotland's made
 in holland and in friesland left no land
 to the false duke so rapid was the raid
 and to rebel against that lord's command
 his zealand stirred nor he the war delayed
 until by him bireno's blood was spilt
 a punishment that ill atoned his guilt

 lxxx
 oberto takes to wife olympia fair
 and her of countess makes a puissant queen
 but be the paladin again our care
 who furrows  night and day the billows green
 and strikes his sails in the same harbour where
 they to the wind erewhile unfurled had been
 all armed he on his brigliadoro leaps
 and leaves behind him winds and briny deeps

 lxxxi
 the remnant of the winter he with shield
 and spear achieved things worthy to be shown
 i ween but these were then so well concealed
 it is no fault of mine they are not blown
 for good orlando was in fighting field
 prompter to do than make his prowess known
 nor e'er was bruited action of the knight
 save when some faithful witness was in sight

 lxxxii
 that winter's remnant he so passed that feat
 of his was known not to the public ear
 but when within that animal discreet
 which phryxus bore the sun illumed the sphere
 and zephyrus returning glad and sweet
 brought back with him again the blooming year
 the wondrous deeds orlando did in stower
 appeared with the new grass and dainty flower

 lxxxiii
 from plain to hill from champaign flat to shore
 oppressed with grief and pain the county fares
 when a long cry entering a forest hoar
  a load lamenting smites upon his ears
 he grasps his brand and spurs his courser sore
 and swiftly pricks toward the sound he hears
 but i shall at another season say
 what chanced and may be heard in future lay


 canto 12

 argument
 orlando full of rage pursues a knight
 who bears by force his ladylove away
 and comes where old atlantes by his sleight
 had raised a dome rogero there to stay
 here too rogero comes where getting sight
 of his lost love the county strives in fray
 with fierce ferrau and after slaughter fell
 amid the paynim host finds isabel


 i
 ceres when from the idaean dame in haste
 returning to the lonely valley where
 enceladus the aetnaean mountain placed
 on his boltsmitten flanks is doomed to bear
 her girl she found not on that pathless waste
 by her late quitted having rent her hair
 and marked cheeks eyes and breast with livid signs
 at the end of her lament tore up two pines

 ii
 and lit at vulcan's fire the double brand
 and gave them virtue never to be spent
 and afterwards with one in either hand
 drawn by two dragons in her chariot went
 searching the forest hill and level land
 field valley running stream or water pent
 the land and sea and having searched the shell
 of earth above descended into hell

 iii
 had roland of eleusis' deity
 the sovereign power possessed no less than will
 he for angelica had land and sea
 ransacked and wood and field and pool and rill
 heaven and oblivion's bottom but since he
 had not his pressing purpose to fulfil
 her dragon and her car the unwearied knight
 pursued the missing maid as best he might

 iv
 through france he sought her and will seek her through
 the realms of italy and of almayn
 and thence through the castiles both old and new
 so passing into libya out of spain
 while bold orlando has this plan in view
 he hears or thinks he hears a voice complain
 he forward spurs and sees on mighty steed
 a warrior trot before him on the mead

 v
 who in his arms a captive damsel bears
 sore grieving and across the pommel laid
 she weeps and struggles and the semblance wears
 of cruel woe and ever calls for aid
 upon anglantes' prince and now appears
 to him as he surveys the youthful maid
 she for whom night and day with ceaseless pain
 inside and out he france had searched in vain

 vi
 i say not is but that she to the sight
 seems the angelica he loves so dear
 he who is ladylove and goddess' flight
 beholds borne off in such afflicted cheer
 impelled by fury foul and angry spite
 calls back with horrid voice the cavalier
 calls back the cavalier and threats in vain
 and brigliadoro drives with flowing rein

 vii
 that felon stops not nor to him replies
 on his great gain intent his glorious prey
 and with such swiftness through the greenwood hies
 wind would not overtake him on his way
 the one pursues while him the other flies
 and with lament resounds the thicket gray
 they issue in a spacious mead on which
 appears a lofty mansion rare and rich

 viii
 of various marbles wrought with subtle care
 is the proud palace he who fast in hold
 bears off upon his arm the damsel fair
 sore pricking enters at a gate of gold
 nor brigliador is far behind the pair
 backed by orlando angry knight and bold
 entering around orlando turns his eyes
 yet neither cavalier nor damsel spies

 ix
 he suddenly dismounts and thundering fares
 through the inmost palace seeking still his foe
 and here and there in restless rage repairs
 till he has seen each bower each galleried row
 with the same purpose he ascends the stairs
 having first vainly searched each room below
 nor spends less labour on his task intent
 above than he beneath had vainly spent

 x
 here beds are seen adorned with silk and gold
 nor of partition aught is spied or wall
 for these and floor beneath throughout that hold
 are hid by curtains and by carpets all
 now here now there returns orlando bold
 nor yet can glad his eyes in bower or hall
 with the appearance of the royal maid
 or the foul thief by whom she was conveyed

 xi
 this while as here and there in fruitless pain
 he moves oppressed with thought and trouble sore
 gradasso brandimart and him of spain
 ferrau he finds with sacripant and more
 who ever toiling like himself in vain
 above that building and beneath explore
 and as they wander curse with one accord
 the malice of the castle's viewless lord

 xii
 all in pursuit of the offender speed
 and upon him some charge of robbery lay
 one knight complains that he has stolen his steed
 one that he has purloined his lady gay
 other accuses him of other deed
 and thus within the enchanted cage they stay
 nor can depart while in the palace pent
 many have weeks and months together spent

 xiii
 roland when he round that strange dome had paced
 four times or six still vainly seeking said
 within himself at last "i here might waste
 my time and trouble still in vain delayed
 while haply her the robber whom i chased
 has far away through other gate conveyed"
 so thinking from the house he issued out
 into the mead which girt the dome about

 xiv
 while roland wanders round the sylvan hall
 still holding close his visage to the ground
 to see if recent print or trace withal
 can right or left upon the turf be found
 he from a neighbouring window hears a call
 and looks and thinks he hears that voice's sound
 and thinks he sees the visage by which he
 was so estranged from what he wont to be

 xv
 he thinks he hears angelica and she
 "help help" entreating cries and weeping sore
 "more than for life and soul alas of thee
 protection for my honour i implore
 then shall it in my roland's presence be
 ravished by this foul robber oh before
 me to such miserable fate you leave
 let me from your own hand my death receive"

 xvi
 these words repeated once and yet again
 made roland through each chamber far and near
 return with passion and with utmost pain
 but tempered with high hope sometimes the peer
 stopt in his search and heard a voice complain
 which seemed to be angelica's if here
 the restless warrior stand it sounds from there
 and calls for help he knows not whence nor where

 xvii
 returning to rogero left i said
 when through a gloomy path upon his steed
 following the giant and the dame who fled
 he from the wood had issued on the mead
 i say that he arrived where roland dread
 arrived before him if i rightly read
 the giant through the golden portal passed
 rogero close behind who followed fast

 xviii
 as soon as he his foot has lifted o'er
 the threshold he through court and gallery spies
 nor sees the giant or the lady more
 and vainly glances here and there his eyes
 he up and down returns with labour sore
 yet not for that his longing satisfies
 nor can imagine where the felon thief
 has hid himself and dame in space so brief

 xix
 after four times or five he so had wound
 above below through bower and gallery fair
 he yet returned and having nothing found
 searched even to the space beneath the stair
 at length in hope they in the woodlands round
 might be he sallied but the voice which there
 roland recalled did him no less recall
 and made as well return within the hall

 xx
 one voice one shape which to anglantes' peer
 seemed his angelica beseeching aid
 seemed to rogero dordogne's lady dear
 who him a truant to himself had made
 if with gradasso or with other near
 he spake of those who through the palace strayed
 to all of them the vision seen apart
 seemed that which each had singly most at heart

 xxi
 this was a new and unwonted spell
 which the renowned atlantes had composed
 that in this toil this pleasing pain might dwell
 so long rogero by these walls enclosed
 from him should pass away the influence fell
  influence which him to early death exposed
 though vain his magic tower of steel and vain
 alcina's art atlantes plots again

 xxii
 not only he but others who stood high
 for valour and in france had greatest fame
 that by their hands rogero might not die
 brought here by old atlantes' magic came
 while these in the enchanted mansion lie
 that food be wanting not to knight or dame
 he has supplied the dome throughout so well
 that all the inmates there in plenty dwell

 xxiii
 but to angelica return we who
 now of that ring so wondrous repossessed
 which in her mouth concealed the maid from view
 preserved from spell when it the finger pressed
 was in the mountaincavern guided to
 whatever needed viands mare and vest
 and had conceived the project to pursue
 her way to her fair indian realm anew

 xxiv
 king sacripant or roland willingly
 the damsel would have taken for her guide
 not that propitious to their wishes she
 averse from both inclined to either side
 but since her eastern journey was to be
 through town and city scattered far and wide
 she needed company and ill had found
 more trusty guides than these for such a round

 xxv
 now this now that she sought with fruitless care
 before she lit on either warrior's trace
 by city or by farm now here now there
 in forest now and now in other place
 fortune at length where caged with roland are
 ferrau and sacripant directs her chase
 rogero with gradasso fierce and more
 noosed with strange witcheries by atlantes hoar

 xxvi
 she enters hidden from the enchanter's eyes
 and by the ring concealed examines all
 and roland there and sacripant espies
 intent to seek her vainly through the hall
 and with her image cheating both descries
 atlantes old the damsel doubts withal
 which of the two to take and long revolves
 this in her doubtful thought nor well resolves

 xxvii
 she knows not which with her will best accord
 the count orlando or circassia's knight
 as of most powers her would rogero ward
 in passage perilous with better might
 but should she make the peer her guide her lord
 she knew not if her champion she could slight
 if him she would depress with altered cheer
 or into france send back the cavalier

 xxviii
 but sacripant at pleasure could depose
 though him she had uplifted to the sky
 hence him alone she for her escort chose
 and feigned to trust in his fidelity
 the ring she from her mouth withdraws and shows
 her face unveiled to the circassian's eye
 she thought to him alone but fierce ferrau
 and roland came upon the maid and saw

 xxix
 ferrau and roland came upon the maid
 for one and the other champion equally
 within the palace and without it strayed
 in quest of her who was their deity
 and now no longer by the enchantment stayed
 each ran alike towards the dame for she
 had placed the ring upon her hand anew
 which old atlantes' every scheme o'erthrew

 xxx
 helm on the head and corselet on the breast
 of both the knights of whom i sing was tied
 by night or day since they into this rest
 had entered never doffed and laid aside
 for such to wear were easy as a vest
 to these so wont the burden to abide
 as well was armed except with iron masque
 ferrau who wore not nor would wear a casque

 xxxi
 till he had that erst wrested by the peer
 orlando from the brother of troyane
 for so had sworn the spanish cavalier
 what time he argalia's helm in vain
 sought in the brook yet though the count was near
 has not stretched forth his hand the prize to gain
 for so it was that neither of the pair
 could recognise the other knight while there

 xxxii
 upon the enchanted dome lay such a spell
 that they from one another were concealed
 they doffed not night nor day the corselet's shell
 not sword nor even put aside the shield
 saddled with bridle hanging at the sell
 their steeds were feeding ready for the field
 within a chamber near the palace door
 with straw and barley heaped in plenteous store

 xxxiii
 nor might nor mean in old atlantes lies
 to stop the knights from mounting who repair
 to their good steeds to chase the bright black eyes
 the fair vermillion cheeks and golden hair
 of the sweet damsel who before them flies
 and goads to better speed her panting mare
 ill pleased the three assembled to discern
 though haply she had taken each in turn

 xxxiv
 and when these from the magic palace she
 had ticed so far that she no more supposed
 the warriors to the wicked fallacy
 of the malign enchanter were exposed
 the ring which more than once from misery
 had rescued her she 'twixt her lips enclosed
 hence from their sight she vanished in a thought
 and left them wondering there like men distraught

 xxxv
 although she first the scheme had entertained
 roland or sacripant to have released
 to guide her thither where her father reigned
 king galaphron who ruled i' the farthest east
 the aid of both she suddenly disdained
 and in an instant from her project ceased
 and deemed without more debt to count or king
 in place of either knight sufficed the ring

 xxxvi
 in haste they through the forest here and there
 so scorned of her still gaze with stupid face
 like questing hound which loses sight of hare
 or fox of whom he late pursued the trace
 into close thicket ditch or narrow lair
 escaping from the keen pursuer's chase
 meantime their ways the wanton indian queen
 observes and at their wonder laughs unseen

 xxxvii
 in the mid wood where they the maid did lose
 was but a single pathway left or right
 which they believed the damsel could not choose
 but follow when she vanished from their sight
 ferrau halts not and roland fast pursues
 nor sacripant less plies the rowels bright
 angelica this while retrains her steed
 and follows the three warriors with less speed

 xxxviii
 when pricking thus they came to where the way
 was in the forest lost with wood o'ergrown
 and had begun the herbage to survey
 for print of recent footsteps up and down
 the fierce ferrau who might have borne away
 from all that ever proudest were the crown
 with evil countenance to the other two
 turned him about and shouted "whence are you"

 xxxix
 "turn back or take another road save here
 in truth you covet to be slain by me
 nor when i chase or woo my lady dear
 let any think i bear with company"
 and  "what more could he say sir cavalier"
 orlando cried to sacripant "if we
 were known for the two basest whores that pull
 and reel from spindlestaff the matted wool"

 xl
 then turning to ferrau "but that thine head
 thou brutish sot as i behold is bare
 if thy late words were ill or wisely said
 thou should'st perceive before we further fare"
 to him ferrau "for that which breeds no dread
 in me why should'st thou take such sovereign care
 what i have said unhelmed will i prove true
 here single as i am on both of you"

 xli
 "oh" to circassia's king cried roland dread
 "thy morion for this man let me entreat
 till i have driven such folly from his head
 for never with like madness did i meet"
  "who then would be most fool" the monarch said
 "but if indeed you deem the suit discreet
 lend him thine own nor shall i be less fit
 haply than thee to school his lack of wit"

 xlii
  "fools both of you" the fierce ferrau replied
 "as if did i to wear a helm delight
 you would not be without your casques of pride
 already reft by me in your despite
 but know thus much that i by vow am tied
 to wear no helm and thus my promise quite
 roaming without till that fine casque i win
 worn by orlando charles's paladin"

 xliii
  "then" smiling to the spaniard said the count
 "with naked head thou thinkest to repeat
 on roland what he did in aspramont
 by agolant's bold son but shouldst thou meet
 the warrior whom thou seekest front to front
 i warrant thou wouldst quake from head to feet
 nor only wouldst forego the casque but give
 the knight thine other arms to let thee live"

 xliv
  "so oft have i had roland on the hip
 and oft" exclaimed the boaster "heretofore
 from him it had been easy task to strip
 what other arms beside his helm he wore
 and if i still have let the occasion slip
  we sometimes think of things unwished before
 such wish i had not i have now and hope
 to compass easily my present scope"

 xlv
 the good orlando could no more forbear
 and cried "foul miscreant liar marched with me
 say caitiff in what country when and where
 boast you to have obtained such victory
 that paladin am i o'er whom you dare
 to vaunt and whom you distant deemed now see
 if you can take my helm or i have might
 to take your other arms in your despite

 xlvi
 "nor i o'er you the smallest vantage wou'd"
 he ended and his temples disarrayed
 and to a beech hung up the helmet good
 and nigh as quickly bared his trenchant blade
 ferrau stands close and in such attitude
 his courage not for what had chanced dismayed
 covered with lifted shield and naked sword
 as might best shelter to his head afford

 xlvii
 'twas thus those warriors two with faulchions bare
 turning their ready steeds began to wheel
 and where the armour thinnest was and where
 the meeting plates were joined probed steel with steel
 nor was there in the world another pair
 more fitted to be matched in fierce appeal
 equal their daring equal was their might
 and safe alike from wound was either knight

 xlviii
 by you fair sir already i presume
 that fierce ferrau was charmed is understood
 save where the child enclosed within the womb
 of the full mother takes its early food
 and hence he ever till the squalid tomb
 covered his manly face wore harness good
 such was his wont the doubtful part to guard
 of seven good plates of metal tempered hard

 xlix
 alike a charmed life orlando bore
 safe every where except a single part
 unfenced beneath his feet which evermore
 by him were guarded with all care and art
 the rest than diamond dug from mountain hoar
 more hard unless report from truth depart
 and armed to battle either champion went
 less for necessity than ornament

 l
 waxing more fierce and fell the combat rages
 of fear and horror full between the twain
 the fierce ferrau such dreadful battle wages
 that stroke or thrust is never dealt in vain
 each mighty blow from roland disengages
 and loosens breaks or shatters plate and chain
 angelica alone secure from view
 regards such fearful sight and marks the two

 li
 for during this the king of circassy
 who deemed angelica not far before
 when ferrau and orlando desperately
 closing in fight were seen his horse did gore
 along the way by which he deemed that she
 had disappeared and so that battle sore
 was witnessed 'twixt the struggling foes by none
 beside the daughter of king galaphron

 lii
 after the damsel had sometime descried
 this dread and direful combat standing nigh
 and it appearing that on either side
 with equal peril both the warriors vie
 she fond of novelty the helm untied
 designs to take desirous to espy
 what they would do when they perceived the wrong
 but without thought to keep her plunder long

 liii
 to give it to orlando was she bent
 but first she would upon the warrior play
 the helmet she took down with this intent
 and in her bosom hid and marked the fray
 next thence without a word to either went
 and from the scene of strife was far away
 ere either of the two had marked the feat
 so were they blinded by their angry heat

 liv
 but ferrau who first chanced the loss to see
 from roland disengaged himself and cried
 "how like unwary men and fools are we
 treated by him who late with us did ride
 what meed which worthiest of the strife might be
 if this be stolen the victor shall abide"
 roland draws back looks upward and with ire
 missing the noble casque is all on fire

 lv
 and in opinion with ferrau agreed
 that he the knight who was with them before
 had born away the prize hence turned his steed
 and with the spur admonished brigliador
 ferrau who from the field beheld him speed
 followed him and when roland and the moor
 arrived where tracks upon the herbage green
 of the circassian and the maid were seen

 lvi
 towards a vale upon the left the count
 went off pursuing the circassian's tread
 the spaniard kept the path more nigh the mount
 by which the fair angelica had fled
 angelica this while has reached a fount
 of pleasant site and shaded overhead
 by whose inviting shades no traveller hasted
 nor ever left the chrystal wave untasted

 lvii
 angelica the sylvan spring beside
 reposes unsuspicious of surprise
 and thinking her the sacred ring will hide
 fears not that evil accident can rise
 on her arrival at the fountain's side
 she to a branch above the helmet ties
 then seeks the fittest sapling for her need
 where fastened to its trunk her mare may feed

 lviii
 the spanish cavalier the stream beside
 arrived who had pursued her traces there
 angelica no sooner him espied
 than she evanished clean and spurred her mare
 the helm this while had dropt but lay too wide
 to be recovered of the flying fair
 as soon as sweet angelica he saw
 towards her full of rapture sprang ferrau

 lix
 she disappeared i say as forms avaunt
 at sleep's departure toiling long and sore
 he seeks the damsel there 'twixt plant and plant
 now can his wretched eyes behold her more
 blaspheming his mahound and termagant
 and cursing every master of his lore
 ferrau returned towards the sylvan fount
 where lay on earth the helmet of the count

 lx
 this he soon recognised for here he read
 letters upon the margin written fair
 which how orlando won the helmet said
 and from what champion took and when and where
 with it the paynim armed his neck and head
 who would not for his grief the prize forbear
 his grief for loss of her conveyed from sight
 as disappear the phantoms of the night

 lxi
 when in this goodly casque he was arrayed
 he deemed nought wanting to his full content
 but the discovery of the royal maid
 who like a flash of lightning came and went
 for her he searches every greenwood shade
 and when all hope of finding her is spent
 he for the vain pursuit no longer tarries
 but to the spanish camp returns near paris

 lxii
 tempering the grief which glowed within his breast
 for such sore disappointment with the thought
 that he was with orlando's morion blest
 as sworn by good anglante's count when taught
 that the false saracen the prize possest
 long time the spanish knight was vainly sought
 nor roland took the helmet from his head
 till he between two bridges laid him dead

 lxiii
 angelica thus viewless and alone
 speeds on her journey but with troubled front
 grieved for the helmet in her haste foregone
 on her departure from the grassy fount
 "choosing to do what i should least have done"
 she said "i took his helmet from the count
 this for his first desert i well bestow
 a worthy recompense for all i owe

 lxiv
 "with good intentions as god knows i wrought
 though these an ill and different end produce
 i took the helmet only with the thought
 to bring that deadly battle to a truce
 and not that this foul spaniard what he sought
 should gain or i to his intent conduce"
 so she lamenting took herself to task
 for having robbed orlando of his casque

 lxv
 by what appeared to her the meetest way
 moody and illcontent she eastward pressed
 ofttimes concealed sometimes in face of day
 as seemed most opportune and pleased her best
 after much country seen a forest gray
 she reached where sorely wounded in mid breast
 between two dead companions on the ground
 the royal maid a bleeding stripling found

 lxvi
 but of angelica i now no more
 shall speak who first have many things to say
 nor shall to the circassian or the moor
 give for long space a rhyme thence called away
 by good anglante's prince who wills before
 i of those others tell i should display
 the labours and the troubles he sustained
 pursuing the great good he never gained

 lxvii
 at the first city whither he was brought
 because to go concealed he had good care
 he a new helmet donned but took no thought
 what was the headpiece he designed to bear
 so safe is he in fairy spell it nought
 imports if hard or soft its temper were
 orlando covered thus pursues the quest
 nor him day night or rain or sun arrest

 lxviii
 it was the hour that our of ocean's bed
 dan phoebus drew his dripping steeds and high
 and low still scattering yellow flowers and red
 aurora stained the heavens with various dye
 and stars had cast their veils about their head
 departing from their revels in the sky
 when passing on a day fair paris near
 orlando made his mighty worth appear

 lxix
 two squadrons he encountered one an old
 saracen manilardo clept obeyed
 king of noritia whilom fierce and bold
 but fitter now to counsel than to aid
 the next beneath the standard was enrolled
 or tremisena's monarch who was said
 'mid africans to be a perfect knight
 alzirdo he by those who knew him hight

 lxx
 these with the other saracen array
 cantoned throughout the winter months had lain
 some near the city some more far away
 all lodged nigh town or hamlet on the plain
 for since king agramant had many a day
 spent in attacking paris' walls in vain
 he for no other means remained to try
 would lastly with a siege the city ply

 lxxi
 and to do this had people infinite
 since he beside the host that with him came
 and that of spain which followed to the fight
 the spanish king marsilius' oriflame
 many of france did in his pay unite
 for all from paris he to arles's stream
 with part of gascony some straggling tower
 excepted had reduced beneath his power

 lxxii
 the quivering brook as warmer breezes blew
 beginning now from ice its waves to free
 and the freshspringing grass and foliage new
 to cloathe again the field and greenwood tree
 all those king agramant assembled who
 had followed him in his prosperity
 to muster in review the armed swarm
 and give to his affairs a better form

 lxxiii
 hence did the king of tremisen' repair
 with him who had noritia in command
 to be in time at that full muster where
 each squadron good or bad was to be scanned
 orlando thus by chance encountered there
 as i have told you this united hand
 who as his usage was went seeking her
 by whom he had been made love's prisoner

 lxxiv
 alzirdo as the approaching count he eyes
 who in this world for valour has no peer
 with such a haughty front and in such guise
 the god of war would less in arms appear
 the features known before astounded spies
 the fierce disdainful glance and furious cheer
 and him esteems a knight of prowess high
 which fondly he too sore desires to try

 lxxv
 arrogant young and of redoubted force
 alzirdo was and prized for dauntless mind
 who bent to joust pricked forth his foaming horse
 happier had he remained in line behind
 met by anglante's prince in middle course
 who pierced his heart as they encountering joined
 frighted the lightened courser scoured the plain
 without a rider to direct the rein

 lxxvi
 rises a sudden and a horrid cry
 and air on every side repeats the scream
 as his scared band the falling youth descry
 and issuing from his wound so wide a stream
 disordered they the count in fury ply
 and raised to cut or thrust their weapons gleam
 against that flower of knights their feathered reeds
 a thicker squadron yet in tempest speeds

 lxxvii
 with sound like that with which from hill repair
 or from the champaign's flat the hurrying swine
 if the wolf issue from his grot or bear
 descending to the mountains' lower line
 some bristly youngling take away and tear
 who with loud squeal and grunt is heard to pine
 came driving at the count the barbarous rout
 "upon him" and "upon him" still their shout

 lxxviii
 at once spears shafts and swords his corslet bore
 by thousands and as many pierce his shield
 this threatens on one side and that before
 and those the ponderous mace behind him wield
 but he esteems the craven rout no more
 he who did never yet to terror yield
 than hungry wolf in twilight makes account
 to what the number of the flock may mount

 lxxix
 he held unsheathed that thundering sword in hand
 which with so many foes has heaped the plain
 that he who thinks to count the slaughtered band
 has undertaken hard emprize and vain
 the road ran red ensanguined by his brand
 and scarce capacious of the many slain
 for neither targe nor headpiece good defends
 where fatal durindana's blade descends

 lxxx
 nor safety cotton vest nor cloths supply
 in thousand folds about the temples spread
 nor only groan and lamentation fly
 through air but shoulder arm and severed head
 death roams the field in strange variety
 of horrid forms and all inspiring dread
 and says "for hundreds of my scythes may stand
 his durindana in orlando's hand"

 lxxxi
 his ceaseless strokes scarce one the other wait
 speedily all his foemen are in flight
 and when before they came at furious rate
 they hoped to swallow quick the single knight
 none is there who in that unhappy straight
 stops for his comrade flying from the fight
 here one man speeds afoot one gallops there
 none stays to question if the road be fair

 lxxxii
 his mirror valour bore about and here
 each blemish of the soul was seen confest
 none looked therein except an aged peer
 whose blood was chilled but courage unreprest
 that death were better deems this cavalier
 than life in flight and in disgrace possest
 i mean noritia's king who lays his lance
 in rest against the paladin of france

 lxxxiii
 he broke it on the border of the shield
 of the intrepid count with stedfast hand
 who by the stroke unshaken nothing reeled
 and smote the king in passing with his brand
 him fortune saved for as orlando wheeled
 the blade it turned descending in his hand
 although anedge he guides not still the sword
 stunned from his saddle reels the paynim lord

 lxxxiv
 astounded from his saddle reels the king
 nor him orlando turns about to see
 he cuts and cleaves and slays his following
 who all believe him at their backs to be
 as through the spacious air with troubled wing
 the starlings from the daring merlin flee
 so of that broken squadron scattered round
 some fly some dip and some fall flat to ground

 lxxxv
 he ceased not his ensanguined blade to sway
 till living wight remained not in his view
 orlando doubted to resume his way
 although the country all about he knew
 does he the right or lefthand road assay
 his thoughts still rove from what his steps pursue
 and he to seek the damsel is in dread
 through other path than that by which she fled

 lxxxvi
 through wood and field his courser did he goad
 often inquiring for the royal dame
 beside himself he strayed beside his road
 and to the foot of rising mountain came
 whence it was nighttime through a fissure glowed
 the distant flicker of a quivering flame
 orlando to the rock approached to spy
 if there angelica concealed might lie

 lxxxvii
 as where low junipers o'er shade her lair
 or in the stubble of the open lay
 what time the hunters seek the fearful hare
 through traversed woods and through uncertain way
  lest peradventure she be hidden there
 they every bramble every bush assay
 even so where hope the toiling warrior leads
 searching his ladylove orlando speeds

 lxxxviii
 pricking in haste towards that ray the count
 arrived where in the wood the light was shed
 forthstreaming from a crevice in the mount
 within whose womb a spacious grotto spread
 and there like wall or bank discerned in front
 of thorns and underwood a bristly bed
 to hide the grotto's inmates and defend
 from scathe or scorn which others might intend

 lxxxix
 by day it had been hidden evermore
 but the clear flame betrayed the haunt by night
 its use he guessed but would the place explore
 and better certify himself by sight
 when he without had tied his brigliador
 in silence to the grotto stole the knight
 threading the shrubs nor calling for a guide
 entered the passage in the mountain's side

 xc
 by a long flight of steps was the descent
 into the cave where in the rocky tomb
 buried were living folk of wide extent
 the grot was chiselled into vaulted room
 nor was although its entrance little lent
 all daylight wanting to disperse the gloom
 for much was furnished by a window dight
 within a natural fissure on the right

 xci
 in the mid cave beside a fire was seen
 a gentle maid of pleasing look and guise
 who seemed to roland little past fifteen
 as far as at first sight he might surmise
 with that so fair she made the rugged scene
 seem in the warrior's sight a paradise
 although this while her eyes with tears o'erflow
 clear tokens of a heart oppressed with woe

 xcii
 an aged dame was with her and the pair
 wrangled as oftentimes is women's way
 but when the county was descending there
 concluded the dispute and wordy fray
 orlando hastens to salute them fair
 as still is due to womankind and they
 to welcome him rise lightly form their seat
 and with benign return the warrior greet

 xciii
 'tis true that when that sudden voice they hear
 somedeal confused in look they seem to be
 at the same time beholding thus appear
 so fierce a wight and harnessed capapee
 "what wight" demands anglantes' cavalier
 so barbarous is and void of courtesy
 that he keeps buried in this rude repair
 a face so gentle and so passing fair"

 xciv
 with pain the virgin to the count replies
 as he inquires of her unhappy doom
 in sweet and broken accents which by sighs
 impelled through rows of pearl and coral come
 and between rose and lily from her eyes
 tears fall so fast she needs must swallow some
 in other canto sir be pleased to attend
 the rest for here 'tis time my strain should end


 canto 13

 argument
 the count orlando of the damsel bland
 who loves zerbino hears the piteous woes
 next puts to death the felons with his hand
 who pent her there duke aymon's daughter goes
 seeking rogero where so large a band
 the old atlantes' magic walls enclose
 her he impounds deceived by fictions new
 agramant ranks his army for review


 i
 those ancient cavaliers right happy were
 born in an age when in the gloomy wood
 in valley and in cave wherein the bear
 serpent or lion hid their savage brood
 they could find that which now in palace rare
 is hardly found by judges proved and good
 women to wit who in their freshest days
 of beauty worthily deserve the praise

 ii
 above i told you how a gentle maid
 orlando had discovered under ground
 and asked by whom she thither was conveyed
 pursuing now my tale i tell how drowned
 in grief her speech by many a sob delayed
 the damsel fair in sweet and softest sound
 summing them with what brevity she might
 her ills recounted to anglantes' knight

 iii
 "though i am sure" she said "o cavalier
 to suffer punishment for what i say
 because i know to him who pens me here
 this woman quickly will the fact display
 i would not but thou shouldst the story hear
  and let my wretched life the forfeit pay
 for what can wait me better than that he
 my gaoler should one day my death decree

 iv
 "lo i am isabel who once was styled
 the daughter of gallicia's hapless king
 i said aright who was but now the child
 no longer his of care and suffering
 the fault of love by whom i was beguiled
 for against him alone this charge i bring
 who sweetly at the first our wish applauds
 and weaves in secret but deceit and frauds

 v
 "whilom i lived content in fortune's smile
 rich blameless fair and young to sad reverse
 condemned i now am wretched poor and vile
 and in worse case if any yet be worse
 but it is fitting i to thee this while
 from their first root my troubles should rehearse
 and it will soothe me though of thee i borrow
 no help that thou compassionate my sorrow

 vi
 "my father in his city of bayonne
 today will be twelve months a tourney dight
 hence led by spreading rumour to our town
 to joust from different lands came many a knight
 mid these was it his manifest renown
 or was it love which so deceived my sight
 praise in my eyes alone zerbino won
 who was the mighty king of scotland's son

 vii
 "when him i after in the field espied
 performing wondrous feats of chivalry
 i was surprised by love ere i descried
 that freedom in my love so rash a guide
 i lay this unction to my phantasy
 that no unseemly place my heart possest
 fixed on the worthiest in the world and best

 viii
 "in beauty and in valour's boast above
 those other lords the scottish prince stood high
 he showed me and i think be bore me love
 and left no less an ardent flame than i
 nor lacked there one who did between us move
 to speak our common wishes frequently
 so could we still in heart and mind unite
 although disjoined from one another's sight

 ix
 "hence when concluded was the festal show
 and to his home zerbino was returned
 if thou know'st what is love thou well may'st know
 how night and day i for the warrior yearned
 and was assured no less on him did prey
 the flame that in his constant bosom burned
 he save a way to have me with him nought
 for solace of his restless passion sought

 x
 "for different faith forbade him on my side
 i was a saracen a christian he
 to ask me of my father as a bride
 by stealth he purposed to elope with me
 amid green fields our wealthy town beside
 i had a garden seated by the sea
 upon the pleasant shore from whence the eye
 might ocean and the hills about descry

 xi
 "a fitting place to effect what different creed
 and law forbade us he esteemed this site
 and showed the order taken for the deed
 which was to make our future life's delight
 and how near santa martha for our need
 a bark was with arm'd men in ambush dight
 under sir odoric of biscay's command
 a leader he approved by sea and land

 xii
 "unable in his person this to do
 for by his father he was forced to wend
 in succour of the king of france in lieu
 this odoric for the purpose he would send
 chosen of all his faithful friends and true
 as his most faithful and his truest friend
 and such had been if benefits could bind
 and goodly deeds the friendship of mankind

 xiii
 "at the time fixed to bear me thence away
 this chief would anchor on the destined ground
  and thus it was arrived the wished for day
 then i of them was in my garden found
 sir odoric at night with fair array
 of valiant men by land and sea renowned
 in the near river from his bark descends
 and thence in silence to my garden wends

 xiv
 "to the pitched bark with me his party sped
 before the city knew what was at hand
 some of the house disarmed and naked fled
 and some were slain while of the helpless band
 with me another part was captive led
 so was i severed from my native land
 hoping in brief zerbino to possess
 i cannot tell thee with what happiness

 xv
 "scarcely was mongia by our galley doubled
 ere a squall took us on the larboard side
 which round about the clear horizon troubled
 and stirred and tost heavenhigh the foaming tide
 smote with a northwest wind next ocean bubbled
 which on her other beam the vessel plied
 this evermore increases with such force
 starboard or larboard boots not which our course

 xvi
 "it steads not to strike sail nor lash the mast
 lowered on the gangboard nor our castles fell
 the bark in our despite is hurried fast
 towards the pointed rocks about rochelle
 save he above assist us at the last
 the cruel storm will us ashore impel
 driven thither by ill wind with mightier speed
 than ever bowstring gave to whistling reed

 xvii
 "our peril well does the biscayan note
 and tries what often has an evil end
 lowers down the galley's skiff and when afloat
 descends into it and makes me descend
 two follow and a troop would throng the boat
 did not the first prevent them and defend
 the entrance with their naked faulchions we
 sever the rope forthwith and put to sea

 xviii
 "driven landward on the shore we safely light
 who in the skiff embarked while of our band
 the rest in the split vessel sink outright
 our goods seaswallowed all upon the strand
 to eternal love to goodness infinite
 i offer up my thanks with outstretched hand
 that i was doomed not 'mid the watery roar
 to perish nor behold zerbino more

 xix
 "though i had left on shipboard matters rare
 and precious in their nature gem and vest
 so i might hope zerbino's lot to share
 i was content the sea should have the rest
 no dwelling on the beach appears nor there
 is any pathway seen by footsteps pressed
 only a hill whose woody top is beat
 by ceaseless winds the waters bathe its feet

 xx
 "here the fell tyrant love aye prompt to range
 and faithless to his every promise still
 who watches ever how he may derange
 and mar our every reasonable will
 converts with woeful and disastrous change
 my comfort to despair my good to ill
 for he in whom zerbino put his trust
 cooled in his loyal faith and burned with lust

 xxi
 "whether he his desire had nursed at sea
 and had not dared exhibit it before
 or that it sprung from opportunity
 suggested by that solitary shore
 without more pause in that lone desert he
 would sate his greedy passion but forbore
 till he of one could rid him of the twain
 who in the boat with us had scaped the main

 xxii
 "a man of scotland he almonio hight
 who to zerbino seemed great faith to bear
 and as a perfect warrior by the knight
 praised when to odoric given his trust to share
 to him the spaniard said it were a slight
 if i unto rochelle afoot should fare
 and prayed that he before would thither speed
 and forward thence some hackney for my need

 xxiii
 "almonio who in this suspects no ill
 forthwith before our party wends his way
 to the town hidden by the wooded hill
 and which not more than six miles distant lay
 to the other finally his wicked will
 sir odoric took courage to display
 as well because he could not rid him thence
 as that in him he had great confidence

 xxiv
 "he that remained with us of whom i said
 before corebo was of bilbao hight
 who with him under the same roof was bred
 from infancy and the ungrateful wight
 deemed that the thought he harboured in his head
 he could impart in safety to the knight
 who would prefer neglected of his trust
 the pleasure of his friend to what was just

 xxv
 "not without high disdain corebo heard
 who kind and courteous was the biscayneer
 and termed him traitor and by deed and word
 withstood the purpose of his foul compeer
 this mighty wrath in either warrior stirred
 in sign whereof their naked brands they rear
 at sight of their drawn swords in panic i
 turn shortly through the gloomy wood to fly

 xxvi
 "sir odoric in war well taught and bred
 gained in few blows such vantage in the fray
 he left corebo on the field for dead
 and following in my steps pursued my way
 love lent to him unless i am misled
 pinions that he might overtake his prey
 and many a prayer and glozing flattery taught
 wherewith i to compliance might be wrought

 xxvii
 "but all in vain for i was fixed and bent
 rather than sate his ill desire to die
 when menace had by him been vainly spent
 and every prayer and every flattery
 he would by open force his will content
 nor boots it aught that i entreaties try 
 of his lord's faith in him the wretch remind
 and how myself i to his hands resigned

 xxviii
 "when i perceived that fruitless was my prayer
 and that i could not hope for other aid
 for he assailed me like a famished bear
 with hands and feet i fierce resistance made
 as he more brutal waxed and plucked his hair
 and with my teeth and nails his visage flayed
 this while i vent such lamentable cries
 the clamour echoes to the starry skies

 xxix
 "were they by chance conducted or my shriek
 which might have well been heard a league around
 or was it they were wont the shore to seek
 when any vessel split or ran aground
 i saw a crowd appear upon the peak
 which to the sea descending towards us wound
 them the biscayan say and at the sight
 abandoned his design and turned to flight

 xxx
 "this rabble sir against that treacherous man
 comes to my aid but in such guise that i
 the homely saw of falling from the pan
 into the fire beneath but verify
 'tis true so lost i was not nor that clan
 accursed with minds of such iniquity
 that they to violate my person sought
 though nothing good or virtuous on them wrought

 xxxi
 "but that they knew for me preserved a maid
 as yet i am they higher price might crave
 eight months are past the ninth arrived since stayed
 by them alive i languish in this grave
 all hope is lost of my zerbino's aid
 for from their speech i gather as a slave
 i am bartered to a merchant for his gold
 by whom i to the sultan shall be sold"

 xxxii
 the gentle damsel so her tale pursues
 while sobs and sighs oft interposing break
 her soft angelic voice which might infuse
 compassion into asp or venomed snake
 what time she so her piteous grief renews
 or haply does her bitter anguish slake
 some twenty men the gloomy cavern fill
 this armed with huntingspear and that with bill

 xxxiii
 with squinting look and dark and but one eye
 the leader of the troop of brutish cheer
 was he the foremost of the company
 by a blow blinded which from nose to ear
 had cleft his jaw when he did so descry
 seated beside the maid that cavalier
 he turned about and said "lo in the net
 another bird for whom it was not set"

 xxxiv
 then to the county cried "i never knew
 a man more opportune my wants to stead
 i know not whether any one to you
 perchance may have announced my pressing need
 of such fair arms  or you conjectured true 
 as well as of that goodly sable weed
 you verily arrived in season are
 my needs pursued the losel to repair"

 xxxv
 with bitter smile upstarting on his feet
 orlando to the ruffian made reply
 "thou at a price at which no chapman treat
 unmarked in merchant's books these arms shalt buy"
 with that he snatched a brand which full of heat
 and smoke was smouldering in the chimney nigh
 threw it and smote by chance the knave half blind
 where with the nose the meeting brows confined

 xxxvi
 the brand discharged by him hit either brow
 but most severely on the left did smite
 for that ill feature perished by the blow
 which was the thief's sole minister of light
 nor is the stroke content to blind the foe
 unsated save it register his sprite
 among those damned souls whom charon keeps
 with their companions plunged in boiling deeps

 xxxvii
 a spacious table in mid cavern stood
 two palms in thickness in its figure square
 propt on one huge ill fashioned food and rude
 which held the thief and all who harboured there
 even with such freedom as his dart of wood
 we mark the nimble spaniard launch through air
 the heavy table roland seized and threw
 where crowded close together stood the crew

 xxxviii
 one had his belly crushed and one his breast
 another head or arm or leg and thigh
 whence some were slain outright and maimed the rest
 while he who was least injured sought to fly
 'tis so sometimes with heavy stone oppressed
 a knot of slimy snakes is seen to lie
 with battered heads and loins where winter done
 they lick their scales rejoicing in the sun

 xxxix
 i could not say what mischiefs these offend
 one dies and one departs without its tail
 another crippled cannot move anend
 and wriggling wreathes its length without avail
 while this whom more propitious saints befriend
 safe through the grass drags off its slimy trail
 dire was the stroke yet should no wonder breed
 since good orlando's arm achieved the deed

 xl
 those whom the board had little maimed or nought
 turpin says there were seven in craven wise
 their safety in their feet yet vainly sought
 for to the cavern's door orlando hies
 and having them without resistance caught
 fast with a rope their hands behind them ties
 a rope which in the cavern on the ground
 convenient for his purpose he had found

 xli
 he after drags them bound without the cave
 where an old servicetree its shadow throws
 orlando lops the branches with his glaive
 and hangs the thieves a banquet for the crows
 nor chain and crook for such a deed did crave
 for ready hooks the tree itself bestows
 to purge the world where by the chin uphung
 these on the branches bold orlando strung

 xlii
 the ancient woman the assassin's friend
 escapes when she perceives that all are dead
 and threading that green labyrinth without end
 laments and plucks the hair from off her head
 by fear impelled through paths which sore offend
 her feet till she beside a river's bed
 encounters with a warrior but to say
 who was the stranger champion i delay

 xliii
 and turn to her who to the count applied
 praying he would not leave her there alone
 and vowed to follow whither he would guide
 orlando her consoles in courteous tone
 and thence when with a wreath of roses tied
 about her brows and robed in purple gown
 on wonted journey white aurora starts
 the paladin with isabel departs

 xliv
 without encountering aught that might appear
 worthy of note they wended many a day
 and finally the twain a cavalier
 as prisoner led encountered by the way
 who shall be told but tale to you as dear
 now calls me from the beaten path away
  of aymon's daughter  whom i left above
 languid and lost in all the pains of love

 xlv
 the beauteous lady who desires in vain
 rogero should not his return delay
 lies in marseilles from whence the paynim train
 she harasses nigh each returning day
 what time they robbing aye by hill and plain
 scower fruitful languedoc and provence gay
 and the true duty executes aright
 of a sage leader and a valiant knight

 xlvi
 the time long past she lying in that place
 had hoped that her rogero would appear
 she not beholding him in all that space
 of many evil chances lived in fear
 one day mid others that her woeful case
 the lady wept alone to her drew near
 the dame who with that healing ring made sound
 the bosom rankling with alcina's wound

 xlvii
 when her she saw without her love returned
 such time elapsed her mission incomplete
 sore trembling faint and pale her heart so yearned
 she scarce had strength to stand upon her feet
 but the enchantress kind when she discerned
 her fear advanced with smiles the maid to meet
 and to console her such glad visage wore
 as messenger who joyful tidings bore

 xlviii
 "fear not for thy rogero he is well
 and safe she cried and ever worships thee
 as wonted but thy foe that wizard fell
 him yet again deprives of liberty
 and it behoves thee now to climb the sell
 would'st thou posses him and to follow me
 for if thou wendest with me i will lead
 whither by thee rogero shall be freed"

 xlix
 and next pursued relating to her all
 the frauds and magic of atlantes hoar
 that wearing her fair face who seemed the thrall
 of an ill giant him had through the door
 of gold enticed into the enchanted hall
 and after disappeared the youth before
 and told how dames and cavaliers he cheats
 who thither make resort with like deceits

 l
 seeing the sage all think they see a squire
 companion ladylove or absent friend
 whatever is each several wight's desire
 since to our scope our wishes never tend
 hence searching every where themselves they tire
 with labour sore and frustrate of their end
 and cannot so desire and hope deceive
 without the missing good that palace leave

 li
 "as soon as thou pursued the dame art near
 the place where he has built the magic seat
 resembling thy rogero in his cheer
 and every look atlantes thee shall meet
 and make himself by his ill art appear
 as suffering from some stronger arm defeat
 that thou may'st aid him in the peril feigned
 and thus among those others be detained

 lii
 "to the end thou may'st escape his ambush where
 so many and so many thus betrayed
 have fallen though he rogero seem beware
 to lend him faith who will demand thine aid
 nor when the sage presents himself forbear
 to take his worthless life with lifted blade
 nor think to slay rogero with the blow
 but him who works thee still such cruel woe

 liii
 "hard will it seem to slay full well i know
 the wight in whom rogero you descry
 but for truth is not in the lying show
 trust not to sight where magic blears the eye
 fix ere with me you to the forest go
 to change not when the traitorous foe is nigh
 for never shall with you rogero wive
 if weakly you the wizard leave alive"

 liv
 the valorous maid with the intent to slay
 the false enchanter on her plan decides
 snatches her arms and follows on her way
 melissa sage in whom she so confides
 and thus by fruitful field or forest gray
 her by forced journeys that enchantress guides
 and studies to beguile their weary course
 ever as best she may with sweet discourse

 lv
 and as the fairest topic of all those
 which might be grateful to the damsel's ear
 her future offspring and rogero's chose
 a race of demigods in prince and peer
 for as melissa all the secrets knows
 of the eternal gods who rule our sphere
 the good enchantress can discover all
 which should in many ages hence befall

 lvi
 "oh my best guide" exclaimed the damsel bold
 to the weirdwoman that to aid her came
 "as thou hast many years before foretold
 men who shall glorify my race and name
 so now i pray thee lady to unfold
 the praise and virtues of some noble dame
 if from my lineage any such shall rise"
 to whom melissa courteously replies

 lvii
 "chaste dames of thee descended i survey
 mothers of those who wear imperial crown
 and mighty kings the column and the stay
 of glorious realms and houses of renown
 and as thy sons will shine in arms so they
 will no less fame deserve in female gown
 with piety and sovereign prudence graced
 and noble hearts incomparably chaste

 lviii
 "and if at length i should relate to thee
 the praise of all who from thy root ascend
 too long my tale would hold nor do i see
 whom i could pass where all to fame pretend
 but from a thousand i some two or three
 will choose because my tale may have an end
 why was not in the cave thy wish made known
 where i their shadows might as well have shown

 lix
 "to hear of one of thy famed race prepare
 whom liberal studies and good works engage
 of whom i know not well if she more fair
 may be entitled or more chaste and sage
 the nobleminded isabel who where
 it stands on mincius' bank in other age
 shall gild the town of ocnus' mother hight
 with her own glorious rays by day and night

 lx
 "where with her worthiest consort she will strain
 in honoured and in splendid rivalry
 which best shall prize the virtues' goodly train
 and widest ope the gates to courtesy
 if he by taro and in naples' reign
 'tis said from gauls delivered italy
 'twill be replied penelope the chaste
 as such was not beneath ulysses placed

 lxi
 "great things and many thus i sum in few
 of this brave dame and others leave behind
 which when i from the vulgar herd withdrew
 sage merlin from the hollow stone divined
 for i should leave old typhis out of view
 if on such sea i launched before the wind
 and with this finish my prophetic strain
  all blessings on her head the skies will rain

 lxii
 "with her shall be her sister beatrice
 whose fortunes well shall with her name accord
 who while she lives not only shall not miss
 what good the heavens to those below afford
 but make with her partaker of her bliss
 first among wealthy dukes her cherished lord
 who shall when she from hence receives her call
 into the lowest depth of misery fall

 lxiii
 "viscontis' serpents will be held in dread
 and moro and sforza while this dame shall be
 from hyperborean snows to billows red
 from ind to hills which to a double sea
 afford a passage and the lady dead
 to the sore mischief of all italy
 will with the insubri into slavery fall
 and men shall sovereign wisdom fortune call

 lxiv
 "other the same illustrious name will bear
 and who will flourish many years before
 pannonia's garland one of these shall wear
 another matron on the ausonian shore
 when she shall be released from earthly care
 men will among the blessed saints adore
 with incense will approach the dame divine
 and hang with votive images her shrine

 lxv
 "the others i shall pass in silence by
 for 'twere too much as said before to sound
 their fame though each might well deserve that high
 heroic trump should in her praise be wound
 hence the biancas and lucretias i
 and constances and more reserve who found
 or else repair upon italian land
 illustrious houses with supporting hand

 lxvi
 "thy race which shall all else in this excel
 in the rare fortune of its women thrives
 nor of its daughters' honour more i tell
 than of the lofty virtue of its wives
 and that thou may'st take note of this as well
 which merlin said of thy descendents' lives
 haply that i the story might narrate
 this i no little covet to relate

 lxvii
 "of good richarda first shall be my strain
 mirror of chastity and fortitude
 who young remains a widow in disdain
 of fortune that which oft awaits the good
 exiles and cheated of their father's reign
 she shall behold the children of her blood
 wandering into the clutches of their foe
 yet find at last a quittance for her woe

 lxviii
 "nor sprung from the ancient root of aragon
 i of the gorgeous queen will silent be
 than whom more prudent or more chaste is none
 renowned in greek or latin history
 nor who so fortunate a course will run
 after that by divine election she
 shall with the goodly race of princes swell
 alphonso hyppolite and isabel

 lxix
 "the prudent eleanour is this a spray
 which will be grafted on thy happy tree
 what of the fruitful stepchild shall i say
 who in succession next to her i see
 lucretia borgia who from day to day
 shall wax in beauty virtue chastity
 and fortune that like youthful plant will shoot
 which into yielding soil has struck its root

 lxx
 "as tin by silver brass by gold as corn
 poppy beside the deeplycrimsoning rose
 willow by laurel evergreen as shorn
 of light stained glass by gem that richly glows
  so by this dame i honour yet unborn
 each hitherto distinguished matron shows
 for beauty and for prudence claiming place
 and all praiseworthy excellence and grace

 lxxi
 "and above every other noble praise
 which shall distinguished her alive or dead
 is that by her shall be through kingly ways
 her hercules and other children led
 who thus the seeds of worth in early days
 to bloom in council and in camp will shed
 for long wine's savour lingers in the wood
 of the new vessel whether bad or good

 lxxii
 "nor the stepdaughter of this noble dame
 will i renata hight of france forget
 of louis born twelfth monarch of his name
 and bretagne's pride all virtues ever yet
 bestowed on woman since the ruddy flame
 has warmed or water had the power to wet
 or overhead the circling heavens have rolled
 united in renata i behold

 lxxiii
 " 'twere long to tell of alda de sansogna
 or of celano's countess in this string
 or blanche maria stiled of catalonia
 or her the daughter of sicilia's king
 or of the beauteous lippa de bologna
 or more with whose renown the world shall ring
 to speak whose separate praise with fitting lore
 were to attempt a sea without a shore"

 lxxiv
 when of the larger portion of her seed
 the king enchantress at full ease had told
 and oft and oft rehearsed amid the rede
 what arts rogero to the wizard's hold
 had drawn melissa halted near the mead
 where stood the mansion of atlantes old
 nor would approach the magic dome more nigh
 lest her the false magician should espy

 lxxv
 and yet again advised the martial maid
 counsel she had a thousand times bestowed
 then left nor bradamant through greenwood shade
 more than two miles in narrow path had rode
 before by two fierce giants overlaid
 she saw a knight who like rogero showed
 so closely pressed and labouring sore for breath
 that he appeared well nigh reduced to death

 lxxvi
 when she beheld him in such perilous strait
 who of rogero all the tokens wore
 she quickly lost the faith she nourished late
 quickly her every fair design forbore
 she weens melissa bears rogero hate
 for some new injury unheard before
 and with unheard of hate and wrong her foe
 would by her hand destroy who loves him so

 lxxvii
 she cried "and is not this rogero who
 aye present to my heart is now to sight
 if 'tis not him whom i agnize and view
 whom e'er shall i agnize or view aright
 why should i other's judgment deem more true
 than the belief that's warranted by sight
 even without eyes and by my heart alone
 if he were near or distant would be shown"

 lxxviii
 while so the damsel thinks a voice she hears
 which like rogero's seems for aid to cry
 at the same time the worsted knight appears
 to slack the bridle and the rowels ply
 while at full speed the goaded courser clears
 his ground pursued by either enemy
 nor paused the dame in following them who sought
 his life till to the enchanted palace brought

 lxxix
 of which no sooner has she past the door
 than she is cheated by the common show
 each crooked way or straight her feet explore
 within it and without above below
 nor rests she night or day so strong the lore
 of the enchanter who has ordered so
 she though they still encounter and confer
 knows not rogero nor rogero her

 lxxx
 but leave we bradamant nor grieve o ye
 who hear that she is prisoned by the spell
 since her in fitting time i shall set free
 and good rogero from the dome as well
 as taste is quickened by variety
 so it appears that in the things i tell
 the wider here and there my story ranges
 it will be found less tedious for its changes

 lxxxi
 meseems that i have many threads to clear
 in the great web i labour evermore
 and therefore be ye not displeased to hear
 how all dislodged the squadrons of the moor
 threatening the golden lines loud appear
 in arms the royal agramant before
 who bids for a review his army post
 willing to know the numbers of his host

 lxxxii
 for besides horse and foot in the campaign
 sore thinned whose numbers were to be supplied
 had many captains and those good of spain
 of libya and of aethiopia died
 and thus the nations and the various train
 wandered without a ruler or a guide
 to give to each its head and order due
 the ample camp is mustered in review

 lxxxiii
 to fill the squadrons ravaged by the sword
 in those fierce battles and those conflicts dread
 this to his spain to his africa that lord
 sent to recruit where well their files they fed
 and next distributed the paynim horde
 under their proper captains ranged and led
 i with your leave till other strain delay
 the order of the muster to display


 canto 14

 argument
 two squadrons lack of those which muster under
 king agramant by single roland slain
 hence furious mandricardo full of wonder
 and envy seeks the count by hill and plain
 next joys himself with doralice such plunder
 aided by heaven his valiant arms obtain
 rinaldo comes with the angelguide before
 to paris now assaulted by the moor


 i
 in many a fierce assault and conflict dread
 'twixt spain and afric and their gallic foe
 countless had been the slain whose bodies fed
 the ravening eagle wolf and greedy crow
 but though the franks had worse in warfare sped
 forced all the champaigne country to forego
 this had the paynims purchased at the cost
 of more good princes and bold barons lost

 ii
 so bloody was the price of victory
 small ground was left them triumphs to prepare
 and if unconquered duke alphonso we
 may modern things with ancient deeds compare
 the battle whose illustrious palm may be
 well worthily assigned to you to wear
 at whose remembrance sad ravenna trembles
 and aye shall weep her loss this field resembles

 iii
 when the calesians and the picards yielding
 and troops of normandy and aquitaine
 you with your valiant arms their squadrons shielding
 stormed the almost victorious flags of spain
 and those bold youths their trenchant weapons wielding
 through parted squadrons followed in your train
 who on that day deserved you should accord
 for honoured gifts the gilded spur and sword

 iv
 you with such glorious hearts who were not slow
 to follow nor far off the gorgeous oak
 seized and shook down the golden acorns so
 and so the red and yellow truncheon broke
 that we to you our festive laurels owe
 and the fair lily rescued from its stroke
 another wreath may round your temples bloom
 in that fabricius you preserved to rome

 v
 rome's mighty column by your valiant hand
 taken and kept entire more praise has shed
 on you than if the predatory band
 had routed by your single valour bled
 of all who flocked to fat ravenna's land
 or masterless without a banner fled
 of arragon castile or of navarre
 when vain was lance or cannon's thundering car

 vi
 this dearbought victory brought more relief
 than joy by its event too much outweighed
 the loss of that french captain and our chief
 whom dead we on the fatal field surveyed
 and swallowed in one storm for further grief
 so many glorious princes who arrayed
 for safeguard of their own or neighbouring lands
 had poured through frozen alps their friendly bands

 vii
 our present safety and life held in fear
 we see assured us by this victory
 that saved us from the wintry tempest drear
 which would have whelmed us from jove's angry sky
 but ill can we rejoice while yet the tear
 is standing in full many a widow's eye
 who weeping and attired in sable vents
 throughout all grieving france her loud laments

 viii
 'tis meet king lewis should find new supplies
 of chiefs by whom his troops may be arrayed
 who for the lilies' honour shall chastise
 the hands which so rapaciously have preyed
 who brethren black and white in shameful wise
 have outraged sister mother wife and maid
 and cast on earth christ's sacrament divine
 with the intent to thieve his silver shrine

 ix
 hadst thou not made resistance to thy foe
 better ravenna had it been for thee
 and thou been warned by brescia's fate than so
 thine should faenza warn and rimini
 o lewis bid good old trivulzio go
 with thine and to thy bands example be
 and tell what ills such license still has bred
 heaping our ample italy with dead

 x
 as the illustrious king of france has need
 of captains to supply his leaders lost
 so the two kings who spain and afric lead
 to give new order to the double host
 resolve their bands should muster on the mead
 from winter lodgings moved and various post
 that they may furnish as their wants demand
 a guide and government to every band

 xi
 marsilius first and after agramant
 passing it troop by troop their army scan
 the catalonians who their captain vaunt
 in doriphoebus muster in the van
 and next without their monarch fulvirant
 erst killed by good rinaldo comes the clan
 of bold navarre whose guideless band to steer
 the king of spain appoints sir isolier

 xii
 with balugantes leon's race comes on
 the algarbi governed by grandonio wheel
 the brother of marsilius falsiron
 brings up with him the power of less castile
 they follow madarasso's gonfalon
 who have left malaga and fair seville
 'twixt fruitful cordova and cadizbay
 where through green banks the betis winds its way

 xiii
 stordilane tessira and baricond
 after each other next their forces stirred
 this in grenada that in lisbon crowned
 majorca was obedient to the third
 larbino had lisbon ruled whose golden round
 was at his death on tessira conferred
 his kinsman he gallicia came in guide
 or serpentine who mericold supplied

 xiv
 they of toledo and of calatrave
 who erst with sinnagon's broad banner spread
 marched and the multitude who drink and lave
 their limbs in chrystal guadiana's bed
 came thither under matalista brave
 beneath bianzardin their common head
 astorga salamanca placenza
 with avila zamorra and palenza

 xv
 the householdtroops which guard marsilius' state
 and saragossa's men ferrau commands
 and in this force wellsheathed in mail and plate
 bold malgarine and balinverno stands
 morgant and malzarise whom common fate
 had both condemned to dwell in foreign lands
 who when dethroned had to marsilius' court
 there hospitably harboured made resort

 xvi
 follicon kind marsilius' bastard hies
 with valiant doricont amid this horde
 bavartes analard and argalise
 and archidantes the saguntine lord
 here malagur in ready cunning wise
 and ammirant and langhiran the sword
 unsheath and march of whom i shall endite
 when it is time their prowess to recite

 xvii
 when so had filed the warlike host of spain
 in fair review before king agramant
 appeared king oran with his martial train
 who might almost a giant's stature vaunt
 next they who weep their martasino slain
 by the avenging sword of bradamant
 king of the garamantes and lament
 that woman triumphs in their monarch spent

 xviii
 marmonda's men next past the royal moor
 who left argosto dead on gascon meads
 and this unguided band like that before
 as well as the fourth troop a captain needs
 although king agramant has little store
 of chiefs he feigns a choice and thinks next speeds
 buraldo ormida and arganio tried
 where needing the unordered troops to guide

 xix
 he give arganio charge of libicane
 who wept the sable dudrinasso dead
 brunello guides the men of tingitane
 with cloudy countenance and drooping head
 who since he in the wooded mountainchain
 nigh where atlantes dwelt to her he led
 fair bradamant had lost the virtuous ring
 had lived in the displeasure of his king

 xx
 and but that ferrau's brother isolier
 who fastened to a stem had found him there
 made to king agramant the truth appear
 he from the gallowstree had swung in air
 already fastened was the noose and near
 the caitiff's fate when at the many's prayer
 the king bade loose him but reprieving swore
 for his first fault to hang offending more

 xxi
 thus not without a cause brunello pined
 and showed a mournful face and hung his head
 next farurantes to whose care consigned
 maurina's valiant horse and footmen tread
 the newmade king libanio comes behind
 by whom are constatina's people led
 since agramant the crown and staff of gold
 once pinador's had given to him to hold

 xxii
 hesperia's people come with soridan
 with dorilon the men of setta ride
 the nasamonians troop with pulian
 and agricaltes is ammonia's guide
 malabupherso rules o'er fezzan's clan
 and finaduro leads the band supplied
 by the canary islands and morocco
 balastro fills the place of king tardocco

 xxiii
 next mulga and arzilla's legions two
 the first beneath their ancient captains wend
 the second troop without a leader who
 are given to corineus the sovereign's friend
 so late tanphirion's almonsilla's crew
 to a new monarch in caichus bend
 goetulia is bestowed on rhimedont
 and cosca comes in charge of balinfront

 xxiv
 ruled by clarindo bolga's people go
 who fills the valiant mirabaldo's post
 him baliverso whom i'd have you know
 for the worst ribald in that ample host
 succeeded next i think not 'mid that show
 the bannered camp a firmer troop could boast
 than that which followed in sobrino's care
 nor saracen than him more wise and ware

 xxv
 gualciotto dead bellamarina's crew
 his vassals serve the sovereign of algiers
 king rodomont of sarza that anew
 brought up a band of foot and cavaliers
 whom when the cloudy sun his rays withdrew
 beneath the centaur and the goat his spears
 there to recruit was sent to the afric shore
 by agramant returned three days before

 xxvi
 there was no saracen of bolder strain
 of all the chiefs who moorish squadrons led
 and paristown nor is the terror vain
 more of the puissant warrior stands in dread
 than of king agramant and all the train
 which he or the renowned marsilius head
 and amid all that mighty muster more
 than others hatred to our faith he bore

 xxvii
 prusion is the alvaracchia's king below
 king dardinello's flag zumara's power
 is ranged i wot not i if owl or crow
 or other bird illomened which from tower
 or tree croaks future evil did foreshow
 to one or to the other that the hour
 was fixed in heaven when on the following day
 either should perish in this deadly fray

 xxviii
 noritia's men and tremisene's alone
 were wanting to complete the paynim host
 but in the martial muster sign was none
 nor tale nor tiding of the squadrons lost
 to wondering agramant alike unknown
 what kept the slothful warriors from their post
 when of king tremisene's a squire was brought
 before him who at large the mischief taught

 xxix
  who taught how manilardo was laid low
 alzirdo and many others on the plain
  "sir" said the bearer of the news "the foe
 who slew our troop would all thy camp have slain
 if thine assembled host had been more slow
 than me who as it was escaped with pain
 this man slays horse and foot as in the cote
 the wolf makes easy waste of sheep and goat"

 xxx
 where the bold africans their standards plant
 a warrior had arrived some days before
 nor was there in the west or whole levant
 a knight with heart or prowess gifted more
 to him much grace was done by agramant
 as successor of agrican who wore
 the crown of tartary a warrior wight
 the son the famous mandricardo hight

 xxxi
 renowned he was for many a glorious quest
 atchieved and through the world his fame was blown
 but him had glorified above the rest
 worth in the syrian fairy's castle shown
 where mail which cased the trojan hector's breast
 a thousand years before he made his own
 and finished that adventure strange and fell
 a story which breeds terror but to tell

 xxxii
 when the squire told his news amid that show
 of troops was present agrican's bold son
 who raised his daring face resolved to go
 and find the warrior who the deed had done
 but the design he hatched forebore to show
 as making small account of any one
 or fearing lest should he reveal his thought
 the quest by other champion might be sought

 xxxiii
 he of the squire demanded what the vest
 and bearings which the valiant stranger wore
 who answered that he went without a crest
 and sable shield and sable surcoat bore
  and sir 'twas true for so was roland drest
 the old device renounced he had before
 for as he mourned within so he without
 the symbols of his grief would bear about

 xxxiv
 marsilius had to mandricardo sped
 as gift a courser of a chestnut stain
 whose legs and mane were sable he was bred
 between a friesland mare and nag of spain
 king mandricardo armed from foot to head
 leapt on the steed and galloped o'er the plain
 and swore upon the camp to turn his back
 till he should find the champion clad in black

 xxxv
 the king encounters many of the crew
 whom good orlando's arm had put to flight
 and some a son and some a brother rue
 who in the rout had perished in their sight
 and in the coward's cheek of pallid hue
 is yet pourtrayed the sad and craven sprite
  yet through the fear endured they far and nigh
 pallid and silent and insensate fly

 xxxvi
 nor he long was had rode ere he descried
 a passingcruel spectacle and sore
 but which the wonderous feats well testified
 that were recounted agramant before
 now on this hand now that the dead he eyed
 measured their wounds and turned their bodies o'er
 moved by strange envy of the knight whose hand
 had strown the champaign with the slaughtered band

 xxxvii
 as wolf or mastiffdog who comes the last
 where the remains of slaughtered bullock lie
 and finds but horn and bones where rich repast
 had fed the ravening hound and vulture night
 glares vainly on the scull unsmacked so passed
 the barbarous tartar king those bodies by
 and grudged lamenting like the hungry beast
 to have come too late for such a sumptuous feast

 xxxviii
 that day and half the next in search he strayed
 of him who wore the sable vest and shield
 when lo he saw a mead o'ertopt with shade
 where a deep river wound about the field
 with narrow space between the turns it made
 where'er from side to side the water wheeled
 even such a spot as this with circling waves
 below otricoli the tyber laves

 xxxix
 where this deep stream was fordable he scanned
 a crowd of cavaliers that armour bore
 and these the paynim questioned who had manned
 with such a troop and to what end the shore
 to him replied the captain of the band
 moved by his lordly air and arms he wore
 glittering with gold and jewels  costly gear
 which showed him an illustrious cavalier

 xl
 "in charge" he said "we of the daughter go
 of him our king who fills granada's throne
 espoused by rodomont of sarza though
 to fame the tidings are as yet unknown
 and we departing when the sun is low
 and the cicala hushed which now alone
 is heard shall bring her where her father keeps
 i' the spanish camp meanwhile the lady sleeps"

 xli
 he who for scorn had daffed the world aside
 designs to see at once how able were
 those horsemen to defend the royal bride
 committed by their sovereign to their care
 "the maid by what i hear is fair" he cried
 "fain would i now be certified how fair
 then me to her or her to me convey
 for i must quickly wend another way"

 xlii
 "thou needs art raving mad" replied in few
 the chief  nor more but with his lance in rest
 the tartar monarch at the speaker flew
 and with the levelled spear transfixed his breast
 for the point pierced the yielding corslet through
 and lifeless he perforce the champaign prest
 the son of agrican his lance regained
 who weaponless without the spear remained

 xliii
 now sword nor club the warlike tartar bore
 since when the trojan hector's plate and chain
 he gained because the faulchion lacked he swore
 to this obliged nor swore the king in vain
 that save he won the blade orlando wore
 he would no other grasp  that durindane
 held in high value by almontes bold
 which roland bears and hector bore of old

 xliv
 great is the tartar monarch's daring those
 at such a disadvantage to assay
 he pricks with levelled lance among his foes
 shouting in fury  "who shall bar my way" 
 round and about him suddenly they close
 these draw the faulchion and those others lay
 the spear in rest a multitude he slew
 before his lance was broke upon the crew

 xlv
 when this he saw was broke the truncheon sound
 and yet entire he took both hands between
 and with so many bodies strewed the ground
 that direr havoc never yet was seen
 and as with that jaw bone by hazard found
 the hebrew samson slew the philistine
 crushed helm and shield and often side by side
 slain by the truncheon horse and rider died

 xlvi
 in running to their death the wretches vie
 nor cease because their comrades perish near
 yet bitterer in such a mode to die
 than death itself does to the troop appear
 they grudge to forfeit precious life and lie
 crushed by the fragment of a broken spear
 and think foul scorn beneath the pounding stake
 strangely to die the death of frog or snake

 xlvii
 but after they at their expense had read
 that it was ill to die in any way
 and near two thirds were now already dead
 the rest began to fly in disarray
 as if with what was his the vanquished fled
 the cruel paynim cheated of his prey
 ill bore that any from the murderous strife
 of that scared rabble should escape with life

 xlviii
 as in the welldried fen or stubbleland
 short time the stalk endures or stridulous reed
 against the flames which careful rustic's hand
 scatters when boreas blows the fires to feed
 what time they take and by the northwind fanned
 crackle and snap and through the furrow speed
 no otherwise with little profit those
 king mandricardo's kindled wrath oppose

 xlix
 when afterwards he marks the entrance free
 left illsecured and without sentinel
 he following prints which had been recently
 marked on the mead proceeds amid the swell
 of loud laments granada's dame to see
 if she as beauteous were as what they tell
 he wound his way 'mid corpses where the wave
 winding from side to side a passage gave

 l
 and in the middle of the mead surveyed
 doralice such the gentle lady's name
 who at the root of an old ash tree laid
 bemoaned her fast her lamentations came
 and tears like plenteous vein of water strayed
 into the beauteous bosom of the dame
 who so it from her lovely face appeared
 for others mourned while for herself she feared

 li
 her fear increased when she approaching spied
 him foul with blood and marked his felon cheer
 and piercing shrieks the very sky divide
 raised by herself and followers in their fear
 for over and above the troop who guide
 the fair infanta squire and cavalier
 came ancient men and matrons in her train
 and maids the fairest of granada's reign

 lii
 when that fair face by him of tartary
 is seen which has no paragon in spain
 where amid tears in laughter what were she
 is twisted love's inextricable chain
 he knows not if in heaven or earth he be
 nor from his victory reaps other gain
 than yielding up himself a thrall to her
 he knows not why who was his prisoner

 liii
 yet not so far his courtesy he strained
 that he would lose his labour's fruit although
 the royal damsel showed who sorely plained
 such grief as women in despair can show
 he who the hope within him entertained
 to turn to sovereign joy her present woe
 would wholly bear her off whom having placed
 on a white jennet he his way retraced

 liv
 he dames maids ancient men and others who
 had from granada with the damsel fared
 kindly dismissed their journey to pursue
 saying "my care suffices i of guard
 of guide of handmaid will the office do
 to serve her in her every need prepared
 farewell" and thus unable to withstand
 the wrong with tears and sighs withdrew the band

 lv
 saying "how woebegone will be her sire
 when he the miserable case shall hear
 what grief will be the bridegroom's what his ire
 how dread the vengeance of that cavalier
 when so the lady's needs such help require
 alas and why is not the champion near
 to save the illustrious blood of stordilane
 ere the thief bears her farther hence from stain"

 lvi
 the tartar joying in the prize possest
 which he by chance and valour won and wore
 to find the warrior of the sable vest
 seemed not to have the haste he had before
 and stopp'd and loitered where he whilom prest
 and cast about and studied evermore
 to find some fitting shelter with desire
 in quiet to exhale such amorous fire

 lvii
 doralice he consoled this while whose eyes
 and cheek were wetted with the frequent tear
 and many matters feigned and flattering lies
  how known by fame he long had held her dear
 and how his country and glad realm whose size
 shamed others praised for grandeur far and near
 he quitted not for sight of france or spain
 but to behold that cheek of lovely grain

 lviii
 "if a man merits love by loving i
 yours by my love deserve if it is won
 by birth  who boasts a genealogy
 like me the puissant agricano's son
 by riches  who with me in wealth can vie
 that in dominion yield to god alone
 by courage  i today i ween have proved
 that i for courage merit to be loved"

 lix
 these words and many others on his part
 love frames and dictates to the tartar knight
 which sweetly tend to cheer the afflicted heart
 of the unhappy maid disturbed with fright
 by these fear first was laid and next the smart
 sheathed of that woe which had nigh pierced her sprite
 and with more patience thence the maid began
 to hear and her new lover's reasons scan

 lx
 next much more affable with courteous lore
 seasoning her answers to his suit replies
 nor looking at the king sometimes forbore
 to fix upon his face her pitying eyes
 the paynim thence whom love had smote before
 not hopeful now but certain of his prize
 deemed that the lovely damsel would not still
 as late be found rebellious to his will

 lxi
 riding in her glad company afield
 which so rejoiced his soul so satisfied
 and being near the time when to their bield
 warned by the chilly night all creatures hied
 seeing the sun now low and half concealed
 the warrior 'gan in greater hurry ride
 until he heard reedpipe and whistle sound
 and next saw farm and cabin smoking round

 lxii
 pastoral lodgings were the dwellings near
 less formed for show than for conveniency
 and the young damsel and the cavalier
 the herdsman welcomed with such courtesy
 that both were pleasured by his kindly cheer
 for not alone dwells hospitality
 in court and city but ofttimes we find
 in loft and cottage men of gentle kind

 lxiii
 what afterwards was done at close of day
 between the damsel and the tartar lord
 i will not take upon myself to say
 so leave to each at pleasure to award
 but as they rose the following morn more gay
 it would appear they were of fair accord
 and on the swain who them such honour showed
 her thanks at parting doralice bestowed

 lxiv
 thence from one place to the other wandering they
 find themselves by a river as they go
 which to the sea in silence winds its way
 and ill could be pronounced to stand or flow
 so clear and limpid that the cheerful day
 with nought to intercept it pierced below
 upon its bank beneath a cooling shade
 they found two warriors and a damsel laid

 lxv
 now lofty fancy which one course to run
 permits not calls me hence in sudden wise
 and thither i return where paynims stun
 fair france with hosile din and angry cries
 about the tent wherein troyano's son
 they holy empire in his wrath defies
 and boastful rodomont with vengeful doom
 gives paris to the flames and levels rome

 lxvi
 tidings had reached the moorish sovereign's ear
 that the english had already passed the sea
 and he bade garbo's aged king appear
 marsilius and his heads of chivalry
 who all advised the monarch to prepare
 for the assault of paris they may be
 assured they in the storm will never thrive
 unless 'tis made before the aids arrive

 lxvii
 innumerable ladders for the scale
 had been collected upon every hand
 and plank and beam and hurdle's twisted mail
 for different uses at the king's command
 and bridge and boat and what might more avail
 than all the rest a first and second band
 for the assault so bids the monarch form
 who will himself go forth with them that storm

 lxviii
 the emperor on the vigil of the day
 of battle within paris everywhere
 by priest and friar of orders black and gray
 and white bade celebrate massrite and prayer
 and those who had confessed a fair array
 and from the stygian demons rescued were
 communicated in such fashions all
 as if they were the ensuing day to fall

 lxix
 at the high church he girt with paladine
 and preachers of the word and barons brave
 with much devotion at those acts divine
 assisted and a fair example gave
 and there with folded hands and face supine
 exclaimed "o lord although my sins be grave
 permit not that in this their utmost need
 thy people suffer for their king's misdeed

 lxx
 "and if that they should suffer is thy will
 and that they should due penance undergo
 at least delay thy purpose to fulfil
 so that thine enemies deal not the blow
 for when 'tis given him in his wrath to kill
 us who are deemed thy friends the paynim foe
 that thou art without power to save will cry
 because thou lett'st thy faithful people die

 lxxi
 "and for one faithless found against thy sway
 a hundred shall throughout the world rebel
 so that false babel's law will have its way
 and thus thy blessed faith put down and quell
 defend thy suffering people who are they
 that purged thy tomb from heathen hounds and fell
 and many times and oft by foes offended
 thy holy church and vicars have defended

 lxxii
 "that our deserts unfitting are to place
 i' the scale against our mighty debt i know
 nor pardon can we hope if we retrace
 our sinful lives but if thou shouldst bestow
 in aid the gift of they redeeming grace
 the account is quit and balanced that we owe
 nor can we of thy succour lord despair
 while we in mind thy saving mercy bear"

 lxxiii
 so spake the holy emperor aloud
 in humbleness of heart and deep contrition
 and added other prayers withal and vowed
 what fitted his great needs and high condition
 now was his supplication disallowed
 for his good genius hears the king's petition
 best of the seraphs he who spreads his wings
 and to the saviour's feet this offering brings

 lxxiv
 infinite other prayers as well preferred
 were by like couriers to the godhead's ear
 so borne which when the blessed spirits heard
 they all together gazed with pitying cheer
 on their eternal loving lord and stirred
 with one desire besought that he would hear
 the just petition to his ears conveyed
 of this his christian people seeking aid

 lxxv
 and the ineffable goodness who in vain
 was never sought by faithful heart an eye
 full of compassion raised and from the train
 waved michael and to the archangel "hie
 to seek the christian host that crost the main
 and lately furled their sails in picardy
 these so conduct to paris that their tramp
 and noise be heard not in the hostile camp

 lxxvi
 "find silence first and bid him on my part
 on this emprize attend thee at thy side
 since he for such a quest with happiest art
 will know what is most fitting to provide
 next where she sojourns instantly impart
 to discord my command that she supplied
 with steel and tinder 'mid the paynims go
 and fire and flame in their encampment blow

 lxxvii
 "and throughout those among them who are said
 to be the mightiest spread such strife that they
 together may contend and that some dead
 remain some hurt some taken in the fray
 and some to leave the camp by wrath be led
 so that they yield their sovereign little stay"
 nothing the blessed wingedone replies
 but swoops descending from the starry skies

 lxxviii
 where'er the angel michael turns his wing
 the clouds are scattered and the sky turns bright
 about his person forms a golden ring
 as we see summer lightning gleam at night
 this while the courier of the heavenly king
 thinks on his way where he may best alight
 with the intent to find that foe to speech
 to whom he first his high behest would teach

 lxxix
 upon the thought the posting angel brooded
 where he for whom he sought was used to dwell
 who after thinking much at last concluded
 him he should find in church or convent cell
 where social speech is in such mode excluded
 that silence where the cloistered brethren swell
 their anthems where they sleep and where they sit
 at meat and everywhere in fine is writ

 lxxx
 weening that he shall find him here he plies
 with greater speed his plumes of gilded scale
 and deems as well that peace here guested lies
 and charity and quiet without fail
 but finds he is deceived in his surmise
 as soon as he has past the cloister's pale
 here silence is not nor 'tis said is found
 longer except in writing on this ground

 lxxxi
 nor here he love nor here he peace surveys
 piety quiet or humility
 here dwelt they once but 'twas in ancient days
 chased hence by avarice anger gluttony
 pride envy sloth and cruelty in amaze
 the angel mused upon such novelty
 he narrowly the hideous squadron eyed
 and discord too amid the rest espied

 lxxxii
 even her to whom the eternal sire as well
 having found silence bade him to repair
 he had believed he to avernus' cell
 where she was harboured with the damned must fare
 and now discerned her in this other hell
 who would believe it amid mass and prayer
 strange michael thought to see her there enshrined
 whom he believed he must go far to find

 lxxxiii
 her by her partycoloured vest he knew
 unequal strips and many formed the gown
 which opening with her walk or wind that blew
 now showed now hid her for they were unsown
 her hair appeared to be at strife in hue
 like silver and like gold and black and brown
 part in a tress in riband part comprest
 some on her shoulders flowed some on her breast

 lxxxiv
 examinations summons and a store
 of writs and letters of attorney she
 and hearings in her hands and bosom bore
 and consultation and authority
 weapons from which the substance of the poor
 can never safe in walled city be
 before behind her and about her wait
 attorney notary and advocate

 lxxxv
 her michael calls to him and give command
 that she among the strongest paynims go
 and find occasion whence amid the band
 warfare and memorable scathe may grow
 he next from her of silence makes demand
 who of his motions easily might know
 as one who from one land to the other hied
 kindling and scattering fire on either side

 lxxxvi
 "i recollect not ever to have viewed
 him anywhere" quoth discord in reply
 "but oft have heard him mentioned and for shrewd
 greatly commended by the general cry
 but fraud who makes one of this multitude
 and who has sometimes kept him company
 i think can furnish news of him to thee
 and" pointing with her finger "that is she"

 lxxxvii
 with pleasing mien grave walk and decent vest
 fraud rolled her eyeballs humbly in her head
 and such benign and modest speech possest
 she might a gabriel seem who ave said
 foul was she and deformed in all the rest
 but with a mantle long and widely spread
 concealed her hideous parts and evermore
 beneath the stole a poisoned dagger wore

 lxxxviii
 of her the good archangel made demand
 what way in search of silence to pursue
 who said "he with the virtues once was scanned
 nor dwelt elsewhere aye guested by the crew
 of benedict or blest elias' band
 when abbeys and when conventcells were new
 and whilom in the schools long time did pass
 with sage archytas and pythagorus

 lxxxix
 "but those philosophers and saints of yore
 extinguished who had been his former stay
 from the good habits he had used before
 he passed to evil ones began to stray
 changing his life at night with lovers bore
 thieves company and sinned in every way
 he oftentimes consorts with treason further
 i even have beheld him leagued with murther

 xc
 "with coiners him you oftentimes may see
 harbour in some obscure and close repair
 so oft he changes home and company
 to light on him would be a fortune rare
 yet have i hope to point him out to thee
 if to sleep's house thou wilt at midnight fare
 him wilt thou surely find for to repose
 at night he ever to that harbour goes"

 xci
 though fraud was alway wont to deal in lies
 so like the simple truth appears her say
 the angel yields the tale belief and flies
 forth from the monastery without delay
 tempers his speed and schemes withal in wise
 to finish at the appointed time his way
 that at the house of sleep the mansion blind
 full well he knew this silence he may find

 xcii
 in blest arabia lies a pleasant vale
 removed from village and from city's reach
 by two fair hills o'ershadowed is the dale
 and full of ancient fir and sturdy beech
 thither the circling sun without avail
 conveys the cheerful daylight for no breach
 the rays can make through boughs spread thickly round
 and it is here a cave runs under ground

 xciii
 beneath the shadow of this forest deep
 into the rock there runs a grotto wide
 here widely wandering ivysuckers creep
 about the cavern's entrance multiplied
 harboured within this grot lies heavy sleep
 ease corpulent and gross upon this side
 upon that sloth on earth has made her seat
 who cannot go and hardly keeps her feet

 xciv
 mindless oblivion at the gate is found
 who lets none enter and agnizes none
 nor message hears or bears and from that ground
 without distinction chases every one
 while silence plays the scout and walks his round
 equipt with shoes of felt and mantle brown
 and motions from a distance all who meet
 him on his circuit from the dim retreat

 xcv
 the angel him approaches quietly
 and " 'tis god's bidding" whispers in his ear
 "that thou rinaldo and his company
 brought in his sovereign's aid to paris steer
 but that thou do the deed so silently
 that not a saracen their cry shall hear
 so that their army come upon the foe
 ere he from fame of their arrival know"

 xcvi
 silence to him no otherwise replied
 than signing with his head that he obeyed
 and took his post behind the heavenly guide
 both at one flight to picardy conveyed
 the angel moved those bands of valour tried
 and short to them a tedious distance made
 whom he to paris safe transports while none
 is conscious that a miracle is done

 xcvii
 silence the advancing troop kept skirting round
 in front and flank and rear of the array
 above the band he spread a mist profound
 and everywhere beside 'twas lightsome day
 nor through the impeding fog the shrilling sound
 of horn was heard without or trumpet's bray
 he next the hostile paynims went to find
 and with i know not what made deaf and blind

 xcviii
 while with such haste his band rinaldo led
 that him an angel well might seem to guide
 and in such silence moved that nought was said
 or heard of this upon the paynim side
 king agramant his infantry had spread
 throughout fair paris' suburbs and beside
 the foss and underneath the walls that day
 to make upon the place his worst assay

 xcix
 he who the moorish monarch's force would tell
 which charlemagne this day will have to meet
 in wooded apennine might count as well
 the trees upon its back or waves that beat
 what time the troubled waters highest swell
 against the mauritanian atlas' feet
 or watch at midnight with how many eyes
 the furtive works of lovers heaven espies

 c
 the larumbells loudsounding through the air
 stricken with frequent blows the town affray
 and in the crowded temples every where
 movement of lips and hands upraised to pray
 are seen if treasure seemed to god so fair
 as to our foolish thoughts upon this day
 the holy consistory had bid mould
 their every statue upon earth in gold

 ci
 lamenting may be heard the aged just
 in that they were reserved for such a woe
 calling those happy that in sacred dust
 were buried many and many a year ago
 but the bold youths who valiant and robust
 small thought upon the approaching ills bestow
 scorning their elders' counsel here and there
 hurrying in fury to the walls repair

 cii
 here might you paladin and baron ken
 king duke and marquis count and chivalry
 and soldier foreigner or citizen
 ready for honour and for christ to die
 who eager to assail the saracen
 on charlemagne to lower the bridges cry
 he witnesses with joy their martial beat
 but to permit their sally deems not meet

 ciii
 and them he ordered in convenient post
 the advance of the barbarians to impede
 for this would ill suffice a numerous host
 to that he was content that few should speed
 some worked at the machines some wildfire tost
 all ranged according to the separate need
 charles never in one place with restless care
 provides defence and succour every where

 civ
 paris is seated on a spacious plain
 i' the midst  the heart of france more justly say
 a stream flows into it and forth again
 but first the passing waters as they stray
 an island form and so secure the main
 and better part dividing on their way
 the other two three separate quarters note
 within the river girds without the moat

 cv
 the town whose walls for miles in circuit run
 might well have been attacked from many a side
 yet for he would assail it but on one
 nor willingly his scattered troops divide
 westward beyond the stream troyano's son
 retired from thence the assailing bands to guide
 in that he neither city had nor plain
 behind but what was his as far as spain

 cvi
 where'er the walls of paris wound about
 large ammunition had king charles purveyed
 strengthening with dyke each quarter held in doubt
 and had within trench drain and casemate made
 and where the river entered and went out
 had thickest chains across the channel laid
 but most of all his prudent cares appear
 where there is greatest cause for present fear

 cvii
 with eyes of argus pepin's valiant son
 where agramant was bent to storm foresaw
 and every thing forestalled ere yet begun
 by the bold followers of mahound's law
 with isolier grandonio falsiron
 serpentin balugantes and ferrau
 and what beside he out of spain had led
 marsilius was in arms their valiant head

 cviii
 with old sobrino on the left of seine
 pulian and dardinel d'almontes meet
 with oran's giant king to swell the train
 six cubits is the prince from head to feet
 but why move i my pen with greater pain
 than these men move their arms for in his heat
 king rodomont exclaims blaspheming sore
 nor can contain his furious spirit more

 cix
 as swarming to assail the pastoral bowl
 with sound of stridulous wing through summer sky
 or relics of a feast their luscious dole
 repair the ready numbers of the fly
 as starlings to the vineyard's crimsoning pole
 with the ripe clusters charged  heaven's concave high
 filling as they advanced with noise and shout
 fast hurried to the storm the moorish rout

 cx
 upon their walls the christians in array
 with lance sword axe and wildfire tost
 the assaulted city guard without dismay
 and little reck the proud barbarian's boast
 nor when death snatches this or that away
 does any one in fear refuse his post
 into the fosse below the paynim foes
 return amid a storm of strokes and blows

 cxi
 nor in this was is iron plied alone
 but mighty masses and whole bulwarks fall
 and top of tower huge piece of bastion
 and with much toil disrupted solid wall
 while streams of boiling water pouring down
 insufferably the advancing paynims gall
 an illresisted rain which in despite
 of helmet makes its way and blinds the sight

 cxii
 and this than iron spear offended more
 then how much more the mist of limedust fine
 then how the emptied vessel burning sore
 with nitre sulphur pitch and turpentine
 nor idle lie the fiery hoops in store
 which wreathed about with flaming tresses shine
 these at the foemen scaled upon all hands
 form cruel garlands for the paynim bands

 cxiii
 meanwhile up to the walls the second crew
 fierce sarza's king was driven accompanied
 by bold orlando and buraldo who
 the garamantes and marmonda guide
 clarindo and loridano nor from view
 it seems will setta's valiant monarch hide
 morocco's king and he of cosco go
 with these that men their martial worth may know

 cxiv
 with crimson rodomont his banner stains
 and in the vermeil field a lion shows
 who bitted by a maid to curb and reins
 his savage mouth disdains not to unclose
 himself in the submissive lion feigns
 the haughty rodomont and would suppose
 in her who curbs him with the bit and string
 doralice daughter to grenada's king

 cxv
 whom mandricardo took as i before
 related and from whom and in what wise
 even she it was whom sarza's monarch more
 loved than his realm  beyond his very eyes
 and valour showed for her and courteous lore
 not knowing yet she was another's prize
 if he had  then  then first  the story known
 even what he did that day he would have done

 cxvi
 at once the foes a thousand ladders rear
 against the wall by the assailants shored
 two mannered each round the second in the rear
 urged on by the first the third the second gored
 one mounts the wall through valour one through fear
 and all attempt perforce the dangerous ford
 for cruel rodomont of argier slays
 or smites the wretched laggard who delays

 cxvii
 'tis thus 'mid fire and ruin all assay
 to mount the wall but others to assure
 themselves some safer passage seek where they
 will have least pain and peril to endure
 rodomont only scorns by any way
 to wend except by what is least secure
 and in that desperate case where others made
 their offerings cursed the god to whom they prayed

 cxviii
 he in a cuirass hard and strong was drest
 a dragonskin it was with scaly quilt
 which erst secured the manly back and breast
 of his bold ancestor that babel built
 who hoped the rule of heaven from god to wrest
 and him would from his golden dome have split
 perfect and for this end alone were made
 helmet and shield as well as trenchant blade

 cxix
 nor rodomont to nimrod yields in might
 proud and untamed and who would not forbear
 to scale the lofty firmament till night
 could he in this wide world descry the stair
 he stood not he to mark the bulwark's plight
 nor if the fosse of certain bottom were
 he past ran  rather flew across the moat
 plunging in filth and water to his throat

 cxx
 dripping and foul with water and with weeds
 'mid fire and stone and arbalests and bows
 on drives the chief as through the marshy reeds
 the wildswine of our own mallea goes
 who makes large daylight wheresoe'er he speeds
 parting the sedge with breast and tusk and nose
 the paynim safe in buckler lifted high
 scorns not the wall alone but braves the sky

 cxxi
 rodomont has no sooner gained the shore
 than on the wooden bartizan he stands
 within the city walls a bridge that bore
 roomy and large king charles's christian bands
 here many a scull is riven here men take more
 than monkish tonsure at the warrior's hands
 heads fly and arms and to the ditch a flood
 runs streaming from the wall of crimson blood

 cxxii
 he drops the shield and with twohanded sway
 wielding his sword duke arnulph he offends
 who came from whence into the briny bay
 the water of the rapid rhine descends
 no better than the sulphur keeps away
 the advancing flame the wretch his life defends
 he his last shudder gives and tumbles dead
 cleft downwards a full palm from neck and head

 cxxiii
 at one backstroke sir spineloccio true
 anselmo prando and oldrado fell
 the narrow place and thicklyswarming crew
 make the widecircling blow so fully tell
 the first half flemings were the residue
 are normans who the list of slaughter swell
 orghetto of maganza he from brow
 to breast divides and thence to paunch below

 cxxiv
 down from the wall andropono and moschine
 he cast into the ditch a priest the first
 the second but a worshipper of wine
 drained at a draught whole runlets in his thirst
 aye wonted simple water to decline
 like viper's blood or venom now immersed
 in this he perishes amid that slaughter
 and what breeds most affliction dies by water

 cxxv
 lewis the provencal is cleft in two
 arnold of thoulouse through the breast before
 hubert of tours sir dionysius hugh
 and claud pour forth their ghosts in reeking gore
 odo ambaldo satallon ensue
 and walter next of paris are the four 
 with others that by me unmentioned fall
 who cannot tell the name and land of all

 cxxvi
 the crowd by rodomont of sarza led
 the ladders lift and many places scale
 here the parisians make no further head
 who find their first defense of small avail
 full well they know that danger more to dread
 within awaits the foemen who assail
 because between the wall and second mound
 a fosse descends wide horrid and profound

 cxxvii
 besides that ours with those upon the height
 war from below like valiant men and stout
 new files succeed to those who fall in fight
 where on the interior summit stand the rout
 who gall with lances and a whistling flight
 of darts the mighty multitude without
 many of whom i ween that post would shun
 if it were not for royal ulien's son

 cxxviii
 but he still heartened some and chid the rest
 and forced them forward to their sore alarm
 one paynim's head he cleft and other's breast
 who turned about to fly and of the swarm
 some shoved and pushed and to the encounter prest
 closegrappled by the collar hair or arm
 and downwards from the wall such numbers threw
 the ditch was all to narrow for the crew

 cxxix
 while so the foes descend or rather fling
 themselves into the perilous profound
 and thence by many ladders try to spring
 upon the summit of the second mound
 king rodomont as if he had a wing
 upon his every member from the ground
 upraised his weight and vaulted clean across
 loaded with all his arms the yawning fosse

 cxxx
 the moat of thirty feet not less he cleared
 as dexterously as leaps the greyhound fleet
 nor at his lighting louder noise was heard
 than if he had worn felt beneath his feet
 he now of this now that the mantle sheared
 as though of pewter not of iron beat
 or rather of soft rind their arms had been
 so matchless was his force and sword so keen

 cxxxi
 this while not idle those of ours had laid
 snares in the inner moat a wellcharged mine
 where broom and thick fascines all over paid
 with swarthy pitch in plenty intertwine
 though they from bank to bank that hollow line
 filling the bottom wellnigh to the brink
 and countless vessels the defenders sink

 cxxxii
 charged with saltpetre oil or sulphur pale
 one and the other or with such like gear
 while ours intent the paynims that assail
 the town should pay their daring folly dear
 who from the ditch on different parts would scale
 the inner bulwark's platform when they hear
 the appointed signal which their comrades raise
 set at fit points the wildfire in a blaze

 cxxxiii
 for that the moat was full from side to side
 the scattered flames united into one
 and mounted to such height they wellnigh dried
 the watery bosom of the moon a dun
 and dismal cloud above extending wide
 dimmed every glimpse of light and hid the sun
 a fearful crash with a continued sound
 like a long peal of thunder shook the ground

 cxxxiv
 a horrid concert a rude harmony
 of deep lament and yell and shriek which came
 from those poor wretches in extremity
 perishing through their furious leader's blame
 was heard as in strange concord to agree
 with the fierce crackling of the murderous flame
 no more of this no more  here sir i close
 my canto hoarse and needing short repose


 canto 15

 argument
 round about paris every where are spread
 the assailing hosts of africa and spain
 astolpho home by logistilla sped
 binds first caligorantes with his chain
 next from orrilo's trunk divides the head
 with whom sir aquilant had warred in vain
 and gryphon bold next sansonet discerns
 ill tidings of his lady gryphon learns


 i
 though conquest fruit of skill or fortune be
 to conquer always is a glorious thing
 'tis true indeed a bloody victory
 is to a chief less honour wont to bring
 and that fair field is famed eternally
 and he who wins it merits worshipping
 who saving from all harm his own without
 loss to his followers puts the foe to rout

 ii
 you sir earned worthy praise when you o'erbore
 the lion of such might by sea and so
 did by him where he guarded either shore
 from francolino to the mouth of po
 that i though yet again i heard him roar
 if you were present should my fear forego
 how fields are fitly won was then made plain
 for we were rescued and your foemen slain

 iii
 this was the paynim little skilled to do
 who was but daring to his proper loss
 and to the moat impelled his meiny who
 one and all perished in the burning fosse
 the mighty gulf had not contained the crew
 but that devouring those who sought to cross
 them into dust the flame reduced that room
 might be for all within the crowded tomb

 iv
 of twenty thousand warriors thither sent
 died nineteen thousand in the fiery pit
 who to the fosse descended ill content
 but so their leader willed of little wit
 extinguished amid such a blaze and spent
 by the devouring flame the christians lit
 and rodomont occasion of their woes
 exempted from the mighty mischief goes

 v
 for he to the inner bank by foes possest
 across the ditch had vaulted wonderously
 had he within it been among the rest
 it sure had been his last assault his eye
 he turns and when the wildfires which infest
 the infernal vale he sees ascend so high
 and hears his people's moan and dying screams
 with imprecations dread he heaven blasphemes

 vi
 this while a band king agramant had brought
 to make a fierce assault upon a gate
 for while the cruel battle here was fought
 wherein so many sufferers met their fate
 this haply unprovided had he thought
 with fitting guard upon the monarch wait
 king bambirago 'mid his knights of price
 and baliverso sink of every vice

 vii
 and corineus of mulga prusion
 the wealthy monarch of the blessed isles
 malabuferzo he who fills the throne
 of fez where a perpetual summer smiles
 and other noble lords and many a one
 wellarmed and tried and others 'mid their files
 naked and base whose hearts in martial fields
 had found no shelter from a thousand shields

 viii
 but all things counter to the hopes ensue
 of agramant upon his side within
 in person girded by a gallant crew
 is charlemagne with many a paladin
 ogier the duke king salamon the two
 guidos are seen and either angelin
 bavaria's duke and ganelon are here
 avino avolio otho and berlinghier

 ix
 and of inferior count withal a horde
 of lombards french and germans without end
 who every one in presence of his lord
 to rank among the valiantest contend
 this will i in another place record
 who here a mighty duke perforce attend
 who signs to me from far and prays that i
 will not omit him in my history

 x
 'tis time that i should measure back my way
 thither where i astolpho left of yore
 who in long exile loathing more to stay
 burnt with desire to tread his native shore
 as hopes to him had given the sober fay
 who quelled alcina by her better lore
 she with all care would send the warrior back
 by the securest and the freest track

 xi
 and thus by her a barque is fitted out
  a better galley never ploughed the sea
 and logistilla wills for aye in doubt
 of hinderance from alcina's treachery
 that good andronica with squadron stout
 and chaste sophrosina with him shall be
 till to the arabian sea beneath their care
 or to the persian gulf he safe repair

 xii
 by scyth and indian she prefers the peer
 should coast and by the nabataean reign
 content he after such a round should veer
 for persian gulf or erithraean main
 rather than for that boreal palace steer
 where angry winds aye vex the rude domain
 so ill at seasons favoured by the sun
 that there for months together light is none

 xiii
 next when she all in readiness espied
 her license to depart the prudent fay
 accorded to the duke first fortified
 with counsel as to things too long to say
 and that he might no more by charms be stayed
 in place from whence he could not wend his way
 him with a useful book and fair purveyed
 and ever for her love to wear it prayed

 xiv
 how man should guard himself from magic cheats
 the book instructed which the fay bestowed
 at the end or the beginning where it treats
 of such an index and appendix showed
 another gift which in its goodly feats
 all other gifts excelled to her he owed
 this was a horn which made whatever wight
 should hear its clang betake himself to flight

 xv
 i say the horn is of such horrid sound
 that wheresoe'er 'tis heard all fly for fear
 nor in the world is one of heart so sound
 that would not fly should he the bugle hear
 wind thunder and the shock which rives the ground
 come not in aught the hideous clangour near
 with thanks did the good englishman receive
 the gift and of the fairy took his leave

 xvi
 quitting the port and smoother waves they stand
 to sea with favouring wind which blows astern
 and coasting round the rich and populous land
 of odoriferous ind the vessels turn
 opening a thousand isles on either hand
 scattered about that sea till they discern
 the land of thomas here the pilot veers
 his ready tiller and more northward steers

 xvii
 astolpho furrowing that ocean hoar
 marks as he coasts the wealthy land at ease
 ganges amid the whitening waters roar
 nigh skirting now the golden chersonese
 taprobana with cori next and sees
 the frith which chafes against its double shore
 makes distant cochin and with favouring wind
 issues beyond the boundaries of ind

 xviii
 scouring at large broad ocean with a guide
 so faithful and secure the cavalier
 questions andronica if from that side
 named from the westering sun of this our sphere
 bark which with oars or canvas stemmed the tide
 on eastern sea was wonted to appear
  and could a wight who loosed from indian strand
 reach france or britain without touching land

 xix
 andronica to england's duke replies
 "know that this earth is girt about with seas
 and all to one another yield supplies
 whether the circling waters boil or freeze
 but since the aethiops' land before us lies
 extending southward many long degrees
 across his waters some one has supposed
 a barrier here to neptune interposed

 xx
 "hence bark from this levant of ind is none
 which weighs to shape her course for europe's shore
 nor navigates from europe any one
 our oriental regions to explore
 fain to retrace alike the course begun
 by the mid land extending wide before
 weening its limits of such length appear
 that it must join another hemisphere

 xxi
 "but in the course of circling years i view
 from farthest lands which catch the western ray
 new argonauts put forth and tiphys new
 opening till now an undiscovered way
 others i see coast afric and pursue
 so far the negroes' burning shore that they
 pass the far sign from whence on his return
 the sun moves hither leaving capricorn

 xxii
 "and find the limit of this length of land
 which makes a single sea appear as two
 who scouring in their frigates every strand
 pass ind and arab isles or persian through
 others i see who leave on either hand
 the banks which stout alcides cleft in two
 and in the manner of the circling sun
 to seek new lands and new creations run

 xxiii
 "the imperial flags and holy cross i know
 fixed on the verdant shore see some upon
 the shattered barks keep guard and others go
 afield by whom new countries will be won
 ten chase a thousand of the flying foe
 realms beyond ind subdued by arragon
 and see all wheresoe'er the warriors wend
 to the fifth charles' triumphant captains bend

 xxiv
 "that this way should be hidden was god's will
 of old and ere 'twas known long time should run
 nor will he suffer its discovery till
 the sixth and seventh century be done
 and he delays his purpose to fulfil
 in that he would subject the world to one
 the justest and most fraught with prudent lore
 or emperors since augustus or before

 xxv
 "of arragon and austria's blood i see
 on the left bank of rhine a monarch bred
 no sovereign is so famed in history
 of all whose goodly deeds are heard or read
 astraea reinthroned by him will be 
 rather restored to life long seeming dead
 and virtues with her into exile sent
 by him shall be recalled from banishment

 xxvi
 "for such desert heaven's bounty not alone
 designs he should the imperial garland bear 
 augustus' trajan's mark's severus' crown
 but that of every farthest land should wear
 which here and there extends as yet unknown
 yielding no passage to the sun and year
 and wills that in his time christ's scattered sheep
 should be one flock beneath one shepherd's keep

 xxvii
 "and that this be accomplished with more ease
 writ in the skies from all eternity
 captains invincible by lands and seas
 shall heavenly providence to him supply
 i mark hernando cortez bring 'mid these
 new cities under caesar's dynasty
 and kingdoms in the orient so remote
 that we of these in india have no note

 xxviii
 "with prospero colonna puissant peer
 a marquis of pescara i behold 
 a youth of guasto next who render dear
 hesperia to the flowerdeluce of gold
 i see prepared to enter the career
 this third who shall the laurel win and hold
 as a good horse before the rest will dart
 and first attain the goal though last to start

 xxix
 "i see such faith such valour in the deeds
 of young alphonso such his name confest
 he in his unripe age  nor he exceeds
 his sixth and twentieth year  at caesar's hest
 a mighty trust the imperial army leads
 saving which caesar not alone the rest
 of his fair empire saves but may the world
 reduce with ensigns by this chief unfurled

 xxx
 "as with these captains where the way by land
 is free he spreads the ancient empire's sway
 so on the sea which severs europe's strand
 from afric open to the southern day
 when with good doria linked in friendly band
 victorious he shall prove in every fray
 this is that andrew doria who will sweep
 from pirates on all sides your midland deep

 xxxi
 "pompey though he chased rovers everywhere
 was not his peer for ill the thievish brood
 vanquished by him in puissance could compare
 with the most mighty realm that ever stood
 but doria singly will of the corsair
 with his own forces purge the briny flood
 so that i see each continent and isle
 quake at his name from calpe to the nile

 xxxii
 "beneath the faith beneath the warrantry
 of the redoubted chief of whom i say
 i see charles enter fertile italy
 to which this captain clears the monarch's way
 but on his country not himself that fee
 shall he bestow which is his labour's pay
 and beg her freedom where himself perchance
 another would to sovereign rule advance

 xxxiii
 "the pious love he bears his native land
 honours him more than any battle's gain
 which julius ever won on afric's strand
 or in thine isle france thessaly or spain
 nor great octavius does more praise command
 nor anthony who jousted for the reign
 with equal arms in that the wrong outweighs
  done to their native land  their every praise

 xxxiv
 "let these and every other wight who tries
 to subject a free country blush for shame
 nor dare in face of man to lift his eyes
 where he hears andrew doria's honoured name
 to him i see charles other meed supplies
 for he beside his leaders' common claim
 bestows upon the chief the sumptuous state
 whence norman bands their power in puglia date

 xxxv
 "not only to this captain courtesy
 shall charles display still liberal of his store
 but to all those who for the empery
 in his emprizes have not spared their gore
 him to bestow a town  a realm  i see
 upon a faithful friend rejoicing more
 and on all such as have good service done
 than in new kingdom and new empire won"

 xxxvi
 thus of the victories by land and main
 which when long course of years shall be complete
 charles' worthy captains for their lord will gain
 andronica did with astolpho treat
 this while now loosening tightening now the rein
 on the eastern winds which blow upon their feet
 making this serve or that her comrade stands
 while the blasts rise or sink as she commands

 xxxvii
 this while they saw as for their port they made
 how wide the persian sea extends to sight
 whence in few days the squadron was conveyed
 nigh the famed gulf from ancient magi hight
 here they found harbourage and here were stayed
 their wandering barks which stern to shore were dight
 secure from danger from alcina's wrath
 the duke by land continued hence his path

 xxxviii
 he pricks through many a field and forest blind
 by many a vale and many a mountain gray
 where robbers now before and now behind
 oft threat the peer by night or open day
 lion and dragon oft of poisonous kind
 and other savage monsters cross his way
 but he no sooner has his bugle wound
 than these are scared and scattered by the sound

 xxxix
 through araby the blest he fares where grow
 thickets of myrrh and gums odorous ooze
 where the sole phoenix makes her nest although
 the world is all before her where to choose
 and to the avenging sea which whelmed the foe
 of israel his way the duke pursues
 in which king pharaoh and his host were lost
 from whence he to the land of heroes crost

 xl
 astolpho along trajan's channel goes
 upon that horse which has no earthly peer
 and moves so lightly that the soft sand shows
 no token of the passing cavalier
 who prints not grass prints not the driven snows
  who dryshod would the briny billows clear
 and strains so nimbly in the course he wind
 and thunderbolt and arrow leaves behind 

 xli
 erst argalia's courser which was born
 from a close union of the wind and flame
 and nourished not by hay or heartening corn
 fed on pure air and rabican his name
 his way the bearer of the magic horn
 following where nile received that river came
 but ere he at its outlet could arrive
 towards him saw a pinnace swiftly drive

 xlii
 a hermit in the poop the bark did guide
 with snowy beard descending to mid breast
 who when from far the paladin be spied
 him to ascend his ready pinnace prest
 "my son unless thou loathest life he cried
 and wouldst that death today thy course arrest
 content thee in my bark to cross the water
 for yonder path conducts thee straight to slaughter

 xliii
 "within six miles no further shalt thou light
 pursued the hermit on the bloody seat
 where dwells a giant horrible to sight
 exceeding every stature by eight feet
 from him wayfaring man or errant knight
 would vainly hope with life to make retreat
 for some the felon quarters some he flays
 and some he swallows quick and some he slays

 xliv
 "he 'mid the cruel horrors he intends
 takes pleasure in a net by cunning hands
 contrived which near his mansion he extends
 so well concealed beneath the crumbling sands
 that whoso uninstructed thither wends
 nought of the subtle mischief understands
 and so the giant scares him with his cries
 that he within the toils in terror flies

 xlv
 "whom with loud laughter to his seat hard by
 he drags along enveloped in his snare
 and knight and damsel views with equal eye
 and for his prisoners' worth has little care
 then having sucked their brains and lifeblood dry
 casts forth their bones upon the desert lair
 and round about his griesly palace pins
 for horrid ornament their bloody skins

 xlvi
 "take this  my son oh take this other way
 which thee will to the sea in safety guide"
 "i thank thee holy father for thy say
 to him the fearless cavalier replied
 but cannot peril against honour weigh
 far dearer than my life to the other side
 me vainly dost thou move to pass the wave
 rather for this i seek the giant's cave

 xlvii
 "i with dishonour life to flight may owe
 but worse than death loath thus to save my head
 the worst that can befall me if i go
 is i my blood shall with the others shed
 but if on me such mercy god bestow
 that i remain alive the giant dead
 secure for thousands shall i make the ways
 so that the greater good the risque o'erpays

 xlviii
 "i peril but the single life of one
 against safety of the countless rest"
  "go then in peace" the other said "my son
 and to thy succour form among the blest
 may god dispatch the archangel michael down"
  and him with that the simple hermit blest
 astolpho pricks along nile's rosy strand
 more in his horn confiding than his brand

 xlix
 between the mighty river and the fen
 a path upon the sandy shore doth lie
 barred by the giant's solitary den
 cut off from converse with humanity
 about it heads and naked limbs of men
 were fixed the victims of his cruelty
 window or battlements was not whence strung
 might not be seen some wretched prisoner hung

 l
 as in hillfarm or castle fenced with moat
 the hunter mindful what his dangers were
 aye fastens on his door the shaggy coat
 and horrid paws and monstrous head of bear
 so showed the giant those of greatest note
 who thither brought had perished in his snare
 the bones of countless others wide were spread
 and every ditch with human blood was red

 li
 caligorant was standing at the gate
 for so was the despiteous monster hight
 who decked his house with corpses as for state
 some theirs with cloth of gold and scarlet dight
 he scarce contained himself for joy so great
 his pleasure when the duke appeared in sight
 for 'twas two months complete a third was near
 since by that road had past a cavalier

 lii
 towards the marish where green rushes grow
 he hastes intending from that covert blind
 to double on his unsuspecting foe
 and issue on the cavalier behind
 for him to drive into the net below
 the sand the griesly giant had designed
 as others trapt he had been wont to see
 brought thither by their evil destiny

 liii
 when him the wary paladin espied
 he stopt his courser not without great heed
 lest he into the covert snare might tide
 forewarned of this by the good hermit's rede
 here to his horn for succour he applied
 nor failed its wonted virtue in this need
 it smote the giant's heart with such affright
 that he turned back and homeward fled outright

 liv
 astolpho blew still watchful of surprise
 weening to see the engine sprung fast flew
 the giant  as if heart as well as eyes
 the thief had lost  nor whitherward he knew
 such is his fear he kens not as he flies
 how is own covert mischief to eschew
 he runs into the net which closing round
 hampers the wretch and drags him to the ground

 lv
 astolpho who beholds his bulky prey
 fall bodily drives thither at full speed
 secure himself and bent  to make him pay
 the price of slaughtered thousands  quits his steed
 yet after deems a helpless wight to slay
 no valour were but rather foul misdeed
 for him arms neck and feet so closely tied
 he could not shake himself the warrior spied

 lvi
 with subtle thread of steel had vulcan wrought
 the net of old and with such cunning pain
 he who to break its weakest mesh had sought
 would have bestowed his time and toil in vain
 it was with this he mars and venus caught
 who hands and feet were fettered by the chain
 nor did the jealous husband weave the thread
 for aught but to surprise that pair in bed

 lvii
 mercury from the smith conveyed the prize
 wanting to take young chloris in the snare
 sweet chloris who behind aurora flies
 at rise of sun through fields of liquid air
 and from her gathered garment through the skies
 scatters the violet rose and lily fair
 he for this nymph his toils so deftly set
 one day in air he took her with the net

 lviii
 the nymph it seems was taken as she flew
 where the great aethiop river meets the brine
 the net was treasured in canopus through
 successive ages in anubis' shrine
 after three thousand years caligorant drew
 the sacred relict from the palace divine
 whence with the net the impious thief returned
 who robbed the temple and the city burned

 lix
 he fixed it here beneath the sandy plain
 in mode that all the travellers whom he chased
 ran into it and the engine was with pain
 touched ere it arms and feet and neck embraced
 from this the good astolpho took a chain
 and with the gyve his hands behind him laced
 his arms and breast he swaddled in such guise
 he could not loose himself then let him rise

 lx
 after his other knots unfastening
 for he was turned more gentle than a maid
 astolpho as a show the thief would bring
 by city boroughtown and farm conveyed
 the net as well than which no quainter thing
 was ever by the file and hammer made
 on him like sumpternag he laid the load
 in triumph led behind him on his road

 lxi
 him helm and shield he gives alike to bear
 as to a valet hence proceeds the peer
 gladdening the fearful pilgrim every where
 who joys to think henceforth his way is clear
 so far an end does bold astolpho fare
 he is to memphis' tombs already near 
 memphis renowned for pyramids in sight
 he marks the populous cairo opposite

 lxii
 ran all the people in tumultuous tide
 to see him drag the unmeasured wight along
 "how can it be" each to his fellow cried
 "that one so weak could master one so strong"
 scarce can astolpho put the press aside
 so close from every part their numbers throng
 while all admire him as a cavalier
 of mighty worth and make him goodly cheer

 lxiii
 then cairo was not such as common cry
 pronounces in our age that costly seat
  that eighteen thousand districts ill supply
 lodging to those who in her markets meet
  and though the houses are three stories high
 numbers are forced to sleep in the open street
 and that the soldan has a palace there
 of wonderous size and passing rich and fair

 lxiv
 and therein christian renegadoes all
 keeps fifteen thousand vassals for his needs
 beneath one roof supplied with bower and stall
 themselves and wives and families and steeds
 the duke desired to see the river's fall
 and how far nile into the sea proceeds
 at damietta where wayfaring wight
 he heard was prisoner made or slain outright

 lxv
 for at nile's outlet there beside his bed
 a sturdy thief was sheltered in a tower
 alike the native's and the stranger's dread
 wont even to cairo's gate the road to scower
 him no one could resist and it was said
 that man to slay the felon had no power
 a hundred thousand wounds he had in strife
 received yet none could ever take his life

 lxvi
 to see if he could break the thread which tied
 the felon's life upon his way the knight
 set forward and to damietta hied
 to find orrilo so the thief was hight
 thence to the river's outlet past and spied
 the sturdy castle on the margin dight
 harboured in which the enchanted demon lay
 the fruit of a hobgoblin and a fay

 lxvii
 he here orrilo and two knights in mail
 found at fierce strife the two ill held their own
 against him so orrilo did assail
 the warlike pair although himself alone
 and how much either might in arms avail
 fame through the universal world had blown
 of oliviero's seed was either plant
 gryphon the white and sable aquilant

 lxviii
 the necromancer had this while to say
 the truth with vantage on his side begun
 the fight who brought a monster to the fray
 found only in those parts and wont to won
 ashore or under water and to prey
 for food on human bodies feeding on
 poor mariners and travelling men who fare
 of the impending danger unaware

 lxix
 the monster slaughtered by the brethren two
 upon the sand beside the haven lies
 and hence no wrong they to orrilo do
 assailing him together in this guise
 him they dismembered often and not slew
 now he  because dismembered  ever dies
 for he replaces leg or hand like wax
 which the good faulchion from his body hacks

 lxx
 gryphon and aquilant by turns divide
 now to the teeth now breast the enchanted wight
 the fruitless blow orrilo does deride
 while the two baffled warriors rage for spite
 let him who falling silver has espied
 which mercury by alchymists is hight
 scatter and reunite each broken member
 hearing my tale what he has seen remember

 lxxi
 if the thief's head be severed by the pair
 he lights and staggers till he finds it now
 uptaken by the nose or by the hair
 and fastened to the neck i know not how
 this sometimes gryphon takes and whirled through air
 whelms in the stream but bootless is the throw
 for like a fish can fierce orrilo swim
 and safely with the head regains the brim

 lxxii
 two ladies meetly clad in fair array
 one damsel was in black and one in white
 and who had been the occasion of that fray
 stood by to gaze upon the cruel fight
 either of these was a benignant fay
 whose care had nourished one and the other knight
 oliver's children when the babes forlorn
 they from the claws of two huge birds had torn

 lxxiii
 since from gismonda they had these conveyed
 borne to a distance from their native sky
 but more to say were needless since displaid
 to the whole world has been their history
 though the author has the father's name missaid
 one for another how i know not i
 mistaking now this fearful strife the pair
 of warriors waged at both the ladies' prayer

 lxxiv
 though it was noon in the happy islands day
 had vanished in this clime displaced by night
 and underneath the moon's uncertain ray
 and illdiscerned were all things hid from sight
 when to the fort orrilo took his way
 since both the sable sister and the white
 were pleased the furious battle to defer
 till a new sun should in the horizon stir

 lxxv
 the duke who by their ensigns and yet more
 had by the sight of many a vigorous blow
 gryphon and aquilant long time before
 agnized to greet the brethren was not slow
 and they who in the peer victorious o'er
 the giant whom he led a captive know
 the baron of the pard so styled at court
 him to salute with no less love resort

 lxxvi
 the ladies to repose the warriors led
 to a fair palace near their sumptuous seat
 thence issuing courtly squire and damsel sped
 them with lit torches in midway to meet
 their goodly steeds they quit there well bested
 put off their arms and in a garden sweet
 discern the ready supper duly laid
 fast by where a refreshing fountain played

 lxxvii
 here they bid bind the giant on the green
 fasttethered by a strong and weighty chain
 to a tough oak whose ancient trunk they ween
 may well be proof against a single strain
 with that by ten good serjeants overseen
 lest he by night get loose and so the train
 assault and haply harm while careless they
 without a guard and unsuspecting lay

 lxxviii
 at the abundant and most sumptuous board
 with costly viands its least pleasure fraught
 the longest topic for discourse afford
 orrilo's prowess and the marvel wrought
 for head or arm dissevered by the sword
 they who upon the recent wonder thought
 might think a dream to see him reunite
 and but return more furious to the fight

 lxxix
 astolpho in his book had found exprest
 that which prescribed a remedy for spell
 how he who of one hair deprived the pest
 only could him in battle hope to quell
 but this plucked out or sheared he from his breast
 parforce the felon's spirit would expell
 so says the volume but instructs not where
 'mid locks so thickly set to find the hair

 lxxx
 the duke no less with hope of conquest glows
 than if the palm he has already won
 as he that hopes with small expense of blows
 to pluck the hair the wizardwight undone
 hence does he to the youthful pair propose
 the burden of that enterprize upon
 himself to take orrilo will he slay
 if the two brethren nought the intent gainsay

 lxxxi
 but willingly to him these yield the emprize
 assured his toil will be bestowed in vain
 and now a new aurora climbs the skies
 and from his walls orrilo on the plain
 drops  and the strife begins  orrilo plies
 the mace the duke the sword he 'mid a rain
 of strokes would from the body at one blow
 divorce the spirit of the enchanted foe

 lxxxii
 together with the mace he lops the fist
 and now this arm now the other falls to ground
 sometimes he cleaves the corslet's iron twist
 and piecemeal shares and maims the felon round
 orrilo reunites the portions missed
 found on the champagne and again is sound
 and though into a hundred fragments hewed
 astolpho sees him in a thought renewed

 lxxxiii
 after a thousand blows astolpho sped
 one stroke above the shoulders and below
 the chin which lopt away both helm and head
 nor lights the duke less swiftly than his foe
 then grasps the hair defiled with gore and red
 springs in a moment on his horse and lo
 upstream with it along nile's margin hies
 so that the thief cannot retake the prize

 lxxxiv
 that fool who had not marked the warrior's feat
 was searching in the dust to find his head
 but when he heard the charger in retreat
 who through the forest with the plunder fled
 leapt quickly into his own courser's seat
 and in pursuit of bold astolpho sped
 fain had orrilo shouted "hola stay"
 but that the duke had borne his mouth away

 lxxxv
 yet pleased astolpho had not in like guise
 borne off his heels pursues with flowing rein
 him rabican who marvellously flies
 distances by a mighty length of plain
 this while the wizard's head astolpho eyes
 from poll to front above the eyebrows twain
 searching in haste if he the hair can see
 which makes orrilo's immortality

 lxxxvi
 amid innumerable locks no hair
 straiter or crisper than the rest was seen
 how then should good astolpho in his care
 to slay the thief so many choose between
 "to cut them all he said it better were"
 and since he scissors lacked and razor keen
 he wanting these resorted to his glaive
 which cut so well it might be said to shave

 lxxxvii
 and holding by the nose the severed head
 closesheared it all behind and eke before
 he found among the rest the fatal thread
 then pale became the visage changing sore
 turned up its eyes and signals sore and dread
 of the last agony of nature wore
 and the headless body seated in the sell
 shuddered its last and from the courser fell

 lxxxviii
 the duke returns where he the champions two
 and dames had left the trophy in his hand
 which manifests of death the tokens true
 and shows the distant body on the sand
 i know not if they this with pleasure view
 though him they welcome with demeanour bland
 for the intercepted victory might pain
 perchance inflict upon the envying twain

 lxxxix
 nor do i think that either gentle fay
 with pleasure could that battle's issue see
 since those kind dames because they would delay
 the doleful fate which shortly was to be
 in france the brethren's lot had in that fray
 with fierce orrilo matched the warriors free
 and so to occupy the pair had cast
 till the sad influence of the skies were past

 xc
 when to the castellan was certified
 in damietta that the thief was dead
 he loosed a carrier pigeon having tied
 beneath her wing a letter by a thread
 she went to cairo and to scatter wide
 the news another from that town was sped
 such is the usage there so egypt through
 in a few hours the joyful tidings flew

 xci
 as he had brought the adventure to an end
 the duke now sought the noble youths to stir
 though of themselves that way their wishes tend
 nor they to whet that purpose need the spur
 that they the church from outrage to defend
 and rights of charles the roman emperor
 would cease to war upon that eastern strand
 and would seek honour in their native land

 xcii
 gryphon and aquilant thus bid adieu
 one and the other to his lady fair
 who though it sorely troubled them ill knew
 how to resist the wishes of the pair
 the duke together with the warlike two
 turns to the right resolved to worship where
 god erst incarnate dwelt the holy places
 ere he to cherished france his way retraces

 xciii
 the warriors to the lefthand might incline
 as plainer and more full of pleasant cheer
 where still along the sea extends their line
 but take the righthand path abrupt and drear
 since the chief city of all palestine
 by six days' journey is through this more near
 water there is along this rugged track
 and grass all other needful matters lack

 xciv
 so that before they enter on their road
 all that is needful they collect and lay
 upon the giant's back the bulky load
 who could a tower upon his neck convey
 the holy land a mountainsummit showed
 at finishing their rough and salvage way
 where heavenly love a willing offering stood
 and washed away our errors with his blood

 xcv
 they at the entrance of the city view
 a gentle stripling and in him the three
 agnize sir sansonet of mecca who
 was in youth's flower for sovereign chivalry
 for sovereign goodness famed the country through
 and wise beyond his years from paganry
 converted by orlando to the truth
 who had with his own hands baptized the youth

 xcvi
 designing there a fortilage in front
 of egypt's caliph they the warrior found
 and with a wall two miles in length the mount
 of calvary intending to surround
 received with such a countenance as is wont
 to be of inward love the surest ground
 them he conducted to his royal home
 and with all comfort harboured in the dome

 xcvii
 as deputy the sainted land he swayed
 conferred on him by charlemagne in trust
 to him the english duke a present made
 of that so sturdy and unmeasured beast
 that it ten draught horse burdens had conveyed
 so monstrous was the giant and next gave
 the net in which he took the unwieldy slave

 xcviii
 in quittance sansonet his sword to bear
 gave a rich girdle to astolpho bold
 and spurs for either heel a costly pair
 with bucklers and with rowels made of gold
 which 'twas believed the warrior's relicts were
 who freed the damsel from that dragon old
 spoils which sir sansonet with many more
 from joppa when he took the city bore

 xcix
 cleansed of their errors in a monastery
 from whence the odour of good works upwent
 they of christ's passion every mystery
 contemplating through all the churches went
 which now to our eternal infamy
 foul moor usurp what time on strife intent
 all europe rings with arms and martial deeds
 and war is everywhere but where it needs

 c
 while grace the warlike three devoutly sought
 intent on pardon and on pious lore
 a grecian pilgrim known to gryphon brought
 tidings which ill the afflicted champion bore
 from his longcherished vow and former thought
 too foreign too remote and these so sore
 inflamed his troubled breast and bred such care
 they wholly turned aside his mind from prayer

 ci
 for his misfortune one of lovely feature
 sir gryphon worshipped origilla hight
 of fairer visage and of better stature
 not one among a thousand meets the sight
 but faithless and of such an evil nature
 that thou mightst town and city search outright
 and continent and island far and near
 yet never as i think wouldst find her peer

 cii
 in constantine's imperial city burned
 with a fierce fever he had left the fair
 and hoped to find her to that place returned
 lovelier than ever and enjoy her there
 but she to antioch as the warrior learned
 had with another leman made repair
 thinking while such fresh youth was yet her own
 'twere not a thing to brook  to sleep alone

 ciii
 sir gryphon from the time he heard the news
 had evermore bemoaned him day or night
 whatever pleasure other wight pursues
 seems but the more to vex his troubled sprite
 let each reflect who to his mischief woos
 how keenly tempered are love's darts of might
 and heavier than all ills the torment fell
 in that he was ashamed his grief to tell

 civ
 this for that aquilant had oft before
 reproved him for the passion which he nursed
 and sought to banish her from his heart's core
  her who of all bad women is the worst
 he still had censured in his wiser lore
 if by his brother aquilant accurst
 her gryphon in his partial love excuses
 for mostly selfconceit our sense abuses

 cv
 it therefore is his purpose without say
 to aquilant alone to take the quest
 as far as antioch and bear her away
 who had borne off his heartcore from his breast
 to find him who had made the dame his prey
 and take such vengeance of him ere he rest
 as shall for aye be told my next will tell
 how he effected this and what befell

 and to my cost in these so well am read
 that i can speak of them as 'twere my art
 hence if i say or if i ever said
 did speech or living page my thoughts impart
 "one ill is grievous and another light"
 yield me belief and deem my judgment right

 ii
 i say i said and while i live will say
 "he who is fettered by a worthy chain
 though his desire his lady should gainsay
 and every way averse his suit disdain
 though love deprive him of all praised pay
 after long time and trouble spent in vain
 he if his heart be placed well worthily
 needs not lament though he should waste and die"

 iii
 let him lament who plays a slavish part
 whom two bright eyes and lovely tresses please
 beneath which beauties lurks a wanton heart
 with little that is pure and much of lees
 the wretch would fly but bears in him a dart
 like wounded stag whichever way he flees
 dares not confess yet cannot quench his flame
 and of himself and worthless love has shame

 iv
 the youthful gryphon finds him in this case
 who sees the error which he cannot right
 he sees how vilely he his heart does place
 on faithless origille his vain delight
 yet evil use doth sovereign reason chase
 and free will is subdued by appetite
 though a foul mind the lady's actions speak
 her wheresoe'er she is must gryphon seek

 v
 resuming the fair history i say
 out of the city he in secret rode
 nor to his brother would his plan bewray
 who oft on him had vain reproof bestowed
 but to the left t'wards ramah shaped his way
 by the most level and most easy road
 him six days' journey to damascus brought
 whence setting out anew he antioch sought

 vi
 he nigh damascus met the lover who
 perfidious origilla's heart possest
 and matched in evil customs were the two
 like stalk and flower for that in either's breast
 was lodged a fickle heart the dame untrue
 and he a traitor whom she loved the best
 while both the lovers hid their nature base
 to others' cost beneath a courteous face

 vii
 as i relate to you the cavalier
 came on huge courser trapped with mickle pride
 with faithless origille in gorgeous gear
 with gold embroidered and with azure dyed
 two ready knaves who serve the warrior rear
 the knightly helm and buckler at his side
 as one who with fair pomp and semblance went
 towards damascus to a tournament

 viii
 damascus' king a splendid festival
 had in these days bid solemnly proclaim
 and with what pomp they could upon his call
 thither in shining arms the champions came
 at gryphon's sight the harlot's spirits fall
 who fears that he will work her scathe and shame
 and knows her lover has not force and breath
 to save her from sir gryphon threatening death

 ix
 but like most cunning and audacious quean
 although she quakes from head to foot with fear
 her voice so strengthens and so shapes her mien
 that in her face no signs of dread appear
 having already made her leman ween
 the trick devised she feigns a joyous cheer
 towards sir gryphon goes and for long space
 hangs on his neck fastlocked in her embrace

 x
 she after suiting with much suavity
 the action to the word sore weeping cried
 "dear lord is this the guerdon due to me
 for love and worship that i should abide
 alone one live long year deprived of thee
  a second near  and yet upon thy side
 no grief  and had i borne for thee to stay
 i know not if i should have seen that day

 xi
 "when i from nicosia thee expected
 when thou wast journeying to the plenar court
 to cheer me  left with fever sore infected
 and in the dread of death  i heard report
 that thou wast gone to syria and dejected
 by that ill tiding suffered in such sort
 i all unable to pursue thy quest
 had nigh with this right hand transfixt my breast

 xii
 "but fortune by her double bounty shows
 she guards me more than thou me to convey
 she sent my brother here who with me goes
 my honour safe in his protecting stay
 and this encounter with thee now bestows
 which i above all other blessings weigh
 and in good time for hadst thou longer stayed
 my lord i should have died of hope delayed"

 xiii
 the wicked woman full of subtlety
 worse than a fox in crafty hardihood
 pursues and so well shapes her history
 she wholly throws the blame on gryphon good
 makes him believe that other not to be
 her kin alone but of her flesh and blood
 got by one father  and so puts upon
 the knight that he less credits luke and john

 xiv
 nor he the fraud of her more false than fair
 only forbore with just reproach to pay
 nor only did the threatened stranger spare
 who was the lover of that lady gay
 but deemed to excuse himself sufficient were
 turning some portion of the blame away
 and as the real brother she profest
 unceasingly the lady's knight carest

 xv
 and to damascus with the cavalier
 returned who to sir gryphon made report
 that syria's wealthy king with sumptuous cheer
 within that place would hold a splendid court
 and who baptized or infidel appear
 there at his tourney of whatever sort
 within the city and without assures
 from wrong for all the time the feast endures

 xvi
 yet i of origilla's treachery
 shall not so steadfastly pursue the lore
 who famed not for one single perfidy
 thousands and thousands had betrayed before
 but that i will return again to see
 two hundred thousand wretched men or more
 burnt by the raging wildfire where they spread
 about the walls of paris scathe and dread

 xvii
 i left you where king agramant prepared
 to storm a gate and to the assault was gone
 this he had hoped to find without a guard
 and work elsewhere to bar the way was none
 for there in person charles kept watch and ward
 with many practised warriors every one
 two angelines two guidos angelier
 avino avolio otho and berlinghier

 xviii
 one and the other host its worth before
 charles and king agramant desire to show
 where praise where riches are they think in store
 for those that do their duty on the foe
 but such were not the atchievements of the moor
 as to repair the loss for to his woe
 full many a saracen the champaign prest
 whose folly was a beacon to the rest

 xix
 the frequent darts a storm of hail appear
 which from the citywall the christians fling
 the deafening clamours put the heavens in fear
 which from our part and from that other ring
 but charles and agramant must wait for here
 i of the mars of africa will sing
 king rodomont that fierce and fearful man
 that through the middle of the city ran

 xx
 i know not sir if you the adventure dread
 of that so daring moor to mind recall
 the leader who had left his people dead
 between the second work and outer wall
 upon those limbs the ravening fire so fed
 was never sight more sad  i told withal
 how vaulting o'er that hindrance at a bound
 he cleared the moat which girt the city round

 xxi
 when he was known the thickening crowd among
 by the strange arms he wore and scaly hide
 there where the aged sires and feebler throng
 listened to each new tale on every side
 heavenhigh groan moan and lamentation rung
 and loud they beat their lifted palms and cried
 while those who had the strength to fly aloof
 sought safety not from house or temple's roof

 xxii
 but this the cruel sword concedes to few
 so brandished by that saracen robust
 and here with half a leg dissevered flew
 a foot there head divided from the bust
 this cleft across and that behold him hew
 from head to hips so strong the blow and just
 while of the thousands wounded by the moor
 is none that shows an honest scar before

 xxiii
 what by weak herd in fields of hircany
 the tiger does or indian ganges near
 or wolf by lamb or kid on heights which lie
 on typheus' back the cruel cavalier
 now executes on those i will not i
 call phalanxes or squadrons but a mere
 rabble that i should term a race forlorn
 who but deserved to die ere they were born

 xxiv
 of all he cuts and thrusts and maims and bleeds
 there is not one who looks him in the face
 throughout that street which in a straight line leads
 up to st michael's bridge so thronged a space
 rodomont terrible and fearful speeds
 whirling his bloody brand nor grants he grace
 in his career to servant or to lord
 and saint and sinner feel alike the sword

 xxv
 religion cannot for the priest bespeak
 mercy nor innocence avail the child
 nor gently beaming eyes nor vermeil cheek
 protect the blooming dame or damsel mild
 age smites its breast and flies while bent to wreak
 vengeance the saracen with gore defiled
 shows not his valour more than cruel rage
 heedless alike of order sex and age

 xxvi
 nor the impious king alone with human blood
  lord of the impious he  his hand distains
 but even on walls so sorely vents his mood
 he fires fair houses and polluted fanes
 the houses almost all were made of wood
 then as 'tis told and this by what remains
 may be believed for yet in paris we
 six out of ten no better builded see

 xxvii
 though flames demolish all things far and wide
 this ill appears his furious hate to slake
 where'er the paynim has his hands applied
 he tumbles down a roof at every shake
 my lord believe you never yet espied
 bombard in padua of so large a make
 that it could rend from wall of battered town
 what at a single pull the king plucked down

 xxviii
 while the accursed man amid the rout
 so warred with fire and sword if at his post
 king agramant had prest it from without
 the ample city had that day been lost
 but he was hindered by the warrior stout
 who came from england with the advancing host
 composed of english and of scotch allied
 with silence and the angel for their guide

 xxix
 it was god's will that while through town and tower
 the furious rodomont such ruin spread
 thither arrived rinaldo clermont's flower
 three leagues above he o'er the river's bed
 had cast a bridge from whence his english power
 to the lefthand by crooked ways he led
 that meaning to assail the barbarous foes
 the stream no obstacle might interpose

 xxx
 rinaldo had with edward sent a force
 six thousand strong of archer infantry
 and sped with ariman two thousand horse
 of lightest sort and foot and cavalry
 sought paris by those roads which have their course
 directly to and from the picard sea
 that by st martin's and st denys' gate
 they might convey the aid the burghers wait

 xxxi
 rinaldo sent with these the baggage train
 and carriages with which his troops were stored
 and fetching with the forces that remain
 a compass he the upper way explored
 he bridge and boat and means to pass the seine
 had with him for it here was ill to ford
 he past his army broke the bridges down
 and rank'd in line the bands of either crown

 xxxii
 but having first the peers and captains wheeled
 about him in a ring the cavalier
 mounted the bank which overtopt the field
 so much that all might plainly see and hear
 and cried "my lords you should thanksgiving yield
 with lifted hands to god who brought you here
 through whom o'er every nation you may gain
 eternal glory bought with little pain

 xxxiii
 "two princes by your means will rescued be
 if you relieve those city gates from siege
 him your own king whom you from slavery
 and death to save a subject's vows oblige
 and a famed emperor of more majesty
 than ever yet in court was served by liege
 and with them other kings and dukes and peers
 and lords of other lands and cavaliers

 xxxiv
 "so that one city saving not alone
 will the parisians bless your helping hand
 who sadder than for sorrows of their own
 timid afflicted and disheartened stand
 and their unhappy wives and children moan
 which share in the same peril and the band
 or virgins dedicate to heavenly spouse
 lest this day frustrate see their holy vows

 xxxv
  "i say this city saved from deadly wound
 not only will parisians hold you dear
 but habitants of all the countries round
 nor speak i only of the nations near
 for city there is none on christian ground
 but what has citizens beleaguered here
 so that to you for vanquishing the foe
 more lands than france will obligation owe

 xxxvi
 "if him the ancients with a crown endued
 who saved one citizen by worthy deed
 for rescuing such a countless multitude
 what recompense shall be your worthy meed
 but if from jealousy or sloth so good
 and holy enterprise should ill succeed
 believe me only while these walls endure
 is italy or almayn's realm secure

 xxxvii
 "or any other part where men adore
 him who for us upon the cross was hung
 nor think that distance saves you from the moor
 nor deem your island strong the waves among
 for if from far gibraltar's straits of yore
 and old alcides' pillars sailed the throng
 to bear off plunder from your seagirt strands
 what will they do when they possess our lands

 xxxviii
 "and if in this fair enterprise arrayed
 no gain no glory served you as a guide
 a common debt enjoins you mutual aid
 militant here upon one church's side
 moreover let not any be afraid
 our broken foemen will the assault abide
 who seem to me illtaught in warlike art
 a feeble rabble without arms or heart"

 xxxix
 such reasons and yet better for that need
 might good rinaldo in his speech infer
 and with quick phrase and voice to valiant deed
 the highminded barons and bold army stir
 and this was but to goad a willing steed
 as the old proverb says who lacks no spur
 he moved the squadrons having closed his speech
 softly beneath their separate banners each

 xl
 he without clamour without any noise
 so moves his triple host their flags below
 zerbino marching by the stream enjoys
 the honour first to assail the barbarous foe
 the paladin the irishmen employs
 more inland with a wider wheel to go
 thus england's horse and foot the two between
 led by the duke of lancaster are seen

 xli
 the paladin rode on along the shore
 when he had put the warriors in their way
 and passing by their squadrons pricked before
 valiant zerbino and his whole array
 until he reached the quarters of the moor
 where oran's king and king sobrino lay
 who halfamile removed from those of spain
 posted upon that side observed the plain

 xlii
 with such a faithful escort fortified
 and sure the christians who had thither wound
 with silence and the angel for their guide
 no longer could stand mute or keep their ground
 but hearing now the foe with shouts defied
 their host and made the shrilling trumpets sound
 and with loud clamours which heaven's concave fill
 sent through the paynim's bones a deadly chill

 xliii
 rinaldo spurs before the troops combined
 his foaming courser and his weapon rests
 and a full bowshot leaves the scots behind
 so all delay the impatient peer molests
 as oftentimes an eddying gust of winds
 issues ere yet the horrid storm infests
 so sallying swiftly from the following herd
 rinaldo forth upon baiardo spurred

 xliv
 as the aspect of the paladin of france
 the wavering moorish files betray their fear
 and trembling in their hands is seen the lance
 their thighs and stirrups quivering like the spear
 king pulian only marks the knight's advance
 knowing rinaldo not unchanged in cheer
 nor thinking such a cruel shock to meet
 gallops against him on his courser fleet

 xlv
 he stoops upon the weapon which he strains
 whole and collected for the martial game
 then to his horse abandoning the reins
 and goading with both spurs the courser came
 upon the other side no valour feigns
 but shows by doings what he is in name
  with what rare grace and matchless art he wars
 the son of aymon rather son of mars

 xlvi
 wellmatched in skill they aimed their cruel blows
 with lances at each other's heads addrest
 ill matched in arms and valour were the foes
 for this past on and that the champaigne prest
 more certain proof of worth when warriors close
 there needs than knightly lance well placed in rest
 but fortune even more than valour needs
 which ill without her saving succour speeds

 xlvii
 with the good spear new levelled in his fist
 at oran's king behold rinaldo dart
 of bulk and bone and sinew to resist
 the monarch was but ill supplied with heart
 and his might pass for a fair stroke in list
 though planted in the buckler's nether part
 let those excuse it who refuse to admire
 since the good paladin could reach no higher

 xlviii
 nor did the buckler so the weapon stay
 though made of palm within and steel without
 but that it pierced the paunch and made a way
 to let that mean and ill matched spirit out
 the courser who had deemed that all the day
 he must so huge a burden bear about
 thanked in his heart the warrior who well met
 had thus preserved him from so sore a sweat

 xlix
 rinaldo having broke his rested spear
 so wheels his horse he seems equipt with wings
 who turning swiftly with the cavalier
 amid the closest crowd impetuous springs
 composed of brittle glass the arms appear
 where sir rinaldo red fusberta swings
 nor tempered steel is there nor corslet thick
 which keeps the sword from biting to the quick

 l
 yet few the tempered plates or iron pins
 with which encounters that descending brand
 but targets some of oak and some of skins
 and quilted vest and turban's twisted band
 lightly such drapery good rinaldo thins
 and cleaves and bores and shears on either hand
 nor better from his sword escapes the swarm
 than grass from sweeping scythe or grain from storm

 li
 the foremost squadron had been put to flight
 when thither the vanguard zerbino led
 forth pricking from the following crowd in sight
 appeared with levelled lance their youthful head
 with no less fury those who trooped to fight
 beneath his banner to the combat sped
 like lions like so many wolves who leap
 in fury to the assault of goat or sheep

 lii
 both spurred their coursers on with rested lance
 when either warrior to his foe was near
 and that short interval that small expanse
 of plain between was seen to disappear
 was never witnessed yet a stranger dance
 for the scots only ply the murderous spear
 only the scattered paynims slaughtered lie
 as if conducted thither but to die

 liii
 it seemed as if each coward paynim grew
 more cold than ice each scot more fierce than flame
 the moors believed that with rinaldo's thew
 and muscle fortified each christian came
 sobrino quickly moved his ordered crew
 nor stayed till herald should his call proclaim
 better were they than those which went before
 for captain armour and for martial lore

 liv
 less worthless men of africa were they
 though ill had they been deemed of much avail
 ill harnessed and worse trained to martial fray
 forthwith king dardinel the foe to assail
 moved up his host himself in helmet gay
 and sheathing all his limbs in plate and mail
 the fourth division i believe was best
 which under isolier to battle prest

 lv
 thraso this while the valiant duke of mar
 glad in the tumult for the cavaliers
 who muster in his train uplifts the bar
 and to the lists of fame his following chears
 when isolier with horsemen of navarre
 entered in that fierce fray he sees and hears
 next ariodantes moved his chivalry
 who was of late made duke of albany

 lvi
 the deep sonorous trumpet's bellowing
 and sound of drum and barbarous instrument
 combined with twang of bow and whiz of sling
 wheel and machine and stone from engine sent
 and what more loud than these appeared to ring
 tumult and shriek and groan and loud lament
 composed a direr whole than what offends
 the neighbouring tribes where deafening nile descends

 lvii
 the arrows' double shower the ample sky
 with wideextended shade is seen to shrowd
 breath smoke of sweat and dust ascend on high
 and seem to stamp in air a murky cloud
 by turns each host gives way and you might spy
 now chasing now in flight the selfsame crowd
 and here some wight beside his foeman slain
 or little distant prostrate on the plain

 lviii
 when harassed with fatigue a wearied crew
 withdraw fresh files their fellows reinforce
 men here and there the wasted ranks renew
 here march supplies of foot and there of horse
 her mantle green for robe of crimson hue
 earth shifts ensanguined where the warriors course
 and there were azure flowers and yellow sprung
 now slaughtered men lie stretched their steeds among

 lix
 zerbino was more wonders seen to do
 than ever stripling of his age he strowed
 the ground with heaps of dead and overthrew
 the paynim numbers which about him flowed
 the valiant ariodantes to his new
 entrusted squadron mighty prowess showed
 filling with dread and wonder near and far
 the squadrons of castile and of navarre

 lx
 chelindo and mosco bastards were the twain
 of calabrun late king of arragon
 and one esteemed among the valiant train
 calamidor of barcellona's town
 leaving their standards in the hope to gain
 by young zerbino's death a glorious force
 and wounded in his flanks the prince's horse

 lxi
 pierced by three lances lay the courser strong
 but bold zerbino quickly rose anew
 and eager to avenge his charger's wrong
 the assailants where he sees them will pursue
 zerbino at mosco first that overhung
 him in the hope to make him prisoner flew
 and pierced him in the flank who from his sell
 pallid and cold upon the champaign fell

 lxii
 when him so killed as 'twere by stealthy blow
 chelindo viewed to avenge his brother slain
 he charged intent the prince to overthrow
 but he seized fast his courser by the rein
 and thence to rise not laid the charger low
 destined no more to feed on hay or grain
 for at one stroke so matchless was his force
 zerbino cleft the rider and his horse

 lxiii
 when that fell blow calamidor espied
 he turned the bridle short to speed away
 but him with downright cut zerbino plied
 behind and cried withal "stay traitor stay"
 nor from its aim the swordstroke wandered wide
 though from the mark it went somedeal astray
 the falchion missed the rider as he fled
 but reached the horse's croup and stretched him dead

 lxiv
 he quits the horse and thence for safety crawls
 but he with little boot escapes his foe
 for him duke thraso's horse o'erturns and mawls
 opprest the ponderous courser's weight below
 where the huge crowd upon zerbino falls
 ariodantes and lurcanio go
 and with them many a cavalier and count
 who do their best zerbino to remount

 lxv
 then artalico and margano knew
 the force of ariodantes' circling brand
 while casimir and enearco rue
 more deeply yet the puissance of his hand
 smote by the knight escaped the former two
 the others were left dead upon the strand
 lurcanio shows what are his force and breath
 who charges smites o'erturns and puts to death

 lxvi
 sir think not that more inland on the plain
 the warfare is less mortal than along
 the stream nor that the troops behind remain
 which to the duke of lancaster belong
 he valiantly assailed the flags of spain
 and long in even scale the battle hung
 for horse and foot and captains of those bands
 on either side could deftly ply their hands

 lxvii
 forward sir oldrad pricks and fieramont
 this glocester's duke and york's the other knight
 with them conjoined is richard warwick's count
 and the bold duke of clarence henry hight
 these follicon and matalista front
 and baricond with all they lead to fight
 almeria this and that granada guides
 and o'er marjorca baricond presides

 lxviii
 well matched awhile the christian and the moor
 appeared without advantage in the fray
 not this now that gave ground like corn before
 the light and fickle breeze which blows in may
 or as the sea which ripples on the shore
 still comes and goes nor keeps one certain way
 when hollow fortune thus had sported long
 she proved disastrous to the paynim throng

 lxix
 the duke of glocester matalista bold
 assailed this while and hurtled from his sell
 fieramont follicon o'erturned and rolled
 in the right shoulder smit on earth as well
 the advancing english either paynim hold
 and bear their prisoners off to dungeon cell
 this while sir baricond is in the strife
 by clarence's bold duke deprived of life

 lxx
 hence 'tis among the moors amazement all
 while hence the christians take such heart and pride
 the bands do nought but quit their ground and fall
 and break their order on the paynim side
 what time the christian troops come on and gall
 their flying rants which nowhere will abide
 and had not one arrived to aid their host
 the paynim camp had on that side been lost

 lxxi
 but ferrau who till this time ever nigh
 marsilius scarce had quitted him that day
 when half destroyed he marked his chivalry
 and saw that baffled banner born away
 pricked his good courser forth in time to spy
 where mid those squadrons hottest waxed the fray
 with his head severed in a griesly wound
 olympio de la serra fall to ground

 lxxii
 a stripling he who such sweet musick vented
 accorded to the horned lyre's soft tone
 that at the dulcet melody relented
 the hearer's heart though harder than a stone
 happy if with such excellence contented
 he had pursued so fair a fame alone
 and loathed shield quiver helmet sword and lance
 destined by these to die a youth in france

 lxxiii
 when bold french beheld his cruel plight
 for whom he love and much esteem profest
 he felt more pity at the doleful sight
 than 'mid those thousands slain for all the rest
 and smote the foe who slew him with such might
 that he his helm divided from the crest
 cut front eyes visage and mid bosom through
 and cast him down amid the slaughtered crew

 lxxiv
 nor stops he here nor leaves a corslet whole
 nor helm unbroken where his sword is plied
 of this the front or cheek of that the poll
 the arm of other foe his strokes divide
 and he of these divorcing body and soul
 restores the wavering battle on that side
 whence the disheartened and ignoble throng
 are scattered wide and broke and driven along

 lxxv
 into the medley pricks king agramant
 desirous there his bloody course to run
 with him king baliverzo farurant
 soridan bambirago prusion
 and next so many more of little vaunt
 whose blood will form a lake ere day be done
 that i could count each leaf with greater ease
 when autumn of their mantle strips the trees

 lxxvi
 agramant from the wall a numerous band
 of horse and foot withdraws and sends the array
 beneath the king of fez with a command
 behind the moorish tents to make his way
 and those of ireland in their march withstand
 whom he sees hurrying with what haste they may
 and with wide wheel and spacious compass wind
 to fall upon the paynim camp behind

 lxxvii
 the king of fez upon this service prest
 for all delay might sore his work impede
 this while king agramant unites the rest
 and parts the troops who to the battle speed
 he sought himself the river where he guessed
 the moorish host might most his presence need
 and from that quarter had a courier prayed
 by king sobrino sent the monarch's aid

 lxxviii
 he more than half his camp behind him led
 in one deep phalanx at the mighty sound
 alone the scotsmen trembled and in dread
 abandoned honour order and their ground
 lurcanio ariodantes and their head
 zerbino there alone the torrent bound
 and haply he who was afoot had died
 but that in time his need rinaldo spied

 lxxix
 elsewhere the paladin was making fly
 a hundred banners while the cavalier
 so chased the quailing saracens the cry
 of young zerbino's peril smote the ear
 for single and afoot his chivalry
 amid the africans had left the peer
 rinaldo turned about and took his way
 where he beheld the scots in disarray

 lxxx
 he plants his courser where their squadrons yield
 to the fierce paynims and exclaims "where go
 your bands and why so basely quit the field
 yielding so vilely to so vile a foe
 behold the promised trophies spear and shield
 spoils which your loaded churches ought to show
 what praise what glory that alone and reft
 of his good horse your monarch's son is left

 lxxxi
 he from a squire receives a lance and spies
 king prusion little distant sovereign
 of the alvaracchiae and against him hies
 whom he unhorses dead upon the plain
 so agricalt so bambirago dies
 and next sore wounded is sir soridane
 who had been slain as well amid the throng
 if good rinaldo's lance had proved more strong

 lxxxii
 that weapon broken he fusberta rears
 and smites sir serpentine him of the star
 though charmed from mischief are the cavalier's
 good arms he falls astounded by the jar
 and thus rinaldo round zerbino clears
 the field so widely where those champions war
 that without more dispute he takes a horse
 of those who masterless at random course

 lxxxiii
 that he in time remounted it was well
 who haply would not if he more delayed
 for agramant at once and dardinel
 sobrino and balastro thither made
 but he who had in time regained the sell
 wheeled here and there his horse with brandished blade
 dispatching into hell the mixt array
 that how men live above their ghosts might say

 lxxxiv
 the good rinaldo who to overthrow
 the strongest of the foeman covets still
 at agramant directs a deadly blow
  who seems too passingproud and greater ill
 works there than thousand others of the foe 
 and spurs his horse the moorish chief to spill
 he smote the monarch broadside charged the steed
 and man and horse reversed upon the mead

 lxxxv
 what time without in such destructive frays
 hate rage and fury all offend by turns
 in paris rodomont the people slays
 and costly house and holy temple burns
 while charles elsewhere anther duty stays
 who nothing hears of this nor aught discerns
 he in the town receives the british band
 which edward and sir ariman command

 lxxxvi
 to him a squire approached who pale with dread
 scarce drew his breath and cried "oh well away
 alas alas" and thus he often said
 ere he could utter aught beside "today
 today sire is the roman empire sped
 and christ to the heathen makes his flock a prey
 a fiend from air today has dropt that none
 henceforth may in this city make their won

 lxxxvii
 "satan in sooth it can no other be
 destroys and ruins the unhappy town
 turn and the curling wreaths of vapour see
 from the red flames which wander up and down
 list to those groans and be they warrantry
 of the sad news thy servant now makes known
 one the fair city wastes with sword and fire
 before whose vengeful fury all retire"

 lxxxviii
 even such as he who hears the tumult wide
 and clatter of churchbells ere he espy
 the raging fire concealed from none beside
 himself to him most dangerous and most nigh
 such was king charles who heard and then descried
 the new disaster with his very eye
 hence he the choicest of his meiny steers
 thither where he the cry and tumult hears

 lxxxix
 with many peers and chiefs who worthiest are
 summoned about him charlemagne is gone
 he bids direct his standards to the square
 whither the paynim had repaired hears groan
 and tumult spies the horrid tokens there
 of cruelty sees human members strown
  no more  let him return another time
 who willingly will listen to this rhyme

 charles goes with his against king rodomont

 as well as those who lived in days of yore
 consigned to ravening wolves ordained to keep
 us his illnurturing and unuseful sheep

 iv
 who as if having more than served to fill
 their hungry maw invite from foreign wood
 beyond the mountain wolves of greedier will
 with them to be partakers of their food
 the bones which thrasymene and trebbia fill
 and cannae seem but few to what are strewed
 on fattened field and bank where on their way
 adda and mella ronco and tarro stray

 v
 now god permits that we should feel the spite
 of people who are haply worse than we
 for errors multiplied and infinite
 and foul and pestilent iniquity
 the time will come we may such ill requite
 upon their shores if we shall better be
 and their transgressions ever prove above
 the long endurance of aeternal love

 vi
 the christian people then god's placid front
 must have disturbed with their excesses sore
 since them with slaughter rape and rapine hunt
 through all their quarters plundering turk and moor
 but the unsparing rage of rodomont
 proves worse than all the ills endured before
 i said that charlemagne had made repair
 in search of him towards the city square

 vii
 charles by the way his people's butchery
 beholds  burnt palaces and ruined fanes 
 and sees large portion of the city lie
 in unexampled wreck  "ye coward trains
 whither in heartless panic would ye fly
 will none his loss contemplate what remains
 to you  what place of refuge say is left
 if this from you so shamefully be reft

 viii
 "then shall one man alone a prisoned foe
 who cannot scale the walls which round him spread
 unscathed unquestioned from your city go
 when all are by his vengeful arm laid dead"
 thus charlemagne whose veins with anger glow
 and shame too strong to brook in fury said
 and to the spacious square made good his way
 where he beheld the foe his people slay

 ix
 thither large portion of the populace
 climbing the palace roof had made resort
 for strongly walled and furnished was the place
 with ammunition for their long support
 rodomont mad with pride had in his chace
 of the scared burghers singly cleared the court
 he with one daring hand which scorned the world
 brandished the sword  his other wildfire hurled

 x
 and smote and thundered 'mid a fearful shower
 at the sublime and royal house's gate
 to their life's peril crumbling roof and tower
 is tost by them that on the summit wait
 nor any fears to ruin hall or bower
 but wood and stone endure one common fate
 and marbled column slab and gilded beam
 by sire and grandsire held in high esteem

 xi
 rodomont stands before the portal bright
 with steel his head and bust secured in mail
 like to a serpent issued into light
 having cast off his slough diseased and stale
 who more than ever joying in his might
 renewed in youth and proud of polished scale
 darts his three tongues fire flashing from his eyes
 while every frighted beast before him flies

 xii
 nor bulwark stone nor arbalest nor bow
 nor what upon the paynim smote beside
 sufficed to arrest the sanguinary foe
 who broke and hewed and shook that portal wide
 and in his fury let such daylight through
 'twas easy to espy  and might be spied 
 in visages o'ercast in deathlike sort
 that full of people was the palace court

 xiii
 through those fair chambers echoed shouts of dread
 and feminine lament from dame distrest
 and grieving through the house pale women fled
 who wept afflicted sore and beat their breast
 and hugged the doorpost and the genial bed
 too soon to be by stranger lords possest
 the matter in this state of peril hung
 when thither came the king his peers among

 xiv
 charles turned him round to these of vigorous hand
 whom he had found in former peril true
 "are you not those that erst with me did stand
 'gainst agolant in aspramont in you
 is vigour now so spent he said the band
 who him troyano and almontes slew
 with hundreds more that you now fear to face
 one of that very blood that very race

 xv
 "why should i now in contest with the foe
 less strength in you behold than them your might
 upon this hound pursued the monarch show
 this hound who preys on man  a generous sprite
 the thought of death  approach he fast or slow 
 so that he dies but well holds cheap and light
 but where you are i doubt my fortune ill
 for by your succour have i conquered still"

 xvi
 this said he spurred his courser couched his spear
 and charged the paynim nor of life less free
 sir ogier joined the king in his career
 namus and oliver and with the three
 avino avolio otho and berlinghier
 for one without the rest i never see
 and on the bosom flanks and on the front
 all smote together at king rodomont

 xvii
 but let us sir for love of heaven forego
 of anger and of death the noisome lore
 and be it deemed that i have said enow
 for this while of that saracen not more
 cruel than strong 'tis time in trace to go
 of gryphon left with origille before
 damascus' gate and him who with her came
 the adulterer not the brother of the dame

 xviii
 of all the cities under eastern skies
 most wealthy populous and fairly dight
 'tis said damascus is which distant lies
 from salem seven days' journey its fair site
 a fertile plain abundant fruits supplies
 winter and summer sojourn of delight
 shading the city from the dawning day
 a mountain intercepts its early ray

 xix
 two crystal streams the wealthy city scower
 whose currents parted into many a rill
 infinite gardens never bare of flower
 or stript of leaf with grateful murmur fill
 'tis said the perfumed waters are of power
 so plenteously they swell to turn a mill
 and that whoever wander through the streets
 scent issuing from each home a cloud of sweets

 xx
 then the highstreet gay signs of triumph wore
 covered with showy cloths of different dye
 which deck the walls while sylvan leaves in store
 and scented herbs upon the pavement lie
 adorned is every window every door
 with carpeting and finest drapery
 but more with ladies fair and richly drest
 in costly jewels and in gorgeous vest

 xxi
 within the city gates in frolic sport
 many are seen to ply the festive dance
 and here the burghers of the better sort
 upon their gay and welltrapt coursers prance
 a fairer show remains the sumptuous court
 of barons bold and vassals who advance
 garnished with what could be procured of ore
 and pearl from ind and erythraean shore

 xxii
 forward sir gryphon pricked with his array
 surveying here and there the whole at ease
 when them a knight arrested by the way
 and such his wont and natural courtesies
 obliged beneath his palaceroof to stay
 where he let nought be wanting which might please
 and chearfully the guests with bath restored
 next welcomed at his costly supperboard

 xxiii
 and told how he who norandino hight
 damascus and all syria's kingdom swayed
 native and foreigner had bade invite
 on whom the sword of knighthood had been laid
 to a fair joust which at the morrow's light
 ensuing in the square was to be made
 where they might show and without further faring
 if they had valour equal to their bearing

 xxiv
 gryphon though he came not that joust to see
 accepts the challenge of the cavalier
 for when occasion serves it cannot be
 an evil use to make our worth appear
 then questioned more of that solemnity
  if 'twere a wonted feast held every year
 or new emprise by which in martial course
 the monarch would assay his warriors' force 

 xxv
 "the gorgeous feast our monarch will display
 each fourth succeeding moon" the baron said
 "this is the first that you will now survey
 none have been held beside the cause which bred
 the solemn usage is that on such day
 the king from sovereign peril saved his head
 after four months consumed in doleful wise
 'mid tears and groans with death before his eyes

 xxvi
 "our monarch who is named king norandine
 fully to you the matter to recite
 through many and many a year for her did pine
 above all other damsels fair and bright
 the king of cyprus' daughter whom in fine
 espoused he with his bride and dame and knight
 to wait upon her home a fair array
 towards his syrian realm had shaped his way

 xxvii
 "but as we scoured the fell carpathian sea
 with flowing sheet at distance from the shore
 a storm assailed us of such cruelty
 the tempest even scared our pilot hoar
 drifting three days and nights at random we
 our devious course 'mid threatening waves explore
 then wet and weary land 'mid verdant hills
 between wellshaded and refreshing rills

 xxviii
 "we our pavilions pitch and 'mid those groves
 joyfully strain our awnings overhead
 and kitchens there construct and rustic stoves
 and carpets for the intended banquet spread
 meanwhile through neighbouring vale the monarch roves
 and secret wood scarce pervious to the tread
 seeking red deer goat fallowbuck and doe
 and following him two servants bear his bow

 xxix
 "while with much solace seated in a round
 we from the chace expect our lord's return
 approaching us along the shore astound
 the orc that fearful monster we discern
 god grant fair sir he never may confound
 your eyesight with his semblance foul and stern
 better it is of him by fame to hear
 than to behold him by approaching near

 xxx
 "to calculate the griesly monster's height
 so measureless is he exceeds all skill
 of fungushue in place of orbs of sight
 their sockets two small bones like berries fill
 towards us as i say he speeds outright
 along the shore and seems a moving hill
 tusks jutting out like savage swine he shows
 a breast with drivel foul and pointed nose

 xxxi
 "running the monster comes and bears his snout
 in guise of brach who enters on the trail
 we who behold him fly a helpless rout
 wherever terror drives with visage pale
 'tis little comfort that he is without
 eyesight who winds his plunder in the gale
 better than aught possest of scent and sight
 and wing and plume were needed for our flight

 xxxii
 "some here some there make off but little gain
 by flying him for swifter is the pest
 than the south wind of forty ten with pain
 swimming aboard the bark in safety rest
 under his arm some wretches of our train
 he packed nor empty left his lap or breast
 and loaded a capacious scrip beside
 which like a shepherd's to his waist was tied

 xxxiii
 "us to his den the sightless monster carried
 hollowed within a rock upon the shore
 of snowy marble was that cavern quarried
 as white as leaf unstained by inky score
 with him within the cave a matron tarried
 who marked by grief and pain a visage wore
 with her were wife and maid a numerous court
 both fair and foul of every age and sort

 xxxiv
 "large as the other and that grotto near
 almost upon the summit of the rock
 another cavern was contrived to rear
 and from the weather fend his woolly flock
 which he still herded through the changeful year
 so numerous it were hard to count his stock
 wont in due season these to pen or loose
 and play the shepherd more for sport than use

 xxxv
 "the flesh of man he savoured more than sheep
 and this before he reached the cave was seen
 three youths of ours ere yet he climbed the steep
 he are alive or rather swallowed clean
 then moved the stone which closed that cavern deep
 and lodged us there with that to pasture green
 his flock he led as wont the meads among
 sounding the pipe which at his neck was hung

 xxxvi
 "our lord meanwhile returning to the strand
 the loss which he had suffered comprehends
 for in deep silence upon every hand
 through empty tent and hut the monarch wends
 nor who has robbed him can be understand
 and full of terror to the beach descends
 whence he his sailors in the offing sees
 unmoor and spread their canvas to the breeze

 xxxvii
 "as soon as norandino was in view
 they launched and sent their pinnace to convey
 the monarch thence but he no sooner knew
 of the fell orc and those he made his prey
 then he without more thought would him pursue
 and follow wheresoe'er he bent his way
 to lose lucina is such cruel pain
 that life is loathsome save he her regain

 xxxviii
 "when on the newly printed sand his eyes
 norandine fixt he with the swiftness sped
 with which the rage of love a man supplies
 until he reached the cave of which i said
 where we enduring greater agonies
 than e'er were suffered there await in dread
 the orc and deem at every sound we hear
 the famished brute about to reappear

 xxxix
 "the monarch to the cave did fortune guide
 when the orc's wife alone was in the lair
 seeing the king `fly  woe to thee' she cried
 `should the orc take thee'  `woeful every where
 i cannot choose but be' the king replied
 `whether be take or miss me kill or spare
 not hither i by chance have wandered i
 come with desire beside my wife to die'

 xxx
 "he afterwards the dame for tidings pressed
 of those the orc had taken on the shore
 and of lucina above all the rest
 if slain or prisoner kept with kindly lore
 she norandino in return addressed
 and said lucina lived nor need he more
 have of her future safety any dread
 for the orc on flesh of woman never fed

 xli
 " `of this you may behold the proof in me
 and all these other dames who with me dwell
 nor me nor them the orc offends so we
 depart not ever from this caverned cell
 but vainly who would from her prison flee
 hopes peace or pardon from our tyrant fell
 buried alive or bound with griding band
 of in the sun stript naked on the sand

 xlii
 " `when hither he today conveyed your crew
 the females from the males he severed not
 but as he took them in confusion threw
 all he had captive made into that grot
 he will scent out their sex not tremble you
 lest he the women slay the others' lot
 is fixt and of four men or six aday
 be sure the greedy orc will make his prey

 xliii
 " `i have no counsel for you how to free
 the lady but content thyself to hear
 she in no danger of her life will be
 who will our lot in good or evil share
 but go for love of heaven my son lest thee
 the monster smell and on thy body fare
 for when arrived he sniffs about the house
 and such his subtle scent can wind a mouse'

 xliv
 "to her the amorous monarch made reply
 that he the cave would not abandon ere
 he saw lucina and near her to die
 than to live far from her esteemed more dear
  seeing that she can nothing more supply
 fitted to shake the purpose of the peer
 upon a new design the matron hits
 pursued with all her pains with all her wits

 xlv
 "with slaughtered sheep and goat was evermore
 the cavern filled the numerous flock's increase
 which served her and her household as a store
 and from the ceiling dangled many a fleece
 the dame made norandino from a hoar
 and huge hegoat's fat bowels take the grease
 and with the suet all his members pay
 until he drove his natural scent away

 xlvi
 "and when she thought he had imbibed the smell
 which the rank goat exhales she took the hide
 and made him creep into the shaggy fell
 who was well covered by that mantle wide
 him in this strange disguise she from the cell
 crawling for such was her command did guide
 where prisoned by a stone in her retreat
 was hid his beauteous lady's visage sweet

 xlvii
 "kin norandine as bid took up his ground
 before the cavern on the greensward laid
 that he might enter with the flock who wound
 homeward and longing sore till evening stayed
 at eve he hears the hollow elder's sound
 upon whose pipes the wonted tune was played
 calling his sheep from pasture to their rock
 by the fell swain who stalked behind his flock

 xlviii
 "think if his heart is trembling at its core
 when norandino hears the approaching strains
 and now advancing to the cavern door
 the sight of that terrific face sustains
 but if fear shook him pity moved him more
 you see if he loves well or only feigns
 the orc removed the stone unbarred the cote
 and the king entered amid sheep and goat

 xlix
 "his flock so housed to us the orc descended
 but first had care the cavern door to close
 then scented all about and having ended
 his quest two wretches for his supper chose
 so is remembrance by this meal offended
 it makes me tremble yet this done he goes
 and being gone the king his goatish vest
 casts off and folds his lady to his breast

 l
 "whereas she him with pleasure should descry
 she seeing him but suffers grief and pain
 she sees him thither but arrived to die
 who cannot hinder her from being slain
 ` "twas no small joy 'mid all the woes that'
 to him exclaimed lucina 'here sustain
 that thou wert not among us found today
 when hither i was brought the monster's prey

 li
 " `for though to find myself about to leave
 this life be bitter and afflict me sore
 such is our common instinct i should grieve
 but for myself but whether thee before
 of after me the orc of life bereave
 assure thyself thy death will pain me more
 than mine' and thus the dame persists to moan
 more norandino's danger than her own

 lii
 " `a hope conducts me here' the monarch said
 `to save thee and thy followers every one
 and if i cannot i were better dead
 than living without light of thee my sun
 i trust to scape as hither i have spied
 as ye shall all if as ourselves have done
 to compass our design you do not shrink
 to imbue your bodies with the loathsome stink'

 liii
 "the trick he told wherewith the monster's smell
 to cheat as first to him the wife had told
 in any case to cloathe us in the fell
 that he may feel is issueing from the fold
 as many men as women in the cell
 we slay persuaded by the monarch bold
 as many goats as with our number square
 of those which stink the most and oldest are

 liv
 "we smeared our bodies with the fruitful grease
 which round about the fat intestines lay
 and cloathed our bodies with the shaggy fleece
 this while from golden dwelling broke the day
 and now his flock returning to release
 we viewed the shepherd with the dawning ray
 who giving breath to the sonorous reeds
 piped forth his prisoned flock to hill and meads

 lv
 "he held his hand before the opened lair
 lest with the herd we issued from the den
 and stopt us short but feeling wool or hair
 upon our bodies let us go again
 by such a strange device we rescued were
 cloathed in our shaggy fleeces dames and men
 nor any issuing thence the monster kept
 till thither sore alarmed lucina crept

 lvi
 "lucina  whether she abhorred the scent
 and like us others loathed herself to smear
  or whether with a slower gait she went
 than might like the pretended beast's appear
  or whether when the orc her body hent
 her dread so mastered her she screamed for fear
  or that her hair escaped from neck or brow
 was known nor can i well inform you how

 lvii
 "so were we all intent on our own case
 we for another's danger had no eyes
 him turning at the scream i saw uncase
 already her whom he had made his prize
 and force her to the cavern to retrace
 her steps we couching in our quaint disguise
 wend with the flock where us the shepherd leads
 through verdant mountains into pleasant meads

 lviii
 "there we awaited till beneath the shade
 secure we saw the beaked orc asleep
 when one along the shore of ocean made
 and one betook him to the mountain steep
 king norandine his love alone delayed
 who would return disguised among the sheep
 nor from the place depart while life remained
 unless his faithful consort he regained

 lix
 "for when before on the flock issuing out
 he saw her prisoned in the cave alone
 into the orc's wide throat he was about
 to spring so grief had reason overthrown
 and he advanced even to the monster's snout
 and but by little scaped the grinding stone
 yet him the hope detained amid the flock
 trusting to bear lucina from the rock

 lx
 "the orc at eve when to the cave again
 he brings the herd nor finds us in the stall
 and knows that he must supperless remain
 lucina guilty of the whole does call
 condemned to stand fast girded with a chain
 in open air upon the summit tall
 the king who caused her woes with pitying eye
 looks on and pines  and only cannot die

 lxi
 "morning and evening her lamenting sore
 ever the unhappy lover might survey
 what time he grieving went afield before
 the issuing flock or homeward took his way
 she with sad face and suppliant evermore
 signed that for love of heaven he would not stay
 since there he tarried at great risk of life
 nor could in any thing assist his wife

 lxii
 "so the orc's wife as well upon her side
 implored him to depart but moved him nought
 to go without lucina he denied
 and but remained more constant in his thought
 in this sad servitude he long was tried
 by love and pity bound till fortune brought
 a pair of warriors to the rocky won
 gradasso and agrican's redoubted son

 lxiii
 "where with their arms so wrought the champions brave
 they freed lucina from the chains she wore
 though he wit less than fortune served in save
 and running to the sea their burden bore
 her to her father who was there they gave
 this was at morn when in the cavern hoar
 mixt with the goats king norandino stood
 which ruminating chewed their grassy food

 lxiv
 "but when at daylight 'twas unbarred and now
 he was instructed that his wife was gone
 for the orc's consort told the tale and how
 in every point the thing rehearsed was done
 he thanked his god and begged with promised vow
 that since 'twas granted her such ill to shun
 he would direct his wife to some repair
 whence he might free her by arms gold or prayer

 lxv
 "together with the flatnosed herd his way
 he took and for green meads rejoicing made
 he here expected till the monster lay
 extended underneath the gloomy shade
 then journeyed all the night and all the day
 till of the cruel orc no more afraid
 he climbed a bark on satalia's strand
 and three days past arrived on syrian land

 lxvi
 "in cyprus and in rhodes by tower and town
 which in near egypt turkey or afric lay
 the king bade seek lucina up and down
 nor could hear news of her till the other day
 the other day his fatherinlaw made known
 he had her safe with him what caused her stay
 in nicosia was a cruel gale
 which had long time been adverse to her sail

 lxvii
 "the king for pleasure of the tidings true
 prepares the costly feast in solemn state
 and will on each fourth moon that shall ensue
 make one resembling this we celebrate
 pleased of that time the memory to renew
 that he in the orc's cavern had to wait
  for four months and a day  which is tomorrow
 when he was rescued from such cruel sorrow

 lxviii
 "the things related i in part descried
 and from him present at the whole heard more
 from norandine through calend and through ide
 pent till he changed to smiles his anguish sore
 and if from other you hear aught beside
 say he is ill instructed in his lore"
 the syrian gentleman did thus display
 the occasion of that feast and fair array

 lxix
 large portion of the night in like discourse
 was by those cavaliers together spent
 who deemed that love and pity's mickle force
 was proved in that so dread experiment
 then rising when the supper's sumptuous course
 was cleared to good and pleasant lodgings went
 and as the ensuing morning fairly broke
 to sounds of triumph and rejoicing woke

 lxx
 the circling drums' and trumpets' echoing strain
 assemble all the town within the square
 and now when mixt with sound of horse and wain
 loud outcries through the streets repeated are
 sir gryphon dons his glittering arms again
 a panoply of those esteemed most rare
 whose mail impassable by spear or brand
 she the white fay had tempered with her hand

 lxxi
 the man of antioch in his company
 armed him a recreant worse than he was none
 provided by their landlord's courtesy
 with sturdy spears and good the course to run
 who with his kindred a fair chivalry
 to bring the warriors to the square is gone
 with squires afoot and mounted upon steeds
 whom he bestowed as aptest for their needs

 lxxii
 they in the square arrived and stood aside
 nor of themselves awhile would make display
 better to see the martial gallants ride
 by twos and threes or singly to the fray
 one told by colours cunningly allied
 his joy or sorrow to his lady gay
 one with a painted love on crest or shield
 if she were cruel or were kind revealed

 lxxiii
 it was the syrians' practise in that age
 to arm them in this fashion of the west
 haply this sprung out of their vicinage
 and constant commerce with the franks possest
 in those days of the sacred heritage
 that god incarnate with his presence blest
 which now to them abandoned by the train
 of wretched christians heathen hounds profane

 lxxiv
 god's worshippers where they should couch the lance
 for furtherance of his holy faith and true
 against each other's breast the spear advance
 to the destruction of the faithful few
 you men of spain and you ye men of france
 and switzers turn your steps elsewhere  and you
 ye germans worthier empire to acquire
 for that is won for christ which you desire

 lxxv
 if verily most christian you would be
  i speak to you that catholic are hight 
 why slain by you christ's people do i see
 wherefore are they despoiled of their right
 why seek you not jerusalem to free
 from renegades by turkish moslemite
 impure why is byzantium with the best
 and fairest portion of the world possest

 lxxvi
 thou spain hast thou not fruitful afric nigh
 and has she not in sooth offended more
 than italy yet her to scathe that high
 and noble enterprize wilt thou give o'er
 alas thou sleepest drunken italy
 of every vice and crime the fetid sewer
 nor grievest as a handmaid to obey
 in turn the nations that have owned thy sway

 lxxvii
 if fear of famishing within thy cave
 switzer does thee to lombardy convey
 and thou among our people dost but crave
 a hand to give thee daily bread or slay 
 the turk has ready wealth across the wave
 drive him from europe or from greece away
 so shalt thou in those parts have wherewithal
 to feed thy hunger or more nobly fall

 lxxviii
 i to the german neighbour of thy lair
 say what i say to thee the wealth o' the west
 which constantine brought off from rome is there 
 brought off the choicest gave away the rest 
 there golden hermus and pactolus are
 mygdonia and lydia nor that country blest
 which many tales for many praises note
 if thou wouldst thither wend is too remote

 lxxix
 thou mighty lion that art charged to keep
 the keys of paradise a weighty care
 oh let not italy lie plunged in sleep
 if thy strong hand is planted in her hair
 to thee his shepherd god to guide his sheep
 has given that wand and furious name to bear
 that thou may'st roar and wide thine arms extend
 and so from greedy wolves thy flock defend

 lxxx
 but whither have i roved who evermore
 so from one topic to the other stray
 yet think not i the road i kept before
 to have missed so far but i can find my way
 i said the syrians then observed the lore
 or arming like the christians of that day
 so that damascus' crowded square was bright
 with corslet plate and helm of belted knight

 lxxxi
 the lovely ladies from their scaffolds throw
 upon the jousters yellow flowers and red
 while these as loud the brazen trumpets blow
 make their steeds leap and wheel and proudly tread
 each rode he well or ill his art would show
 and with the goring spur his courser bled
 hence this good cavalier earns fame and praise
 while others scornful hoots and laughter raise

 lxxxii
 a suit of arms was prize of the assay
 presented to the king some days before
 which late a merchant found upon the way
 returning from armenia this the more
 to grace a vest with noblest tissue gay
 the syrian king subjoined so powdered o'er
 with jewels gold and pearls in rich device
 they made the meed a thing of passing price

 lxxxiii
 if the good king had known the panoply
 this he had held above all others dear
 nor this had given as full of courtesy
 to be contented for with sword and spear
 'twere long to tell who so unworthily
 had erst mistreated thus the goodly gear
 that lay the way the harness had been strowed
 a prey to whosoever past the road

 lxxxiv
 of this you more in other place shall hear
 of gryphon now i tell who at the just
 arrived saw broken many a knightly spear
 and more than one good stroke and one good thrust
 eight were there who made league together dear
 to norandine and held in sovereign trust
 youths quick in arms and practised in the shock
 all lords or scions of illustrious stock

 lxxxv
 at open barriers one by one the place
 they kept against all comers for a day
 at first with lance and next with sword or mace
 while them the king delighted to survey
 ofttimes they pierce the corslet's iron case
 and every thing in fine perform in play
 which foemen do that deadly weapons measure
 save that the king may part them at his pleasure

 lxxxvi
 that witless antiochite who worthily
 by name was cowardly martano hight
 thinking because his comrade he must be
 partaker of the noble gryphon's might
 into the martial press rides valiantly
 then stops and the issue of a furious fight
 which had begun between two cavaliers
 to wait retiring from the strife appears

 lxxxvii
 seleucia's lord of those companions one
 combined in that emprize to keep the place
 who then a course with bold ombruno run
 wounded the unhappy warrior in midface
 so that he slew him mourned by every one
 who as a worthy knight the warrior grace
 and over and above his worth before
 all others hold him for his courteous lore

 lxxxviii
 when vile martano from his place discerned
 the fate which might be his with fearful eye
 into his craven nature be returned
 and straight began to think how he might fly
 but him from flight the watchful gryphon turned
 and after much ado with act and cry
 urged him against a knight upon the ground
 as at the ravening wolf men slip the hound

 lxxxix
 who will pursue the brindled beast for ten
 or twenty yards and after stop to bay
 when he beholds his flashing eyes and when
 he sees the griesly beast his teeth display
 'twas thus before those valiant gentlemen
 and princes present there in fair array
 fearful martano seized with panic dread
 turned to the right his courser's rein and head

 xc
 yet he who would excuse the sudden wheel
 upon his courser might the blame bestow
 but after he so ill his strokes did deal
 demosthenes his cause might well forego
 with paper armed he seems and not with steel
 so shrinks he at the wind of every blow
 at length he breaks the ordered champions through
 amid loud laughter from the circling crew

 xci
 clapping of hands and cries at every turn
 were heard from all that rubble widely spread
 as a wolf sorely hunted makes return
 to earth to his retreat martano fled
 gryphon remained and sullied with the scorn
 esteemed himself which on his mate was shed
 and rather than be there he in his ire
 would gladly find himself i' the midst of fire

 xcii
 with burning heart and visage red with shame
 he thinks the knight's disgrace is all his own
 because by deeds like his with whom he came
 he weens the mob expects to see him known
 so that it now behoves his valour flame
 more clear than light or they to censure prone
  errs he a finger's breadth  an inch  will swell
 his fault and of that inch will make an ell

 xciii
 already he the lance upon his thigh
 has rested little used to miss the foe
 then makes with flowing rein his courser fly
 and next somedeal advanced directs the blow
 and smiting puts to the last agony
 sidonia's youthful lord by him laid low
 o'ercome with wonder each assistant rises
 whom sore the unexpected deed surprises

 xciv
 gryphon returned and did the weapon wield
 whole and recovered which he couched before
 and in three pieces broke it on the shield
 which bold laodicea's baron bore
 thrice of four times about to press the field
 he seemed and lay along the crupper sore
 astound yet rose at length unsheathed his blade
 wheeled his good courser and at gryphon made

 xcv
 gryphon who in his saddle sees the peer
 advancing towards him nor unseated by
 the encounter says "the failure of the spear
 in a few strokes the sabre shall supply"
 and on his temples smote a stroke so shear
 it seemed that it descended from the sky
 and matched it with another and again
 another till he stretched him on the plain

 xcvi
 here two good brothers of apamia were
 in tourney wont to have the upper hand
 corimbo named and thyrsis was the pair
 both overturned by gryphon on the land
 one at the encounter left his saddle bare
 on the other gryphon used his trenchant brand
 this valiant knight was in the common trust
 sure to obtain the honours of the just

 xcvii
 bold salinterno mid the warlike train
 was in the lists vizier and marshal hight
 who had the government of all that reign
 and was withal a puissant man of might
 the tourney's prize he sees with much disdain
 about to be borne off by foreign knight
 a lance he snatches and to gryphon cries
 and him with many menaces defies

 xcviii
 but he makes answer with a massy spear
 out of ten others chosen as the best
 and levelling at the buckler of the peer
 for greater surety pierces plate and breast
 'twixt rib and rib it bored the cavalier
 issuing a palm behind to all the rest
 the king excepted welcome was the blow
 for each was greedy salinterno's foe

 xcix
 two of damascus next sir gryphon sped
 hermophilo and carmondo this arraid
 under his flag the king's militia led
 that was as lord high admiral obeyed
 this lightly at the shock on earth was shed
 and that reversed upon the ground o'erlaid
 by his weak horse too feeble to withstand
 sir gryphon's mighty push and puissant hand

 c
 yet in the field remained seleucia's knight
 the best of all the other seven at need
 and one who well accompanied his might
 with perfect armour and a gallant steed
 both at the helmet where it locks take sight
 and with their spears to the encounter speed
 but gryphon hardest smote whose paynim foe
 lost his left stirrup staggered by the blow

 ci
 they cast the truncheons down their coursers wheel
 and full of daring with drawn falchions close
 sir gryphon was the first a stroke to deal
 which might have split an anvil at the blow's
 descent the shield is splintered  bone and steel 
 this had its lord mid thousand others chose
 and but 'twas double and the coat as well
 the sword had cleft the thigh on which it fell

 cii
 he of seleucia at sir gryphon's casque
 at the same time so fell a blow addrest
 it would have rent and torn the iron mask
 had it not been enchanted like the rest
 the paynim's labour is a fruitless task
 of arms so hard sir gryphon is possest
 who has the foe's already cleft and broke
 in many parts nor thrown away a stroke

 ciii
 each one might see how much seleucia's lord
 was overmatched by gryphon and that day
 the worsted men had perished by the sword
 had not the monarch quickly stopt the fray
 to his guard king norandino spake the word
 and bade them enter and the duel stay
 they part the knight whom they asunder bear
 and much the king is lauded for his care

 civ
 the eight who had to keep the field pretended
 from all the world nor yet their part had done
 on a sole knight  their quarrel ill defended 
 had vanished from the tiltyard one by one
 the others who with them should have contended
 stood idle for to answer them was none
 since gryphon had forestalled in the debate
 what they should all have done against those eight

 cv
 and for such little time endured the play
 less than an hour sufficed to finish all
 but norandine the pastime to delay
 and to continue it till evenfall
 descending from his place bade clear the way
 and the huge squad divided at his call
 into two troops whom ranked by blood and might
 the monarch formed and marched for other fight

 cvi
 sir gryphon during this had made return
 homeward with anger and with fury stung
 less thinking of his honours that the scorn
 which on the vile martano had been flung
 hence from himself the opprobrious shame to turn
 martano now employs his lying tongue
 and she the false and cunning courtezan
 assists him in his scheme as best she can

 cvii
 whether the youth believed the tale or no
 he the excuse received like one discreet
 and deemed it best for them at once to go
 and secretly and silently retreat
 for fear that if the populace should know
 martano base they him might ill entreat
 so by short ways and close they quit the abode
 and issue from the gates upon their road

 cviii
 sir gryphon was he or his horse foredone
 with toil or was it sleep his eyes down weighed
 ere yet the troop beyond two miles had gone
 at the first inn upon the highway stayed
 he doffed his armour all and morion
 and had the steeds of trappings disarrayed
 and next alone he to a chamber sped
 locked himself in undrest and went to bed

 cix
 no sooner he his head had rested there
 than with deep sleep opprest he closed his eye
 so heavily no badgers in their lair
 or dormice overcome with slumber lie
 martano and origille to take the air
 entered this while a garden which was nigh
 and there the strangest fraud together bred
 which ever entered into mortal head

 cx
 martano schemed to take away the steed
 and gear in which sir gryphon had been dight
 and stand before the monarch in the weed
 of him who had in joust so proved his might
 as he had shaped in thought he did the deed
 he took away the warrior's horse more white
 than milk his buckler surcoat arms and crest
 in all sir gryphon's knightly ensigns drest

 cxi
 he who was clad in trappings not his own
 like the ass mantled in the lion's hide
 as he expected to the king unknown
 was called in place of gryphon when descried
 or norandine he rising from his throne
 embraced and kissed and placed him by his side
 nor deems enough to praise and hold him dear
 but wills that all around his praise should hear

 cxii
 and bids them the sonorous metal blow
 proclaiming him the conqueror of that day
 and round about loud voices high and low
 the unworthy name throughout the lists convey
 he wills that side by side with him shall go
 the knight when homeward he shall take his way
 and him such favour shows intent to please
 as might have honoured mars or hercules

 cxiii
 him lodgings fair he gave wherein to dwell
 at court and she who with the peer did ride
 was honoured by the courteous king as well
  false origille  with knight and page supplied
 but it is time that i of gryphon tell
 who unsuspecting she or wight beside
 him would with treacherous stratagem deceive
 had fallen asleep nor ever waked till eve

 cxiv
 when he how late it was awaking knew
 with speed he from the chamber did withdraw
 and hastened where he with the other crew
 left origille and her false brotherinlaw
 and when nor these nor upon better view
 his armour nor his wonted clothes he saw
 suspicious waxed and more suspicion bred
 the ensigns of his comrade left instead

 cxv
 the host arriving him at full possest
 of every thing  and how in white array
 that warrior with the lady and the rest
 had to the city measured back their way
 by little and by little gryphon guessed
 what love from him had hidden till that day
 and knew to his great sorrow in the other
 origille's paramour and not her brother

 cxvi
 now he lamenting for his folly stood
 that having heard the truths the pilgrim said
 he should have let her story change his mood
 who him before so often had betrayed
 he might have venged himself nor did  now wou'd
 too late inflict the punishment delaid
 constrained a crying error in his need
 to take that wily treachour's arms and steed

 cxvii
 he better would have gone like naked man
 than braced the unworthy cuirass on his breast
 or hastened the detested shield to span
 or place upon his helm the scorned crest
 but of the lover and that courtezan
 he passion mastering reason took the quest
 and bending to damascus' gate his way
 arrived an hour before the close of day

 cxviii
 on the left hand a castle richly dight
 stood nigh the gate to which sir gryphon rode
 besides that it was strong and armed for fight
 filled with rare chambers was the rich abode
 the first of syria king and lord and knight
 and lady in a gentle group bestowed
 there in an open gallery fairly met
 were at their glad and costly supper set

 cxix
 with the high tower the beauteous gallery clear
 beyond the citywall projected out
 from whence might be discovered far and near
 the spacious fields and different roads about
 when gryphon now in his opprobrious gear
 and arms dishonoured by the rabble's flout
 makes by ill fortune to the gate resort
 he by the king is seen and all his court

 cxx
 and taken for the man whose crest he wears
 in dame and knight moves laughter through the ring
 the vile martano as a man who shares
 the royal grace sits next below the king
 and next she whom her love so fitly pairs
 whom norandino gaily questioning
 demands of them who is the coward knight
 that of his honour makes so passing light

 cxxi
 who after feat so base and foul anew
 approaches with such front and shameless cheer
  and cries "it seems a thing unheard that you
 an excellent and worthy cavalier
 should take this man for your companion who
 has not in all our wide levant his peer
 did you with him for contrastsake combine
 that so your valour might more brightly shine

 cxxii
 " but did not love for you my will restrain
 by the eternal gods i truly swear
 he should endure such ignominious stain
 as i am wont to make his fellows share
 him would i make of my longnursed disdain
 of cowardice perpetual record bear
 to you by whom he hither was conveyed
 if now unpunished let his thanks be paid"

 cxxiii
 that vessel of all filthy vices he
 made answer "mighty sir i cannot say
 who is the stranger that fell in with me
 journeying from antioch hither by the way
 but him i worthy of my company
 deemed by his warlike semblance led astray
 i nothing of his deeds have heard or seen
 save what ill feats today have witnessed been

 cxxiv
 "which moved me so it little lacked but i
 for punishment of his unworthy fear
 had put him out of case again to ply
 in martial tournament the sword or spear
 and but in reverence to your majesty
 and presence i forbore by hand to rear
 not for his sake  nor by thy mercy showed
 on him as my companion on the road

 cxxv
 "whose former fellowship appears a stain
 and ever 'twill sit heavy at my heart
 if i uninjured see the wretch again
 'scape to the scandal of the warlike art
 'twere better he from tower a worthy pain
 were gibbeted than suffered to depart
 hung as a beacon for the coward's gaze
 such were a princely deed and worthy praise"

 cxxvi
 a voucher he in origilla had
 who well without a sign his purpose read
 "i deem not" cried the king "his works so bad
 that they should cost the stranger knight his head
 enough that he again the people glad
 for penance of his weighty sin" this said
 he quickly called a baron of his crew
 and him enjoined the deed he was to do

 cxxvii
 with many armed men that baron fares
 and to the citygate descending here
 collects his troop and for the attempt prepares
 waiting the coming of the cavalier
 and him surprises so at unawares
 he softly 'twixt two bridges takes the peer
 and him detains with mockery and scorn
 in a dark chamber till returning morn

 cxxviii
 the early sun had scarce his golden hair
 uplifted from his ancient nurse's breast
 beginning upon alpine regions bare
 to chase the shades and gild the mountaincrest
 when martan' fearing gryphon might declare
 his wrong and to the king the truth attest
 retorting upon him the slander cast
 took leave and thence upon his journey past

 cxxix
 his ready wit a fit excuse supplies
 why he stays not to see the recreant shown
 he is with other gifts beside the prize
 rewarded for the victory not his own
 and letters patent drawn in ample wise
 wherein his lofty honours wide are blown
 let him depart i promise he shall meet
 a guerdon worthy of his treacherous feat

 cxxx
 gryphon is brought with shame into the square
 when it is fully thronged with gazing wight
 whom they of cuirass and of helmet bare
 and leave in simple cassock meanly dight
 and as to slaughter he conducted were
 place on a wain conspicuous to the sight
 harnessed to which two sluggish cows are seen
 weary and weak and with long hunger lean

 cxxxi
 thronging about the ignoble car appear
 brazenfaced boy and girl of evil fame
 who each in turn will play the charioteer
 and all assail the knight with bitter blame
 the boys might be a cause of greater fear
 for joined to mocks and mows and words of shame
 the warrior they with volleyed stones would slay
 but that the wiser few their fury stay

 cxxxii
 that which of his disgrace had been the ground
 though no true evidence of guilt his mail
 and plate are dragged in due dishonour round
 suspended at the shameful waggon's tail
 the wain is stopt and to the trumpet's sound
 heralds in front of a tribunal's pale
 his shame before his eyes amid the crowd
 another's evil deed proclaim aloud

 cxxxiii
 they take their prisoner thence and so repair
 in front of temple dwellinghouse and store
 nor any cruel name of mockery spare
 nor leave unsaid a word of filthy lore
 and him at last without the city bear
 the foolish rabble trusting evermore
 their thrall to banish to the sound of blows
 who passing little of its prisoner knows

 cxxxiv
 the warrior's gyves no sooner they undo
 and from their manacles free either hand
 than gryphon seizes shield and sword and through
 the rabble makes long furrows with his brand
 with pike and spear unfurnished was the crew
 who without weapons came a witless band
 the rest for other canto i suspend
 for sir 'tis time this song should have an end


 canto 18

 argument
 gryphon is venged sir mandricardo goes
 in search of argier's king charles wins the fight
 marphisa norandino's men o'erthrows
 due pains martano's cowardice requite
 a favouring wind marphisa's gallery blows
 for france with gryphon bound and many a knight
 the field medoro and cloridano tread
 and find their monarch dardinello dead


 i
 high minded lord your actions evermore
 i have with reason lauded and still laud
 though i with style inapt and rustic lore
 you of large portion of your praise defraud
 but of your many virtues one before
 all others i with heart and tongue applaud
  that if each man a gracious audience finds
 no easy faith your equal judgment blinds

 ii
 often to shield the absent one from blame
 i hear you this or other thing adduce
 or him you let at least an audience claim
 where still one ear is open to excuse
 and before dooming men to scaith and shame
 to see and hear them ever is your use
 and ere you judge another many a day
 and month and year your sentence to delay

 iii
 had norandine been with your care endued
 what he by gryphon did he had not done
 profit and fame have from your rule accrued
 a stain more black than pitch he cast upon
 his name through him his people were pursued
 and put to death by olivero's son
 who at ten cuts or thrusts in fury made
 some thirty dead about the waggon laid

 iv
 whither fear drives in rout the others all
 some scattered here some there on every side
 fill road and field to gain the citywall
 some strive and smothered in the mighty tide
 one on another in the gateway fall
 gryphon all thought of pity laid aside
 threats not nor speaks but whirls his sword about
 well venging on the crowd their every flout

 v
 of those who to the portal foremost fleed
 the readiest of the crowd their feet to ply
 part more intent upon their proper need
 than their friends' peril raise the drawbridge high
 part weeping and with deathlike visage speed
 nor turn their eyes behind them as they fly
 while through the ample city outcry loud
 and noise and tumult rises from the crowd

 vi
 two nimble gryphon seizes mid the train
 when to their woe the bridge is raised of one
 upon the field the warrior strews the brain
 which he bears out on a hard grinding stone
 seized by the breast the other of the twain
 over the citywall by him is thrown
 fear chills the townsmen's marrow when they spy
 the luckless wretch descending from the sky

 vii
 many there were who feared in their alarms
 lest o'er the wall sir gryphon would have vaulted
 nor greater panic seized upon those swarms
 than if the soldan had the town assaulted
 the sound of running up and down of arms
 of cry of muezzins on high exalted
 of drums and trumpets heaven 'twould seem rebounded
 and that the world was by the noise confounded

 viii
 but i will to another time delay
 what chanced on this occasion to recount
 'tis meet i follow charles upon his way
 hurrying in search of furious rodomont
 who did the monarch's suffering people slay
 i said with him the danger to affront
 went namus oliver the danish peer
 avino avolio otho and berlinghier

 ix
 eight lances' shock that eight such warriors guide
 which all at once against the king they rest
 endured the stout and scaly serpent's hide
 in which the cruel moor his limbs had drest
 as a barque rights itself  the sheet untied
 which held its sail  by growing wind opprest
 so speedily sir rodomont arose
 though a hill had been uprooted by the blows

 x
 rainier and guido richard salomon
 ivan ughetto turpin and the twain 
 angiolin angelier  false ganellon
 and mark and matthew from st michael's plain
 with the eight of whom i spake all set upon
 the foe with edward and sir arimane
 who leading succours from the english shore
 had lodged them in the town short time before

 xi
 not so wellkeyed into the solid stone
 groans upon alpine height the castle good
 when by rude boreas' rage or eurus' strown
 uptorn are ash and fir in mountain wood
 as groans sir rodomont with pride o'erblown
 inflamed with anger and with thirst of blood
 and as the thunder and the lightning's fire
 fly coupled such his vengeance and his ire

 xii
 he at his head took aim who stood most nigh
 ughetto was the miserable wight
 whom to the teeth he clove and left to die
 though of good temper was his helmet bright
 as well the others many strokes let fly
 at him himself which all the warrior smite
 but harm so hard the dragon's hide no more
 than needle can the solid anvil score

 xiii
 all the defences round abandoned are
 the unpeopled city is abandoned all
 for where the danger is the greater there
 the many give their aid at charles' call
 through every street they hurry to the square
 since flying nought avails from work and wall
 their bosoms so the monarch's presence warms
 that each again takes courage each takes arms

 xiv
 as when within the closelyfastened cage
 of an old lioness well used to fight
 an untamed bull is prisoned to engage
 the savage monster for the mob's delight
 the cubs who see him cresting in his rage
 and round the den loudbellowing to the sight
 of the huge beast's enormous horns unused
 cower at a distance timid and confused

 xv
 but if the mother spring at him and hang
 fixing her cruel tusks into his ear
 her whelps as well will blood their greedy fang
 and bold in her defence assail the steer
 one bites his paunch and one his back so sprang
 that band upon the paynim cavalier
 from roof and window and from place more nigh
 poured in a ceaseless shower the weapons fly

 xvi
 of cavaliers and footmen such the squeeze
 that hardly can the place the press contain
 they cluster there as thick as swarming bees
 who thither from each passage troop amain
 so that were they unarmed and with more ease
 than stalks or turnips he could cleave the train
 ill rodomont in twenty days would clear
 the gathering crowd united far and near

 xvii
 unknowing how himself from thence to free
 the paynim by this game is angered sore
 who little thins the gathering rabblery
 staining the ground with thousands slain or more
 and all the while in his extremity
 finds that his breath comes thicker than before
 and sees he cannot pierce the hostile round
 unless he thence escape while strong and sound

 xviii
 the monarch rolls about his horrid eyes
 and sees that foes all outlets barricade
 but at the cost of countless enemies
 a path shall quickly by his hand be made
 where fury calls him lo the felon hies
 and brandishes on high his trenchant blade
 to assail the newly entered british band
 which edward and sir ariman command

 xix
 he who has seen the fence in wellthonged square
 against whose stakes the eddying crowd is born
 by wild bull broken that has had to bear
 through the long day dogs blows and ceaseless scorn
 who hunts the scattered people here and there
 and this or that now hoists upon his horn
 let him as such or fiercer yet account
 when he breaks forth the cruel rodomont

 xx
 at one crossblow fifteen or twenty foes
 he hews as many leaves without a bead
 at cross or downrightstroke as if he rows
 trashes in vineyard or in willowbed
 at last all smeared with blood the paynim goes
 safe from the place which he has heaped with dead
 and wheresoe'er he turns his steps are left
 heads arms and other members maimed and cleft

 xxi
 he from the square retires in such a mode
 none can perceive that danger him appals
 but during this what were the safest road
 by which to sally he to thought recals
 he comes at last to where the river flowed
 below the isle and past without the walls
 in daring men at arms and mob increase
 who press him sore nor let him part in peace

 xxii
 as the highcouraged beast whom hunters start
 in the wild nomade or massilian chace
 who even in flying shows his noble heart
 and threatening seeks his lair with sluggish pace
 from that strange wood of sword and spear and dart
 turns rodomont with action nothing base
 and still impeded by the galling foe
 makes for the river with long steps and slow

 xxiii
 he turned upon the rabblerout who bayed
 behind him thrice or more by anger driven
 and stained anew his falchion by whose blade
 more than a hundred deadly wounds were given
 but reason finally his fury stayed
 before the bloody carnage stank to heaven
 and he with better counsel from the side
 cast himself down into seine's foaming tide

 xxiv
 athwart the current swam with arms and all
 as if by corks upborn the cavalier
 though thou antaeus bred'st and hannibal
 o africa thou never bred'st his peer 
 when now across the stream without the wall
 he turned and saw the royal town appear
  to have traversed all the city moved his ire
 leaving it undestroyed by sword or fire

 xxv
 and him so sorely anger stung and pride
 thither he thought a second time to go
 and from his inmost bosom groaned and sighed
 nor would depart until he laid it low
 but he saw one along the riverside
 approach who made him rage and hate forego
 strait shall you hear who 'twas approached the king
 but first i have to say of other thing

 xxvi
 i have of haughty discord now to say
 to whom the archangel michael gave command
 to heat to enmity and fierce affray
 the best of agramant's besieging band
 she went that evening from the abbey gray
 her task committing to another's hand
  left it to fraud to feed till her return
 the war and make the fires she kindled burn

 xxvii
 and she believed that she with greater power
 should go did pride with her as well repair
 and she for all were guested in one bower
 in search of her had little way to fare
 pride went with her but that in hall or tower
 a vicar too her charge might duly bear
 she for those days she absent thought to be
 for her lieutenant left hypocrisy

 xxviii
 the implacable discord went and with the dame
 companion of the enterprise was pride
 upon her road and found that by the same
 was journeying to the paynim camp beside
 comfortless jealousy with whom there came
 a little dwarf attending as a guide
 who erst had been sent forward with advice
 to sarza's king by beauteous doralice

 xxix
 when she fell into mandricardo's hand
 i have before recounted when and where
 she had in secret given the dwarf command
 he to the king should with the tidings fare
 by whom she hoped not vainly would be scanned
 the tale her messenger was charged to bear
 but wonderous deeds be done for her relief
 with sad and signal vengeance on the thief

 xxx
 jealousy had that little dwarf espied
 and kenned the reason of his mission too
 and joined him journeying with him side by side
 deeming that she therein a part might do
 discord with pleasure jealousy decried
 but with more joy when she the occasion knew
 which thither brought the dame who much she wist
 might in the task she had in hand assist

 xxxi
 of means to embroil the sarzan and the son
 of agrican she deems herself possest
 a certain mode to enrage these two is won
 and other means may work upon the rest
 she thither with the dwarfish page is gone
 where the fierce pagan in his clutch had prest
 proud paris and they reached the river strand
 exactly as the felon swam to land

 xxxii
 as soon as the redoubted rodomont
 knew in the dwarf the courier of his dame
 he all his rage extinguished cleared his front
 and felt his courage brighten into flame
 all else he deems the courier may recount
 save that a wight had wrought him scaith and shame
 and cries encountering him with chearful brow
 "how fares our lady wither sent art thou"

 xxxiii
 "nor mine nor thine that lady will i say
 who is another's thrall" the dwarf replied
 "we on our road encountered yesterday
 a knight who seized and bore away the bride"
 jealousy upon this took up the play
 and cold as asp embraced the king her guide
 pursued his tale relating how the train
 their mistress taken by one man were slain

 xxxiv
 her flint and steel fell discord as he said
 took forth and somewhile hammered on the stone
 pride underneath the ready tinder spread
 and the quick fire was in a moment blown
 this on the paynim's soul so fiercely fed
 he could not find a resting place 'mid groan
 and sob he storms with horrid face and eye
 which threat the elements and ample sky

 xxxv
 as tiger rages who in vain descends
 into her den and finds herself alone
 and circling all the cavern comprehends
 at last that her beloved young are gone
 to ire to rage like hers his wrath extends
 nor night the king regards nor rock nor stone
 nor stream  nor length of way nor storm arrest
 the speed with which he on the plunderer prest

 xxxvi
 so raging to the pigmy dwarf who bore
 the news exclaimed the king "now hence away"
 nor horse he waits nor carriage nor before
 departing deigns to his a word to say
 he hurries with such speed that not with more
 the lizard darts at noon across the way
 horse had he none but be he whose he might
 would make his own the first which came in sight

 xxxvii
 discord at this who read his secret thought
 exclaimed as she looked smilingly on pride
 through her he to a courser should be brought
 by which new cause of strife should be supplied
 and that by him no other might be caught
 she from his path would keep all steeds beside
 and knew already where the prize to seek
  but her i leave again of charles to speak

 xxxviii
 when on the saracen's departure spent
 about king charles was the consuming flame
 he ranged his troops anew some warriors went
 to strengthen feeble posts which succours claim
 the rest against the saracens are sent
 to give the foe checkmate and end the game
 and from st german's to saint victor's gates
 he pours the host which on his signal waits

 xxxix
 he these at saint marcellus' gate where lay
 outstretched a large circumference of plain
 bade one another wait in one array
 to reunite against the paynim train
 inflaming every one to smite and slay
 in guise that for a record should remain
 he made the various troops fall in below
 their banners and the battlesignal blow

 xl
 agramant has remounted in his sell
 while this is doing in his foe's despite
 and with the stripling who loved isabel
 is waging perilous and fearful fight
 lurcanio with sobrino strives as well
 rinaldo a troop encounters whom the knight
 with valour and with fortune for his guide
 charges and breaks and routs on every side

 xli
 while so the battle stands king charlemagne
 falls on the rear guard of the paynim foe
 where bold marsilius halts the flower of spain
 and forms the host his royal flag below
 on these king charlemagne impels his train
 who foot with horse to flank against them go
 while so the deafening drum and trumpet sounds
 'twould seem the spacious world the din rebounds

 xlii
 the saracenic squadrons had begun
 to bend and all the army of the moor
 had turned disordered broken and undone
 never to be arrayed or rallied more
 but that grandonio stood and falsiron
 tried oftentimes in greater ill before
 with serpentine and balugantes proud
 and the renowned ferrau who cried aloud

 xliii
 "o valiant men" he  "o companions" cries
 "o brethren stand and yet your place maintain
 like cobwebthreads our cruel enemies
 will find their works if we our part sustain
 what this day fortune offers to our eyes
 if now we conquer see the praise the gain 
 if conquered see the utter loss and shame
 which will for ever wait upon your name"

 xliv
 he in this time a mighty lance had spanned
 and spurred at once against sir berlinghier
 who argaliffa guided with his hand
 and broke his helmet's frontal with the spear
 cast him on earth and with the cruel brand
 unhorsed perhaps eight other warriors near
 his mighty strokes discharging at each blow
 he ever laid at least one horseman low

 xlv
 in other part rinaldo in his mood
 has slain more enemies than i can say
 before the warlike knight no order stood
 you might have seen the ample camp give way
 no less zerbino and lurcanio good
 do deeds which will be told in every day
 this with a thrust has bold balastro slain
 that finaduro's helm has cleft in twain

 xlvi
 the first was of the alzerban army head
 ruled by tardocco some short time before
 the other one the valiant squadrons led
 of saphi and morocco and zamor
 "where 'mid the paynims" might to me be said
 "is knight whose sword can cleave or lance can gore"
 but step by step i go and as i wind
 my way leave none who merits praise behind

 xlvii
 zumara's king is not forgotten here
 dardinel who sir dulphin of the mount
 claude of the wood and hubert with the spear
 of mirford he and elio did dismount
 and with the faulchion stamford's cavalier
 sir anselm raymond and sir pinnamont
 from londontown though valiant were the twain
 two stunned one wounded the four others slain

 xlviii
 yet will his squadron not so firmly stand
 maugre the valour which his deeds display
 so firmly as to wait the christian band
 in number less but steadier in array
 more used to joust and manage of the brand
 and all things appertaining to the gray
 setta and morocco turned and seized with dread
 zumara and canaries' islesmen fled

 xlix
 but faster than the rest alzerba flies
 whom dardinel opposed and now with sore
 reproach and now with prayer he moves and tries
 what best he deems their courage may restore
 "if good almontes has deserved" he cries
 "that you should by his memory set such store
 now shall be seen  be seen if you will me
 his son abandon in such jeopardy

 l
 "for sake of my green youth i pray you stand
 that youth whereon your hopes were wont to feed
 and suffer not that scattered by the brand
 to africa be lost our noble seed
 save you united go be sure the land
 is shut against you wheresoe'er you speed
 too high a wall to climb is mountainsteep
 the yawning sea a ditch too wide to leap

 li
 "far better 'tis to perish than to be
 torn by these dogs or lie at their control
 since vain is every other remedy
 wait friends for love of heaven the advancing shoal
 they are not gifted with more lives than we
 have but one pair of hands have but one soul"
 so saying the bold youth amid the crew
 of enemies the earl of huntley slew

 lii
 almontes' memory through the moorish bands
 makes every bosom with such ardour glow
 they deem 'tis better to use arms and hands
 in fight than turn their backs upon the foe
 taller than all william of burnwich stands
 an englishman whom dardinel brings low
 and equals with the rest then smites upon
 and cleaves the head of cornish aramon

 liii
 down fell this aramon and to afford
 him succour thitherward his brother made
 but from the shoulder him zumara's lord
 cleft to the fork with his descending blade
 next bogio de vergalla's belly gored
 and from his debt absolved the forfeit paid
 who to return within six months if life
 were granted him had promised to his wife

 liv
 lurcanio next met dardinello's eye
 he upon earth dorchino had laid low
 pierced through the throat and hapless gardo nigh
 cleft to the teeth at him as all too slow
 he from altheus vainly seeks to fly
 whom as his heart lurcanio loves a blow
 upon his head behind the scotchman speeds
 and slaughtered by the stroke the warrior bleeds

 lv
 dardinel to avenge him took a spear
 and should he lay the fierce lurcanio dead
 vowed to his mahomet if he could hear
 the mosque should have his empty arms this said
 ranging the field in haste that cavalier
 he in the flank with thrust so full and dread
 encountered that it went through either side
 and he to his to strip the baron cried

 lvi
 from me it sure were needless to demand
 if ariodantes when his brother fell
 was grieved if he with his avenging hand
 among the damned would send sir dardinell
 but all access the circling troops withstand
 and bar no less baptized than infidel
 yet would he venge himself and with his blade
 now here now there an open passage made

 lvii
 he charges chases breaks and overthrows
 whoever cross him on the crowded plain
 and dardinello who his object knows
 would fain the wish content but him the train
 impedes as well which round about him flows
 and renders aye his every purpose vain
 if one on all sides thins the moorish rank
 the other slays scot englishman and frank

 lviii
 fortune still blocked their path throughout the day
 so that they met not 'mid that chivalry
 and kept one as a mightier champion's prey
 for rarely man escapes his destiny
 behold the good rinaldo turns that way
 that for this one no refuge there might be
 lo good rinaldo comes him fortune guides
 and for his sword king dardinel provides

 lix
 but here enough for this one while is shown
 of their illustrious doings in the west
 'tis time i seek sir gryphon and make known
 how he with fury burning in his breast
 that rabblerout had broke and overthrown
 struck with more fear than ever men possest
 thither speeds norandine on that alarm
 and for his guard above a thousand arm

 lx
 king norandine girt with peer and knight
 seeing on every side the people fly
 rides to the gates with squadron duly dight
 and at his hest the portals open fly
 meanwhile sir gryphon having put to flight
 the weak and worthless rabble far and nigh
 the scorned arms to keep him from that train
 such as they were took up and donned again

 lxi
 and nigh a temple strongly walled and round
 whose base a moat for its protection goes
 upon a little bridge takes up his ground
 that him his enemies may not enclose
 lo loudly shouting and with threatening sound
 a mighty squadron through the gateway flows
 the valiant gryphon changes not his place
 and shows how small his fear by act and face

 lxii
 but when approaching near he saw the band
 he sallied forth to meet them by the way
 and wielding still his sword in either hand
 made cruel havoc in the close array
 then on the narrow bridge resumed his stand
 nor there his hunters only held at bay
 anew he sallied and returned anew
 aye leaving bloody signs when he withdrew

 lxiii
 forestroke and back he deals and on the ground
 horsemen and foot o'erthrows on every side
 this while the ample mob the knight surround
 and more and more the warfare rages wide
 at length sir gryphon fears he shall be drowned
 so waxed their numbers in the increasing tide
 and hurt in the left shoulder through his mail
 and thigh his wind as well begins to fail

 lxiv
 but valour who so oft befriends her own
 makes him find grace in norandino's eyes
 who while alarmed he hurries there o'erthrown
 so many men such heaps of dead espies
 while he views wounds which hector's hand alone
 he weens could deal  to him all testifies
 that he had put an undeserved shame
 upon a cavalier of mighty name

 lxv
 next seeing him more near whose falchion's sweep
 had dealt such deaths amid his chivalry
 and raised about himself that horrid heap
 and stained the water with that bloody dye
 he thought that he beheld horatius keep
 singly the bridge against all tuscany
 and vext and anxious to remove the stain
 recalled his men and that with little pain

 lxvi
 and lifting his bare hand in sign affied
 from ancient times of treaty and of truce
 repenting him he to sir gryphon cried
 "it grieves me sorely and i cannot choose
 but own my sin let counsels which misguide
 and my own little wit such fault excuse
 what by the vilest knight i thought to do
 i to the best on earth have done in you

 lxvii
 "and though the bitter injuries and shame
 that have to thee through ignorance been done
 are equalled and all cancelled by thy fame
 and merged in truth in glory thou hast won
 whatever satisfaction thou canst claim
 within my power or knowledge count upon
 when i know how atonement may be made
 by city castle or by money paid

 lxviii
 "demand of me this kingdom's moiety
 and from this day thou its possessor art
 since not alone thy worth deserves this fee
 but merits i with this should give my heart
 then pledge of faith and lasting love to me
 in the meanwhile thy friendly hand impart"
 so saying from his horse the king descended
 and towards gryphon his righthand extended

 lxix
 when he beheld the monarch's altered cheer
 who bent to clasp his neck towards him paced
 his sword and rancour laid aside the peer
 him humbly underneath the hips embraced
 king norandine who saw the sanguine smear
 of his two wounds bade seek a leech in haste
 and bade them softly with the knight resort
 towards the town and lodge him in his court

 lxx
 here wounded he remained some days before
 he could bear arms but him in the design
 of seeking out sir aquilant once more
 and good astolpho left in palestine
 i quit they vainly did his path explore
 after sir gryphon left the holy shrine
 through solyma in every place of note
 and many from the holy land remote

 lxxi
 one and the other are alike to seek
 in the inquiry where the knight may use
 but they encounter with the pilgrimgreek
 who of false origilla gives them news
 relating as of her he haps to speak
 that towards antioch she her way pursues
 by a new leman of that city charmed
 who her with fierce and sudden flame had warmed

 lxxii
 aquilant asked him if he had possest
 sir gryphon of the news to them conveyed
 who hearing that he had surmised the rest 
 where he was gone and by what motive swayed
 he followed origille was manifest
 and had in quest of her for antioch made
 to take her from his rival and with view
 on him some memorable scathe to do

 lxxiii
 aquilant brooked not gryphon such a feat
 without him and alone should thus assay
 and took his armour and pursued his beat
 but first besought the duke he would delay
 to visit france and his paternal seat
 till he from antioch measured back his way
 at joppa he embarks who deems by sea
 the better and securer way to be

 lxxiv
 from the southeast upsprung so strong a breeze
 and which for gryphon's galley blew so right
 that the third day he tyre's famed city sees
 and lesser joppa quick succeeds to sight
 by zibellotto and baruti flees
 cyprus to larboard left the galley light
 from tripoli to tortosa shapes her way
 and so to lizza and lajazzo's bay

 lxxv
 from thence towards the east the pilot veered
 her ready tiller prompt his course to scan
 and straightway for the wide orontes steered
 and watched his time and for the harbour ran
 aquilant when his bark the margin neared
 bade lower the bridge and issued horse and man
 it armour and along the river wended
 upstream till he his way at antioch ended

 lxxvi
 to inform himself of that martano bent
 and heard that he to antioch was addrest
 with origilla where a tournament
 was to be solemnized by royal hest
 to track whom aquilant was so intent
 assured that gryphon had pursued his quest
 he antioch left again that very day
 but not by sea again would take his way

 lxxvii
 he towards lidia and larissa goes
  at rich aleppo makes a longer stay
 god to make plain that he even here bestows
 on evil and on good their fitting pay
 at a league's distance from mamuga throws
 martano in the avenging brother's way
 martano travelling with the tourney's prize
 displayed before his horse in showy wise

 lxxviii
 sir aquilant believed at the first show
 his brother he in vile martano spied
 for arms and vest more white than virgin snow
 the coward in the warrior's sight belied
 and sprang towards him with that joyful "oh"
 by which delight is ever signified
 but changed his look and tone when nearer brought
 he sees that he is not the wight he sought

 lxxix
 and through that evil woman's treachery
 deemed gryphon murdered by the cavalier
 and "tell me" he exclaimed "thou who must be
 traitor and thief  both written in thy cheer 
 whence are these arms and wherefore do i thee
 view on the courser of my brother dear
 say is my brother slaughtered or alive
 how didst thou him of horse and arms deprive"

 lxxx
 when origille hears him in affright
 she turns her palfrey and for flight prepares
 but aquilant more quick in her despite
 arrests the traitress ere she further fares
 at the loud threats of that all furious knight
 by whom he so was taken unawares
 martan' turns pale and trembles like a leaf
 nor how to act or answer knows the thief

 lxxxi
 aquilant thundered still and to his dread
 a falchion pointed at his gullet shewed
 and swore with angry menaces the head
 from him and origille should be hewed
 save in all points the very truth be said
 awhile on this illstarred martano chewed
 revolving still what pretext he might try
 to lessen his grave fault then made reply

 lxxxii
 "know sir you see my sister in this dame
 and one of good and virtuous parents born
 though she has lately led a life of shame
 and been by gryphon foully brought to scorn
 and for i loathed such blot upon our name
 yet weened that she could ill by force be torn
 from such a puissant wight i laid a scheme
 her by address and cunning to redeem

 lxxxiii
 "with her i planned the means who in her breast
 nursed the desire a better life to prove
 that she when gryphon was retired to rest
 in silence from the warrior should remove
 this done lest he should follow on our quest
 and so undo the web we vainly wove
 him we deprived of horse and arm and we
 are hither come together as you see"

 lxxxiv
 his cunning might have proved of good avail
 for aquilant believed him easily
 and save in taking gryphon's horse and mail
 he to the knight had done no injury
 but that he wrought so high the specious tale
 as manifested plainly 'twas a lie
 in all 'twas perfect save that he the dame
 had for his sister vouched with whom he came

 lxxxv
 aquilant had in antioch chanced to know
 she was his concubine  well certified
 of this by many  and in furious glow
 exclaimed "thou falsest robber thou hast lied"
 and dealt with that the recreant such a blow
 he drove two grinders down his throat then tied
 not sought martano with his foe to cope
 the caitiff's arms behind him with a rope

 lxxxvi
 and though she for excuse tried many wiles
 did thus as well by origille untrue
 and till he reached damascus' lofty piles
 them by town street or farm behind him drew
 and will a thousand times a thousand miles
 with sorrow and with suffering drag the two
 till he his brother find who at his pleasure
 may vengeance to the guilty couple measure

 lxxxvii
 sir aquilant made squires and beasts as well
 return with him and to damascus came
 and heard renown throughout the city swell
 plying her ample wings sir gryphon's name
 here great and little  every one could tell
 'twas he that in the tourney won such fame
 and had by one that ill deserved his trust
 been cheated of the honours of the just

 lxxxviii
 pointing him out to one another's sight
 the hostile people all martano bayed
 "and is not this they cried that ribald wight
 who in another's spoils himself arrayed
 and who the valour of a sleeping knight
 with his own shame and infamy o'erlaid
 and this the woman of ungrateful mood
 who aids the wicked and betrays the good"

 lxxxix
 others exclaimed "how fittingly combined
 marked with one stamp and of one race are they"
 some loudly cursed them and some raved behind
 while others shouted "hang burn quarter slay"
 the throng to view them prest with fury blind
 and to the square before them made its way
 the monarch of the tidings was advised
 and these above another kingdom prized

 xc
 attended with few squires the syrian king
 as then he chanced to be came forth with speed
 and with sir aquilant encountering
 who gryphon had avenged with worthy deed
 him honoured with fair cheer and home would bring
 and in his palace lodged as fitting meed
 having the prisoned pair with his consent
 first in the bottom of a turret pent

 xci
 thither they go where gryphon from his bed
 has not as yet since he was wounded stirred
 who at his brother's coming waxes red
 surmising well he of his case has heard
 and after aquilant his say had said
 and him somedeal reproached the three conferred
 as to what penance to the wicked two
 so fallen into their hands was justly due

 xcii
 'tis aquilant's 'tis norandino's will
 a thousand tortures shall their guerdon be
 but gryphon who the dame alone can ill
 excuse entreats for both impunity
 and many matters urges with much skill
 but well is answered and 'tis ruled to flea
 martano's body with the hangman's scourge
 and only short of death his penance urge

 xciii
 bound is the wretch but not 'mid grass and flower
 whose limbs beneath the hangman's lashes burn
 all the next morn they prison in the tower
 origille till lucina shall return
 to whom the counselling lords reserve the power
 to speak the woman's sentence mild or stern
 harboured till gryphon can bear arms at court
 aquilant fleets the time in fair disport

 xciv
 the valiant norandino could not choose
 made by such error temperate and wise
 but full of penitence and sorrow muse
 with downcast spirit and in mournful guise
 on having bid his men a knight misuse
 whom all should worthily reward and prize
 so that he night and morning in his thought
 how to content the injured warrior sought

 xcv
 and he determined in the public sight
 o' the city guilty of that injury
 with all such honour as to perfect knight
 could by a puissant monarch rendered be
 him with the glorious guerdon to requite
 which had been ravished by such treachery
 and hence within a month proclaimed the intent
 to hold another solemn tournament

 xcvi
 for which he made what stately preparation
 was possible to make by sceptered king
 hence fame divulged the royal proclamation
 throughout all syria's land with nimble wing
 phoenicia and palestine till the relation
 of this in good astolpho's ears did ring
 who with the lord who ruled that land in trust
 resolved he would be present at the just

 xcvii
 for a renowned and valiant cavalier
 has the true history vaunted sansonnet
 by roland christened charles i said the peer
 over the holy land as ruler set
 he with the duke takes up his load to steer
 thither where rumour speaks the champions met
 so that his ears on all sides in the journey
 are filled with tidings of damascus' tourney

 xcviii
 thither the twain their way those countries through
 by easy stages and by slow addrest
 that fresh upon the day of joust the two
 might in damascustown set up their rest
 when at the meeting of crossways they view
 a person who in movement and in vest
 appears to be a man but is a maid
 and marvellously fierce in martial raid

 xcix
 marphisa was the warlike virgin's name
 and such her worth she oft with naked brand
 had pressed orlando sore in martial game
 and him who had mount alban in command
 and ever night and day the armed dame
 scowered here and there by hill and plain the land
 hoping with errant cavalier to meet
 and win immortal fame by glorious feat

 c
 when sansonnetto and the english knight
 she sees approaching her in warlike weed
 who seem two valiant warriors in her sight
 as of large bone and nerved for doughty deed
 on them she fain would prove her martial might
 and to defy the pair has moved her steed
 when eyeing the two warriors now more near
 marphisa recognized the duke and peer

 ci
 his pleasing ways she did in mind retrace
 when arms in far catay with her he bore
 called him by name nor would in iron case
 retain her hand upraised the casque she wore
 and him advanced to meet with glad embrace
 though of all living dames and those of yore
 the proudest she nor with less courteous mien
 the paladin salutes the martial queen

 cii
 they questioned one another of their way
 and when the duke has said who first replied
 that he damascus seeks where to assay
 their virtuous deeds all knights of valour tried
 the syrian king invites in martial play 
 the bold marphisa at his hearing cried
 ever to prove her warlike prowess bent
 "i will be with you at this tournament"

 ciii
 to have such a comrade either cavalier
 is much rejoiced they to damascus go
 and in a suburb of the city clear
 are lodged upon the day before the show
 and till her aged lover once so dear
 aurora roused their humble roof below
 in greater ease the weary warriors rested
 than had they been in costly palace guested

 civ
 and when the clear and lucid sun again
 its shining glories all abroad had spread
 the beauteous lady armed and warriors twain
 having first couriers to the city sped
 who when 'twas time reported to the train
 that to see truncheons split in contest dread
 king norandine had come into the square
 in which the cruel games appointed were

 cv
 straight to the city ride the martial band
 and through the highstreet to the crowded place
 where waiting for the royal signal stand
 ranged here and there the knights of gentle race
 the guerdons destined to the conqueror's hand
 in that day's tourney were a tuck and mace
 richly adorned and with them such a steed
 as to the winning lord were fitting meed

 cvi
 norandine sure that in the martial game
 both prizes destined for the conquering knight
 as well as one and the other tourney's fame
 must be obtained by gryphon named the white
 to give him all that valiant man could claim
 nor could he give the warrior less with right
 the armour guerdon of this final course
 placed with the tuck and mace and noble horse

 cvii
 the arms which in the former joust the due
 of valiant gryphon were who all had gained
 with evil profit by the wretch untrue
 martan' usurped who gryphon's bearing feigned
 to be hung up on high in public view
 with the richflourished tuck the king ordained
 and fastened at the saddle of the steed
 the mace that gryphon might win either meed

 cviii
 but from effecting what he had intended
 he was prevented by the warlike maid
 who late into the crowded square had wended
 with sansonnet and england's duke arrayed
 seeing the arms of which i spoke suspended
 she straight agnized the harness she surveyed
 once hers and dear to her as matters are
 esteemed by us as excellent and rare

 cix
 though as a hindrance she upon the road
 had left the arms when to retrieve her sword
 she from her shoulders slipt the ponderous load
 and chased brunello worthy of the cord
 more to relate were labour ill bestowed
 i deem nor further of the tale record
 enough for me by you 'tis understood
 how here she found anew her armour good

 cx
 you shall take with you when by manifest
 and certain tokens they by her were known
 she for no earthly thing the iron vest
 and weapons for a day would have foregone
 she thinks not if this mode or that be best
 to have them anxious to regain her own
 but t'wards the arms with hand extended hies
 and without more regard takes down the prize

 cxi
 and throwing some on earth it chanced that more
 than was her own she in her hurry took
 the syrian king who was offended sore
 raised war against her with a single look
 for ill the wrong his angered people bore
 and to avenge him lance and falchion shook
 remembering not on other day how dear
 they paid for scathing errant cavalier

 cxii
 no wishful child more joyfully 'mid all
 the flowers of springtide yellow blue and red
 finds itself nor at concert or at ball
 dame beauteous and adorned than 'mid the tread
 of warlike steeds and din of arms and fall
 of darts and push of spears  where blood is shed
 and death is dealt in the tumultuous throng 
 she finds herself beyond all credence strong

 cxiii
 she spurred her courser and with lance in rest
 imperious at the foolish rabble made
 and  through the neck impaled or through the breast 
 some pierced some prostrate at the encounter layed
 next this or that she with the falchion prest
 the head from one she severed with the blade
 and from that other cleft another sank
 short of right arm or left or pierced in flank

 cxiv
 bold sansonnetto and astolpho near
 who had with her their limbs in harness dight
 though they for other end in arms appear
 seeing the maid and crowd engaged in fight
 first lower the helmet's vizor next the spear
 and with their lances charge the mob outright
 then bare their falchions and amid the crew
 a passage with the trenchant weapons hew

 cxv
 the errant cavaliers who to that stage
 to joust from different lands had made resort
 seeing them warfare with such fury wage
 and into mourning changed the expected sport
 because all knew not what had moved the rage
 of the infuriate people in that sort
 nor what the insult offered to the king
 suspended stood in doubt and wondering

 cxvi
 of these some will the crowded rabble's band
 too late repentant of the feat befriend
 those favouring not the natives of the land
 more than the foreigners to part them wend
 others more wary with their reins in hand
 sit watching how the mischief is to end
 gryphon and aquilant are of the throng
 which hurry forward to avenge the wrong

 cxvii
 the pair of warlike brethren witnessing
 the monarch's drunken eyes with venom fraught
 and having heard from many in the ring
 the occasion which the furious strife had wrought
 himself no whit less injured than the king
 of syria's land offended gryphon thought
 each knight in haste supplied himself with spear
 and thundering vengeance drove in full career

 cxviii
 on rabican pricked forth before his hand
 valiant astolpho from the other bound
 with the enchanted lance of gold in hand
 which at the first encounter bore to ground
 what knights he smote with it and on the sand
 laid gryphon first next aquilant he found
 and scarcely touched the border of his shield
 ere he reversed the warrior on the field

 cxix
 from lofty saddle sansonnet o'erthrew
 famous for price and prowess many a knight
 to the outlet of the square the mob withdrew
 the monarch raged with anger and despite
 meanwhile of the first cuirass and the new
 possest as well as either helmet bright
 marphisa when she all in flight discerned
 conqueror towards her suburbinn returned

 cxx
 sansonnet and astolpho are not slow
 in following t'wards the gate the martial maid
 the mob dividing all to let them go
 and halt when they have reached the barricade
 gryphon and aquilant who saw with woe
 themselves on earth at one encounter laid
 their drooping heads opprest with shame decline
 nor dare appear before king norandine

 cxxi
 seizing their steeds and mounting either son
 of oliver to seek their foemen went
 with many of his vassals too is gone
 the king on death or vengeance all intent
 the foolish rabble cry "lay on lay on"
 and stand at distance and await the event
 gryphon arrived where the three friends had gained
 a bridge and facing round the post maintained

 cxxii
 he at the first approach astolpho knew
 for still the same device had been his wear
 even from the day he charmed orrilo slew
 his horse his arms the same him not with care
 sir gryphon had remarked nor stedfast view
 when late he jousted with him in the square
 he knows him here and greets next prays him show
 who the companions are that with him go

 cxxiii
 and why they had those arms without the fear
 of syria's king pulled down and to his slight
 of his champions england's cavalier
 sir gryphon courteously informed aright
 but little of those arms pursued the peer
 he knew which were the occasion of the fight
 but for he thither with marphisa came
 and sansonnet had armed to aid the dame

 cxxiv
 while he and gryphon stood in colloquy
 aquilant came and knew astolpho good
 whom he heard speaking with his brother nigh
 and though of evil purpose changed his mood
 of norandine's trooped many these to spy
 but came not nigh the warriors where they stood
 and seeing them in conference stood clear
 listening in silence and intent to hear

 cxxv
 some one who hears marphisa hold is there
 famed through the world for matchless bravery
 his courser turns and bids the king have care
 save he would lose his syrian chivalry
 to snatch his court before all slaughtered are
 from the hand of death and of tisiphone
 for that 'twas verily marphisa who
 had borne away the arms in public view

 cxxvi
 as norandine is told that name of dread
 through the levant so feared on every side
 whose mention made the hair on many a head
 bristle though she was often distant wide
 he fears the ill may happen which is said
 unless against the mischief he provide
 and hence his meiny who have changed their ire
 already into fear he bids retire

 cxxvii
 the sons of oliver on the other hand
 with sansonnetto and the english knight
 so supplicate marphisa she her brand
 puts up and terminates the cruel fight
 and to the monarch next amid his brand
 cries proudly "sir i know not by what right
 thou wouldst this armour not thine own present
 to him who conquers in thy tournament

 cxxviii
 "mine are these arms which i upon a day
 left on the road which leads from armeny
 because parforce afoot i sought to stay
 a robber who had sore offended me
 the truth of this my ensign may display
 which here is seen if it be known to thee"
 with that she on the plate which sheathed the breast
 cleft in three places showed a crown imprest

 cxxix
 "to me this an armenian merchant gave
 'tis true" replied the king "some days ago
 and had you raised your voice the arms to crave
 you should have had them whether yours or no
 for notwithstanding i to gryphon gave
 the armour i so well his nature know
 he freely would resign the gift he earned
 that it by me to you might be returned

 cxxx
 "your allegation needs not to persuade
 these arms are yours  that they your impress bear
 your word suffices me by me more weighed
 than all that other witness could declare
 to grant them yours is but a tribute paid
 to virtue worthy better prize to wear
 now have the arms and let us make accord
 and let some fairer gift the knight reward"

 cxxxi
 gryphon who little had those arms at heart
 but much to satisfy the king was bent
 replied "you recompense enough impart
 teaching me how your wishes to content"
  "here is my honour all at sake" apart
 "meseemeth" said marphisa and forewent
 her claim for gryphon's sake with courteous cheer
 and as his gift in fine received the gear

 cxxxii
 to the city their rejoicings to renew
 in love and peace they measured back their way
 next came the joust of which the honour due
 and prize was sansonnet's since from the fray
 abstained astolpho and the brethren two
 and bold marphisa best of that array
 like faithful friends and good companions fain
 that sansonnet the tourney's meed should gain

 cxxxiii
 eight days or ten in joy and triumph dwell
 the knights with norandine but with such strong
 desire of france the warriors' bosoms swell
 which will not let them thence be absent long
 they take their leave marphisa who as well
 thither would go departs the troop among
 marphisa had long time with sword and lance
 desired to prove the paladins of france

 cxxxiv
 and make experiment if they indeed
 such worth as is by rumour voiced display
 sansonnet leaves another in his stead
 the city of jerusalem to sway
 and now these five in chosen squadron speed
 who have few peers in prowess on their way
 dismist by norandine to tripoli
 they wend and to the neighbouring haven hie

 cxxxv
 and there a carack find about to steer
 for western countries taking in her store
 they with the patron for themselves and gear
 and horses make accord a seaman hoar
 of luna he the heavens on all sides clear
 vouch many days' fair weather from the shore
 they loose with sky serene and every sail
 of the yare vessel stretched by favouring gale

 cxxxvi
 the island of the amorous deity
 breathed upon them an air in her first port
 which not alone to man does injury
 but moulders iron and here life is short
  a marsh the cause  and nature certainly
 wrongs famagosta poisoning in such sort
 that city with constantia's fen malign
 to all the rest of cyprus so benign

 cxxxvii
 the noxious scents that from the marish spring
 after short sojourn there compel their flight
 the barque to a southeaster every wing
 extends and circles cyprus to the right
 makes paphos' island next and anchoring
 the crew and warriors on the beach alight
 those to ship merchandize and these at leisure
 to view the laughing land of love and pleasure

 cxxxviii
 inland six miles or seven from thence a way
 scales with an easy rise a pleasant hill
 which myrtle orange cedartree and bay
 and other perfumed plants by thousands fill
 thyme marjoram crocus rose and lily gay
 from odoriferous leaf such sweets distill
 that they who sail the sea the fragrance bland
 scent in each genial gale which blows from land

 cxxxix
 a fruitful rill by limpid fountain fed
 waters all round about the fertile space
 the land of venus truly may be said
 that passing joyous and delightful place
 for every maid and wife who there is bred
 is through the world beside unmatched in grace
 and venus wills till their last hour be tolled
 that love should warm their bosoms young and old

 cxl
 'twas here they heard the same which they before
 of the orc and of lucina erst had heard
 in syria how she to return once more
 in nicosia to her lord prepared
 thence a fair wind now blowing from the shore
 his bark for sea the ready patron cleared
 hawled up his anchor westward turned the head
 of the good ship and all his canvas spread

 cxli
 to the north wind which blew upon their right
 stretching to seaward they their sails untie
 when lo a southsouthwester which seemed light
 in the beginning while the sun was high
 and afterwards increased in force t'wards night
 raised up the sea against them mountains high
 with such dread flashes and loud peals of thunder
 as heaven to swallow all in fire would sunder

 cxlii
 the clouds their gloomy veil above them strain
 nor suffer sun or star to cheer the view
 above the welkin roared beneath the main
 on every side the wind and tempest grew
 which with sharp piercing cold and blinding rain
 afflicted sore the miserable crew
 while aye descending night with deeper shade
 the vext and fearful billows overlayed

 cxliii
 the sailors in this war of wind and flood
 were prompt to manifest their vaunted art
 one blowing through the shrilling whistle stood
 and with the signal taught the rest their part
 one clears the best bower anchor one is good
 to lower this other to hawl home or start
 the braces one from deck the lumber cast
 and this secured the tiller that the mast

 cxliv
 the cruel wind increased throughout the night
 which grew more dismal and more dark than hell
 the wary patron stood to sea outright
 where he believed less broken was the swell
 and turned his prow to meet with ready sleight
 the buffets of the dreadful waves which fell
 never without some hope that at daybreak
 the storm might lull or else its fury slake

 cxlv
 it lulls not nor its fury slakes but grown
 wilder shows worse by day  if this be day
 which but by reckoning of the hours is known
 and not by any cheering light or ray
 now with more fear his weaker hope o'erthrown
 the sorrowing patron to the wind gives way
 he veers his barque before the cruel gale
 and scowers the foaming sea with humble sail

 cxlvi
 while fortune on the sea annoys this crew
 she grants those others small repose by land
 those left in france who one another slew 
 the men of england and the paynim band
 these bold rinaldo broke and overthrew
 nor troops nor banners spread before him stand
 i speak of him who his baiardo fleet
 had spurred the gallant dardinel to meet

 cxlvii
 the shield of which almontes' son was vain
 that of the quarters good rinaldo spied
 and deemed him bold and of a valiant strain
 who with orlando's ensign dared to ride
 approaching nearer this appeared more plain
 when heaps of slaughtered men he round him eyed
 "better it were" he cried "to overthrow
 this evil plant before it shoot and grow"

 cxlviii
 each to retreat betook him where the peer
 his face directed and large passage made
 nor less the saracens than faithful clear
 the way so reverenced is fusberta's blade
 save dardinel mount alban's cavalier
 saw none nor he to chase his prey delayed
 to whom "he cast upon thee mickle care
 poor child who of that buckler left thee heir

 cxlix
 "i seek thee out to prove if thou attend
 my coming how thou keep'st the red and white
 for thou save this from me thou canst defend
 canst ill defend it from orlando's might"
 to him the king "now clearly comprehend
 i what i bear as well defend in fight
 and i more honour hope than trouble dread
 from my paternal quartering white and red

 cl
 "have thou no hope to make me fly or yield
 to thee my quarters though a child i be
 my life shalt thou take from me if my shield
 but i in god well hope the contrary
  this as it may  shall none in fighting field
 say that i ever shamed my ancestry"
 so said and grasping in his hand the sword
 the youthful king assailed mount alban's lord

 cli
 upon all parts a freezing fear goes through
 the heart blood of each trembling paynim nigh
 when they amazed the fierce rinaldo view
 who charged the monarch with such enmity
 as might a lion which a bullock new
 to stings of love should in a meadow spy
 the moor smote first but fruitless was his task
 who beat in vain upon mambrino's casque

 clii
 rinaldo smiled and said "i'd have thee know
 if i am better skilled to find the vein"
 he spurs and lets with that the bridle go
 and a thrust pushes with such might and main
  a thrust against the bosom of his foe
 that at his back the blade appears again
 forth issued blood and soul and from his sell
 lifeless and cold the reeling body fell

 cliii
 as languishes the flower of purple hue
 which levelled by the passing ploughshare lies
 or as the poppy overcharged with dew
 in garden droops its head in piteous wise
 from life the leader of zumara's crew
 so past his visage losing all its dyes
 so passed from life and perished with their king
 the heart and hope of all his following

 cliv
 as waters will sometime their course delay
 stagnant and penned in pool by human skill
 which when the opposing dyke is broke away
 fall and with mighty noise the country fill
 'twas so the africans who had some stay
 while dardinello valour did instil
 fled here and there dismayed on every side
 when they him hurtling form his sell descried

 clv
 letting the flyers fly of those who stand
 firm in their place rinaldo breaks the array
 ariodantes kills on every hand
 who ranks well nigh rinaldo on that day
 these leonetto's those zerbino's brand
 o'erturns all rivals in the glorious fray
 well charles and oliver their parts have done
 turpin and ogier guido and salomon

 clvi
 in peril were the moors that none again
 should visit heatheness that day opprest
 but that the wise and wary king of spain
 gathered and from the field bore off the rest
 to sit down with his loss he better gain
 esteemed that here to hazard purse and vest
 better some remnant of the host to save
 than bid whole squadrons stand and find a grave

 clvii
 he bids forthwith the moorish ensigns be
 borne to the camp which fosse and rampart span
 with the bold monarch of andology
 the valiant portuguese and stordilan
 he sends to pray the king of barbary
 to endeavour to retire as best be can
 who will no little praise that day deserve
 if he his person and his place preserve

 clviii
 that king who deemed himself in desperate case
 nor ever more biserta hoped to see
 for with so horrible and foul a face
 he never fortune had beheld with glee
 heard that marsilius had contrived to place
 part of his host in full security
 and faced about his banners and bade beat
 throughout his broken squadrons a retreat

 clix
 but the best portion neither signal knew
 nor listened to the drum or trumpet's sound
 so scared so crowded is the wretched crew
 that many in seine's neighbouring stream are drowned
 agramant who would form the band anew
 with him sobrino scowers the squadrons round
 and with them every leader good combines
 to bring the routed host within their lines

 clx
 but nought by sovereign or sobrino done
 who toiling them with prayer or menace stirred
 to march where their illfollowed flags are gone
 can bring i say not all not even a third
 slaughtered or put to flight are two for one
 who 'scapes  nor he unharmed among that herd
 wounded is this behind and that before
 and wearied one and all and harassed sore

 clxi
 and even within their lines in panic sore
 they by the christian bands are held in chase
 and of all needful matters little store
 was made there for provisioning the place
 charlemagne wisely by the lock before
 would grapple fortune when she turned her face
 but that dark night upon the field descended
 and hushed all earthly matters and suspended

 clxii
 by the creator haply hastened who
 was moved to pity for the works he made
 the blood in torrents ran the country through
 flooding the roads while on the champaign laid
 were eighty thousand of the paynim crew
 cut off that day by the destroying blade
 last trooped from caverns at the midnight hour
 villain and wolf to spoil them and devour

 clxiii
 king charles returns no more within the town
 but camps without the city opposite
 the moor's cantonments and bids up and down
 and round highpiled and frequent watchfires light
 the paynim fashions ditch and bastion
 rampart and mine and all things requisite
 visits his outposts and his guards alarms
 nor all the livelong night puts off his arms

 clxiv
 that livelong night the foes throughout their tents
 as insecure and with their scathe deprest
 poured tears and uttered murmurs and laments
 but as they could their sounds of woe supprest
 one grief for slaughtered friends or kindred vents
 some are by sorrows of their own distrest
 as wounded or as ill at ease but more
 tremble at mischief which they deem in store

 clxv
 two moors amid the paynim army were
 from stock obscure in ptolomita grown
 of whom the story an example rare
 of constant love is worthy to be known
 medoro and cloridan were named the pair
 who whether fortune pleased to smile or frown
 served dardinello with fidelity
 and late with him to france had crost the sea

 clxvi
 of nimble frame and strong was cloridane
 throughout his life a follower of the chase
 a cheek of white suffused with crimson grain
 medoro had in youth a pleasing grace
 nor bound on that emprize 'mid all the train
 was there a fairer or more jocund face
 crisp hair he had of gold and jetblack eyes
 and seemed an angel lighted from the skies

 clxvii
 these two were posted on a rampart's height
 with more to guard the encampment from surprise
 when 'mid the equal intervals at night
 medoro gazed on heaven with sleepy eyes
 in all his talk the stripling woful wight
 here cannot choose but of his lord devise
 the royal dardinel and evermore
 him left unhonoured on the field deplore

 clxviii
 then turning to his mate cries "cloridane
 i cannot tell thee what a cause of woe
 it is to me my lord upon the plain
 should lie unworthy food for wolf or crow
 thinking how still to me he was humane
 meseems if in his honour i forego
 this life of mine for favours so immense
 i shall but make a feeble recompense

 clxix
 "that he may lack not sepulture will i
 go forth and seek him out among the slain
 and haply god may will that none shall spy
 where charles's camp lies hushed do thou remain
 that if my death be written in the sky
 thou may'st the deed be able to explain
 so that if fortune foil so fear a feat
 the world through fame my loving heart may weet"

 clxx
 amazed was cloridan a child should show
 such heart such love and such fair loyalty
 and fain would make the youth his though forego
 whom he held passing dear but fruitlessly
 would move his stedfast purpose for such woe
 will neither comforted nor altered be
 medoro is disposed to meet his doom
 or to enclose his master in the tomb

 clxxi
 seeing that nought would bend him nought would move
 "i too will go" was cloridan's reply
 "in such a glorious act myself will prove
 as well such famous death i cover i
 what other thing is left me here above
 deprived of thee medoro mine to die
 with thee in arms is better on the plain
 than afterwards of grief should'st thou be slain"

 clxxii
 and thus resolved disposing in their place
 their guard's relief depart the youthful pair
 leave fosse and palisade and in small space
 are among ours who watch with little care
 who for they little fear the paynim race
 slumber with fires extinguished everywhere
 'mid carriages and arms they lie supine
 up to the eyes immersed in sleep and wine

 clxxiii
 a moment cloridano stopt and cried
 "not to be lost are opportunities
 this troop by whom my master's blood was shed
 medoro ought not i to sacrifice
 do thou lest any one this way be led
 watch everywhere about with ears and eyes
 for a wide way amid the hostile horde
 i offer here to make thee with my sword"

 clxxiv
 so said he and his talk cut quickly short
 coming where learned alpheus slumbered nigh
 who had the year before sought charles's court
 in medicine magic and astrology
 well versed but now in art found smallsupport
 or rather found that it was all a lie
 he had foreseen that he his longdrawn life
 should finish in the bosom of his wife

 clxxv
 and now the saracen with wary view
 has pierced his weasand with the pointed sword
 four others he neat that diviner slew
 nor gave the wretches time to say a word
 sir turpin in his story tells not who
 and time had of their names effaced record
 palidon of moncalier next he speeds
 one who securely sleeps between two steeds

 clxxvi
 next came the warrior where with limbs outspread
 pillowed on barrel lay the wretched gryll
 this he had drained and undisturbed by dread
 hoped to enjoy a peaceful sleep and still
 the daring saracen lopt off his head
 blood issues from the taphole with a rill
 of wine and he well drenched with many a can
 dreams that he drinks dispatched by cloridan

 clxxvii
 next gryll andropono and conrad hight
 a greek and german at two thrusts he gored
 who in the air had past large part of night
 with dice and goblet blest it at that board
 they still had watched till clothed in amber light
 the radiant sun had traversed indus' ford
 but mortals destiny would set at nought
 if every wight futurity were taught

 clxxviii
 as in full fold a lion long unfed
 whom wasting famine had made lean and spare
 devours and rends and swallows and lays dead
 the feeble flock which at his mercy are
 so in their sleep the cruel paynim bled
 our host and made wide slaughter everywhere
 nor blunted was the young medoro's sword
 but he disdained to smite the ignoble horde

 clxxix
 he to labretto's duke leaving those dead
 had come who slumbered with a gentle mate
 each clasping each so closely in their bed
 that air between them could not penetrate
 from both medoro cleanly lopt the head
 oh blessed way of death oh happy fate
 for 'tis my trust that as their bodies so
 their souls embracing to their bourne shall go

 clxxx
 malindo with andalico he slew
 his brother sons to the earl of flanders they
 to whom has bearings each to arms was new
 charles had the lilies given because that day
 the monarch had beheld the valiant two
 with crimsoned staves returning from the fray
 and them with lands in flanders vowed to glad
 and would but that medoro this forbad

 clxxxi
 rearing the insidious blade the pair are near
 the place where round king charles' pavilion
 are tented warlike paladin and peer
 guarding the side that each is camped upon
 when in good time the paynims backward steer
 and sheathe their swords the impious slaughter done
 deeming impossible in such a number
 but they must light on one who does not slumber

 clxxxii
 and though they might escape well charged with prey
 to save themselves they think sufficient gain
 thither by what he deems the safest way
 medoro following him went cloridane
 where in the field 'mid bow and falchion lay
 and shield and spear in pool of purple stain
 wealthy and poor the king and vassal's corse
 and overthrown the rider and his horse

 clxxxiii
 the horrid mixture of the bodies there
 which heaped the plain where roved these comrades sworn
 might well have rendered vain their faithful care
 amid the mighty piles till break of morn
 had not the moon at young medoro's prayer
 out of a gloomy cloud put forth her horn
 medoro to the heavens upturns his eyes
 towards the moon and thus devoutly cries

 clxxxiv
 "o holy goddess whom our fathers well
 have styled as of a triple form and who
 thy sovereign beauty dost in heaven and hell
 and earth in many forms reveal and through
 the greenwood holt of beast and monster fell
  a huntress bold  the flying steps pursue
 show where my king amid so many lies
 who did alive thy holy studies prize"

 clxxxv
 at the youth's prayer from parted cloud outshone
 were it the work of faith or accident
 the moon as fair as when endymion
 she circled in her naked arms with tent
 christian or saracen was paristown
 seen in that gleam and hill and plain's extent
 with these mount martyr and mount levy's height
 this on the left and that upon the right

 clxxxvi
 the silvery splendor glistened yet more clear
 there where renowned almontes' son lay dead
 faithful medoro mourned his master dear
 who well agnized the quartering white and red
 with visage bathed in many a bitter tear
 for he a rill from either eyelid shed
 and piteous act and moan that might have whist
 the winds his melancholy plaint to list

 clxxxvii
 but with a voice supprest not that he aught
 regards if any one the noise should hear
 because he of his life takes any thought
 of which loathed burden he would fain be clear
 but lest his being heard should bring to nought
 the pious purpose which has brought them here
 the youths the king upon their shoulders stowed
 and so between themselves divide the load

 clxxxviii
 hurrying their steps they hastened as they might
 under the cherished burden they conveyed
 and now approaching was the lord of light
 to sweep from heaven the stars from earth the shade
 when good zerbino he whose valiant sprite
 was ne'er in time of need by sleep downweighed
 from chasing moors all night his homeward way
 was taking to the camp at dawn of day

 clxxxix
 he has with him some horsemen in his train
 that from afar the two companions spy
 expecting thus some spoil or prize to gain
 they every one towards that quarter hie
 "brother behoves us" cried young cloridane
 "to cast away the load we bear and fly
 for 'twere a foolish thought might well be said
 to lose two living men to save one dead

 cxc
 and dropt the burden weening his medore
 had done the same by it upon his side
 but that poor boy who loved his master more
 his shoulders to the weight alone applied
 cloridan hurrying with all haste before
 deeming him close behind him or beside
 who did he know his danger him to save
 a thousand deaths instead of one would brave

 cxci
 those horsemen with intent to make the two
 yield themselves prisoners to their band or die
 some here some there disperse the champaign through
 and every pass and outlet occupy
 the captain little distant from his crew
 is keener than the rest the chase to ply
 and when he sees them hurrying in such guise
 is certain that the twain are enemies

 cxcii
 of old an ancient forest clothed that lair
 of trees and underwood a tangled maze
 of salvage beasts alone the wild repair
 and like a labyrinth full of narrow ways
 here from the boughs such shelter hope the pair
 as may conceal them well from hostile gaze
 but him i shall expect who loves the rhyme
 to listen to my tale some other time


 canto 19

 argument
 medoro by angelica's quaint hand
 is healed and weds and bears her to catay
 at length marphisa with the chosen band
 after long suffering makes laiazzi's bay
 guido the savage bondsman in the land
 which impious women rule with civil sway
 with marphisa strives in single fight
 and lodges her and hers at full of night


 i
 by whom he is beloved can no one know
 who on the top of fortune's wheel is seated
 since he by true and faithless friends with show
 of equal faith in glad estate is greeted
 but should felicity be changed to woe
 the flattering multitude is turned and fleeted
 while he who loves his master from his heart
 even after death performs his faithful part

 ii
 were the heart seen as is the outward cheer
 he who at court is held in sovereign grace
 and he that to his lord is little dear
 with parts reversed would fill each other's place
 the humble man the greater would appear
 and he now first be hindmost in the race
 but be medoro's faithful story said
 the youth who loved his lord alive or dead

 iii
 the closest path amid the forest gray
 to save himself pursued the youth forlorn
 but all his schemes were marred by the delay
 of that sore weight upon his shoulders born
 the place he knew not and mistook the way
 and hid himself again in sheltering thorn
 secure and distant was his mate that through
 the greenwood shade with lighter shoulders flew

 iv
 so far was cloridan advanced before
 he heard the boy no longer in the wind
 but when he marked the absence of medore
 it seemed as if his heart was left behind
 "ah how was i so negligent" the moor
 exclaimed "so far beside myself and blind
 that i medoro should without thee fare
 nor know when i deserted thee or where"

 v
 so saying in the wood he disappears
 plunging into the maze with hurried pace
 and thither whence he lately issued steers
 and desperate of death returns in trace
 cries and the tread of steeds this while he hears
 and word and the tread of foemen as in chase
 lastly medoro by his voice is known
 disarmed on foot 'mid many horse alone

 vi
 a hundred horsemen who the youth surround
 zerbino leads and bids his followers seize
 the stripling like a top the boy turns round
 and keeps him as he can among the trees
 behind oak elm beech ash he takes his ground
 nor from the cherished load his shoulders frees
 wearied at length the burden he bestowed
 upon the grass and stalked about his load

 vii
 as in her rocky cavern the shebear
 with whom close warfare alpine hunters wage
 uncertain hangs about her shaggy care
 and growls in mingled sound of love and rage
 to unsheath her claws and blood her tushes bare
 would natural hate and wrath the beast engage
 love softens her and bids from strife retire
 and for her offspring watch amid her ire

 viii
 cloridan who to aid him knows not how
 and with medoro willingly would die
 but who would not for death this being forego
 until more foes than one should lifeless lie
 ambushed his sharpest arrow to his bow
 fits and directs it with so true an eye
 the feathered weapon bores a scotchman's brain
 and lays the warrior dead upon the plain

 ix
 together all the others of the band
 turned thither whence was shot the murderous reed
 meanwhile he launched another from his stand
 that a new foe might by the weapon bleed
 whom while he made of this and that demand
 and loudly questioned who had done the deed
 the arrow reached  transfixed the wretch's throat
 and cut his question short in middle note

 x
 zerbino captain of those horse no more
 can at the piteous sight his wrath refrain
 in furious heat he springs upon medore
 exclaiming "thou of this shalt bear the pain"
 one hand he in his locks of golden ore
 enwreaths and drags him to himself amain
 but as his eyes that beauteous face survey
 takes pity on the boy and does not slay

 xi
 to him the stripling turns with suppliant cry
 and "by thy god sir knight" exclaims "i pray
 be not so passing cruel nor deny
 that i in earth my honoured king may lay
 no other grace i supplicate nor i
 this for the love of life believe me say
 so much no longer space of life i crave
 as may suffice to give my lord a grave

 xii
 "and if you needs must feed the beast and bird
 like theban creon let their worst be done
 upon these limbs so that by me interred
 in earth be those of good almontes' son"
 medoro thus his suit with grace preferred
 and words  to move a mountain and so won
 upon zerbino's mood to kindness turned
 with love and pity he all over burned

 xiii
 this while a churlish horseman of the band
 who little deference for his lord confest
 his lance uplifting wounded overhand
 the unhappy suppliant in his dainty breast
 zerbino who the cruel action scanned
 was deeply stirred the rather that opprest
 and livid with the blow the churl had sped
 medoro fell as he was wholly dead

 xiv
 so grieved zerbino with such wrath was stung
 "not unavenged shalt thou remain" he cries
 then full of evil will in fury sprung
 upon the author of the foul emprize
 but he his vantage marks and from among
 the warriors in a moment slips and flies
 cloridan who beholds the deed at sight
 of young medoro's fall springs forth to fight

 xv
 and casts away his bow and 'mid the band
 of foemen whirls his falchion in desire
 rather of death than hoping that his hand
 may snatch a vengeance equal to his ire
 amid so many blades he views the sand
 tinged with his blood and ready to expire
 and feeling he the sword no more can guide
 lets himself drop by his medoro's side

 xvi
 the scots pursue their chief who pricks before
 through the deep wood inspired by high disdain
 when he has left the one and the other moor
 this dead that scarce alive upon the plain
 there for a mighty space lay young medore
 spouting his lifeblood from so large a vein
 he would have perished but that thither made
 a stranger as it chanced who lent him aid

 xvii
 by chance arrived a damsel at the place
 who was though mean and rustic was her wear
 of royal presence and of beauteous face
 and lofty manners sagely debonair
 her have i left unsung so long a space
 that you will hardly recognise the fair
 angelica in her if known not scan
 the lofty daughter of catay's great khan

 xviii
 angelica when she had won again
 the ring brunello had from her conveyed
 so waxed in stubborn pride and haught disdain
 she seemed to scorn this ample world and strayed
 alone and held as cheap each living swain
 although amid the best by fame arrayed
 nor brooked she to remember a galant
 in count orlando or king sacripant

 xix
 and above every other deed repented
 that good rinaldo she had loved of yore
 and that to look so low she had consented
 as by such choice dishonoured grieved her sore
 love hearing this such arrogance resented
 and would the damsel's pride endure no more
 where young medoro lay he took his stand
 and waited her with bow and shaft in hand

 xx
 when fair angelica the stripling spies
 nigh hurt to death in that disastrous fray
 who for his king that there unsheltered lies
 more sad than for his own misfortune lay
 she feels new pity in her bosom rise
 which makes its entry in unwonted way
 touched was her haughty heart once hard and curst
 and more when he his piteous tale rehearsed

 xxi
 and calling back to memory her art
 for she in ind had learned chirurgery
 since it appears such studies in that part
 worthy of praise and fame are held to be
 and as an heirloom sires to sons impart
 with little aid of books the mystery
 disposed herself to work with simples' juice
 till she in him should healthier life produce

 xxii
 and recollects a herb had caught her sight
 in passing hither on a pleasant plain
 what whether dittany or pancy hight
 i know not fraught with virtue to restrain
 the crimson blood forthwelling and of might
 to sheathe each perilous and piercing pain
 she found it near and having pulled the weed
 returned to seek medoro on the mead

 xxiii
 returning she upon a swain did light
 who was on horseback passing through the wood
 strayed from the lowing herd the rustic wight
 a heifer missing for two days pursued
 him she with her conducted where the might
 of the faint youth was ebbing with his blood
 which had the ground about so deeply dyed
 life was nigh wasted with the gushing tide

 xxiv
 angelica alights upon the ground
 and he her rustic comrade at her hest
 she hastened 'twixt two stones the herb to pound
 then took it and the healing juice exprest
 with this did she foment the stripling's wound
 and even to the hips his waist and breast
 and with such virtue was the salve endued
 it stanched his lifeblood and his strength renewed

 xxv
 and into him infused such force again
 that he could mount the horse the swain conveyed
 but good medoro would not leave the plain
 till he in earth had seen his master laid
 he with the monarch buried cloridane
 and after followed whither pleased the maid
 who was to stay with him by pity led
 beneath the courteous shepherd's humble shed

 xxvi
 nor would the damsel quit the lowly pile
 so she esteemed the youth till he was sound
 such pity first she felt when him erewhile
 she saw outstretched and bleeding on the ground
 touched by his mien and manners next a file
 she felt corrode her heart with secret wound
 she felt corrode her heart and with desire
 by little and by little warmed took fire

 xxvii
 the shepherd dwelt between two mountains hoar
 in goodly cabin in the greenwood shade
 with wife and children and short time before
 the brentnew shed had builded in the glade
 here of his griesly wound the youthful moor
 was briefly healed by the catayan maid
 but who in briefer space a sorer smart
 than young medoro's suffered at her heart

 xxviii
 a wound far wider and which deeper lies
 now in her heart she feels from viewless bow
 which from the boy's fair hair and beauteous eyes
 had the winged archer dealt a sudden glow
 she feels and still the flames increasing rise
 yet less she heeds her own than other's woe
  heeds not herself and only to content
 the author of her cruel ill is bent

 xxix
 her ill but festered and increased the more
 the stripling's wounds were seen to heal and close
 the youth grew lusty while she suffered sore
 and with new fever parched now burnt now froze
 from day to day in beauty waxed medore
 she miserably wasted like the snow's
 unseasonable flake which melts away
 exposed in sunny place to scorching ray

 xxx
 she if of vain desire will not die
 must help herself nor yet delay the aid
 and she in truth her will to satisfy
 deemed 'twas no time to wait till she was prayed
 and next of shame renouncing every tye
 with tongue as bold as eyes petition made
 and begged him haply an unwitting foe
 to sheathe the suffering of that cruel blow

 xxxi
 o count orlando o king of circassy
 say what your valour has availed to you
 say what your honour boots what goodly fee
 remunerates ye both for service true
 sirs show me but a single courtesy
 with which she ever graced ye  old or new 
 as some poor recompense desert or guerdon
 for having born so long so sore a burden

 xxxii
 oh couldst thou yet again to life return
 how hard would this appear o agricane
 in that she whilom thee was wont to spurn
 with sharp repulse and insolent disdain
 o ferrau o ye thousand more forlorn
 unsung who wrought a thousand feats in vain
 for this ungrateful fair what pain 'twould be
 could you within his arms the damsel see

 xxxiii
 to pluck as yet untouched the virgin rose
 angelica permits the young medore
 was none so blest as in that garden's close
 yet to have set his venturous foot before
 they holy ceremonies interpose
 somedeal to veil  to gild  the matter o'er
 young love was bridesman there the tie to bless
 and for brideswoman stood the shepherdess

 xxxiv
 in the low shed with all solemnities
 the couple made their wedding as they might
 and there above a month in tranquil guise
 the happy lovers rested in delight
 save for the youth the lady has no eyes
 nor with his looks can satisfy her sight
 nor yet of hanging on his neck can tire
 of feel she can content her fond desire

 xxxv
 the beauteous boy is with her night and day
 does she untent herself or keep the shed
 morning or eve they to some meadow stray
 now to this bank and to that other led
 haply in cavern harboured at midday
 grateful as that to which aeneas fled
 with dido when the tempest raged above
 the faithful witness to their secret love

 xxxvi
 amid such pleasures where with tree o'ergrown
 ran stream or bubbling fountain's wave did spin
 on bark or rock if yielding were the stone
 the knife was straight at work or ready pin
 and there without in thousand places lone
 and in as many places graved within
 medoro and angelica were traced
 in divers cyphers quaintly interlaced

 xxxvii
 when she believed they had prolonged their stay
 more than enow the damsel made design
 in india to revisit her catay
 and with its crown medoro's head entwine
 she had upon her wrist an armlet gay
 with costly gems in witness and in sign
 of love to her by count orlando borne
 and which the damsel for long time had worn

 xxxviii
 on ziliantes hid beneath the wave
 this morgue bestowed and from captivity
 the youth restored to monodantes grave
 his ancient sire through roland's chivalry
 to roland in return the bracelet gave
 roland a lover deigned the gorgeous fee
 to wear with the intention to convey
 the present to his queen of whom i say

 xxxix
 no love which to the paladin she bears
 but that it costly is and wrought with care
 this to angelica so much endears
 that never more esteemed was matter rare
 this she was suffered in the isle of tears
 i know not by what privilege to wear
 when naked to the whale exposed for food
 by that inhospitable race and rude

 xl
 she not possessing wherewithal to pay
 the kindly couple's hospitality
 served by them in their cabin from the day
 she there was lodged with such fidelity
 unfastened from her arm the bracelet gay
 and bade them keep it for her memory
 departing hence the lovers climb the side
 of hills which fertile france from spain divide

 xli
 within valencia or barcelona's town
 the couple thought a little to remain
 until some goodly ship should make her boun
 to loose for the levant as so the twain
 journey beneath gerona  coming down
 those mountains  they behold the subject main
 and keeping on their left the beach below
 by beaten track to barcelona go

 xlii
 but ere they there arrive a crazed wight
 they find extended on the outer shore
 who is bedaubed like swine in filthy plight
 and smeared with mud face reins and bosom o'er'
 he comes upon them as a dog in spite
 swiftly assails the stranger at the door
 and is about to do the lovers scorn
 but to the bold marphisa i return 

 xliii
 marphisa astolpho gryphon aquilant
 of these and of the others will i tell
 who death before their eyes the vext levant
 traverse and ill resist the boisterous swell
 while aye more passing proud and arrogant
 waxes in rage and threat the tempest fell
 and now three days the angry gale has blown
 nor signal of abatement yet has shown

 xliv
 waves lifted by the waxing tempest start
 castle and flooring and if yet there be
 aught standing left in any other part
 'tis cut away and cast into the sea
 here pricking out their course upon the chart
 one by a lantern does his ministry
 upon a seachest propt another wight
 is busied in the well by torch's light

 xlv
 this one beneath the poop beneath the prow
 that other stands to watch the ebbing sand
 and each halfglass run out returns to know
 what way the ship has made and towards what land
 thence all to speak their different thoughts below
 to midships make resort with chart in hand
 there where the mariners assembled all
 are met in council at the master's call

 xlvi
 one says "abreast of limisso are we
 among the shoals"  and by his reckoning nigh
 the rocks of tripoli and bark must be
 where shipwrecked for the most part vessels lie
 another "we are lost on sataly
 whose coast makes many patrons weep and sigh"
 according to their judgment all suggest
 their treasons each with equal dread opprest

 xlvii
 more spitefully the wind on the third day
 blows and the sea more yeasty billows rears
 the foremast by the first is borne away
 the rudder by the last with him who steers
 better than steel that man will bide the assay
  of marble breast  who has not now his fears
 marphisa erst so confident 'mid harms
 denied not but that day she felt alarms

 xlviii
 a pilgrimage is vowed to sinai
 to cyprus and gallicia and to rome
 ettino and other place of sanctity
 if such is named and to the holy tomb
 meanwhile above the sea and near the sky
 the bark is tost with shattered plank and boom
 from which the crew had cut in her distress
 the mizenmast to make her labour less

 xlix
 they bale and chest and all their heavy lumber
 cast overboard from poop and prow and side
 and every birth and cabin disencumber
 of merchandize to feed the greedy tide
 water to water others of the number
 rendered by whom the spouting pumps were plied
 this in the hold bestirs himself where'er
 planks opened by the beating sea appear

 l
 they in this trouble in this woe remained
 for full four days and helpless was their plight
 and a full victory the sea had gained
 if yet a little had endured its spite
 but them with hope of clearer sky sustained
 the wished appearance of st elmo's light
 which every spar was gone descending glowed
 upon a boat which in the prow was stowed

 li
 when flaming they the beauteous light surveyed
 all those aboard kneeled down in humble guise
 and heaven for peace and for smooth water prayed
 with trembling voices and with watery eyes
 nor longer waxed the storm which had dismayed
 till then enduring in such cruel wise
 northwester or crosswind no longer reigns
 but tyrant of the sea the south remains

 lii
 this on the sea remained so passing strong
 and from its sable mouth so fiercely blew
 and bore with it so swift a stream and strong
 of the vext waters that it hurried through
 their tumbling waves the shattered bark along
 faster than gentle falcon ever flew
 and sore the patron feared to the world's brink
 it would transport his bark or wreck or sink

 liii
 for this the master finds a remedy
 who bids them cast out spars and veer away
 a line which holds this float and as they flee
 so by twothirds their furious course delay
 this counsel boots and more the augury
 from him whose lights upon the gunwale play
 this saves the vessel haply else undone
 and makes her through the sea securely run

 liv
 they driven on syria in laiazzo's bay
 a mighty city rise so nigh at hand
 that they can from the vessel's deck survey
 two castles which the port within command
 pale turns the patron's visage with dismay
 when he perceives what is the neighbouring land
 who will not to the port for shelter hie
 nor yet can keep the open sea nor fly

 lv
 they cannot fly nor yet can keep the sea
 for mast and yards are gone and by the stroke
 of the huge billows beating frequently
 loosened is plank and beam and timber broke
 and certain death to make the port would be
 or to be doomed to a perpetual yoke
 for each is made a slave or sentenced dead
 thither by evil chance or error led

 lvi
 sore dangerous 'twas to doubt lest hostile band
 should sally from the puissant town in sight
 with armed barks and upon theirs lay hand
 in evil case for sea and worse for fight
 what time the patron knows not what command
 to give of him inquires the english knight
 what kept his mind suspended in that sort
 and why at first he had not made the port

 lvii
 to him relates the patron how a crew
 of murderous women tenanted that shore
 which by their ancient law enslave or slew
 all those whom fortune to this kingdom bore
 and that he only could such for eschew
 that in the lists ten champions overbore
 and having this achieved the following night
 in bed should with ten damsels take delight

 lviii
 and if he brings to end the former feat
 but afterwards the next unfinished leaves
 they kill him and as slaves his following treat
 condemned to delve their land or keep their beeves
  if for the first and second labour meet 
 he liberty for all his band achieves
 not for himself who there must stay and wed
 ten wives by him selected for his bed

 lix
 so strange a custom of the neighbouring strand
 without a laugh astolpho cannot hear
 sansonet and marphisa near at hand
 next aquilant and he his brother dear
 arrive to them the patron who from land
 aye keeps aloof explains the cause of fear
 and cries "i liefer in the sea would choke
 than here of servitude endure the yoke"

 lx
 the sailors by the patron's rede abide
 and all the passengers affrighted sore
 save that marphisa took the other side
 with hers who deemed that safer was the shore
 than sea which raging round them far and wide
 than a hundred thousand swords dismayed them more
 them little this or other place alarms
 so that they have but power to wield their arms

 lxi
 the warriors are impatient all to land
 but boldest is of these the english peer
 knowing how soon his horn will clear the strand
 when the scared foe its pealing sound shall hear
 to put into the neighbouring port this band
 desires and are at strife with those who fear
 and they who are the strongest in such sort
 compel the patron that he makes the port

 lxii
 already when their bark was first espied
 at sea within the cruel city's view
 they had observed a galley well supplied
 with practised mariners and numerous crew
 while them uncertain counsels did divide
 make for their wretched ship the billows through
 her lofty prow to their short stern and low
 these lash and into port the vessel tow

 lxiii
 they thitherward were worked with warp and oar
 rather than with assistance of the sail
 since to lay starboard course or larboard more
 no means were left them by the cruel gale
 again their rugged rhind the champions wore
 girding the faithful falchion with the mail
 and with unceasing hope of comfort fed
 master and mariners opprest with dread

 lxiv
 like a halfmoon projected from the beach
 more than four miles about the city's port
 six hundred paces deep and crowning each
 horn of the circling haven was a fort
 on every side secure from storm or breach
 save only from the south a safe resort
 in guise of theatre the town extended
 about it and a hill behind ascended

 lxv
 no sooner there the harboured ship was seen
 the news had spread already through the land
 than thitherward with martial garb and mien
 six thousand women trooped with bow in hand
 and to remove all hope of flight between
 one castle and the other drew a band
 and with strong chains and barks the port enclosed
 which ever for that use they kept disposed

 lxvi
 a dame as the cumean sybil gray
 or hector's ancient mother of renown
 made call the patron out and bade him say
 if they their lives were willing to lay down
 or were content beneath the yoke to stay
 according to the custom of the town
  one of two evils they must choose  be slain
 or captives one and all must there remain

 lxvii
 " 'tis true if one so bold and of such might
 be found amid your crew" the matron said
 "that he ten men of ours engage in fight
 and can in cruel battle lay them dead
 and after with ten women in one night
 suffice to play the husband's part in bed
 he shall remain our sovereign and shall sway
 the land and you may homeward wend your way

 lxviii
 "and at your choice to stay shall also be
 whether a part or all but with this pact
 that he who here would stay and would be free
 can with ten dames the husband's part enact
 but if your chosen warrior fall or flee
 by his ten enemies at once attacked
 or for the second function have not breath
 to slavery you we doom and him to death"

 lxix
 at what she deemed the cavaliers would start
 the beldam found them bold for to compete
 with those they should engage and play their part
 the champions hoped alike in either feat
 nor failed renowned marphisa's valiant heart
 albeit for the second dance unmeet
 secure where nature had her aid denied
 the want should with the falchion be supplied

 lxx
 the patron is commanded their reply
 resolved in common council to unfold
 the dames at pleasure may their prowess try
 and shall in lists and bed allow them bold
 the lashings from the vessels they untie
 the skipper heaves the warp and bids lay hold
 and lowers the bridge o'er which in warlike weed
 the expectant cavaliers their coursers lead

 lxxi
 these through the middle of the city go
 and see the damsels as they forward fare
 ride through the streets succinct in haughty show
 and arm in guise of warriors in the square
 nor to gird sword nor fasten spur below
 is man allowed nor any arm to wear
 excepting as i said the ten to follow
 the ancient usage which those women hallow

 lxxii
 all others of the manly sex they seat
 to ply the distaff broider card and sow
 in female gown descending to the feet
 which renders them effeminate and slow
 some chained another labour to complete
 are tasked to keep their cattle or to plough
 few are the males and scarce the warriors ken
 amid a thousand dames a hundred men

 lxxiii
 the knights determining by lot to try
 who in their common cause on listed ground
 should slay the ten with whom they were to vie
 and in the other field ten others wound
 designed to pass the bold marphisa by
 believing she unfitting would be found
 and would be in the second joust at eve
 illqualified the victory to achieve

 lxxiv
 but with the others she the martial maid
 will run her risque and 'tis her destiny
 "i will lay down this life" the damsel said
 "rather than you lay down your liberty
 but this"  with that she pointed to the blade
 which she had girt  "is your security
 i will all tangles in such manner loose
 as alexander did the gordian noose

 lxxv
 "i will not henceforth stranger shall complain
 so long as the world lasts of this repair"
 so said the maid nor could the friendly train
 take from her what had fallen to her share
 then  either every thing to lose or gain
 their liberty  to her they leave the care
 with stubborn plate and mail all over steeled
 ready for cruel fight she takes the field

 lxxvi
 high up the spacious city is place
 with steps which serve as seats in rising rows
 which for nought else is used except the chase
 tourney or wrestling match or suchlike shows
 four gates of solid bronze the rabble flows
 in troubled tide and to marphisa bold
 that she may enter afterwards is told

 lxxvii
 on pieballed horse marphisa entered  spread
 were circles dappling all about his hair 
 of a bold countenance and little head
 and beauteous points and haughty gait and air
 out of a thousand coursers which he fed
 him as the best and biggest and most rare
 king norandino chose and decked with brave
 and costly trappings to marphisa gave

 lxxviii
 through the south gate from the midday the plain
 marphisa entered nor expected long
 before she heard approaching trumpetstrain
 peal through the lists in shrilling notes and strong
 and looking next towards the northern wain
 saw her ten opposites appear among
 these as their leader pricked a cavalier
 excelling all the rest in goodly cheer

 lxxix
 on a large courser came the leading foe
 which was excepting the near foot behind
 and forehead darker than was ever crow
 his foot and forehead with some white were signed
 the horseman did his horse's colours show
 in his own dress and hence might be divined
 he as the mournful hue o'erpowered the clear
 was less inclined to smile than mournful tear

 lxxx
 at once their spears in rest nine warriors laid
 when the trump sounded in the hostile train
 but he in black no sign of jousting made
 as if he held such vantage in disdain
 better he deemed the law were disobeyed
 than that his courtesy should suffer stain
 the knight retires apart and sits to view
 what against nine one single lance can do

 lxxxi
 of smooth and balanced pace the damsel's horse
 to the encounter her with swiftness bore
 who poised a lance so massive in the course
 it would have been an overweight for four
 she disembarking as of greatest force
 the boom had chosen out of many more
 at her fierce semblance when in motion quail
 a thousand hearts a thousand looks grow pale

 lxxxii
 the bosom of the first she opens so
 as might surprise if naked were the breast
 she pierced the cuirass and the mail below
 but first a buckler solid and well prest
 a yard behind the shoulders of the foe
 was seen the steel so well was it addrest
 speared on her lance she left him on the plain
 and at the others drove with flowing rein

 lxxxiii
 and so she shocked the second of the crew
 and dealt the third so terrible a blow
 from sell and life with broken spine the two
 she drove at once so fell the overthrow
 and with such weight she charged the warriors through
 so serried was the battle of the foe 
 i have seen bombard open in such mode
 the squadrons as that band marphisa strowed

 lxxxiv
 many good spears were broken on the dame
 who was as little moved as solid wall
 when revellers play the chace's merry game
 is ever moved by stroke of heavy ball
 so hard the temper of her corslet's mail
 the strokes aye harmless on the breastplate fall
 whose steel was heated in the fires of hell
 and in avernus' water slaked by spell

 lxxxv
 at the end of the career she checked her steed
 wheeled him about and for a little stayed
 and then against the others drove at speed
 broke them and to the handle dyed her blade
 here shorn of arms and there of head they bleed
 and other in such manner cleft the maid
 that breast and head and arms together fell
 belly and legs remaining in the sell

 lxxxvi
 with such just measure him she cleaves i say
 where the two haunches and the ribs confine
 and leaves him a half figure in such way
 as what we before images divine
 of silver oftener made of wax survey
 which supplicants from far and near enshrine
 in thanks for mercy shown and to bestow
 a pious quittance for accepted vow

 lxxxvii
 marphisa next made after one that flew
 and overtook the wretch and cleft before
 he the mid square had won his collar through
 so clean no surgeon ever pieced it more
 one after other all in fine she slew
 or wounded every one she smote so sore
 she was secure that never more would foe
 arise anew from earth to work her woe

 lxxxviii
 the cavalier this while had stood aside
 who had the ten conducted to the place
 since with so many against one to ride
 had seemed to him advantage four and base
 who now he by a single hand espied
 so speedily his whole array displaced
 pricked forth against the martial maid to show
 'twas courtesy not fear had made him slow

 lxxxix
 he signing with his right hand made appear
 that he would speak ere their career was run
 nor thinking that beneath such manly cheer
 a gentle virgin was concealed begun
 "i wot thou needs must be sir cavalier
 sore wearied with such mighty slaughter done
 and if i were disposed to weary thee
 more than thou art it were discourtesy

 xc
 "to thee to rest until tomorrow's light
 then to renew the battle i concede
 no honour 'twere today to prove my might
 on thee whom weak and overwrought i read"
  "arms are not new to me nor listed fight
 nor does fatigue so short a toil succeed"
 answered marphisa "and i at my post
 hope to prove this upon thee to thy cost

 xci
 "i thank thee for thy offer of delay
 but need not what thy courtesy agrees
 and yet remains so large a space of day
 'twere very shame to spend it all in ease"
  "oh were i he replied so sure to appay
 my heart with everything which best would please
 as thine i shall appay in this  but see
 that ere thou thinkest daylight fail not thee"

 xcii
 so said he and obedient to his hest
 two spears say rather heavy booms they bear
 he to marphisa bids consigns the best
 and the other takes himself the martial pair
 already with their lances in the rest
 wait but till other blast the joust declare
 lo earth and air and sea the noise rebound
 as they prick forth at the first trumpet's sound

 xciii
 no mouth was opened and no eyelid fell
 nor breath was drawn amid the observant crew
 so sore intent was every one to spell
 which should be conqueror of the warlike two
 marphisa the black champion from his sell
 so to o'erthrow he shall not rise anew
 levels her lance and the black champion bent
 to slay marphisa spurs with like intent

 xciv
 both lances made of willow thin and dry
 rather than stout and stubborn oak appeared
 so splintered even to the rest they fly
 while with such force the encountering steeds careered
 it seemed as with a scytheblade equally
 the hams of either courser had been sheared
 alike both fall but voiding quick the seat
 the nimble riders start upon their feet

 xcv
 marphisa in her life with certain wound
 a thousand cavaliers on earth had laid
 and never had herself been borne to ground
 yet quitted now the saddle as was said
 not only at the accident astound
 but nigh beside herself remained the maid
 strange to the sable cavalier withal
 unwont to be unhorsed appeared his fall

 xcvi
 they scarcely touch the ground before they gain
 their feet and now the fierce assault renew
 with cut and thrust which now with shield the twain
 or blade ward off and now by leaps eschew
 whether the foes strike home or smite in vain
 blows ring and echo parted aether through
 more force those shields those helms those breastplates show
 than anvils underneath the sounding blow

 xcvii
 if heavy falls the savage damsel's blade
 that falls not lightly of her warlike foe
 equal the measure one the other paid
 and both receive as much as they bestow
 he who would see two daring spirits weighed
 to seek two fiercer need no further go
 nor to seek more dexterity or might
 for greater could not be in mortal wight

 xcviii
 the women who have sate long time to view
 the champions with such horrid strokes offend
 nor sign of trouble in the warriors true
 behold nor yet of weariness commend
 them with just praises as the worthiest two
 that are where'er the sea's wide arms extend
 they deem these of mere toil and labour long
 must die save they be strongest of the strong

 xcix
 communing with herself marphisa said
 "that he moved not before was well for me
 who risqued to have been numbered with the dead
 if he at first had joined his company
 since as it is i hardly can make head
 against his deadly blows" this colloquy
 she with herself maintained and while she spoke
 ceased not to ply her sword with circling stroke

 c
 " 'twas well for me" the other cried again
 "that to repose i did not leave the knight
 i now from him defend myself with pain
 who is o'erwearied with the former fight
 what had he been renewed in might and main
 if he had rested till tomorrow's light
 right fortunate was i as man could be
 that he refused my proffered courtesy"

 ci
 till eve they strove nor did it yet appear
 which had the vantage of the doubtful fray
 nor without light could either foe see clear
 now to avoid the furious blows when day
 was done again the courteous cavalier
 to his illustrious opposite 'gan say
 "what shall we do since illtimed shades descend
 while we with equal fortune thus contend"

 cii
 "meseems at least that till tomorrow's morn
 'twere better thou prolonged thy life no right
 have i thy doom sir warrior to adjourn
 beyond the limits of one little night
 nor will i that by me the blame be born
 that thou no longer shalt enjoy the light
 with reason to the sex's charge by whom
 this place is governed lay thy cruel doom"

 ciii
 "if i lament thee and thy company
 he knows by whom all hidden things are spied
 thou and thy comrades may repose with me
 for whom there is no safe abode beside
 since leagued against you in conspiracy
 are all those husbands by thy hand have died
 for every valiant warrior of the men
 slain in the tourney consort was of ten

 civ
 "the scathe they have today received from thee
 would ninety women wreak with vengeful spite
 and save thou take my hospitality
 except by them to be assailed this night"
  "i take thy proffer in security"
 replied marphisa "that the faith so plight
 and goodness of thy heart will prove no less
 than are thy corporal strength and hardiness

 cv
 "but if as having to kill me thou grieve
 thou well mayst grieve for reasons opposite
 nor hast thou cause to laugh as i conceive
 nor hitherto has found me worst in fight
 whether thou wouldst defer the fray or leave
 or prosecute by this or other light
 behold me prompt thy wishes to fulfil
 where and whenever it shall be thy will"

 cvi
 so by consent the combatants divided
 till the dawn broke from ganges' stream anew
 and so remained the question undecided
 which was the better champion of the two
 to both the brothers and the rest who sided
 upon that part the liberal lord did sue
 with courteous prayer that till the coming day
 they would be pleased beneath his roof to stay

 cvii
 they unsuspecting with the prayer complied
 and by the cheerful blaze of torches white
 a royal dome ascended with their guide
 divided into many bowers and bright
 the combatants remain as stupified
 on lifting up their vizors at the sight
 one of the other for by what appears
 the warrior hardly numbers eighteen years

 cviii
 much marvels with herself the gentle dame
 that one so young so well should do and dare
 much marvels he his wonderment the same
 when he her sex agnizes by her hair
 questioning one another of their name
 as speedily reply the youthful pair
 but how was hight the youthful cavalier
 await till the ensuing strain to hear


 canto 20

 argument
 guido and his from that foul haunt retire
 while all astolpho chases with his horn
 who to all quarters of the town sets fire
 then roving singly round the world is borne
 marphisa for gabrina's cause in ire
 puts upon young zerbino scathe and scorn
 and makes him guardian of gabrina fell
 from whom he first learns news of isabel


 i
 great fears the women of antiquity
 in arms and hallowed arts as well have done
 and of their worthy works the memory
 and lustre through this ample world has shone
 praised is camilla with harpalice
 for the fair course which they in battle run
 corinna and sappho famous for their lore
 shine two illustrious light to set no more

 ii
 women have reached the pinnacle of glory
 in every art by them professed well seen
 and whosoever turns the leaf of story
 finds record of them neither dim nor mean
 the evil influence will be transitory
 if long deprived of such the world had been
 and envious men and those that never knew
 their worth have haply hid their honours due

 iii
 to me it plainly seems in this our age
 of women such is the celebrity
 that it may furnish matter to the page
 whence this dispersed to future years shall be
 and you ye evil tongues which foully rage
 be tied to your eternal infamy
 and women's praises so resplendent show
 they shall by much marphisa's worth outgo

 iv
 to her returning yet again the dame
 to him who showed to her such courteous lore
 refused not to disclose her martial name
 since he agreed to tell the style be bore
 she quickly satisfied the warrior's claim
 to learn his title she desired so sore
 "i am marphisa" the virago cried
 all else was known as bruited far and wide

 v
 the other since 'twas his to speak begun
 with longer preamble "amid your train
 sirs it is my belief that there is none
 but has heard mention of my race and strain
 not pontus aethiopia ind alone
 with all their neighbouring realms but france and spain
 wot well of clermont from whose loins the knight
 issued who killed almontes bold in fight

 vi
 "and chiareillo and mambrino slew
 and sacked the realm whose royal crown they wore
 come of this blood where danube's waters through
 eight horns or ten to meet the euxine pour
 me to the farrenowned duke aymon who
 thither a stranger roved my mother bore
 and 'tis a twelvemonth now since her in quest
 of my french kin i left with grief opprest

 vii
 "but reached not france for southern tempest's spite
 impelled me hither lodged in royal bower
 ten months or more for  miserable wight 
 i reckon every day and every hour
 guido the savage i by name am hight
 ill known and scarcely proved in warlike stower
 here argilon of meliboea i
 slew with ten warriors in his company

 viii
 "conqueror as well in other field confessed
 ten ladies are the partners of my bed
 selected at my choice who are the best
 and fairest damsels in this kingdom bred
 these i command as well as all the rest
 who of their female band have made me head
 and so would make another who in fight
 like me ten opposites to death would smite"

 ix
 sir guido is besought of them to say
 why there appear so few of the male race
 and to declare if women there bear sway
 o'er men as men o'er them in other place
 he "since my fortune has been here to stay
 i oftentimes have heard relate the case
 and now according to the story told
 will since it pleases you the cause unfold

 x
 "when after twenty years the grecian host
 returned from troy ten years hostility
 the town endured ten weary years were tost
 the greeks detained by adverse winds at sea
 they found their women had for comforts lost
 and pangs of absence learned a remedy
 and that they might not freeze alone in bed
 chosen young lovers in their husbands' stead

 xi
 "with others' children filled the grecian crew
 their houses found and by consent was past
 a pardon to their women for they knew
 how ill they could endure so long a fast
 but the adulterous issue as their due
 to seek their fortunes on the world were cast
 because the husbands would not suffer more
 the striplings should be nourished from their store

 xii
 "some are exposed and others underhand
 their kindly mothers shelter and maintain
 while the adults in many a various band
 some here some there dispersed their living gain
 arms are the trade of some by some are scanned
 letters and arts another tills the plain
 one serves in court by other guided go
 the herd as pleases her who rules below

 xiii
 "a boy departed with they youthful peers
 who was of cruel clytemnestra born
 like lily fresh he numbered eighteen years
 or blooming rose newgathered from the thorn
 he having armed a bark his pinnace steers
 in search of plunder o'er the billows borne
 with him a hundred other youths engage
 picked from all greece and of their leader's age

 xiv
 "the cretans who had banished in that day
 idomeneus the tyrant of their land
 and their new state to strengthen and upstay
 were gathering arms and levying martial band
 phalantus' service by their goodly pay
 purchased so hight the youth who sought that strand
 and all those others that his fortune run
 who the dictaean city garrison

 xv
 "amid the hundred cities of old crete
 was the dictaean the most rich and bright
 of fair and amorous dames the joyous seat
 joyous with festive sports from morn to night
 and as her townsmen aye were wont to greet
 the stranger with such hospitable rite
 they welcomed these it little lacked but they
 granted them o'er their households sovereign sway

 xvi
 "youthful and passing fair were all the crew
 the flower of greece who bold phalantus led
 so that with those fair ladies at first view
 stealing their hearts full well the striplings sped
 since fair in deed as show they good and true
 lovers evinced themselves and bold in bed
 and in few days to them so grateful proved
 above all dearest things they were beloved

 xvii
 "after the war was ended on accord
 for which were hired phalantus and his train
 and pay withdrawn nor longer by the sword
 was aught which the adventurous youth can gain
 and they for this anew would go aboard
 the unhappy cretan women more complain
 and fuller tears on this occasion shed
 that if their fathers lay before them dead

 xviii
 "long time and sorely all the striplings bold
 were each apart by them implored to stay
 who since the fleeting youths they cannot hold
 leave brother sire and son with these to stray
 of jewels and of weighty sums of gold
 spoiling their households ere they wend their way
 for so well was the plot concealed no wight
 throughout all crete was privy to their flight

 xix
 "so happy was the hour so fair the wind
 when young phalantus chose his time to flee
 they many miles had left the isle behind
 ere crete lamented her calamity
 next uninhabited by human kind
 this shore received them wandering o'er the sea
 'twas here they settled with the plunder reft
 and better weighed the issue of their theft

 xx
 "with amorous pleasures teemed this place of rest
 for ten days to that roving company
 but as oft happens that in youthful breast
 abundance brings with it satiety
 to quit their women with one wish possest
 the band resolved to win their liberty
 for never burden does so sore oppress
 as woman when her love breeds weariness

 xxi
 "they who are covetous of spoil and gain
 and illbested withal in stipend know
 that better means are wanted to maintain
 so many paramours than shaft and bow
 and leaving thus alone the wretched train
 thence with their riches charged the adventurers go
 for puglia's pleasant land there founded near
 the sea tarentum's city as i hear

 xxii
 "the women when they find themselves betrayed
 of lovers by whose faith they set most store
 for many days remain so sore dismayed
 that they seem lifeless statues on the shore
 but seeing lamentations nothing aid
 and fruitless are the many tears they pour
 begin to meditate amid their pains
 what remedy for such an ill remains

 xxiii
 "some laying their opinions now before
 the others deem that to return to crete
 is in their sad estate the wiser lore
 throwing themselves at sire and husband's feet
 than in those wilds and on that desert shore
 to pine of want another troop repeat
 they should esteem it were a worthier notion
 to cast themselves into the neighbouring ocean

 xxiv
 "and lighter ill if they as harlots went
 about the world  beggars or slaves to be
 than offer up themselves for punishment
 well merited by their iniquity
 such and like schemes the unhappy dames present
 each harder than the other finally
 one orontea amid these upstood
 who drew her origin from minos' blood

 xxv
 "youngest and fairest of the crew betrayed
 she was and wariest and who least had erred
 who to phalantus' arms had come a maid
 and left for him her father she in word
 as well as in a kindling face displayed
 how much with generous wrath her heart was stirred
 then reprobating all advised before
 spake and adopted saw her better lore

 xxvi
 "she would not leave the land they were upon
 whose soil was fruitful and whose air was sane
 throughout which many limpid rivers ran
 shaded with woods and for the most part plain
 with creek and port where stranger bark could shun
 foul wind or storm which vexed the neighbouring main
 that might from afric or from egypt bring
 victual or other necessary thing

 xxvii
 "for vengeance she opined they there should stay
 upon man's sex which had so sore offended
 she willed each bark and crew which to that bay
 for shelter from the angry tempest wended
 they should without remorse burn sack and slay
 nor mercy be to any one extended
 such was the lady's motion such the course
 adopted and the statute put in force

 xxviii
 "the women when they see the changing heaven
 turbid with tempest hurry to the strand
 with savage orontea by whom given
 was the fell law the ruler of the land
 and of all barks into their haven driven
 make havoc dread with fire and murderous brand
 leaving no man alive who may diffuse
 upon this side or that the dismal news

 xxix
 " 'twas thus with the male sex at enmity
 some years the lonely women lived forlorn
 then found that hurtful to themselves would be
 the scheme save changed for if from them were born
 none to perpetuate their empery
 the idle law would soon be held in scorn
 and fail together with the fruitful reign
 which they had hoped eternal should remain

 xxx
 "so that some deal its rigour they allay
 and in four years of all who made repair
 thither by chance conducted to this bay
 chose out ten vigorous cavaliers and fair
 that for endurance in the amorous play
 against those hundred dames good champions were
 a hundred they and of the chosen men
 a husband was assigned to every ten

 xxxi
 "ere this too feeble to abide the test
 many a one on scaffold lost his head
 now these ten warriors so approved the best
 were made partakers of their rule and bed
 first swearing at the sovereign ladies' hest
 that they if others to that port are led
 no mercy shall to any one afford
 but one and all will put them to the sword

 xxxii
 "to swell and next to child and thence to fear
 the women turned to teeming wives began
 lest they in time so many males should bear
 as might invade the sovereignty they plan
 and that the government they hold so dear
 might finally from them revert to man
 and so while these are children yet take measure
 they never shall rebel against their pleasure

 xxxiii
 "that the male sex may not usurp the sway
 it is enacted by the statute fell
 each mother should one boy preserve and slay
 the others or abroad exchange or sell
 for this they these to various parts convey
 and to the bearers of the children tell
 to truck the girls for boys in foreign lands
 or not at least return with empty hands

 xxxiv
 "nor by the women one preserved would be
 if they without them could the race maintain
 such all their mercy all the clemency
 the law accords for theirs not others' gain
 the dames all others sentence equally
 and temper but in this their statute's pain
 that not as was their former practice they
 all in their rage promiscuously slay

 xxxv
 "did ten or twenty persons or yet more
 arrive they were imprisoned and put by
 and every day one only from the store
 of victims was brought out by lot to die
 in fane by orontea built before
 an altar raised to vengeance and to ply
 as headsman and dispatched the unhappy men
 one was by lot selected from the ten

 xxxvi
 "to that foul murderous shore by chance did fare
 after long years elapsed a youthful wight
 whose fathers sprung from good alcides were
 and he of proof in arms elbanio hight
 there was he seized of peril scarce aware
 as unsuspecting such a foul despite
 and closely guarded into prison flung
 kept for like cruel use the rest among

 xxxvii
 "adorned with every fair accomplishment
 of pleasing face and manners was the peer
 and of a speech so sweet and eloquent
 him the deaf adder might have stopt to hear
 so that of him to alexandria went
 tidings as of a precious thing and rare
 she was the daughter of that matron bold
 queen orontea that yet lived though old

 xxxviii
 "yet orontea lived while of that shore
 the other settlers all were dead and gone
 and now ten times as many such or more
 had into strength and greater credit grown
 nor for ten forges often closed in store
 have the illfurnished band more files than one
 and the ten champions have as well the care
 to welcome shrewdly all who thither fare

 xxxix
 "young alexandria who the blooming peer
 burned to behold so praised on every part
 the special pleasure him to see and hear
 won from her mother and about to part
 from him discovers that the cavalier
 remains the master of her tortured heart
 finds herself bound and that 'tis vain to stir
  a captive made by her own prisoner

 xl
 " `i pity' said elbanio 'lady fair
 was in this cruel region known as through
 all other countries near or distant where
 the wandering sun sheds light and colouring hue
 i by your beauty's kindly charms should dare
 which make each gentle spirit bound to you
 to beg my life which always at your will
 should i be ready for your love to spill

 xli
 " `but since deprived of all humanity
 are human bosoms in this cruel land
 i shall not now request my life of thee
 for fruitless would i know be the demand
 but whether a good knight or bad i be
 ask but like such to die with arms in hand
 and not as one condemned to penal pain
 or like brute beast in sacrifice be slain'

 xlii
 "the gentle maid her eye bedimmed with tear
 in pity for the hapless youth replied
 `though this land be more cruel and severe
 than any other country far and wide
 each woman is not a medaea here
 as thou wouldst make her and if all beside
 were of such evil kind in me alone
 should an exception to the rest be known

 xliii
 " `and though i like so many here of yore
 was full of evil deeds and cruelty
 i can well say i never had before
 a fitting subject for my clemency
 but fiercer were i than a tiger more
 hard were my heart than diamonds if in me
 all hardness did not vanish and give place
 before your courage gentleness and grace

 xliv
 " `ah were the cruel statute less severe
 against the stranger to these shores conveyed
 so should i not esteem my death too dear
 a ransom for thy worthier life were paid
 but none is here so great sir cavalier
 nor of such puissance as to lend thee aid
 and what thou askest though a scanty grace
 were difficult to compass in this place

 xlv
 " `and yet will i endeavour to obtain
 for thee before thou perish this content
 though much i fear 'twill but augment thy pain
 and thee protracted death but more torment'
 `so i the ten encounter' said again
 elbanio `i at heart am confident
 myself to save and enemies to slay
 though made of iron were the whole array'

 xlvi
 "to this the youthful alexandria nought
 made answer saving with a piteous sigh
 and from the conference a bosom brought
 gored with deep wounds beyond all remedy
 to orontea she repaired and wrought
 on her to will the stripling should not die
 should he display such courage and such skill
 as with his single hand the ten to kill

 xlvii
 "queen orontea straightway bade unite
 her council and bespoke the assembled band
 `it still behoves us place the prowest wight
 whom we can find to guard our ports and strand
 and to discover whom to take or slight
 'tis fitting that we prove the warrior's hand
 lest to our loss the election made be wrong
 and we enthrone the weak and slay the strong

 xlviii
 " `i deem it fit if you the counsel shown
 deem fit as well in future to ordain
 that each upon our coast by fortune thrown
 before he in the temple shall be slain
 shall have the choice instead of this alone
 battle against ten others to maintain
 and if he conquer shall the port defend
 with other comrades pardoned to that end

 xlix
 " `i say this since to strive against our ten
 it seems that one imprisoned here will dare
 who if he stands against so many men
 by heaven deserves that we should hear his prayer
 but if he rashly boasts himself again
 as worthily due the punishment should bear'
 here orontea ceased on the other side
 to her the oldest of the dames replied

 l
 " `the leading cause for which to entertain
 this intercourse with men we first agreed
 was not because we to defend this reign
 of their assistance stood in any need
 for we have skill and courage to maintain
 this of ourselves and force withal to speed
 would that we could in all as well avail
 without their succour nor succession fail

 li
 " `but since this may not be we some have made
 these few partakers of our company
 that ten to one we be not overlaid
 nor they possess them of the sovereignty
 not that we for protection need their aid
 but simply to increase and multiply
 than be their powers to this sole fear addressed
 and be they sluggards idle for the rest

 lii
 " `to keep among us such a puissant wight
 our first design would render wholly vain
 if one can singly slay ten men in fight
 how many women can he not restrain
 if our ten champions had possessed such might
 they the first day would have usurped the reign
 to arm a hand more powerful than your own
 is an ill method to maintain the throne

 liii
 " `reflect withal that if your prisoner speed
 so that he kill ten champions in the fray
 a hundred women's cry whose lords will bleed
 beneath his falchion shall your ears dismay
 let him not 'scape by such a murderous deed
 but if he would propound some other way
  yet if he of those ten supply the place
 and please a hundred women grant him grace'

 liv
 "this was severe artemia's sentiment
 so was she named and had her counsel weighed
 elbanio to the temple had been sent
 to perish by the sacrificial blade
 but orontea willing to content
 her daughter to the matron answer made
 and urged so many reasons and so wrought
 the yielding senate granted what she ought

 lv
 "elbanio's beauty for so fair to view
 never was any cavalier beside
 so strongly works upon the youthful crew
 which in that council sit the state to guide
 that the opinion of the older few
 that like artemia think is set aside
 and little lacks but that the assembled race
 absolve elbanio by especial grace

 lvi
 "to pardon him in fine the dames agreed
 but after slaying his halfscore and when
 he in the next assault as well should speech
 not with a hundred women but with ten
 and furnished to his wish with arms and steed
 next day he was released from dungeonden
 and singly with ten warriors matched in plain
 who by his arm successively were slain

 lvii
 "he to new proof was put the following night
 against ten damsels naked and alone
 when so successful was the stripling's might
 he took the 'say of all the troop and won
 such grace with orontea that the knight
 was by the dame adopted for her son
 and from her alexandria had to wife
 with those whom he had proved in amorous strife

 lviii
 "and him she left with alexandria heir
 to this famed city which from her was hight
 so he and all who his successors were
 should guard the law which willed whatever wight
 conducted hither by his cruel star
 upon this miserable land did light
 should have his choice to perish by the knife
 or singly with ten foes contend to strife

 lix
 "and if he should dispatch the men by day
 at night should prove him with the female crew
 and if so fortunate that in this play
 he proved again the conqueror he as due
 the female band as prince and guide should sway
 and his ten consorts at his choice renew
 and reign with them till other should arrive
 of stouter hand and him of life deprive

 lx
 "they for two thousand years nigh past away
 this usage have maintained and yet maintain
 the impious rite and rarely passes day
 but stranger wight is slaughtered in the fane
 if he elbaniolike ten foes assay
 and such sometimes is found he oft is slain
 in the first charge nor in a thousand one
 the other feat of which i spake has done

 lxi
 "yet some there are have done it though so few
 they may be numbered on the fingers one
 of the victorious cavaliers but who
 reigned with his ten short time was argilon
 for smote by me whom ill wind hither blew
 the knight to his eternal rest is gone
 would i with him that day had filled a grave
 rather than in such scorn survive a slave

 lxii
 "for amorous pleasures laughter game and play
 which evermore delight the youthful breast
 the gem the purple garment rich array
 and in his city place before the rest
 little by heaven the wretched man appay
 who of his liberty is dispossest
 and not to have the power to leave this shore
 to me seems shameful servitude and sore

 lxiii
 "to know i wear away life's glorious spring
 in such effeminate and slothful leisure
 is to my troubled heart a constant sting
 and takes away the taste of every pleasure
 fame bears my kindred's praise on outstretched wing
 even to the skies and haply equal measure
 i of the glories of my blood might share
 if i united with my brethren were

 lxiv
 "methinks my fate does such injurious deed
 by me condemned to servitude so base
 as he who turns to grass the generous steed
 to run amid the herd of meaner race
 because unfit for war or worthier meed
 through blemish or disease of sight or pace
 nor hoping but by death alas to fly
 so vile a service i desire to die"

 lxv
 here guido ceased to address the martial peers
 and cursed withal the day in high disdain
 that he achieved o'er dames and cavaliers
 the double victory which bestowed that reign
 astolpho hides his name and silent hears
 until to him by many a sign is plain
 that this sir guido is as he had said
 the issue of his kinsman aymon's bed

 lxvi
 then cried "the english duke astolpho i
 thy cousin am" and clipt him round the waist
 and in a kindly act of courtesy
 not without weeping kist him and embraced
 then "kinsman dear thy birth to certify
 no better sign thy mother could have placed
 about thy neck enough that sword of thine
 and courage vouch thee of our valiant line"

 lxvii
 guido who gladly would in other place
 so near a kin have welcomed in dismay
 beholds him here and with a mournful face
 knowing if he himself survives the fray
 astolpho will be doomed to slavery base
 his fate deferred but till the following day
 and he shall perish if the duke is free
 so that one's good the other's ill shall be

 lxviii
 he grieves as well the other cavaliers
 should through his means for ever captive be
 nor that he should if slain those martial peers
 deliver by his death from slavery
 since if marphisa from one quicksand clears
 the troop yet these from other fails to free
 she will have won the victory in vain
 for they will be enslaved and she be slain

 lxix
 on the other hand the stripling's age in may
 of youth with courtesy and valour fraught
 upon the maid and comrades with such sway
 touching their breasts with love and pity wrought
 that they of freedom for which he must pay
 the forfeit of his life nigh loathed the thought
 and if marphisa him perforce must kill
 she is resolved as well herself to spill

 lxx
 "join thou with us" she to sir guido cried
 "and we from hence will sally"  "from within
 these walls to sally"  guido on his side
 answered "ne'er hope with me you lose or win"
 " i fear not i" the martial maid replied
 "to execute whatever i begin
 nor know what can securer path afford
 than that which i shall open with my sword

 lxxi
 "such proof of thy fair prowess have i made
 with thee i every enterprise would dare
 tomorrow when about the palisade
 the crowds assembled in the circus are
 let us on every side the mob invade
 whether they fly or for defence prepare
 then give the town to fire and on their bed
 of earth to wolf and vulture leave the dead"

 lxxii
 he "ready shalt thou find me in the strife
 to follow thee or perish at thy side
 but let us hope not to escape with life
 enough is vengeance somedeal satisfied
 ere death for oft ten thousand maid and wife
 i in the place have witnessed and outside
 as many castle wall and port defend
 nor know i certain way from hence to wend"

 lxxiii
 "and were there more marphisa made reply
 than xerxes led our squadrons to oppose
 more than those rebel spirits from the sky
 cast out to dwell amid perpetual woes
 all in one day should by this weapon die
 wert thou with me at least not with my foes"
 to her again "no project but must fail
 sir guido said i know save this avail"

 lxxiv
 "this only us can save should it succeed
 this which but now remembered i shall teach
 to dames alone our laws the right concede
 to sally or set foot upon the beach
 and hence to one of mine in this our need
 must i commit myself and aid beseech
 whose love for me by perfect friendship tied
 has oft by better proof than this been tried

 lxxv
 "no less than me would she desire that i
 should 'scape from slavery so she went with me
 and that without her rival's company
 she of my lot should sole partaker be
 she bark or pinnace in the harbour nigh
 shall bid while yet 'tis dark prepare for sea
 which shall await your sailors rigged and yare
 for sailing when they thither shall repair

 lxxvi
 "behind me in a solid band comprest
 ye merchants mariners and warriors who
 driven to this city have set up your rest
 beneath this roof for which my thanks are due
  you have to force your way with stedfast breast
 if adversaries interrupt our crew
 'tis thus i hope by succour of the sword
 to clear a passage through the cruel horde"

 lxxvii
 "do as thou wilt" marphisa made reply
 "i of escape am confident withal
 and likelier 'twere that by my hand should die
 the martial race encompassed by this wall
 than any one should ever see me fly
 or guess by other sign that fears appall
 i would my passage force in open day
 and shameful in my sight were other way

 lxxviii
 "i wot if i were for a woman known
 honour and place from women i might claim
 here gladly entertained and classed as one
 haply among their chiefs of highest fame
 but privilege or favour will i none
 unshared by those with whom i hither came
 too base it were did i depart or free
 remain to leave the rest in slavery"

 lxxix
 these speeches by marphisa made and more
 showed that what only had restrained her arm
 was the respect she to the safety bore
 of the companions whom her wrath might harm
 by this alone withheld form taking sore
 and signal vengeance on the female swarm
 and hence she left in guido's care to shape
 what seemed the fittest means for their escape

 lxxx
 sir guido speaks that night with alery
 so the most faithful of his wives was hight
 nor needs long prayer to make the dame agree
 disposed already to obey the knight
 she takes a ship and arms the bark for sea
 stowed with her richest chattels for their flight
 feigning design as soon as dawn ensues
 to sail with her companions on a cruise

 lxxxi
 she into guido's palace had before
 bid sword and spear and shield and cuirass bear
 with the intent to furnish from this store
 merchants and sailors that half naked were
 some watch and some repose upon the floor
 and rest and guard among each other share
 oft marking still with harness on their backs
 if ruddy yet with light the orient wax

 lxxxii
 not yet from earth's hard visage has the sun
 lifted her veil of dim and dingy dye
 scarcely lycaon's child her furrow done
 has turned about her ploughshare in the sky
 when to the theatre the women run
 who would the fearful battle's end espy
 as swarming bees upon their threshold cluster
 who bent on change of realm in springtide muster

 lxxxiii
 with warlike trumpet drum and sound of horn
 the people make the land and welkin roar
 summoning thus their chieftain to return
 and end of unfinished warfare covered o'er
 with arms stand aquilant and gryphon stern
 and the redoubted duke from england's shore
 marphisa dudo sansonet and all
 the knights or footmen harboured in that hall

 lxxxiv
 hence to descend towards the sea or port
 the way across the place of combat lies
 nor was there other passage long or short
 sir guido so to his companions cries
 and having ceased his comrades to exhort
 to do their best set forth in silent wise
 and in the place appeared amid the throng
 head of a squad above a hundred strong

 lxxxv
 toward the other gate sir guido went
 hurrying his band but gathered far and nigh
 the mighty multitude for aye intent
 to smite and clad in arms when they descry
 the comrades whom he leads perceive his bent
 and truly deem he is about to fly
 all in a thought betake them to their bows
 and at the portal part the knight oppose

 lxxxvi
 sir guido and the cavaliers who go
 beneath that champion's guidance and before
 the others bold marphisa were not slow
 to strike and laboured hard to force the door
 but such a storm of darts from ready bow
 dealing on all sides death or wounding sore
 was rained in fury on the troop forlorn
 they feared at last to encounter skaith and scorn

 lxxxvii
 of proof the corslet was each warrior wore
 who without this would have had worse to fear
 sansonnet's horse was slain and that which bore
 marphisa to himself the english peer
 exclaimed "why wait i longer as if more
 my horn could ever succour me than here
 since the sword steads not i will make assay
 if with my bugle i can clear the way"

 lxxxviii
 as he was customed in extremity
 he to his mouth applied the bugle's round
 the wide world seemed to tremble earth and sky
 as he in air discharged the horrid sound
 such terror smote the dames that bent to fly
 when in their ears the deafening horn was wound
 not only they the gate unguarded left
 but from the circus reeled of wit bereft

 lxxxix
 as family awaked in sudden wise
 leaps from the windows and from lofty height
 periling life and limb when in surprise
 they see now near the fire's encircling light
 which had while slumber sealed their heavy eyes
 by little and by little waxed at night
 reckless of life thus each impelled by dread
 at sound of that appalling bugle fled

 xc
 above below and here and there the rout
 rise in confusion and attempt to fly
 at once above a thousand swarm about
 each entrance to each other's lett and lie
 in heaps from window these or stage without
 leap headlong in the press these smothered die
 broken is many an arm and many a head
 and one lies crippled and another dead

 xci
 amid the mighty ruin which ensued
 cries pierce the very heavens on every part
 where'er the sound is heard the multitude
 in panic at the deafening echo start
 when you are told that without hardihood
 appear the rabble and of feeble heart
 this need not more your marvel for by nature
 the hare is evermore a timid creature

 xcii
 but of marphisa what will be your thought
 and guido late so furious  of the two
 young sons of olivier that lately wrought
 such deeds in honour of their lineage who
 lately a hundred thousand held as nought
 and now deprived of courage basely flew
 as ringdoves flutter and as coneys fly
 who hear some mighty noise resounding nigh

 xciii
 for so to friend as stranger noxious are
 the powers that in the enchanted horn reside
 sansonet guido follow with the pair
 or brethren bold marphisa terrified
 nor flying can they to such distance fare
 but that their ears are dinned on every side
 astolpho on his foaming courser borne
 lends louder breath to his enchanted horn

 xciv
 one sought the sea and one the mountaintop
 one fled the hide herself in forest hoar
 and this who turned not once nor made a stop
 not for ten days her headlong flight forbore
 these from the bridge in that dread moment drop
 never to climb the river's margin more
 so temple house and square and street were drained
 that nigh unpeopled the wide town remained

 xcv
 marphisa guido and the brethren two
 with sansonetto pale and trembling hie
 towards the sea and behind these the crew
 of frighted mariners and merchants fly
 and 'twixt the forts in bark prepared with view
 to their escape discover alery
 who in sore haste receives the warriors pale
 and bids them ply their oars and make all sail

 xcvi
 the duke within and out the town had bear
 from the surrounding hills to the seaside
 and of its people emptied every street
 all fly before the deafening sound and hide
 many in panic seeking a retreat
 lurk in some place obscure and filthy stied
 many not knowing whither to repair
 plunge in the neighbouring sea and perish there

 xcvii
 the duke arrives seeking the friendly band
 whom he had hoped to find upon the quay
 he turns and gazes round the desert strand
 and none is there  directs along the bay
 his eyes and now far distant from the land
 beholds the parting frigate under way
 so that the paladin for his escape 
 the vessel gone  must other project shape

 xcviii
 let him depart nor let it trouble you
 that he so long a road must beat alone
 where never without fear man journeys through
 wild paynim countries danger is there none
 but what he with his bugle may eschew
 whose dread effect the english duke has shown
 and let his late companions be our care
 who trembling to the beach had made repair

 xcix
 they from that cruel and ensanguined ground
 to seaward under all their canvas bore
 and having gained such offing that the sound
 of that alarming horn was heard no more
 unwonted shame inflicted such a wound
 that all a face of burning crimson wore
 one dares not eye the other and they stand
 with downcast looks a mute and mournful band

 c
 fixed on his course the pilot passes by
 cyprus and rhodes and ploughs the aegean sea
 beholds a hundred islands from him fly
 and malea's fearful headland fanned by free
 and constant wind sees vanish from the eye
 the greek morea rounding sicily
 into the tuscan sea his frigate veers
 and coasting italy's fair region steers

 ci
 last rises luna where his family
 is waiting his return the patron hoar
 gives thanks to god at having passed the sea
 without more harm and makes the wellknown shore
 here offering passage to their company
 they find a master ready to unmoor
 for france and that same day his pinnace climb
 thence wafted to marseilles in little time

 cii
 there was not bradamant who used to sway
 the land and had that city in her care
 and who if present there to make some stay
 would have compelled them by her courteous prayer
 they disembarked and that same hour away
 did bold marphisa at a venture fare
 bidding adieu to salvage guido's wife
 and to the four her comrades in the strife

 ciii
 saying she deems unfitting for a knight
 to fare in like great fellowship that so
 the starlings and the doves in flock unite
 and every beast who fears  the stag and doe
 but hawk and eagle that in other's might
 put not their trust for ever singly go
 and lion bear and tyger roam alone
 who fear no prowess greater than their own

 civ
 but none with her opine and in the lack
 of a companion singly must she fare
 so then alone and friendless she a track
 uncouth pursues and through a wooded lair
 gryphon the white and aquilant the black
 take road more beaten with the other pair
 and on the following day a castle see
 within which they are harboured courteously

 cv
 courteously i in outward show would say
 for soon the contrary was made appear
 since he the castellain who with display
 of kindness sheltered them and courteous cheer
 the night ensuing took them as they lay
 couched in their beds secure and void of fear
 nor from the snare would he his prisoners loose
 till they had sworn to observe an evil use

 cvi
 but i will first pursue the martial maid
 ere more of these fair sir i shall proclaim
 beyond the durence rhone and saone she strayed
 and to the foot of sunny mountain came
 and there approaching in black gown arrayed
 beside a torrent saw an ancient dame
 who with long journey weak and wearied sore
 appeared but pined by melancholy more

 cvii
 this was the beldam who had wont to ply
 serving the robbers in the caverned mount
 whither stern justice sent that they might die
 by that good paladin anglante's count
 the aged harridan for cause which i
 to you shall in another place recount
 now many days by path obscure had flown
 still fearing lest her visage should be known

 cviii
 the semblance now of foreign cavalier
 she in marphisa saw in arms and vest
 and hence she flies not her though wont to fear
 as being natives of that land the rest
  nay with security and open cheer
 stops at the ford the damsel to arrest
 stops at the ford  where that old beldam meets
 marphisa and with fair encounter greets

 cix
 and next implored the maid she of her grace
 would bear her on the croupe to the other shore
 marphisa who was come of gentle race
 the hag with her across the torrent bore
 and is content to bear till she can place
 in a securer road the beldam hoar
 clear of a spacious marish as its end
 they see a cavalier towards them wend

 cx
 in shining armour and in fair array
 the warrior rode on saddle richly wrought
 towards the river and upon his way
 with him a single squire and damsel brought
 of passing beauty was the lady gay
 but little pleasing was her semblance haught
 all overblown with insolence and pride
 worthy the cavalier who was her guide

 cxi
 he of maganza was a count who bore
 the lady with him pinabello hight
 the same who bradamant some months before
 had plunged into a hollow cave in spite
 those many sobs those burning sighs and sore
 those tears which had nigh quenched the warrior's sight 
 all for the damsel were now at his side
 and then by that false necromancer stied

 cxii
 but when the magic tower upon the hill
 was razed the dwelling of atlantes hoar
 and every one was free to rove at will
 through bradamant's good deed and virtuous lore
 the damsel who had been compliant still
 with the desires of pinabel before
 rejoined him and now journeying in a round
 with him from castle was to castle bound

 cxiii
 as wanton and illcustomed when she spies
 marphisa's aged charge approaching near
 she cannot rein her saucy tongue but plies
 here in her petulance with laugh and jeer
 marphisa haught unwont in any wise
 outrage from whatsoever part to hear
 makes answer to the dame in angry tone
 that handsomer than her she deems the crone

 cxiv
 and that she this would prove upon her knight
 with pact that she might strip the bonnibell
 of gown and palfrey if o'erthrown in fight
 her champion from his goodly courser fell
  in silence to have overpast the slight
 would have been sin and shame in pinabel
 who for short answer seized his shield and spear
 and wheeled and drove at her in fierce career

 cxv
 marphisa grasped a mighty lance and thrust
 encountering him at pinabello's eyes
 and stretched him so astounded in the dust
 that motionless an hour the warrior lies
 marphisa now victorious in the just
 gave orders to strip off the glorious guise
 and ornaments wherewith the maid was drest
 and with the spoils her ancient crone invest

 cxvi
 and willed that she should don the youthful weed
 bedizened at the haughty damsel's cost
 and took away as well the goodly steed
 which her had thither borne and  bent to post
 on her old track  with her the hag will speed
 who seems most hideous when adorned the most
 three days the tedious road the couple beat
 without adventure needful to repeat

 cxvii
 on the fourth day they met a cavalier
 who came in fury galloping alone
 if you the stranger's name desire to hear
 i tell you 'twas zerbino a king's son
 of beauty and of worth example rare
 now grieved and angered as unvenged of one
 who a great act of courtesy which fain
 the warrior would have done had rendered vain

 cxviii
 vainly the young zerbino through the glade
 had chased that man of his who this despite
 had done him who himself so well conveyed
 away and took such 'vantage in his flight
 so hid by wood and mist which overlaid
 the horizon and bedimmed the morninglight
 that he escaped zerbino's grasp and lay
 concealed until his wrath was past away

 cxix
 zerbino laughed parforce when he descried
 that beldam's face though he was full of rage
 for too illsorted seemed her vest of pride
 with her foul visage more deformed by age
 and to the proud marphisa at her side
 the prince exclaimed "sir warrior you are sage
 in having chosen damsel of a sort
 whom none i ween will grudge you should escort"

 cxx
 older than sibyl seemed the beldam hoar
 as far as from her wrinkles one might guess
 and in the youthful ornaments she wore
 looked like an ape which men in mockery dress
 and now appears more foul as angered sore
 while rage and wrath her kindled eyes express
 for none can do a woman worse despite
 than to proclaim her old and foul to sight

 cxxi
 to have sport of him  as she had  an air
 of wrath the maid assumed upon her part
 and to the prince "by heaven more passing fair
 is this my lady than thou courteous art"
 exclaimed in answer "though i am aware
 what thou hast uttered comes not from thy heart
 thou wilt not own her beauty a device
 put on to masque thy sovereign cowardice

 cxxii
 "and of what stamp would be that cavalier
 who found such fair and youthful dame alone
 without protection in the forest drear
 nor sought to make the lovely weft his own"
  "so well she sorts with thee" replied the peer
 " `twere ill that she were claimed by any one
 nor i of her would thee in any wise
 deprive god rest thee merry with thy prize

 cxxiii
 "but would thou prove what is my chivalry
 on other ground i to thy wish incline
 yet deem me not of such perversity
 as to tilt with thee for this prize of thine
 or fair or foul let her remain thy fee
 i would not i such amity disjoin
 well are ye paired and safely would i swear
 that thou as valiant art as she is fair"

 cxxiv
 to him marphisa "thou in thy despite
 shalt try to bear from me the dame away
 i will not suffer that so fair a sight
 thou shouldst behold nor seek to gain the prey"
 to her the prince "i know not wherefore wight
 should suffer pain and peril in affray
 striving for victory where for his pains
 the victor losses and the vanquished gains"

 cxxv
 "if this condition please not other course
 which ill thou canst refuse i offer thee"
 marphisa cried "if thou shalt me unhorse
 in this our tourney she remains with me
 but if i win i give her thee parforce
 then prove we now who shall without her be
 premised if loser thou shalt be her guide
 wherever it may please the dame to ride"

 cxxvi
 "and be it so" zerbino cried and wheeled
 swiftly his foaming courser for the shock
 and rising in his stirrups scowered the field
 firm in his seat and smote with levelled stock
 for surer aim the damsel in midshield
 but she sate stedfast as a metal rock
 and at the warrior's morion thrust so well
 she clean outbore him senseless from the sell

 cxxvii
 much grieved the prince to whom in other fray
 the like misfortune had not chanced before
 who had unhorsed some thousands in his day
 now shamed he thought for ever troubled sore
 and mute long space upon the ground he lay
 and when 'twas recollected grieved the more
 that he had promised and that he was bound
 to accompany the hag where'er she wound

 cxxviii
 turning about to him the victoress cried
 laughing "this lady i to thee present
 and the more beauty is in her descried
 the more that she is thine i am content
 now in my place her champion and her guide
 but do not thou thy plighted faith repent
 so that thou fail as promised to attend
 the dame wherever she may please to wend"

 cxxix
 without awaiting answer to career
 she spurred her horse and vanished in the wood
 zerbino deeming her a cavalier
 cried to the crone "by whom am i subdued"
 and knowing 'twould be poison to his ear
 and that it would inflame his angered blood
 she in reply "it was a damsel's blow
 which from thy lofty saddle laid thee low

 cxxx
 "she for her matchless force deservedly
 usurps from cavalier the sword and lance
 and even from the east is come to try
 her strength against the paladins of france"
 not only was his cheek of crimson dye
 such shame zerbino felt as his mischance
 little was wanting so his blushes spread
 but all the arms he wore had glowed as red

 cxxxi
 he mounts and blames himself in angry wise
 in that he had no better kept his seat
 within herself the beldam laughs and tries
 the scottish warrior more to sting and heat
 to him for promised convoy she applies
 and he who knows that there is no retreat
 stands like tired courser who in pensive fit
 hangs down his ears controlled by spur and bit

 cxxxii
 and sighing deeply cries in his despair
 "fell fortune with what change dost thou repay
 my loss she who was fairest of the fair
 who should be mine by thee is snatched away
 and thinkest thou the evil to repair
 with her whom thou hast given to me this day
 rather than make like ill exchange less cross
 it were to undergo a total loss

 cxxxiii
 "her who for virtue and for beauteous form
 was never equalled nor will ever be
 thou on the rocks hast wrecked in wintry storm
 as food for fowls and fishes of the sea
 and her who should have fed the earthbred worm
 preserved beyond her date some ten or score
 of years to harass and torment me more"

 cxxxiv
 so spake zerbino and like grief displaid
 in his despairing words and woful mien
 for such an odious acquisition made
 as he had suffered when he lost his queen
 the aged woman now from what he said
 though she before zerbino had not seen
 perceived 'twas him of whom in the thieves' hold
 isabel of gallicia erst had told

 cxxxv
 if you remember what was said before
 this was the hag who 'scaped out of the cave
 where isabella who had wounded sore
 zerbino's heart was long detained a slave
 who oft had told how she her native shore
 had left and launching upon ocean's wave
 her frigate had been wrecked by wind and swell
 upon the rocky shallows near rochelle

 cxxxvi
 and she to her zerbino's goodly cheer
 and gentle features had pourtrayed so well
 that the hag hearing him and now more near
 letter her eyes upon his visage dwell
 discerned it was the youth for whom whilere
 had grieved at heart the prisoned isabel
 whose loss she in the cavern more deplored
 than being captive to the murderous horde

 cxxxvii
 the beldam hearing what in rage and grief
 zerbino vents perceives the youth to be
 deceived and cheated by the false belief
 that isabel had perished in the sea
 and though she might have given the prince relief
 knowing the truth in her perversity
 what would have made him joyful she concealed
 and only what would cause him grief revealed

 cxxxviii
 "hear you that are so proud" the hag pursues
 "and flout me with such insolence and scorn
 you would entreat me fair to have the news
 i know of her whose timeless death you mourn
 but to be strangled would i rather choose
 and be into a thousand pieces torn
 whereas if you had made me kinder cheer
 haply from me the secret might you hear"

 cxxxix
 as the dog's rage is quickly overblown
 who flies the approaching robber to arrest
 if the thief proffer piece of bread or bone
 of offer other lure which likes him best
 as readily zerbino to the crone
 humbled himself and burned to know the rest
 who in the hints of the old woman read
 that she had news of her he mourned as dead

 cxl
 and with more winning mien to her applied
 and her did supplicate entreat conjure
 by men and gods the truth no more to hide
 did she benign or evil lot endure
 the hard and pertinacious crone replied
 "nought shalt thou hear thy comfort to assure
 isabel has not yielded up her breath
 but lives a life she would exchange for death

 cxli
 "she since thou heardest of her destiny
 within few days has fallen into the power
 of more than twenty if restored to thee
 think now if thou hast hope to crop her flower"
  "curst hag how well thou shapest thy history
 yet knowest it is false her virgin dower
 secure from brutal wrong would none invade
 though in the power of twenty were the maid"

 cxlii
 questioning of the maid he when and where
 she saw her vainly asked the beldam hoar
 who ever restive to zerbino's prayer
 to what she had rehearsed would add no more
 the prince in the beginning spoke her fair
 and next to cut her throat in fury swore
 but prayers and menaces alike were weak
 nor could he make the hideous beldam speak

 cxliii
 at length zerbino to his tongue gave rest
 since speaking to the woman booted nought
 scarcely his heart found room within his breast
 such dread suspicion had her story wrought
 he to find isabella was so pressed
 her in the midst of fire he would have sought
 but could not hurry more than was allowed
 by her his convoy since he so had vowed

 cxliv
 they hence by strange and solitary way
 rove as the beldam does her will betoken
 nor climbing nor descending hill survey
 each other's face nor any word is spoken
 but when the sun upon the middle day
 had turned his back their silence first was broken
 by cavalier encountered in their way
 what followed the ensuing strain will say


 canto 21

 argument
 zerbino for gabrina who a heart
 of asp appears to bear contends o'erthrown
 the fleming falls upon the other part
 through cause of that despised and odious crone
 he wounded sore and writhing with the smart
 the beldam's treason to the prince makes known
 whose scorn and hatred hence derive new force
 towards loud cries zerbino spurs his horse


 i
 no cord i well believe is wound so tight
 round chest nor nails the plank so fastly hold
 as faith enwraps an honourable sprite
 in its secure inextricable fold
 nor holy faith it seems except in white
 was mantled over in the days of old
 so by the ancient limner ever painted
 as by one speck one single blemish tainted

 ii
 faith should be kept unbroken evermore
 with one or with a thousand men united
 as well if given in grot or forest hoar
 remote from town and hamlet as if plighted
 amid a crowd of witnesses before
 tribunal and in act and deed recited
 nor needs the solemn sanction of an oath
 it is sufficient that we pledge our troth

 iii
 and this maintains as it maintained should be
 in each emprize the scottish cavalier
 and gives good proof of his fidelity
 quitting his road with that old crone to steer
 although this breeds the youth such misery
 as 'twould to have disease itself as near
 or even death but with him heavier weighed
 that his desire the promise he had made

 iv
 of him i told who felt at heart such load
 reflecting she beneath his charge must go
 he spake no word and thus in silent mode
 both fared so sullen was zerbino's woe
 i said how vexed their silence as they rode
 was broke when sol his hindmost wheels did show
 by an adventurous errant cavalier
 who in mid pathway met the crone and peer

 v
 the hag who the approaching warrior knew
 hermonides of holland he was hight
 that bore upon a field of sable hue
 a bar of vermeil tint transversely dight
 did humbly now to good zerbino sue
  her pride abased and look of haught despite 
 and him reminded of the promise made
 when her marphisa to his care conveyed

 vi
 because as foe to her and hers she knew
 the knight they were encountering who had slain
 her only brother and her father true
 and was advised the traitor would be fain
 by her the remnant of her race to do
 what he had perpetrated on the twain
 "woman while guarded by my arm he said
 i will not thou shouldst any danger dread"

 vii
 as nearer now the stranger knight espied
 that face which was so hateful in his sight
 with menacing and savage voice he cried
 "either with me prepare thyself to fight
 or arm thee not on that old woman's side
 who by my hand shall perish as is right
 if thou contendest for her thou art slain
 for such their portion is who wrong maintain"

 viii
 him young zerbino answered courteously
 twas sign of evil and ungenerous will
 and corresponded not with chivalry
 that he a woman should desire to kill
 yet if the knight persists he will not flee 
 but bids him well consider first how ill
 'twould sound that he a gentle knight and good
 should wish to dip his hand in woman's blood

 ix
 this and yet more he vainly says nor stand
 they idle long from word they pass to deed
 and having compassed on the level land
 enough of ground encounter on the mead
 not fired in some rejoicing from the hand
 discharged so fast the whistling rockets speed
 as the two coursers bear the cavaliers
 to hurtle in mid space with rested spears

 x
 hermonides of holland levelled low
 and for the youth's left flank the stroke intended
 but his weak lance was shivered by the blow
 and little the opposing scot offended
 but vain was not the spearthrust of his foe
 who bored his opposite's good shield and rended
 his shoulder by the lance pierced through and through
 and good hermonides on earth o'erthrew

 xi
 thinking him slain who only lay amazed
 by pity prest zerbino leapt to ground
 and from his deathlike face the vizor raised
 and he as wakened out of sleep profound
 in silence hard upon zerbino gazed
 then cried "it does not me in truth confound
 to think that i am overthrown by thee
 who seem'st the flower of errant chivalry

 xii
 "but it with reason grieves me this is done
 upon account of a false woman's spite
 whose wicked cause i know not why you own
 an office ill according with your might
 and when to you the occasion shall be known
 which urges me her wickedness to quite
 whene'er you think on it you will repent
 how she by you was saved and i was shent

 xiii
 "and if enough of breath although i fear
 the contrary is left me to expound
 her evil actions i shall make appear
 she in all guilt transgresses every bound
 i had a brother once the youthful peer
 set out from holland's isle our natal ground
 to serve heraclius 'mid his knights arrayed
 who then the grecian empire's sceptre swayed

 xiv
 "brother in arms and bosomfriend installed
 here was he by a baron of that court
 who in a pleasant site and strongly walled
 on servia's distant frontier had a fort
 argaeus he of whom i tell was called
 husband of that ill hag whom in such sort
 he loved as passed all mean and misbecame
 one of his worth and honourable fame

 xv
 "but she more volatile than leaf when breeze
 of autumn most its natural moisture dries
 and strips the fluttering foliage from the trees
 which blown about before its fury flies
 changes her humour and her husband sees
 whom she some time had loved with other eyes
 and in her every wish and every thought
 schemes how my brother's love may best be bought

 xvi
 "but not acroceraunus fronts the brine
  illfamed  against whose base the billow heaves
 nor against boreas stands the mountain pine
 that has a hundred times renewed its leaves
 and towering high on alp or apennine
 with its fast root the rock as deeply cleaves
 so firmly as the youth resists the will
 of that foul woman sink of every ill

 xvii
 "now as it oft befalls a cavalier
 who seeks and finds adventure high and low
 it happened that my gentle brother near
 his comrade's fort was wounded by a foe
 where often uninvited by the peer
 he guested was his host with him or no
 and thither he resorted from the field
 there to repose until his wounds were healed

 xviii
 "while there he wounded lay upon some need
 it chanced argaeus was compelled to ride
 quickly that wanton from his presence freed
 as was her use my brother's fealty tried
 but he as one unstained in thought and deed
 so fell a goad no longer would abide
 and to preserve his faith as lures increased
 of many evils chose what seemed the least

 xix
 "to break communion with the cavalier
 to him  of many  seemed the lightest ill
 and go so far that wanton should not hear
 more of his name this purpose to fulfil
 was honester though quitting one so dear
 was hard than to content her evil will
 of her foul wishes to her lord impart
 who cherished her as fondly as his heart

 xx
 "and though yet smarting with his wounds and pined
 he dons his arms and from the tower departs
 and wanders thence with firm and constant mind
 ne'er to return again into those parts
 but nought availed the purpose he designed
 his projects fortune baffled with new arts
 this while behold the castellain returned
 and bathed in bitter tears the wife discerned

 xxi
 "and with flushed face and hair in disarray
 he asks of her what had disturbed her mood
 who ere she in reply a word will say
 is vainly more than once to answer wooed
 and all the while is thinking in what way
 the knight can best with vengeance be pursued
 and well it suited with her fickle vein
 lightly to change her love into disdain

 xxii
 " `ah why should i conceal in fine she cried
 the fault committed while you were away
 for though i it from all the world should hide
 this would my conscience to myself bewray
 the soul which is with secret evil dyed
 does with such penitence its fault appay
 as every corporal sufferance exceeds
 that thou couldst deal me for my evil deeds

 xxiii
 " `if evil be the deed when done parforce
 but be it what it may the mischief know
 then with my sword from this polluted corse
 delivered let my spotless spirit go
 and quench these wretched eyes which in remorse
 i if i lived on earth must ever throw
 as the least penance of so foul a blame
 and look on whom they may must blush for shame

 xxiv
 " `my honour has been ruined by thy mate
 who to this body violence has done
 and fearing lest i all to thee relate
 without farewell the graceless churl is gone'
 she by this story made her husband hate
 the youth than whom before was dearer none
 argaeus credits all without delay
 arms him and breathing vengeance posts away

 xxv
 "in knowledge of that country not to seek
 he overtook the knight in little space
 for my poor brother yet diseased and weak
 rode unsuspicious at an easy pace
 argaeus eager his revenge to wreak
 assailed him straight in a sequestered place
 my brother would excuse him if he might
 but his indignant host insists on fight

 xxvi
 "this one was sound and full of new disdain
 that weak and friendly as aye wont to be
 my brother was ill fitted to sustain
 his altered comrade's newborn enmity
 philander then unmeriting such pain
 so was the stripling named described by me
 not gifted with the power to undergo
 such fierce assault was taken by the foe

 xxvii
 " `forbid it heaven i should be led astray
 so by just wrath and thy iniquity
 to him argaeus cried as thee to slay
 who loved thee once and certes thou lovedst me
 though in the end thou ill didst this display
 i yet desire this ample world may see
 that measured by my deeds i rank above
 thyself in hate as highly as in love

 xxviii
 " `in other mode shall i chastise the deed
 than spilling more of thine ill blood' the peer
 this said commands his followers on a steed
 of verdant boughs composed to place a bier
 and with the knight halflifeless homeward speed
 and in a tower enclose the cavalier
 there dooms the guiltless stripling to remain
 and suffer prisonment's perpetual pain

 xxix
 "yet nothing but his former liberty
 thence to depart was wanting to the knight
 in all the rest as one at large and free
 he ordered and was still obeyed aright
 but that ill dame her former phantasy
 pursuing ever with unwearied sprite
 having the keys repaired nigh every day
 to the close turret where the prisoner lay

 xxx
 "and evermore my brother she assailed
 and with more boldness prest her former suit
 `mark what to thee fidelity availed'
 she cries `which all mere perfidy repute
 with what triumphant joy shalt thou be hailed
 what noble spoils are thine what happy fruit
 oh what a worthy guerdon is thy meed
 branded by all men for a traitor's deed

 xxxi
 " `how well thou mightst have given and without stain
 of thine own honour what i sought of thee
 now of so rigorous mood the worthy gain
 have and enjoy in close captivity
 thou art nor ever hope to break thy chain
 unless thou soften thy obduracy
 but if compliant i a mean can frame
 to render thee thy liberty and fame'

 xxxii
 " `no no have thou no hope' replied the knight
 `that my true faith shall ever change although
 it thus should happen that against all right
 i should so hard a sentence undergo
 let the world blame enough that in his sight
  who sees and judges every thing below
 and in his grace divine my fame can clear 
 my innocence unsullied shall appear

 xxxiii
 " `does not argaeus deem enough to sty
 me in his prison let him take away
 this noisome life nor yet may heaven deny
 its meed though ill the world my work appay
 and yet he who condemns me may when i
 am parted from this tenement of clay
 perceive that he has wronged me in the end
 and shall bewail when dead his faithful friend'

 xxxiv
 "thus oftentimes that shameless woman prest
 the good philander but obtained no fruit
 nursing her blind desires which knew not rest
 in seeking what her wicked love may boot
 she her old vices in her inmost breast
 ransacks for what may best the occasion suit
 and sifts them all then having overrun
 a thousand evil thoughts resolved on one

 xxxv
 "six months she waited ere again she sought
 the prisoner's tower as she was wont before
 from which the sad philander hoped and thought
 that love to him the dame no longer bore
 lo fortune for her an occasion wrought
 to evil deed propitious evermore
 to give effect with memorable ill
 to her irrational and evil will

 xxxvi
 "the husband had an ancient feud with one
 who was by name morando hight the fair
 who even within the fort would often run
 in its lord's absence but the knight's repair
 at the wide distance of ten miles would shun
 was he assured the castellain was there
 who now to lure him thither bruited how
 he for jerusalem was bound by vow

 xxxvii
 "said he would go and went thus each who spies
 his outset of his journey spreads the fame
 nor he who only on his wife relies
 trusts any with his purpose but the dame
 and home returned when dusky waxed the skies
 nor ever save at evening thither came
 and with changed ensigns at the dawn of day
 unseen of any always went his way

 xxxviii
 "he now on this side now on the other side
 roved round his castle but to ascertain
 if credulous morando who to ride
 thither was wonted would return again
 all day he in the forest used to hide
 and when he saw the sun beneath the main
 came to the tower and through a secret gate
 was there admitted by his faithless mate

 xxxix
 "thus every one except his consort ill
 argaeus many miles away suppose
 she when 'tis time her errand to fulfil
 hatching new mischief to my brother goes
 of tears she has a ready shower at will
 which from her eyes into her bosom flows
 `  where shall i succour find now needed most
 so that my honour be not wholly lost

 xl
 " `and with my own my wedded lord's' she cries
 `i should feel no alarm if he were here
 thou knowst morando know if deities
 or men he in argaeus' absence fear
 he at this time tries all extremities
 nor servant have i but by threat or prayer
 he him to further his desire has swayed
 nor know i whither to recur for aid

 xli
 " `of my lord's absence hearing the report
 and that he would not quickly homeward fare
 he had the insolence within my court
 upon no other pretext to repair
 who were my absent lord within his fort
 so bold a deer not only would not dare
 but would not deem himself secure withal
 by heaven at three miles' distance from his wall

 xlii
 " `and what he erst by messenger had sought
 from me today has sued for face to face
 and in such manner that long time i thought
 dishonour must have followed and disgrace
 and if i had not humbly him besought
 and feigned to yield to him with ready grace
 he haply would have ravished that by force
 which he expects to win by milder course

 xliii
 " `i promise not designing to comply
 for void is contract made in fear alone
 from his ill purpose would i put him by
 and what he then parforce would else have done
 so stands the case the single remedy
 lies in yourself my honour else is gone
 and that of my argaeus which as dear
 or more so than your own you vowed whilere

 xliv
 " `if you refuse me i shall say you show
 that you have not the faith which you pretended
 but that in cruelty you said me no
 when vainly were my tears on you expended
 and no wise for argaeus' sake although
 with this pretext you have yourself defended
 our loves bad been concealed and free from blame
 but here i stand exposed to certain shame'

 xlv
 " `to me such preface needs not said anew
 the good philander bound by amity
 to my argaeus still thy pleasure shew
 i what i ever was will be and i
 although from him i bear such ill undue
 accuse him not for him would i defy
 even death itself and let the world allied
 with my ill destiny against me side'

 xlvi
 "the impious woman answered ` 'tis my will
 thou slay him who would do us foul despite
 nor apprehend to encounter any ill
 for i the certain mean will tell aright
 he will return his purpose to fulfil
 at the third hour when darkest is the night
 and at a preconcerted signal made
 be without noise by me within conveyed

 xlvii
 " `let it not irk thee to await the peer
 within my chamber where no light will be
 till i shall make him doff his warlike gear
 and almost naked yield him up to thee'
 so did his wife into that quicksand steer
 her hapless husband it appears to me
 if wife she rightly could be called more fell
 and cruel than a fury sprung from hell

 xlviii
 "she drew my brother forth that guilty night
 with his good arms in hand and him again
 secreted in the chamber without light
 till thither came the wretched castellain
 as it was ordered all fell out aright
 for seldom ill design is schemed in vain
 so fell argaeus by philander's sword
 who for morando took the castle's lord

 xlix
 "one blow divided head and neck for nought
 was there of helm the warrior to defend
 without a struggle was argaeus brought
 to his unhappy life's disastrous end
 and he who slew him never had such thought
 nor this would have believed to aid his friend
 intent strange chance he wrought him in that blow
 the worst that could be done by mortal foe

 l
 "when now unknown on earth argaeus lay
 my brother to gabrina gave the blade
 so was she named who lived but to betray
 she who discovery had till then delayed
 wills that philander with a light survey
 the man whom he on earth has lifeless laid
 and she with the assistance of the light
 shows him argaeus in the murdered wight

 li
 "and threatens save he with desires comply
 to which her bosom had been long a prey
 what he would be unable to deny
 she to the assembled household will display
 and he like traitor and assassin die
 upon her tale in ignominious way
 and minds him fame is not to be despised
 albeit so little life by him be prized

 lii
 "philander stood oppressed with grief and fear
 when his mistake to him the woman showed
 and to have slain her in his wrath went near
 and long be doubted so his choler glowed
 and but that reason whispered in his ear
 that he was in an enemy's abode
 for lack of faulchion in his empty sheath
 he would have torn her piecemeal with his teeth

 liii
 "as sometimes vessel by two winds which blow
 from different points is vext upon the main
 and now one speeds the bark anend and now
 another squall impels her back again
 still on her poop assailed or on her prow
 till she before the strongest flies amain
 philander so distraught by two designs
 takes what he pregnant with least ill opines

 liv
 "reason demonstrates with what peril fraught
 his case not more with death than lasting stain
 if in the castle were that murder taught
 nor any time has he to sift his brain
 will he or nill he in conclusion nought
 is left him but the bitter cup to drain
 thus in his troubled heart prevailing more
 his fear his resolution overbore

 lv
 "the fear of shameful punishment's pursuit
 made him with many protestations swear
 to grant in every thing gabrina's suit
 if from the fortilage they safely fare
 so plucks that impious dame parforce the fruit
 of her desires and thence retreat the pair
 thus home again the young philander came
 leaving behind him a polluted name

 lvi
 "and deeply graven in his bosom bore
 the image of his friend so rashly slain
 by this to purchase to his torment sore
 a progne a medea impious gain
  and but his knightly faith and oaths he swore
 were to his fury as a curbing rein
 from him when safe she would have met her fate
 but lived subjected to his bitterest hate

 lvii
 "thenceforth he nevermore was seen to smile
 all his discourse was sad and still ensued
 sobs from his breast afflicted in the style
 of vext orestes when he in his mood
 had slain his mother and aegysthus vile
 by vengeful furies for the deed pursued
 till broken by the ceaseless grief he fed
 he sickened and betook himself to bed

 lviii
 "now in the harlot when she had discerned
 this other set by her so little store
 the former amorous flame was quickly turned
 into despiteous rage and hatred sore
 nor with less wrath she towards my brother burned
 than for argaeus she had felt before
 and she disposed herself in treasons versed
 to slay her second husband like the first

 lix
 "of a deceitful leech she made assay
 well fitted for the work she had in hand
 who better knew what deadly poisons slay
 than he the force of healing syrup scanned
 and promised him his service to repay
 with a reward exceeding his demand
 when he should with some drink of deadly might
 of her detested husband rid her sight

 lx
 "in presence of myself and more beside
 the wicked elder with his deadly dole
 approaching my unhappy brother cried
 `it was a sovereign drink to make him whole'
 but here a new device gabrina tried
 and ere the sickly man could taste the bowl
 to rid her of accomplice in the deed
 or to defraud him of his promised meed

 lxi
 "seized on his hand the instant he presented
 the poison to my brother `ill my fear
 exclaimed the dame by you would be resented
 excited for a spouse i hold so dear
 i that the beverage has not been fermented
 with evil drug and poisonous will be clear
 nor deem it meet that you to him convey
 the proffered bowl unless you take the say'

 lxii
 "in what condition think you sir remained
 the wretched elder by his fears opprest
 thus by the woman's suddenness constrained
 he had no time for thinking what were best
 he lest more doubt of him be entertained
 tastes of the chalice at gabrina's hest
 and the sick man emboldened so drinks up
 all the remainder of the poisoned cup

 lxiii
 "as the trained hawk of crooked talon who
 clutches the partridge when about to eat
 is by the dog she deems her comrade true
 o'ertaken and defrauded of the meat
 so on ill gain intent the leech in lieu
 of the expected aid received defeat
 hear thus what sovereign wickedness will dare
 and be like fate each greedy miscreant's share

 lxiv
 "this past and done the leech would homeward speed
 that he to counteract the pest he bore
 within his bowels in this fearful need
 might use some secret of his cunning lore
 but this the wicked dame would not concede
 forbidding him to issue thence before
 his patient's stomach should the juice digest
 and its restoring power be manifest

 lxv
 "no prayer will move nor offered price will buy
 the woman's leave to let him thence depart
 the desperate man who saw that death was nigh
 and sure to follow quickly changed his part
 and told the story to the standersby
 nor could she cover it with all her art
 thus what he wont to do by many a one
 that goodly doctor by himself has done

 lxvi
 "and follows with his soul my brother true
 that hence already freed was gone before
 we the assistants that the matter knew
 from the old man who lingered little more
 took that abominable monster who
 more cruel was than beast in forest hoar
 and prisoned in a darksome place reserved
 to perish in the fire as she deserved"

 lxvii
 so said hermonides and had pursued
 his tale and told how she from prison fled
 but suffered from his wound a pang so shrewd
 he fell reversed upon his grassy bed
 meanwhile two squires who served him in the wood
 a rustic bier of sturdy branches spread
 their master upon this the servants lay
 who could not thence be borne in other way

 lxviii
 zerbino in excuse assured the peer
 he grieved so good a knight to have offended
 but as was still the use of cavalier
 had guarded her who in his guidance wended
 nor had he else preserved his honour clear
 for when the dame was to his care commended
 her to defend his promise he had plight
 from all men to the utmost of his might

 lxix
 he if he might is any thing beside
 would readily assist him in his need
  his only wish the cavalier replied
 was he might be from ill gabrina freed
 ere him some mighty mischief should betide
 of future penitence the bitter seed
 gabrina keeps on earth her downcast eye
 for ill the simple truth admits reply

 lxx
 zerbino thence upon the promised way
 with the old woman in his escort went
 and inly cursed her all the livelong day
 that in her cause that baron he had shent
 and having heard the knight her guilt display
 who was instructed in her evil bent
 he  if before he had her at despite 
 so loathed her she was poison to his sight

 lxxi
 well read in young zerbino's hate the dame
 would not by him in malice be outdone
 nor bated him an inch but in that game
 of deadly hatred set him two for one
 her face was with the venom in a flame
 wherewith her swelling bosom overrun
 'twas thus in such concord as i say
 these through the ancient wood pursued their way

 lxxii
 when lo as it is now nigh eventide
 they a mixt sound of blows and outcries hear
 which seem a sign of battle fiercely plied
 and as the deafening noise demonstrates near
 to mark what this might be towards that side
 whence came the tumult moved the scottish peer
 nor is in following him gabrina slow
 what chanced in other canto you shall know


 canto 22

 argument
 atlantes' magic towers astolpho wight
 destroys and frees his thralls from prisoncell
 bradamant finds rogero who in fight
 o'erthrows four barons from the warlike sell
 when on their way to save an errant knight
 doomed to devouring fire the four who fell
 for impious pinnabel maintained the strife
 whom after bradamant deprives of life


 i
 ye courteous dames and to your lovers dear
 you that are with one single love content
 though 'mid so many and many it is clear
 right few of you are of such constant bent
 be not displeased at what i said whilere
 when i so bitterly gabrina shent
 nor if i yet expend some other verse
 in censure of the beldam's mind perverse

 ii
 such was she and i hide not what is true
 so was enjoined me for a task by one
 whose will is law therefore is honour due
 to constant heart throughout my story done
 he who betrayed his master to the jew
 for thirty pence nor peter wronged nor john
 nor less renowned is hypermnestra's fame
 for her so many wicked sisters' shame

 iii
 for one i dare to censure in my lays
 for so the story wills which i recite
 on the other hand a hundred will i praise
 and make their virtue dim the sun's fair light
 but turning to the various pile i raise
 gramercy dear to many of the knight
 of scotland i was telling who hardby
 had heard as was rehearsed a piercing cry

 iv
 he entered 'twixt two hills a narrow way
 from whence was heard the cry nor far had hied
 ere to a vale he came shut out from day
 where he before him a dead knight espied
 who i shall tell but first i must away
 from france in the levant to wander wide
 till i the paladin astolpho find
 who westward had his course from thence inclined

 v
 i in the cruel city left the peer
 whence with the formidable bugle's roar
 he had chased the unfaithful people in their fear
 and has preserved himself from peril sore
 and with the sound had made his comrades rear
 then sail and fly with noted scorn that shore
 now following him i say the warrior took
 the armenian road and so that land forsook

 vi
 he after some few days in natoly
 finds himself and towards brusa goes his ways
 hence wending on the hither side o' the sea
 makes thrace through hungary by the danube lays
 his course and as his horse had wings to flee
 traverses in less time than twenty days
 both the moravian and bohemian line
 threaded franconia next and crost the rhine

 vii
 to aixlachapelle thence through arden's wood
 came and embarked upon the flemish strand
 to sea with southern breeze his vessel stood
 and so the favouring wind her canvas fanned
 that he at little distance albion viewed
 by noon and disembarked upon her land
 he backed his horse and so the rowels plied
 in london he arrived by eventide

 viii
 here learning afterwards that otho old
 has lain for many months in paristown
 and that anew nigh every baron bold
 has after his renowned example done
 he straightway does for france his sails unfold
 and to the mouth of thames again is gone
 whence issuing forth with all his canvas spread
 for calais he directs the galley's head

 ix
 a breeze which from the starboard blowing light
 had tempted forth astolpho's bark to sea
 by little and by little waxed in might
 and so at last obtains the mastery
 the pilot is constrained to veer outright
 lest by the billows swampt his frigate be
 and he departing from his first design
 keeps the bark straight before the cresting brine

 x
 now to the right now to the other hand
 sped by the tempest through the foaming main
 the vessel ran she took the happy land
 at last nigh rouen and forthwith in chain
 and plate astolpho cased and girt with brand
 bade put the saddle upon rabicane
 departed thence and what availed him more
 than thousands armed with him his bugle bore

 xi
 and traversing a forest at the feet
 of a fair hill arrived beside a font
 what time the sheep foregoes his grassy meat
 penned in the cabin or the hollow mount
 and overcome by feverish thirst and heat
 lifted the weighty morion from his front
 tethered his courser in the thickest wood
 and with intent to drink approached the flood

 xii
 his lips he had not wetted in its bed
 before a youthful rustic ambushed near
 sprang from a copse backed rabican and fled
 with the good courser of the cavalier
 astolpho hears the noise and lifts his head
 and when he sees his mighty loss so clear
 satiate although he had not drunk upstarts
 and after the young churl in fury darts

 xiii
 that robber did not let the courser strain
 at speed or he had from the warrior shot
 but loosening now and tightening now the rein
 fled at a gallop or a steady trot
 from the deep forest issued forth the twain
 after long round and reached in fine the spot
 where so many illustrious lords were shent
 worse prisoners they than if in prison pent

 xiv
 on rabican who with the wind might race
 the villain sped within the enchanter's won
 impeded by his shield and iron case
 parforce astolpho far behind him run
 yet there arrives as well but every trace
 of what the warrior had pursued is gone
 he neither rabican nor thief can meet
 and vainly rolls his eyes and plies his feet

 xv
 he plies his feet and searches still in vain
 throughout the house hall bower or galleried rows
 yet labours evermore with fruitless pain
 and care to find the treacherous churl nor knows
 where he can have secreted rabicane
 who every other animal outgoes
 and vainly searches all day the dome about
 above below within it and without

 xvi
 he wearied and confused with wandering wide
 perceived the place was by enchantment wrought
 and of the book he carried at his side
 by logistilla given in india thought
 bestowed should new enchantment him betide
 that needful succour might therein be sought
 he to the index turns and quickly sees
 what pages show the proper remedies

 xvii
 i' the book of that enchanted house at large
 was written and in this was taught the way
 to foil the enchanter and to set at large
 the different prisoners subject to his sway
 of these illusions and these frauds in charge
 a spirit pent beneath the threshold lay
 and the stone raised which kept him fast below
 with him the palace into smoke would go

 xviii
 astolpho with desire to bring to end
 an enterprise so passing fair delays
 no more but to the task his force does bend
 and prove how much the heavy marble weighs
 as old atlantes sees the knight intend
 to bring to scorn his art and evil ways
 suspicious of the ill which may ensue
 he moves to assail him with enchantments new

 xix
 he with his spells and shapes of devilish kind
 makes the duke different from his wont appear
 to one a giant and to one a hind
 to other an illvisaged cavalier
 each in the form which in the thicket blind
 the false enchanter wore beholds the peer
 so that they all with purpose to have back
 what the magician took the duke attack

 xx
 the child gradasso iroldo bradamant
 prasildo brandimart and many more
 all cheated by this new illusion pant
 to slay the english baron angered sore
 but he abased their pride and haughty vaunt
 who straight bethought him of the horn be bore
 but for the succour of its echo dread
 they without fail had laid astolpho dead

 xxi
 but he no sooner has the bugle wound
 and poured a horrid larum than in guise
 of pigeons at the musquet's scaring sound
 the troop of cavaliers affrighted flies
 no less the necromancer starts astound
 no less he from his den in panic hies
 troubled and pale and hurrying evermore
 till out of hearing of the horrid roar

 xxii
 the warder fled with him his prisoned train
 and many steeds as well are fled and gone
 these more than rope is needed to restrain
 who after their astounded masters run
 scared by the sound nor cat nor mouse remain
 who seem to hear in it "lay on lay on"
 rabican with the rest had broke his bands
 but that he fell into astolpho's hands

 xxiii
 he having chased the enchanter moor away
 upraised the heavy threshold from the ground
 beneath which figures and more matters lay
 that i omit desirous to confound
 the spell which did the magic dome upstay
 the duke made havock of whate'er he found
 as him the book he carried taught to do
 and into mist and smoke all past from view

 xxiv
 there he found fastened by a golden chain
 rogero's famous courser him i say
 given by the wizard that to the domain
 of false alcina him he might convey
 on which equipt with logistilla's rein
 to france rogero had retraced his way
 and had from ind to england rounded all
 the righthand side of the terrestrial ball

 xxv
 i know not if you recollect how tied
 to a tree rogero left his rein the day
 galaphron's naked daughter from his side
 vanished and him did with that scorn appay
 the courser to his wonder who espied
 returned to him whom he was used to obey
 beneath the old enchanter's care to dwell
 and stayed with him till broken was the spell

 xxvi
 at nought astolpho could more joyous be
 than this of all things fortunate the best
 in that the hippogryph so happily
 offered himself that he might scower the rest
 as much he coveted of land and sea
 and in few days the ample world invest
 him well he knew how fit for his behoof
 for of his feats he had elsewhere made proof

 xxvii
 him he that day in india proved when sped
 he was by sage melissa from the reign
 of that ill woman who him sore bested
 had changed from man to myrtle on the plain
 had marked and noted how his giddy head
 was formed by logistilla to the rein
 and saw how well instructed by her care
 rogero was to guide him every where

 xxviii
 minded to take the hippogryph he flung
 the saddle on him which lay near and bitted
 the steed by choosing all the reins among
 this part or that until his mouth was fitted
 for in that place were many bridles hung
 belonging to the coursers which flitted
 and now alone intent upon his flight
 the thought of rabicane detained the knight

 xxix
 good cause he had to love that rabicane
 for better horse was not to run with lance
 and him had he from the remotest reign
 of india ridden even into france
 after much thought he to some friend would fain
 present him rather than so left to chance
 abandon there the courser as a prey
 to the first stranger who should pass that way

 xxx
 he stood upon the watch if he could view
 some hunter in the forest or some hind
 to whom he might commit the charge and who
 might to some city lead the horse behind
 he waited all that day and till the new
 had dawned when while the twilight yet was blind
 he thought he saw as he expecting stood
 a cavalier approaching through the wood

 xxxi
 but it behoves that ere the rest i say
 i bradamant and good rogero find
 after the horn had ceased and far away
 the beauteous pair had left the dome behind
 rogero looked and knew what till that day
 he had seen not by atlantes rendered blind
 atlantes had effected by his power
 they should not know each other till that hour

 xxxii
 rogero looks on bradamant and she
 looks on rogero in profound surprise
 that for so many days that witchery
 had so obscurred her altered mind and eyes
 rejoiced rogero clasps his lady free
 crimsoning with deeper than the rose's dyes
 and his fair love's first blossoms while he clips
 the gentle damsel gathers from her lips

 xxxiii
 a thousand times they their embrace renew
 and closely each is by the other prest
 while so delighted are those lovers two
 their joys are ill contained within their breast
 deluded by enchantments much they rue
 that while they were within the wizard's rest
 they should not e'er have one another known
 and have so many happy days foregone

 xxxiv
 the gentle bradamant who was i' the vein
 to grant whatever prudent virgin might
 to solace her desiring lover's pain
 so that her honour should receive no slight
  if the last fruits he of her love would gain
 nor find her ever stubborn bade the knight
 her of duke aymon through fair mean demand
 but be baptized before he claimed her hand

 xxxv
 rogero good who not alone to be
 a christian for the love of her were fain
 as his good sire had been and anciently
 his grandsire and his whole illustrious strain
 but for her pleasure would immediately
 resign whatever did of life remain
 says "i not only if 'tis thy desire
 will be baptized by water but by fire"

 xxxvi
 then on his way to be baptized he hied
 that he might next espouse the martial may
 with bradamant who served him as a guide
 to vallombrosa's fane an abbey gray
 rich fair nor less religious and beside
 courteous to whosoever passed that way
 and they encountered issuing from the chase
 a woman with a passing woful face

 xxxvii
 rogero as still courteous still humane
 to all but woman most when he discerned
 her dainty visage furrowed by a rain
 of lovely tears sore pitied her and burned
 with the desire to know her grievous pain
 and having to the mournful lady turned
 besought her after fair salute to show
 what cause had made her eyes thus overflow

 xxxviii
 and she uplifting their moist rays and bright
 most kindly to the inquiring child replied
 and of the cause of her unhappy plight
 him since he sought it fully satisfied
 "thou hast to understand o gentle knight
 my visage is so bathed with tears" she cried
 "in pity to a youth condemned to die
 this very day within a town hard by

 xxxix
 "loving a gentle lady and a gay
 the daughter of marsilius king of spain
 and feigning veiled in feminine array
 the modest roll of eye and girlish strain
 with her each night the amorous stripling lay
 nor any had suspicion of the twain
 but nought so hidden is but searching eye
 in the long run the secret will espy

 xl
 "one first perceived it and then spoke with two
 those two with more till to the king 'twas said
 of whom but yesterday a follower true
 gave order to surprise the pair in bed
 and in the citadel the prisoners new
 to separate dungeons in that fortress led
 nor think i that enough of day remains
 to save the lover from his cruel pains

 xli
 "i fled not to behold such cruelty
 for they alive the wretched youth will burn
 nor think i aught could more afflicting be
 than such fair stripling's torment to discern
 or that hereafter thing can pleasure me
 so much but that it will to trouble turn
 if memory retrace the cruel flame
 which preyed upon his fair and dainty frame"

 xlii
 touched deeply bradamant his danger hears
 in heart sore troubled at the story shown
 as anxious for the lover it appears
 as if he were a brother of her own
 nor certes wholly causeless are her fears
 as in an after verse will be made known
 then to rogero "him to keep from harms
 meseems we worthily should turn our arms"

 xliii
 and to that melancholy damsel said
 "place us but once within the walls and i
 so that the youth be not already dead
 will be your warrant that he shall not die"
 rogero who the kindly bosom read
 of bradamant still full of piety
 felt himself but all over with desire
 to snatch the unhappy stripling from the fire

 xliv
 and to the maid whose troubled face apears
 bathed with a briny flood "why wait we  need
 is here of speedy succour not of tears
 do you but where the youth is prisoned lead
 him from a thousand swords a thousand spears
 we vow to save so it be done with speed
 but haste you lest too tardy be our aid
 and he be burnt which succour is delayed"

 xlv
 the haughty semblance and the lofty say
 of these who with such wondrous daring glowed
 that hope which long had ceased to be her stay
 again upon the grieving dame bestowed
 but for she less the distance of the way
 dreaded than interruption of the road
 lest they through this should take that path in vain
 the damsel stood suspended and in pain

 xlvi
 then said "if to the place our journey lay
 by the highroad which is both straight and plain
 that we in time might reach it i should say
 before the fire was lit but we must strain
 by path so foul and crooked that a day
 to reach the city would suffice with pain
 and when alas we thither shall have sped
 i fear that we shall find the stripling dead"

 xlvii
 "and wherefore take we not the way most near"
 rogero answers and the dame replies
 "because fast by where we our course should steer
 a castle of the count of poictiers lies
 where pinnabel for dame and cavalier
 did three days past a shameful law devise
 than whom more worthless living wight is none
 the count anselmo d'altaripa's son

 xlviii
 "no cavalier or lady by that rest
 without some noted scorn and injury goes
 both of their coursers here are dispossest
 and knight his arms and dame her gown foregoes
 no better cavaliers lay lance in rest
 nor have for years in france against their foes
 than four who for sir pinnabel have plight
 their promise to maintain the castle's right

 xlix
 "whence first arose the usage which began
 but three days since you now sir knight shall hear
 and shall the cause if right or evil scan
 which moved the banded cavaliers to swear
 so ill a lady has the castellan
 so wayward that she is without a peer
 who on a day as with the count she went
 i know not whither by a knight was shent

 l
 "this knight as flouted by that bonnibel
 for carrying on his croup an ancient dame
 encountered with her champion pinnabel
 of overweening pride and little fame
 him he o'erturned made alight as well
 and put her to the proof if sound or lame
  left her on foot and had that woman old
 in the dismounted damsel's garment stoled

 li
 "she who remained on foot in fell despite
 greedy of vengeance and athirst for ill
 leagued with the faithless pinnabel a wight
 all evil prompt to further and fulfil
 says she shall never rest by day nor night
 nor ever know a happy hour until
 a thousand knights and dames are dispossest
 of courser and of armour and of vest

 lii
 "four puissant knights arrived that very day
 it happened at a place of his and who
 had all of them from regions far away
 come lately to those parts so many true
 and valiant warriors skilled in martial play
 our age has seen not these the goodly crew
 guido the savage but a stripling yet
 gryphon and aquilant and sansonet

 liii
 "them at the fortilage of which i told
 sir pinnabel received with semblance fair
 next seized the ensuing night the warriors bold
 in bed nor loosed till he had made them swear
 that he such period fixt they in his hold
 should be his faithful champions for a year
 and month and of his horse and arms deprive
 whatever cavalier should there arrive

 liv
 "and any damsel whom the stranger bore
 with him dismount and strip her of her vest
 so thus surprised the warlike prisoners swore
 so were constrained to observe the cruel hest
 though grieved and troubled nor against the four
 it seems can any joust but vails his crest
 knight infinite have come but one and all
 afoot and without arms have left that hall

 lv
 "their order is who from the castle hies
 the first by lot shall meet the foe alone
 but if he find a champion of such guise
 as keeps the sell while he himself is thrown
 the rest must undertake the enterprise
 even to the death against that single one
 ranged in a band if such each single knight
 imagine the assembled warriors' might

 lvi
 "nor stands it with our haste which all delay
 all let forbids that you beside that tower
 be forced to stop and mingle in the fray
 for grant that you be conquerors in the stower
 and as your presence warrants well you may
 'tis not a thing concluded in an hour
 and if all day he wait our succour i
 much fear the stripling in the fire will die"

 lvii
 "regard we not this hindrance of our quest"
 rogero cried "but do we what we may
 let him who rules the heavens ordain the rest
 or fortune if he leave it in her sway
 to you shall by this joust be manifest
 if we can aid the youth for whom today
 they on a ground so causeless and so slight
 as you to us rehearsed the fire will light"

 lviii
 rogero ceased and in the nearest way
 the damsel put the pair without reply
 nor these beyond three miles had fared when they
 reached bridge and gate the place of forfeitry
 of horse and arms and feminine array
 with peril sore of life on turret high
 upon first sight of them a sentinel
 beat twice upon the castle's larumbell

 lix
 and lo in eager hurry from the gate
 an elder trotting on hackney made
 and he approaching cried "await await
  hola halt sirs for here a fine is paid
 and i to you the usage shall relate
 if this has not to you before been said"
 and to the three forthwith began to tell
 the use established there by pinnabel

 lx
 he next proceeds as he had wont before
 to counsel other errant cavalier
 "unrobe the lady" said the elder hoar
 "my sons and leave your steeds and martial geer
 nor put yourselves in peril and with four
 such matchless champions hazard the career
 clothes arms and coursers every where are rife
 but not to be repaired is loss of life"

 lxi
 "  no more" rogero said "no more for i
 am well informed of all and hither speed
 with the intention here by proof to try
 if what my heart has vouched i am in deed
 for sign or threat i yield not panoply
 if nought beside i hear nor vest nor steed
 and this my comrade i as surely know
 these for mere words as little will forego

 lxii
 "but let me face to face by heaven espy
 those who would take my horse and arms away
 for we have yet beyond that hill to hie
 and little time can here afford to stay"
 "behold the man" that ancient made reply
 "clear of the bridge"  nor did in this missay
 for thence a warrior pricked who powdered o'er
 with snowy flowers a crimson surcoat wore

 lxiii
 bradamant for long time with earnest prayer
 for courtesy the good rogero prest
 to let her from his sell the warrior bear
 who with white flowers had purfled o'er his vest
 but moved him not and to rogero's share
 must leave and do herself what liked him best
 he willed the whole emprize his own should be
 and bradamant should stand apart to see

 lxiv
 the child demanded of that elder who
 was he that from the gate first took his way
 and he " 'tis sansonet of crimson hue
 i know his surcoat with white flowers gay"
 without a word exchanged the warlike two
 divide the ground and short is the delay
 for they against each other levelling low
 their spears and hurrying sore their coursers go

 lxv
 this while had issued from the fortress near
 with many footmen girt sir pinnabel
 all ready to despoil the cavalier
 who in the warlike joust should void is sell
 at one another spurred in bold career
 the knights with their huge lances rested well
 up to the points nigh equal was each stick
 of stubborn native oak and two palms thick

 lxvi
 sansonet of such staves above five pair
 had made them sever from the living stock
 in neighboring wood and bade his followers bear
 two of them hither destined for that shock
 such truncheons to withstand well neededwere
 a shield and cuirass of the diamond rock
 one he had made them give his foe and one
 he kept himself the present course to run

 lxvii
 with these which might the solid anvil bore
 so well their ends were pointed there and here
 each aiming at the shield his foeman wore
 the puissant warriors shocked in mid career
 that of rogero wrought with magic lore
 by fiends had little from the stroke to fear
 i of the buckler speak atlantes made
 of whose rare virtues i whilere have said

 lxviii
 i have already said the enchanted light
 strikes with such force on the beholder's eyes
 that at the shield's discovery every wight
 is blinded or on earth half lifeless lies
 wherefore well mantled with a veil the knight
 keeps it unless some passing need surprise
 impassive is the shield as well believed
 since it no damage in the shock received

 lxix
 the other by less skilful artist wrought
 did not so well that weightless blow abide
 but as if smit by thunder in a thought
 gave way before the steel and opened wide
 gave way before the griding steel which sought
 the arm beneath by this ill fortified
 so that sir sansonet was smote and reeled
 in his departure unhorsed upon the field

 lxx
 and this was the first comrade of the train
 that of the tower maintained the usage fell
 who there had failed another's spoil to gain
 and voided in the joust his knightly sell
 who laughs as well will sometimes have to plain
 and find that fortune will by fits rebel
 anew the warder on his larum beats
 and to the other knights the sign repeats

 lxxi
 this while sir pinnabello had drawn near
 to bradamant and prayed that she would shew
 what warrior had his knight in the career
 smith with such prowess that the guerdon due
 to his ill deeds might wait the cavalier
 god's justice that illdoer thither drew
 on the same courser which before the cheat
 from bradamant had taken by deceit

 lxxii
 'twas now exactly the eighth month was ended
 since if you recollect upon his way
 the faithless maganzese with whom she wended
 cast into merlin's tomb the martial may
 when her a bough which fell with her defended
 from death or her good fortune rather say
 and pinnabel bore off her courser brave
 deeming the damsel buried in the cave

 lxxiii
 the courser and through him the cavalier
 bradamant knew to be the wicked count
 and having heard him and perused him near
 with more attentive eye and front to front 
 "this is the man" the damsel said " 'tis clear
 who erst designed me outrage and affront
 lo him the traitor's sin doth hither speed
 of all his treasons to receive the meed"

 lxxiv
 to threaten him with vengeance and to lay
 hands on her sword and charge him now was done
 all in a thought but first she barred the way
 by which he might his fortilage have won
 to earth himself like fox in his dismay
 sir pinnabel has every hope foregone
 he screaming loud nor ever making head
 against the damsel through the forest fled

 lxxv
 pale and dismayed his spurs the caitiff plied
 whose last hope of escape in flight was found
 while with her ready sword dordona's pride
 was at his flank and prest him in his round
 hunting him close and ever fast beside
 loud is the uproar and the woods resound
 nothing of this is at the castle kenned
 for only to rogero all attend

 lxxvi
 the other three who from the fortress came
 this while had issued forth upon their way
 and brought with them the illaccustomed dame
 who made wayfarers that ill use obey
 in all who rather than prolong with blame
 their life would choose to perish in the fray
 the kindling visage burns and heart is woe
 that to assail one man so many go

 lxxvii
 the cruel courtezan by whom was made
 and by whose hest maintained that evil rite
 reminds the warriors that they are arrayed
 by oath and pact to avenge her in the fight
 "if with this lance alone thy foes are laid
 on earth why should i band with other knight"
 guido the savage said "and if i lie
 off with my head for i consent to die"

 lxxviii
 so aquilant so gryphon for the twain
 singly against a single foe would run
 and rather would be taken rather slain
 than he should be assailed by more than one
 to them exclaimed the woman "why in vain
 waste you so many words where fruit is none
 i brought you here that champion's arms to take
 not other laws and other pacts to make

 lxxix
 "you should have offered when in prisoncell
 this your excuse which now too late is made
 'tis yours the law's observance to compel
 and not with lying tongue your oath evade"
 "  behold the arms behold with a new sell
 and cloth the goodly steed" rogero said
 "behold with these as well the damsel's vest
 if these you covet why your course arrest"

 lxxx
 she of the castle presses on this side
 on that rogero rates and calls them on
 till they parforce t'wards him together hied
 but red with shame are to the encounter gone
 foremost appeared 'mid those three knights of pride
 of burgundy's good marquis either son
 but guido who was borne on heavier steed
 came at some interval with tardier speed

 lxxxi
 with the same lance with which he overbore
 sir sansonet rogero came to fight
 wellcovered with the shield which heretofore
 atlantes used on pyrenean height
 i say the enchanted buckler which too sore
 for human sufferance dazed the astonished sight
 to which rogero as a last resource
 in the most pressing peril had recourse

 lxxxii
 although three times alone the child was fain
 and certes sore bested this to display
 twice when he from the wanton fairy's reign
 was to that soberer region on his way
 last when the unsated orc upon the main
 by this astounded 'mid the seafoam lay
 which would have fed upon the naked maid
 so cruel to the child who brought her aid

 lxxxiii
 save these three times he has preserved the shield
 beneath its veil but covered in such wise
 that it may quickly be to sight revealed
 if he in need of its good succour lies
 with this as said before he came afield
 as boldly as if those three enemies
 who were arrayed before him had appeared
 yet less than little children to be feared

 lxxxiv
 rogero shocked the valiant gryphon where
 the border of the buckler joined the sight
 who seemed as he would fall now here now there
 and from his courser far last fell outright
 he at the shield had aimed but smote not fair
 the mark and for rogero's orb was bright
 and smooth the hissing weapon slipt and wrought
 other effect than was in gryphon's thought

 lxxxv
 it rent and tore the veil which served to hide
 the lightning's fearful and enchanted rays
 which without blinded eyes can none abide
 upright nor refuge is for them who gaze
 aquilant who was at his brother's side
 tore off the rest and made the buckler blaze
 the splendour struck the valiant brothers blind
 and guido in their rear who spurred behind

 lxxxvi
 these here or there to earth astonished reel
 nor eyes alone are dazzled by the light
 but every sense astounds the flaming steel
 unconscious of the issue of the fight
 rogero turned his horse and in the wheel
 handled his sword so good to thrust and smite
 and none descried his fury to oppose
 for in the charge dismounted were his foes

 lxxxvii
 the knights together with the footmen all
 and women who had from the castle hied
 nor less the coursers panting with their fall
 as if about to die the warrior spied
 he wondered first and next perceived the pall
 of silk was handing down on the left side
 i say the pall in which he used to lap
 his shield the evil cause of that mishap

 lxxxviii
 he quickly turns and turning rolls his eyes
 in hopes to view his wellloved martial maid
 and thitherward without delay he hies
 where when the joust began the damsel stayed
 not finding her it is the child's surmise
 that she is gone to bear the stripling aid
 fearing he may be burnt while they their journey
 so long delay retarded by that tourney

 lxxxix
 he saw the damsel stretched among the rest
 who him had thither guided as she lay
 he took and placed her yet with sleep opprest
 before him and sore troubled rode away
 he with a mantle which above her vest
 she wore concealed the enchanted buckler's ray
 and to the maid restored when 'twas concealed
 her senses which were ravished by the shield

 xc
 away rogero posted with the dame
 and did not date his crimsoned visage raise
 since every one it seemed to him might blame
 with right that victory worthy little praise
 "by what amends can i of such a shame
 the blushing warrior said the stain eraze
 for 'twill be bruited all my deeds by sleight
 of magic have been done and not by might"

 xci
 as thinking thus he journeyed on his way
 rogero stumbled upon what he sought
 for in the middle of the track there lay
 a well within the ground profoundly wrought
 whither the thirsty herd at noon of day
 repaired their paunches with green forage fraught
 rogero said " 'tis now must i provide
 i shame from thee o shield no more abide

 xcii
 "thee will i keep no more and this shall be
 even the last shame which so on me is thrown"
 the child so ending his selfcolloquy
 dismounting takes a large and heavy stone
 which to the shield he ties and bodily
 both to the bottom of the well are gone
 "lie buried there for ever from all eyes
 and with thee hidden be my shame" he cries

 xciii
 filled to the brim with water was the well
 heavy the stone and heavy was the shield
 nor stopt they till they to the bottom fell
 by the light liquid element concealed
 fame was not slow the noble act to swell
 but wandering wide the deed in brief revealed
 and voicing it abroad with trumpetsound
 told france and spain and all the countries round

 xciv
 when that so strange adventure to the rest
 of the wide world from mouth to mouth was blown
 knights out of number undertook the quest
 from neighbouring parts and distant but unknown
 to all remained the forest which possessed
 the spring wherein the virtuous shield was thrown
 for she who told the action would not say
 where was the well nor in what land it lay

 xcv
 upon rogero's parting thence where fell
 the four good champions of that evil law
 made by the castle's lord sir pinnabel
 by him discomfited like men of straw
  the shield withdrawn  he had removed as well
 the light which quelled their sight and minds who saw
 and those who like dead men on earth had lain
 had risen full of wonderment again

 xcvi
 nor any thing throughout that livelong day
 they 'mid themselves but that strange case relate
 and how it was in that disastrous fray
 each by the horrid light was quelled debate
 while these discoursing of the adventure say
 tidings are brought of pinnabello's fate
 that pinnabel is dead the warriors hear
 but learn not who had slain the cavalier

 xcvii
 bradamant in close pass this while had staid
 the faithless pinnabel and sorely prest
 and many times had buried half her blade
 within bleeding flanks and heaving breast
 when of his crimes the forfeit had been paid
 by him the infected country's curse and pest
 she from the conscious forest turned away
 with that good steed the thief had made his prey

 xcviii
 she would return where she had left the knight
 but never could make out the road anew
 and now by valley now by mountainheight
 wandered wellnigh the ample country through
 yet could she never such her fortune's spite
 find out the way to join rogero true
 him in another canto i attend
 who loves the tale to hear my story's end


 canto 23

 argument
 astolpho soars in air upon account
 of pinnabel is prisoned scotland's heir
 by roland freed frontino rodomont
 takes from hippalca trusted to her care
 with mandricardo strives anglantes' count
 who next offended by his lady fair
 into the fury falls so strange and fell
 which in the world has not a parallel


 i
 let each assist the other in his need
 seldom good actions go without their due
 and if their just reward should not succeed
 at least nor death nor shame nor loss ensue
 who wrongs another the remembered meed
 as well shall have and soon or later rue
 that mountains never meet but that men may
 and oft encounter is an ancient say

 ii
 now mark what chanced to pinnabel the event
 of having borne himself so wickedly
 he at the last received due punishment
 due and deserved by his iniquity
 and god who for the most is ill content
 to see the righteous suffer wrongfully
 secured the maid from harm and will secure
 all who from every wickedness are pure

 iii
 pinnabel deemed he to an end had brought
 and buried deep in earth the martial maid
 nor weening to behold her more less thought
 to her his treason's forfeit to have paid
 nor profits it the wily traitor ought
 to be among the forts his father swayed
 for altaripa here its summit rears
 amid rude hills confining on poictiers

 iv
 anselm in altaripa held command
 the count from whom was sprung this evil seed
 who to escape from angry clermont's hand
 of friends and of assistance stood in need
 at a hill's foot with her avenging brand
 bradamant made the worthless traitor bleed
 who found no better succour in the strife
 than piteous cry and fruitless prayer for life

 v
 when she has put to death the treacherous peer
 who to put her to death had erst intent
 to seek rogero she again would steer
 but that her cruel fate would not consent
 which where the wood was loneliest and most drear
 to wander by close path the lady sent
 until the western sun withdrew his light
 abandoning the world above to night

 vi
 nor knowing where for shelter she should rove
 bradamant in that place resolves to stay
 couched on the verdant herbage of the grove
 and sleeping now awaits the dawn of day
 now watching saturn venus mars and jove
 and the other wandering gods upon their way
 but whether waking or to sleep resigned
 has aye rogero present to her mind

 vii
 with sorrow and repentance oft assailed
 she from her inmost heart profoundly sighed
 that anger over love should have prevailed
 "anger has torn me from my love" she cried
 "oh had i made some note which had availed
 thither whence i set out my steps to guide
 when i departed on my ill emprize
 sure i was lorn of memory and of eyes"

 viii
 these words and others she in mournful strain
 utters and broods within her heart on more
 meanwhile a wind of sighs and plenteous rain
 of tears are tokens of her anguish sore
 in the east at last expected long in vain
 the wished for twilight streaked the horizon o'er
 and she her courser took which on the ley
 was feeding and rode forth to meet the day

 ix
 nor far had rode ere from the greenwoodtrees
 she issued where the dome was erst displayed
 and many days her with such witcheries
 the evilminded wizard had delayed
 here she astolpho found who at full ease
 a bridle for the hippogryph had made
 and here was standing thoughtful and in pain
 to whom he should deliver rabicane

 x
 by chance she found him as the cavalier
 had from the helm uncased his head to view
 so that when of the dingy forest clear
 fair bradamant her gentle cousin knew
 him from afar she hailed with joyful cheer
 and now more nigh to embrace the warrior flew
 and named herself and raised her vizor high
 and let him plainly who she was espy

 xi
 none could astolpho have found any where
 with whom to leave his horse with more content
 as knowing she would guard the steed with care
 and to his lord on his return present
 and he believed that heaven had in its care
 duke aymon's daughter for this pleasure sent
 her was he wont with pleasure aye to see
 but now with more in his necessity

 xii
 embracing twice or thrice the cousins stand
 fraternally each other's neck and they
 had of each other's welfare made demand
 with much affection ere the duke 'gan say
 "would i now see the winged people's land
 here upon earth i make too long delay"
 and opening to the dame the thought he brewed
 to her the flying horse astolpho shewed

 xiii
 but she scarce marvelled when above the plain
 she saw the rising steed his wings unfold
 since upon former time with mastering rein
 on him had charged the dame that wizard old
 and made her eye and eyelid sorely strain
 so hard she gazed his movements to behold
 the day that he bore off with wonderous range
 rogero on his journey long and strange

 xiv
 astolpho says on her he will bestow
 his rabican so passing swift of kind
 that if the courser started when a bow
 was drawn he left the feathered shaft behind
 and will as well his panoply forego
 that it may to mount alban be consigned
 and she for him preserve the martial weed
 since of his arms he has no present need

 xv
 bent since a course in air was to be flown
 that he as best he can will make him light
 yet keeps the sword and horn although alone
 the horn from every risque might shield the knight
 but he the lance abandons which the son
 of galaphron was wont to bear in flight
 the lance by which whoever in the course
 was touched fell headlong hurtling from his horse

 xvi
 backed by astolpho and ascending slow
 the hippogryph through yielding aether flew
 and next the rider stirred the courser so
 that in a thought he vanished out of view
 thus with his pilot does the patron go
 fearing the gale and rock till he is through
 the reefs then having left the shore behind
 hoists every sail and shoots before the wind

 xvii
 bradamant when departed was the peer
 remained distressed in mind since in what way
 she knew not her good kinsman's warlike gear
 and courser to mount alban to convey
 for on her heart which they inflame and tear
 the warm desire and greedy will yet prey
 to see the child whom she to find once more
 at vallombrosa thought if not before

 xviii
 here standing in suspense by chance she spied
 a churl that came towards her on the plain
 who at her best astolpho's armour tied
 as best he might and laid on rabicane
 she next behind her bade the peasant guide
 one courser loaded and one loose the twain
 two were the steeds for she had that before
 on which his horse from pinnabel she bore

 xix
 to vallombrosa to direct her way
 she thought in hopes to find rogero there
 but fearing evermore to go astray
 knew not how thither she might best repair
 the churl had of the country small assay
 and sure to be bewildered wend the pair
 yet at a venture thitherward she hies
 where she believes the place of meeting lies

 xx
 she here and there as she her way pursued
 turned but found none to question of the road
 she saw at midday issuing from the wood
 a fort nor far removed was the abode
 which on the summit of a mountain stood
 and to the lady like mount alban showed
 and was mount alban sure in which repair
 one of her brothers and her mother were

 xxi
 she when she recognized the place became
 sadder at heart than i have power to say
 if she delays discovered is the dame
 nor thence will be allowed to wend her way
 if thence she wends not of the amorous flame
 which so consumes her she will be the prey
 nor see rogero more nor compass aught
 which was at vallombrosa to be wrought

 xxii
 some deal she doubted then to turn her steed
 resolved upon mount alban's castle near
 and for she thence her way could deftly read
 her course anew towards the abbey steer
 but fortune good or evil had decreed
 the maid before she of the vale was clear
 of one of her good brethren should be spied
 alardo named ere she had time to hide

 xxiii
 he came from billeting the bands which lay
 dispersed about that province foot and horse
 for the surrounding district to obey
 king charlemagne had raised another force
 embraces brotherly and friendly say
 salutes and kindly cheer ensue of course
 and next into mount alban side by side
 they communing of many matters ride

 xxiv
 bradamant enters montalbano's seat
 whom beatrice had mourned and vainly sought
 through spacious france 'tis here all welcome sweet
 the kiss and clasp of hand she holds at nought
 while her a mother and a brother greet
 as the enamoured maid compares in thought
 these with the loved rogero's fond embrace
 which time will never from her mind efface

 xxv
 because she could not go one in her stead
 to send to vallombrosa she devised
 who thither in the damsel's name should speed
 by whom should young rogero be apprised
 what kept her thence and prayed if prayer should need
 that there he for love would be baptised
 and next as was concerned would intend
 what might their bridal bring to happy end

 xxvi
 she purposed the same messenger should bear
 as well to her rogero his good steed
 which he was ever wonted to hold dear
 worthily dear for sure so stout at need
 and beauteous was no courser far or near
 in land of christian or of paynim creed
 in occupation of the gaul or moor
 except baiardo good and brigliador

 xxvii
 valiant rogero when too bold of sprite
 he backed the hippogryph and soared in air
 frontino left frontino he was hight
 whom bradamant then took into her care
 and to mount alban sent and had him dight
 and nourished at large cost with plenteous fare
 nor let be rode except at easy pace
 hence was he ne'er so sleek or well in case

 xxviii
 each damsel and each dame who her obeyed
 she tasked together with herself to sew
 with subtle toil and with fine gold o'erlaid
 a piece of silk of white and sable hue
 with this she trapt the horse then chose a maid
 old callitrephia's daughter from the crew
 whose mother whilom bradamant had nursed
 a damsel she in all her secrets versed

 xxix
 how graven in her heart rogero lies
 a thousand times to her she had confessed
 and had extolled above the deities
 the manners worth and beauty be possessed
 "no better messenger could i devise"
 she said and called the damsel from the rest
 "nor have i one hippalca mine more sage
 and sure than three to do my embassage"

 xxx
 hippalca was the attendant damsel hight
 "go" says her lady and describes the way
 and afterwards informs the maid aright
 of all which to rogero she should say
 and why she at the abbey failed the knight
 who must not to bad faith ascribe her stay
 but this to fortune charge that so decides
 who more than we ourselves our conduct guides

 xxxi
 she made the damsel mount upon a pad
 and put into her hand frontino's rein
 and if she met with one so rude or mad
 who to deprive her of the steed were fain
 her to proclaim who was his owner bade
 as that which might suffice to make him sane
 for she believed there was no cavalier
 but that rogero's name would make him fear

 xxxii
 of many and many things whereof to treat
 with good rogero in her stead she showed
 of which instructed well her palfrey fleet
 hippalca stirred nor longer there abode
 through highway field and wood a gloomy beat
 more than ten weary miles the damsel rode
 ere any crossed her path on mischief bent
 or even questioned witherward she went

 xxxiii
 at noon of day descending from a mount
 she in a streight and ill declivity
 led by a dwarf encountered rodomont
 who was afoot and harnessed capapee
 the moor towards her raised his haughty front
 and straight blasphemed the eternal hierarchy
 that horse so richly trapped and passing fair
 he had not found in a knighterrant's care

 xxxiv
 on the first courser he should find the knight
 had sworn a solemn oath his hands to lay
 this was the first nor he on steed could light
 fairer or fitter yet to take away
 the charger from a maid were foul despite
 doubtful he stands but covets sore the prey
 eyes and surveys him and says often "why
 is not as well the courser's master by"

 xxxv
 "ah would be were" to him the maid replied
 "for haply he would make thee change thy thought
 a better knight than thee the horse doth ride
 and vainly would his match on earth be sought"
  "who tramples thus on other's fame"  he cried
 and she  "rogero"  said as she was taught
 then rodomont  "the steed i may my own
 since him a champion rides of such renown

 xxxvi
 "if he as you relate be of such force
 that he surprises all beside in might
 i needs must pay the hire as well as horse
 and be this at the pleasure of the knight
 that i am rodomont to him discourse
 and if indeed with me he lists to fight
 me shall to find in that i shine confest
 by my own light in motion or at rest

 xxxvii
 "i leave such vestige wheresoe'er i tread
 the volleyed thunder leaves not worse below"
 he had thrown back over frontino's head
 the courser's gilded reins in saying so
 backed him and left hippalca sore bested
 who bathed in tears and goaded by her woe
 cries shame on him and threats the king with ill
 rodomont hearkens not and climbs the hill

 xxxviii
 whither the dwarf conducts him on the trace
 of doralice and mandricardo bold
 behind hippalca him in ceaseless chase
 pursues with taunt and curses manifold
 what came of this is said in other place
 turpin by whom this history is told
 here makes digression and returns again
 thither where faithless pinnabel was slain

 xxxix
 duke aymon's daughter scarce had turned away
 from thence who on her track in haste had gone
 ere thither by another path astray
 zerbino came with that deceitful crone
 and saw the bleeding body where it lay
 and though the warrior was to him unknown
 as good and courteous felt his bosom swell
 with pity at that cruel sight and fell

 xl
 dead lay sir pinnabel and bathed in gore
 from whom such streams of blood profusely flow
 as were a cause for wonderment had more
 swords than a hundred joined to lay him low
 a print of recent footsteps to explore
 the cavalier of scotland was not slow
 who took the adventure in the hope to read
 who was the doer of the murderous deed

 xli
 the hag to wait was ordered by the peer
 who would return to her in little space
 she to the body of the count drew near
 and with fixt eye examined every place
 who willed not aught that in her sight was dear
 the body of the dead should vainly grace
 as one who soiled with every other vice
 surpassed all womankind in avarice

 xlii
 if she in any manner could have thought
 or hoped to have concealed the intended theft
 the bleeding warrior's surcoat richly wrought
 she would together with his arms have reft
 but at what might be safely hidden caught
 and grieved at heart forewent the glorious weft
 him of a beauteous girdle she undrest
 and this secured between a double vest

 xliii
 zerbino after some short space came back
 who vainly bradamant had thence pursued
 through the green holt because the beaten track
 was lost in many others in the wood
 and he for daylight now began to lack
 feared night should catch him 'mid those mountains rude
 and with the impious woman thence in quest
 of inn from the disastrous valley prest

 xliv
 a spacious town which altaripa hight
 journeying the twain at two miles' distance spy
 there stopt the pair and halted for the night
 which at full soar even now went up the sky
 nor long had rested there ere left and right
 they from the people heard a mournful cry
 and saw fast tears from every eyelid fall
 as if some cause of sorrow touched them all

 xlv
 zerbino asked the occasion and 'twas said
 tidings had been to count anselmo brought
 that pinnabel his son was lying dead
 in a streight way between two mountains wrought
 zerbino feigned surprise and hung his head
 in fear lest he the assassin should be thought
 but well divined this was the wight he found
 upon his journey lifeless on the ground

 xlvi
 after some little time the funeral bier
 arrives 'mid torch and flambeau where the cries
 are yet more thick and to the starry sphere
 lament and noise of smitten hands arise
 and faster and from fuller vein the tear
 waters all cheeks descending from the eyes
 but in a cloud more dismal than the rest
 is the unhappy father's visage drest

 xlvii
 while solemn preparation so was made
 for the grand obsequies with reverence due
 according to old use and honours paid
 in former age corrupted by each new
 a proclamation of their lord allayed
 quickly the noise of the lamenting crew
 promising any one a mighty gain
 that should denounce by whom his son was slain

 xlviii
 from voice to voice from one to other ear
 the loud proclaim they through the town declare
 till this the wicked woman chanced to hear
 who past in rage the tyger or the bear
 and hence the ruin of the scottish peer
 either in hatred would the crone prepare
 or were it she alone might boast to be
 in human form without humanity

 xlix
 or were it but to gain the promised prize 
 she to seek out the grieving county flew
 and prefacing her tale in likely wise
 said that zerbino did the deed and drew
 the girdle forth to witness to her lies
 which straight the miserable father knew
 and on the woman's tale and token built
 a clear assurance of zerbino's guilt

 l
 and weeping with raised hands was heard to say
 he for his murdered son would have amends
 to block the hostel where zerbino lay
 for all the town is risen the father sends
 the prince who deems his enemies away
 and no such injury as this attends
 in his first sleep is seized by anselm's throng
 who thinks he has endured so foul a wrong

 li
 that night in prison fettered with a pair
 of heavy letters is zerbino chained
 for before yet the skies illuminated are
 the wrongful execution is ordained
 and in the place will he be quartered where
 the deed was done for which he is arraigned
 no other inquest is on this received
 it is enough that so their lord believed

 lii
 when the next morn aurora stains with dye
 red white and yellow the clear horizon
 the people rise to punish "death" their cry
 zerbino for the crime he has not done
 they without order him accompany
 a lawless multitude some ride some run
 i' the midst the scottish prince with drooping head
 is bound upon a little hackney led

 liii
 but he who with the innocent oft sides
 nor those abandons who make him their stay
 for prince zerbino such defence provides
 there is no fear that he will die today
 god thitherward renowned orlando guides
 whose coming for his safety paves the way
 orlando sees beneath him on a plain
 the youth to death conducted by the train

 liv
 with him was wended she that in the cell
 prisoned orlando found that royal maid
 child of gallicia's king fair isabel
 whom chance into the ruffians' power conveyed
 what time her ship she quitted by the swell
 of the wild sea and tempest overlaid
 the damsel who yet nearer her heartcore
 than her own vital being zerbino wore

 lv
 she had beneath orlando's convoy strayed
 since rescued from the cave when on the plain
 the damsel saw the motley troop arrayed
 she asked orlando what might be the train
 "i know not" said the count and left the maid
 upon the height and hurried towards the plain
 he marked zerbino and at the first sight
 a baron of high worth esteemed the knight

 lvi
 and asked him why and wherefore him they led
 thus captive to zerbino drawing near
 at this the doleful prince upraised his head
 and having better heard the cavalier
 rehearsed the truth and this so well he said
 that he deserved the succour of the peer
 well sir orlando him by his reply
 deemed innocent and wrongly doomed to die

 lvii
 and after he had heard 'twas at the hest
 of anselm count of altaripa done
 was certain 'twas and outrage manifest
 since nought but ill could spring from him and one
 moreover was the other's foe profest
 from ancient hate and enmity which run
 in clermont and maganza's blood a feud
 with injuries and death and shame pursued

 lviii
 orlando to the rabble cried "untie
 the cavalier unless you would be slain"
  "who deals such mighty blows"  one made reply
 that would be thought the truest of the train
 "were he of fire who makes such bold defy
 we wax or straw too haughty were the strain"
 and charged with that the paladin of france
 orlando at the losel couched his lance

 lix
 the shining armour which the chief had rent
 from young zerbino but the night before
 and clothed himself withal poor succour lent
 against orlando in that combat sore
 against the churl's right cheek the weapon went
 it failed indeed his tempered helm to bore
 but such a shock he suffered in the strife
 as broke his neck and stretched him void of life

 lx
 all at one course of other of the band
 with lance unmoved he pierced the bosom through
 left it on durindana laid his hand
 and broke into the thicket of the crew
 one head in twain he severed with the brand
 while from the shoulders lopt another flew
 of many pierced the throat and in a breath
 above a hundred broke and put to death

 lxi
 above a third he killed and chased the rest
 and smote and pierced and cleft as he pursued
 himself of helm or shield one dispossest
 one with spontoon or bill the champaign strewed
 this one along the road across it prest
 a fourth this squats in cavern or in wood
 orlando without pity on that day
 lets none escape whom he has power to slay

 lxii
 of a hundred men and twenty in that crew
 so turpin sums them eighty died at least
 thither orlando finally withdrew
 where with a heart sore trembling in his breast
 zerbino sat how he at roland's view
 rejoiced in verse can hardly be exprest
 who but that he was on the hackney bound
 would at his feet have cast himself to ground

 lxiii
 while roland after he had loosed the knight
 helped him to don his shining arms again
 stript from those serjeants' captain who had dight
 himself with the good harness to his pain
 the prince on isabella turned his sight
 who had halted on the hill above the plain
 and after she perceived the strife was o'er
 nearer the field of fight her beauties bore

 lxiv
 when young zerbino at his side surveyed
 the lady who by him was held so dear
 the beauteous lady whom false tongue had said
 was drowned so often wept with many a tear
 as if ice at his heartcore had been laid
 waxed cold and some deal shook the cavalier
 but the chill quickly past and he instead
 was flushed with amorous fire from foot to head

 lxv
 from quickly clipping her in his embrace
 him reverence for anglantes' sovereign stayed
 because he thought and held for certain case
 that roland was a lover of the maid
 so past from pain to pain and little space
 endured the joy which he at first assayed
 and worse he bore she should another's be
 than hearing that the maid was drowned at sea

 lxvi
 and worse he grieved that she was with a knight
 to whom he owed so much because to wrest
 the lady from his hand was neither right
 nor yet perhaps would prove an easy quest
 he without quarrel had no other wight
 suffered to part of such a prize possest
 but would endure orlando such his debt
 a foot upon his prostrate neck should set

 lxvii
 the three in silence journey to a font
 where they alight and halt beside the well
 his helmet here undid the weary count
 and made the prince too quit the iron shell
 the youth unhelmed she sees her lover's front
 and pale with sudden joy grows isabel
 then changing brightened like a humid flower
 when the warm sun succeeds to drenching shower

 lxviii
 and without more delay or scruple prest
 to cast her arms about her lover dear
 and not a word could drawforth from her breast
 but bathed his neck and face with briny tear
 orlando who remarked the love exprest
 needing no more to make the matter clear
 could not but by these certain tokens see
 the could no other but zerbino be

 lxix
 when speech returned ere yet the maiden well
 had dried her cheeks from the descending tear
 she only of the courtesy could tell
 late shown her by anglantes' cavalier
 the prince who in one scale weighed isabel
 together with his life esteemed as dear 
 fell at orlando's feet and him adored
 as to two lives at once by him restored

 lxx
 proffers and thanks had followed with a round
 of courtesies between the warlike pair
 had they not heard the covered paths resound
 which overgrown with gloomy foliage were
 upon their heads the helmet late unbound
 they quickly place and to their steeds repair
 and lo a knight and maid arrive ere well
 the cavaliers are seated in the sell

 lxxi
 this was the tartar mandricardo who
 in haste behind the paladin had sped
 to venge alzirdo and manilard the two
 whom good orlando's valour had laid dead
 though afterwards less eager to pursue
 since he with him fair doralice had led
 whom from a hundred men in plate and chain
 he with a single staff of oak had ta'en

 lxxii
 yet knew not that it was anglantes' peer
 this while of whom he had pursued the beat
 though that he was a puissant cavalier
 by certain signals was he taught to weet
 more than zerbino him he eyed and near
 perused the paladin from head to feet
 then finding all the tokens coincide
 "thou art the man i seek" the paynim cried

 lxxiii
 " 'tis now ten days" to him the tartar said
 "that thee i still have followed so the fame
 had stung me and in me such longing bred
 which of thee to our camp of paris came
 when amid thousands by thy hand laid dead
 scarce one alive fled thither to proclaim
 the mighty havoc made by thy good hand
 'mid tremisena's and noritia's band

 lxxiv
 "i was not as i knew in following slow
 both to behold thee and to prove thy might
 and by the surcoat o'er thine arms i know
 instructed of thy vest thou art the knight
 and if such cognizance thou didst not show
 and 'mid a hundred wert concealed from sight
 for what thou art thou plainly wouldst appear
 thy worth conspicuous in thy haughty cheer"

 lxxv
 "no one can say" to him orlando cried
 "but that a valiant cavalier thou art
 for such a brave desire can ill reside
 'tis my assurance in a humble heart
 since thou wouldst see me would that thou inside
 couldst as without behold me i apart
 will lay me helm that in all points thy will
 and purpose of thy quest i may fulfil

 lxxvi
 "but when thou well hast scanned me with thine eye
 to that thine other wish as well attend
 it yet remains for thee to satisfy
 the want which leads thee after me to wend
 that thou mayest mark if in my valour i
 agree with that bold cheer thou so commend"
  "and now" exclaimed the tartar "for the rest
 for my first want is thoroughly redrest"

 lxxvii
 orlando all this while from head to feet
 searches the paynim with inquiring eyes
 both sides and next the pommel of his seat
 surveys yet neither mace nor tuck espies
 and asks how he the combat will repeat
 if his good lance at the encounter flies
  "take thou no care for that" replied the peer
 "thus into many have i stricken fear

 lxxviii
 "i have an oath in heaven to gird no blade
 till durindana from the count be won
 pursuing whom i through each road here strayed
 with him to reckon for more posts than one
 if thou wilt please to hear my oath i made
 when on my head i placed this morion
 which casque with all the other arms i bear
 a thousand years ago great hector's were

 lxxix
 "to these good arms nought lacks beside the sword
 how it was stolen to you i cannot say
 this now it seems is borne by brava's lord
 and hence is he so daring in affray
 yet well i trust if i the warrior board
 to make him render his illgotten prey
 yet more i seek the champion with desire
 to avenge the famous agrican my sire

 lxxx
 "him this orlando slew by treachery
 i wot nor could have slain in other wise"
 the count could bear no more and " 'tis a lie"
 exclaims "and whosoever says so lies
 him fairly did i slay orlando i
 but what thou seekest fortune here supplies
 and this the faulchion is which thou has sought
 which shall be thine if by thy valour bought

 lxxxi
 "although mine is the faulchion rightfully
 let us for it in courtesy contend
 nor will i in this battle that it be
 more mine than thine but to a tree suspend
 bear off the weapon freely hence if me
 thou kill or conquer" as he made an end
 he durindana from his belt unslung
 and in midfield upon a sapling hung

 lxxxii
 already distant half the range of bow
 is from his opposite each puissant knight
 and pricks against the other nothing slow
 to slack the reins or ply the rowels bright
 already dealt is either mighty blow
 where the helm yields a passage to the sight
 as if of ice the shattered lances fly
 broke in a thousand pieces to the sky

 lxxxiii
 one and the other lance parforce must split
 in that the cavaliers refuse to bend
 the cavaliers who in the saddle sit
 returning with the staff's unbroken end
 the warriors who with steed had ever smit
 now as a pair of hinds in rage contend
 for the mead's boundary or river's right
 armed with two clubs maintain a cruel fight

 lxxxiv
 the truncheons which the valiant champions bear
 fail in the combat and few blows resist
 both rage with mightier fury here and there
 left without other weapon than the fist
 with this the desperate foes engage and where
 the hand can grapple plate and mail untwist
 let none desire to guard himself from wrongs
 a heavier hammer or more holding tongs

 lxxxv
 how can the saracen conclude the fray
 with honour which he haughtily had sought
 'twere forty to waste time in an assay
 where to himself more harm the smiter wrought
 than to the smitten in conclusion they
 closed and the paynim king orlando caught
 and strained against his bosom what jove's son
 did by antaeus thinking to have done

 lxxxvi
 him griped athwart he in impetuous mood
 would now push from him now would closely strain
 and waxed so wroth that in his heat of blood
 the tartar little thought about his rein
 firm in his stirrups selfcollected stood
 roland and watched his vantage to obtain
 he to the other courser's forehead slipt
 his wary hand and thence the bridle stript

 lxxxvii
 the saracen assays with all his might
 to choak and from the sell his foeman tear
 with either knee orlando grasps it tight
 nor can the tartar more him here or there
 but with the straining of the paynim knight
 the girts which hold his saddle broken are
 scarce conscious of his fall orlando lies
 with feet i' the stirrups tightening yet his thighs

 lxxxviii
 as falls a sack of armour with such sound
 tumbled orlando when he prest the plain
 king mandricardo's courser when he found
 his head delivered from the guiding rein
 made off with him unheeding what the ground
 stumbling through woodland or by pathway plain
 hither and tither blinded by his fear
 and bore with him the tartar cavalier

 lxxxix
 the beauteous doralice who sees her guide
 so quit the field  dismayed at his retreat
 and wonted in his succour to confide
 her hackney drives behind his courser fleet
 the paynim rates the charger in his pride
 and smites him oftentimes with hands and feet
 threatening as if he understood his lore
 and where he'd stop the courser chafes him more

 xc
 not looking to his feet by high or low
 the beast of craven kind with headlong force
 three miles in rings had gone and more would go
 but that into a fosse which stopt their course
 not lined with featherbed or quilt below
 tumble reversed the rider and his horse
 on the hard ground was mandricardo thrown
 yet neither spoiled himself nor broke a bone

 xci
 here stopt the horse but him he could not guide
 left without bit his motions to restrain
 brimfull of rage and choler at his side
 the tartar held him grappled by the mane
 "put upon him" to mandricardo cried
 his lady doralice "my hackney's rein
 since for the bridle i have little use
 for gentle is my palfrey reined or loose"

 xcii
 the paynim deems it were discourtesy
 to accept the proffer by the damsel made
 but his through other means a rein will be
 since fortune who his wishes well appaid
 made thitherward the false gabrina flee
 after she young zerbino had betrayed
 who like a shewolf fled which as she hies
 at distance hears the hounds and hunters' cries

 xciii
 she had upon her back the gallant gear
 and the same youthful ornaments and vest
 stript from the illtaught damsel for her jeer
 that in her spoils the beldam might be drest
 and rode the horse that damsel backed whilere
 who was among the choicest and the best
 ere yet aware of her the ancient dame
 on doralice and mandricardo came

 xciv
 stordilane's daughter and the tartar king
 laugh at the vest of youthful show and shape
 upon that ancient woman figuring
 like monkey rather say like grandam ape
 from her the saracen designs to wring
 the rein and does the deed upon the rape
 of the crone's bridle he with angry cry
 threatens and scares her horse and makes him fly

 xcv
 he flies and hurries through the forest gray
 that ancient woman almost dead with fear
 by hill and dale by straight and crooked way
 by fosse and cliff at hazard there and here
 but it imports me not so much to say
 of her that i should leave anglantes' peer
 who from annoyance of a foe released
 the broken saddle at his ease repieced

 xcvi
 he mounts his horse and watches long before
 departing if the foe will reappear
 nor seeing puissant mandricardo more
 at last resolves in search of him to steer
 but as one nurtured well in courtly lore
 from thence departed not the cavalier
 till he with kind salutes in friendly strain
 fair leaves had taken of the loving twain

 xcvii
 at his departure waxed zerbino woe
 and isabella wept for sorrow they
 had wended with him but the count although
 their company was fair and good said nay
 urging for reason nought so ill could show
 in cavalier as when upon his way
 to seek his foeman out to take a friend
 who him with arms might succour or defend

 xcviii
 next if they met the saracen before
 they should encounter him besought them say
 that he orlando would for three days more
 waiting him in that territory stay
 but after that would seek the flags which bore
 the golden lilies and king charles' array
 that mandricardo through their means might know
 if such his pleasure where to find his foe

 xcix
 the lovers promised willingly to do
 this and whatever else he should command
 by different ways the cavaliers withdrew
 one on the right and one on the left hand
 the count ere other path he would pursue
 took from the sapling and replaced his brand
 and where he weened he might the paynim best
 encounter thitherward his steed addrest

 c
 the course in pathless woods which without rein
 the tartar's charger had pursued astray
 made roland for two days with fruitless pain
 follow him without tidings of his way
 orlando reached a rill of crystal vein
 on either bank of which a meadow lay
 which stained with native hues and rich he sees
 and dotted o'er with fair and many trees

 ci
 the midday fervour made the shelter sweet
 to hardy herd as well as naked swain
 so that orlando well beneath the heat
 some deal might wince opprest with plate and chain
 he entered for repose the cool retreat
 and found it the abode of grief and pain
 and place of sojourn more accursed and fell
 on that unhappy day than tongue can tell

 cii
 turning him round he there on many a tree
 beheld engraved upon the woody shore
 what as the writing of his deity
 he knew as soon as he had marked the lore
 this was a place of those described by me
 whither ofttimes attended by medore
 from the near shepherd's cot had wont to stray
 the beauteous lady sovereign of catay

 ciii
 in a hundred knots amid those green abodes
 in a hundred parts their cyphered names are dight
 whose many letters are so many goads
 which love has in his bleeding hearcore pight
 he would discredit in a thousand modes
 that which he credits in his own despite
 and would parforce persuade himself that rhind
 other angelica than his had signed

 civ
 "and yet i know these characters" he cried
 "of which i have so many read and seen
 by her may this medoro be belied
 and me she figured in the name may mean"
 feeding on such like phantasies beside
 the real truth did sad orlando lean
 upon the empty hope though ill contented
 which he by selfillusions had fomented

 cv
 but stirred and aye rekindled it the more
 that he to quench the ill suspicion wrought
 like the incautious bird by fowler's lore
 hampered in net or line which in the thought
 to free its tangled pinions and to soar
 by struggling is but more securely caught
 orlando passes thither where a mountain
 o'erhangs in guise of arch the crystal fountain

 cvi
 splayfooted ivy with its mantling spray
 and gadding vine the cavern's entry case
 where often in the hottest noon of day
 the pair had rested locked in fond embrace
 within the grotto and without it they
 had oftener than in any other place
 with charcoal or with chalk their names pourtrayed
 or flourished with the knife's indenting blade

 cvii
 here from his horse the sorrowing county lit
 and at the entrance of the grot surveyed
 a cloud of words which seemed but newly writ
 and which the young medoro's hand had made
 on the great pleasure he had known in it
 the sentence he in verses had arrayed
 which in his tongue i deem might make pretence
 to polished phrase and such in ours the sense

 cviii
 "gay plants green herbage rill of limpid vein
 and grateful with cool shade thou gloomy cave
 where oft by many wooed with fruitless pain
 beauteous angelica the child of grave
 king galaphron within my arms has lain
 for the convenient harbourage you gave
 i poor medoro can but in my lays
 as recompence for ever sing your praise

 cix
 "and any loving lord devoutly pray
 damsel and cavalier and every one
 whom choice or fortune hither shall convey
 stranger or native  to this crystal run
 shade caverned rock and grass and plants to say
 benignant be to you the fostering sun
 and moon and may the choir of nymphs provide
 that never swain his flock may hither guide"

 cx
 in arabic was writ the blessing said
 known to orlando like the latin tongue
 who versed in many languages best read
 was in this speech which oftentimes from wrong
 and injury and shame had saved his head
 what time he roved the saracens among
 but let him boast not of its former boot
 o'erbalanced by the present bitter fruit

 cxi
 three times and four and six the lines imprest
 upon the stone that wretch perused in vain
 seeking another sense than was exprest
 and ever saw the thing more clear and plain
 and all the while within his troubled breast
 he felt an icy hand his heartcore strain
 with mind and eyes close fastened on the block
 at length he stood not differing from the rock

 cxii
 then wellnigh lost all feeling so a prey
 wholly was he to that o'ermastering woe
 this is a pang believe the experienced say
 of him who speaks which does all griefs outgo
 his pride had from his forehead passed away
 his chin had fallen upon his breast below
 nor found he so grief barred each natural vent
 moisture for tears or utterance for lament

 cxiii
 stiffed within the impetuous sorrow stays
 which would too quickly issue so to abide
 water is seen imprisoned in the vase
 whose neck is narrow and whose swell is wide
 what time when one turns up the inverted base
 towards the mouth so hastes the hurrying tide
 and in the streight encounters such a stop
 it scarcely works a passage drop by drop

 cxiv
 he somewhat to himself returned and thought
 how possibly the thing might be untrue
 the some one so he hoped desired and sought
 to think his lady would with shame pursue
 or with such weight of jealously had wrought
 to whelm his reason as should him undo
 and that he whosoe'er the thing had planned
 had counterfeited passing well her hand

 cxv
 with such vain hope he sought himself to cheat
 and manned some deal his spirits and awoke
 then prest the faithful brigliadoro's seat
 as on the sun's retreat his sister broke
 nor far the warrior had pursued his beat
 ere eddying from a roof he saw the smoke
 heard noise of dog and kine a farm espied
 and thitherward in quest of lodging hied

 cxvi
 languid he lit and left his brigliador
 to a discreet attendant one undrest
 his limbs one doffed the golden spurs he wore
 and one bore off to clean his iron vest
 this was the homestead where the young medore
 lay wounded and was here supremely blest
 orlando here with other food unfed
 having supt full of sorrow sought his bed

 cxvii
 the more the wretched sufferer seeks for ease
 he finds but so much more distress and pain
 who every where the loathed handwriting sees
 on wall and door and window he would fain
 question his host of this but holds his peace
 because in sooth he dreads too clear too plain
 to make the thing and this would rather shrowd
 that it may less offend him with a cloud

 cxviii
 little availed the count his selfdeceit
 for there was one who spake of it unsought
 the sheperdswain who to allay the heat
 with which he saw his guest so troubled thought
 the tale which he was wonted to repeat
  of the two lovers  to each listener taught
 a history which many loved to hear
 he now without reserve 'gan tell the peer

 cxix
 how at angelica's persuasive prayer
 he to his farm had carried young medore
 grievously wounded with an arrow where
 in little space she healed the angry sore
 but while she exercised this pious care
 love in her heart the lady wounded more
 and kindled from small spark so fierce a fire
 she burnt all over restless with desire

 cxx
 nor thinking she of mightiest king was born
 who ruled in the east nor of her heritage
 forced by too puissant love had thought no scorn
 to be the consort of a poor footpage
  his story done to them in proof was borne
 the gem which in reward for harbourage
 to her extended in that kind abode
 angelica at parting had bestowed

 cxxi
 a deadly axe was this unhappy close
 which at a single stroke lopt off the head
 when satiate with innumerable blows
 that cruel hangman love his hate had fed
 orlando studied to conceal his woes
 and yet the mischief gathered force and spread
 and would break out parforce in tears and sighs
 would he or would be not from mouth and eyes

 cxxii
 when he can give the rein to raging woe
 alone by other's presence unreprest
 from his full eyes the tears descending flow
 in a wide stream and flood his troubled breast
 'mid sob and groan he tosses to and fro
 about his weary bed in search of rest
 and vainly shifting harder than a rock
 and sharper than a nettle found its flock

 cxxiii
 amid the pressure of such cruel pain
 it past into the wretched sufferer's head
 that oft the ungrateful lady must have lain
 together with her leman on that bed
 nor less he loathed the couch in his disdain
 nor from the down upstarted with less dread
 than churl who when about to close his eyes
 springs from the turf if he a serpent spies

 cxxiv
 in him forthwith such deadly hatred breed
 that bed that house that swain he will not stay
 till the morn break or till the dawn succeed
 whose twilight goes before approaching day
 in haste orlando takes his arms and steed
 and to the deepest greenwood wends his way
 and when assured that he is there alone
 gives utterance to his grief in shriek and groan

 cxxv
 never from tears never from sorrowing
 he paused nor found he peace by night and day
 he fled from town in forest harbouring
 and in the open air on hard earth lay
 he marvelled at himself how such a spring
 of water from his eyes could stream away
 and breath was for so many sobs supplied
 and thus ofttimes amid his mourning cried

 cxxvi
 "these are no longer real tears which rise
 and which i scatter from so full a vein
 of tears my ceaseless sorrow lacked supplies
 they stopt when to midheight scarce rose my pain
 the vital moisture rushing to my eyes
 driven by the fire within me now would gain
 a vent and it is this which i expend
 and which my sorrows and my life will end

 cxxvii
 "no these which are the index of my woes
 these are not sighs nor sighs are such they fail
 at times and have their season of repose
 i feel my breast can never less exhale
 its sorrow love who with his pinions blows
 the fire about my heart creates this gale
 love by what miracle does thou contrive
 it wastes not in the fire thou keep'st alive

 cxxviii
 "i am not  am not what i seem to sight
 what roland was is dead and under ground
 slain by that most ungrateful lady's spite
 whose faithlessness inflicted such a wound
 divided from the flesh i am his sprite
 which in this hell tormented walks its round
 to be but in its shadow left above
 a warning to all such as thrust in love"

 cxxix
 all night about the forest roved the count
 and at the break of daily light was brought
 by his unhappy fortune to the fount
 where his inscription young medoro wrought
 to see his wrongs inscribed upon that mount
 inflamed his fury so in him was nought
 but turned to hatred phrensy rage and spite
 nor paused he more but bared his faulchion bright

 cxxx
 cleft through the writing and the solid block
 into the sky in tiny fragments sped
 wo worth each sapling and the caverned rock
 where medore and angelica were read
 so scathed that they to shepherd or to flock
 thenceforth shall never furnish shade or bed
 and that sweet fountain late so clear and pure
 from such tempestuous wrath was ill secure

 cxxxi
 for he turf stone and trunk and shoot and lop
 cast without cease into the beauteous source
 till turbid from the bottom to the top
 never again was clear the troubled course
 at length for lack of breath compelled to stop
 when he is bathed in sweat and wasted force
 serves not his fury more he falls and lies
 upon the mead and gazing upward sighs

 cxxxii
 wearied and woebegone he fell to ground
 and turned his eyes toward heaven nor spake he aught
 nor ate nor slept till in his daily round
 the golden sun had broken thrice and sought
 his rest anew nor ever ceased his wound
 to rankle till it marred his sober thought
 at length impelled by phrensy the fourth day
 he from his limbs tore plate and mail away

 cxxxiii
 here was his helmet there his shield bestowed
 his arms far off and farther than the rest
 his cuirass through the greenwood wide was strowed
 all his good gear in fine and next his vest
 he rent and in his fury naked showed
 his shaggy paunch and all his back and breast
 and 'gan that phrensy act so passing dread
 of stranger folly never shall be said

 cxxxiv
 so fierce his rage so fierce his fury grew
 that all obscured remained the warrior's sprite
 nor for forgetfulness his sword he drew
 or wonderous deeds i trow had wrought the knight
 but neither this nor bill nor axe to hew
 was needed by orlando's peerless might
 he of his prowess gave high proofs and full
 who a tall pine uprooted at a pull

 cxxxv
 he many others with as little let
 as fennel wallwortstem or dill uptore
 and ilex knotted oak and fir upset
 and beech and mountainash and elmtree hoar
 he did what fowler ere he spreads his net
 does to prepare the champaigne for his lore
 by stubble rush and nettlestalk and broke
 like these old sturdy trees and stems of oak

 cxxxvi
 the shepherd swains who hear the tumult nigh
 leaving their flocks beneath the greenwood tree
 some here some there across the forest hie
 and hurry thither all the cause to see
  but i have reached such point my history
 if i o'erpass this bound may irksome be
 and i my story will delay to end
 rather than by my tediousness offend


 canto 24

 argument
 odorico's and gabrina's guilt repaid
 youthful zerbino sets at large the train
 he in defence of good orlando's blade
 is afterwards by mandricardo slain
 isabel weeps by rodomont is made
 war on the tartar king and truce again
 to succour agramant and his array
 who to the lilies are wellnigh a prey


 i
 let him make haste his feet to disengage
 nor lime his wings whom love has made a prize
 for love in fine is nought but phrensied rage
 by universal suffrage of the wise
 and albeit some may show themselves more sage
 than roland they but sin in other guise
 for what proves folly more than on this shelf
 thus for another to destroy oneself

 ii
 various are love's effects but from one source
 all issue though they lead a different way
 he is as 'twere a forest where parforce
 who enter its recess go astray
 and here and there pursue their devious course
 in sum to you i for conclusion say
 he who grows old in love besides all pain
 which waits such passion well deserves a chain

 iii
 one here may well reproach me "brother thou
 seest not thy faults while thou dost others fit"
  i answer that i see mine plain enow
 in this my lucid interval of wit
 and strive and hope withal i shall forego
 this dance of folly but yet cannot quit
 as quickly as i would the faults i own
 for my disease has reached the very bone

 iv
 i in the other canto said before
 orlando furious and insensate wight
 having torn off the arms and vest he wore
 and cast away from him his faulchion bright
 and uptorn trees and made the forest hoar
 and hollow cave resound and rocky height
 towards the noise some shepherds on that side
 their heavy sins or evil planets guide

 v
 viewing the madman's wonderous feats more near
 the frighted band of rustics turned and fled
 but they in their disorder knew not where
 as happens oftentimes in sudden dread
 the madman in a thought is in their rear
 seizes a shepherd and plucks off his head
 and this as easily as one might take
 apple from tree or blossom from the brake

 vi
 he by one leg the heavy trunk in air
 upheaved and made a mace the rest to bray
 astounded upon earth he stretched one pair
 who haply may awake at the last day
 the rest who well awake at the last day
 the rest who well advised and nimble are
 at once desert the field and scour away
 nor had the madman their pursuit deferred
 had he not turned already on their herd

 vii
 by such examples warned the rustic crew
 abandoned in the fields pick scythe and plough
 and to the roof of house and temple flew
 for ill secure was elm or willow's bough
 from hence the maniac's horrid rage they view
 who dealing kick and bite and scratch and blow
 horses and oxen slew his helpless prey
 and well the courser ran who 'scaped that day

 viii
 already might'st thou hear how loudly ring
 the hubbub and the din from neighbouring farms
 outcry and horn and rustic trumpeting
 and faster sound of bells with various arms
 by thousands with spontoon bow spit and sling
 lo from the hills the rough militia swarms
 as many peasants from the vale below
 to make rude war upon the madman go

 ix
 as beats the wave upon the saltsea shore
 sportive at first which southern wind has stirred
 when the next bigger than what went before
 and bigger than the second breaks the third
 and the vext water waxes evermore
 and louder on the beach the surf is heard
 the crowd increasing so the count assail
 and drop from mountain and ascend from dale

 x
 twice he ten peasants slaughtered in his mood
 who charging him in disarray were slain
 and this experiment right clearly showed
 to stand aloof was safest for the train
 was none who from his body could draw blood
 for iron smote the impassive skin in vain
 so had heaven's king preserved the count from scathe
 to make him guardian of his holy faith

 xi
 he would have been in peril on that day
 had he been made of vulnerable mould
 and might have learned was 'twas to cast away
 his sword and weaponless so play the bold
 the rustic troop retreated from the fray
 seeing no stroke upon the madman told
 since him no other enemy attends
 orlando to a neighbouring township wends

 xii
 since every one had left the place for dread
 no wight he found within it small or great
 but here was homely food in plenty spread
 victual well sorting with the pastoral state
 here acorns undistinguishing from bread
 by tedious fast and fury driven to sate
 his hunger he employed his hand and jaw
 on what he first discovered cooked or raw

 xiii
 thence repossest with the desire to rove
 he through the land did man and beast pursue
 and scowering in his phrensy wood and grove
 took sometimes goat or doe of dappled hue
 often with bear and with wild boar he strove
 and with his naked hand the brutes o'erthrew
 and gorging oftentimes the savage fare
 swallowed the prey with all its skin and hair

 xiv
 now right now left he wandered far and wide
 throughout all france and reached a bridge one day
 beneath which ran an ample water's tide
 of steep and broken banks a turret gray
 was builded by the spacious river's side
 discerned from far and near and every way
 what here he did i shall relate elsewhere
 who first must make the scottish prince my care

 xv
 when roland had departed on his quest
 zerbino paused some deal then in his rear
 slowly his steed by the same path addrest
 which had been taken by anglantes' peer
 nor two miles on his way i think had prest
 when he beheld a captive cavalier
 upon a sorry little hackney tied
 and by armed horseman watched on either side

 xvi
 zerbino speedily the prisoner knew
 and isabel as soon when nigh surveyed
 this was sir odoric the biscayan who
 like wolf the guardian of a lamb was made
 to whom of all his friends esteemed most true
 zerbino isabella had conveyed
 hoping one hitherto by him found just
 would now as ever have approved his trust

 xvii
 even then how all had chanced with punctual lore
 was isabel relating to the knight
 how in the pinnace she was saved before
 the broken vessel sank at sea outright
 odoric's assault and next how bandits bore
 her to the cavern in a mountain dight
 nor isabella yet her tale has told
 when bound the malefactor they behold

 xviii
 the two that had sir odoric in their ward
 the royal damsel isabella knew
 and deemed he was her lover and her lord
 that pricked beside the lady fair of hue
 more that the bearings on his shield record
 the honours of the stem from which he grew
 and found as better they observed his cheer
 they had judged rightly of the cavalier

 xix
 lighting with open arms and hurried pace
 they make towards zerbino eagerly
 and kneeling with bare head the prince embrace
 where lord is clipt by one of less degree
 zerbino looking either in the face
 knows one corebo of biscay to be
 and sir almonio his comate the pair
 charged under odoric with the galley's care

 xx
 almonio cried "since god is pleased in the end
 grammercy isabel should be with you
 my lord i very clearly comprehend
 i should deliver tidings nothing new
 if i should now inform you why i wend
 with this offender whom with me you view
 since she who at his hands has suffered worst
 the story of his crimes will have rehearsed

 xxi
 "how me that traitour duped thou hast not to learn
 what time he rid himself of me nor how
 corebo who would have avenged the scorn
 intended to the damsel was laid low
 but that which followed upon my return
 by her unseen or heard she cannot know
 so as to thee the story to have told
 the sequel of it then will i unfold

 xxii
 "i seaward from the city with a store
 of nags collected in a hurry fare
 aye watchful if the trace i can explore
 of those left far behind me i repair
 thitherward i arrive upon the shore
 the place where they were left look everywhere
 nor sign of them perceive upon that strand
 except some steps newprinted on the sand

 xxiii
 "the steps i traced into the forest drear
 nor far within the greenwood had i wound
 when guided by a noise which smote my ear
 i saw my comrade bleeding on the ground
 of isabel i asked the cavalier
 of odoric and what hand had dealt his wound
 and thence departed when the thing i knew
 seeking the wretch these precipices through

 xxiv
 "wide circling still i go and through that day
 i find no other sign of him that fled
 at length return to where corebo lay
 who had the ground about him dyed so red
 that he had i made little more delay
 a grave would have required and more than bed
 and succour of the leech to make him sound
 craved priest and friar to lay him in the ground

 xxv
 "i had him to the neighbouring city brought
 and boarded with a friendly host and there
 corebo's cure in little time was wrought
 beneath an old chirurgeon's skilful care
 this finished having arms and horses brought
 we thence together to the court repair
 of king alphonso of biscay where i
 find out the traitor and to fight defy

 xxvi
 "the monarch's justice who fair field and free
 allowed us for the duel and my right
 and destiny to boot for destiny
 oftener makes conquest where she listeth light
 so backed my arms that felon was by me
 worsted and made a prisoner in the fight
 alphonso having heard his guilt confessed
 bade me dispose of him as liked me best

 xxvii
 "him would i neither loose nor yet have slain
 but as thou seest in bonds to thee convey
 that whether he should be condemned to pain
 or death it should be thine his doom to say
 i hearing thou wert with king charlemagne
 thither in hope to find thee took my way
 i thank my god that thee upon this ground
 where i least hoped to meet thee i have found

 xxviii
 "as well i render thanks that isabel
 i see restored to thee i know not how
 of whom by reason of that traitor fell
 i deemed thou never more should'st tidings know"
 in silence prince zerbino hears him tell
 his story gazing upon odoric's brow
 in pity more than hate as he perpends
 how foully such a goodly friendship ends

 xxix
 after almonio had his tale suspended
 astounded for a while the prince stood by
 wondering that he who least should have offended
 had him requited with such treachery
 but his long fit of admiration ended
 waking from his amazement with a sigh
 questioned the prisoner in the horsemen's hold
 it that was true the cavalier had told

 xxx
 the faithless man alighted and down fell
 upon his bended knees and answered "sir
 all people that on middle earth do dwell
 through weakness of their nature sin and err
 one thing alone distinguishes the well
 and evil doer this at every stir
 of least desire submits without a blow
 that arms but yields as well to stronger foe

 xxxi
 "had i been charged some castle to maintain
 and without contest on the first assault
 hoisted the banners of the hostile train
  for cowardice or treason fouler fault 
 upon my eyes a well deserved pain
 thou might'st have justly closed the darksome vault
 but yielding to superior force i read
 i should not merit blame but praise and meed

 xxxii
 "the stronger is the enemy the more
 easily is the vanquished side excused
 i could but faith maintain as girded sore
 the leaguered fort to keep her faith is used
 even so with all the sense with all the lore
 by sovereign wisdom into me infused
 this i essayed to keep but in the end
 to o'ermastering assault was forced to bend"

 xxxiii
 so said sir odoric and after showed
 though 'twere too tedious to recount his suit
 him no light cause had stirred but puissant goad
  if ever earnestness of prayer could boot
 to melt a heart that with resentment glowed
  if e'er humility produced good fruit
 it well might here avail since all that best
 moves a hard heart sir odoric now exprest

 xxxiv
 whether or no to venge such infamy
 youthful zerbino doubted the review
 of faithless odorico's treachery
 moved him to death the felon to pursue
 the recollection of the amity
 so long maintained between them with the dew
 of pity cooled the fury in his mind
 and him to mercy towards the wretch inclined

 xxxv
 while scotland's prince is doubting in such wise
 to keep him captive or to loose his chain
 or to remove him from before his eyes
 by dooming him to die or live in pain
 loud neighing thitherward the palfrey hies
 from which the tartar king had stript the rein
 and the old harridan who had before
 nigh caused zerbino's death among them bore

 xxxvi
 the horse that had the others of that band
 heard at a distance thither her conveyed
 sore weeping came the old woman and demand
 for succour in her trouble vainly made
 zerbino when he saw her raised his hand
 to heaven that had to him such grace displayed
 giving him to decide that couple's fate
 the only two that had deserved his hate

 xxxvii
 the wicked hag is kept so bids the peer
 until he is determined what to do
 he to cut off her nose and either ear
 now thought and her as an example shew
 next 'twere far better deemed the cavalier
 if to the vultures he her carcase threw
 he diverse punishments awhile revolved
 and thus the warrior finally resolved

 xxxviii
 he to his comrades turned him round and said
 "to let the traitour live i am content
 who if full grace he has not merited
 yet merits not to be so foully shent
 i as i find his fault of love was bred
 to give him life and liberty consent
 and easily we all excuses own
 when on commanding love the blame is thrown

 xxxix
 "often has love turned upside down a brain
 of sounder wit than that to him assigned
 and led to mischief of far deeper stain
 than has so outraged us let odoric find
 pardon his offences i the pain
 of these should justly suffer who was blind
 blind when i gave him such a trust nor saw
 how easily the fire consumes the straw"

 xl
 "then gazing upon odoric 'gan say
 "this is the penance i enjoin to thee
 that thou a year shalt with the beldam stay
 nor ever leave this while her company
 but roving or at rest by night or day
 shalt never for an hour without her be
 and her shall even unto death maintain
 against whoever threatens her with pain

 xli
 "i will if so this woman shall command
 with whosoe'er he be thou battle do
 i will this while that thou all france's land
 from city shalt to city wander through"
 so says he for as odoric at his hand
 well merits death for his foul trespass due
 this is a pitfall for his feet to shape
 which it will be rare fortune if he 'scape

 xlii
 so many women many men betrayed
 and wronged by her have been so many more
 not without strife by knight shall he be stayed
 who was beneath his care the beldam hoar
 so for their crimes shall both alike be paid
 she for her evil actions done before
 and he who wrongfully shall her defraud
 nor far can go before he finds an end

 xliii
 to keep the pact zerbino makes him swear
 a mighty oath under this penalty
 that should he break his faith and anywhere
 into his presence led by fortune be
 without more mercy without time for prayer
 a cruel death shall wait him as his fee
 next by his comrades so their lord commands
 sir odoric is unpinioned from his bands

 xliv
 corebo frees the traitor in the end
 almonio yielding yet as ill content
 for much zerbino's mercies both offend
 which thus their so desired revenge prevent
 thence he disloyal to his prince and friend
 in company with that curst woman went
 what these befel sir turpin has not said
 but more i once in other author read

 xlv
 this author vouches i declare not who
 that hence they had not one day's journey wended
 when odoric to all pact all faith untrue
 for riddance of the pest to him commended
 about gabrina's neck a halter threw
 and left her to a neighbouring elm suspended
 and in a year the place he does not name
 almonio by the traitor did the same

 xlvi
 zerbino who the paladin pursues
 and loath would be to lose the cavalier
 to his scottish squadron of himself sends news
 which for its captain well might stand in fear
 almonio sends and many matters shews
 too long at full to be recited here
 almonio sends corebo next nor stayed
 other with him besides the royal maid

 xlvii
 so mighty is the love zerbino bore
 nor less than his the love which isabel
 nursed for the valorous paladin so sore
 he longed to know if that bold infidel
 the count had found who in the duel tore
 him from his horse together with the sell
 that he to charles's camp till the third day
 be ended will not measure back his way

 xlviii
 this was the term for which orlando said
 he should wait him who yet no faulchion wears
 nor is there place the count has visited
 but thither in his search zerbino fares
 last to those trees upon whose bark was read
 the ungrateful lady's writing he repairs
 little beside the road and there finds all
 in strange disorder rock and waterfall

 xlix
 far off he saw that something shining lay
 and spied orlando's corslet on the ground
 and next his helm but not that headpiece gay
 which whilom african almontes crowned
 he in the thicket heard a courser neigh
 and lifting up his visage at the sound
 saw brigliadoro the green herbage browze
 with rein yet hanging at his saddlebows

 l
 for durindane he sought the greenwood round
 which separate from the scabbard met his view
 and next the surcoat but in tatters found
 that in a hundred rags the champaign strew
 zerbino and isabel in grief profound
 stood looking on nor what to think they knew
 they of all matters else might think besides
 the fury which the wretched count misguides

 li
 had but the lovers seen a drop of blood
 they might have well believed orlando dead
 this while the pair beside the neighbouring flood
 beheld a shepherd coming pale with dread
 he just before as on a rock he stood
 had seen the wretch's fury how he shed
 his arms about the forest tore his clothes
 slew hinds and caused a thousand other woes

 lii
 questioned by good zerbino him the swain
 of all which there had chanced informed aright
 zerbino marvelled and believed with pain
 although the proofs were clear this as it might
 he from his horse dismounted on the plain
 full of compassion in afflicted plight
 and went about collecting from the ground
 the various relics which were scattered round

 liii
 isabel lights as well and where they lie
 dispersed the various arms uniting goes
 lo them a damsel joins who frequent sigh
 heaves from her heart and doleful visage shows
 if any ask me who the dame and why
 she mourns and with such sorrow overflows
 i say 'twas flordelice who bound in trace
 of her lost lover's footsteps sought that place

 liv
 her brandimart had left disconsolate
 without farewell i' the court of charlemagne
 who there expected him six months or eight 
 and lastly since he came not there again
 from sea to sea had sought her absent mate
 through alpine and through pyrenean chain
 in every place had sought the warrior save
 within the palace of atlantes' grave

 lv
 if she had been in that enchanted hold
 she might before have seen the cavalier
 wandering with bradamant rogero bold
 gradasso and ferrau and brava's peer
 but when astolpho chased the wizard old
 with the loud bugle horrible to hear
 to paris he returned but nought of this
 as yet was known to faithful flordelice

 lvi
 to flordelice were known the arms and sword
 who as i say by chance so joined the twain
 and brigliadoro left without his lord
 yet bearing at the saddlebow his rein
 she with her eyes the unhappy signs explored
 and she had heard the tidings of the swain
 who had alike related how he viewed
 orlando running frantic in his mood

 lvii
 here prince zerbino all the arms unites
 and hangs like a fair trophy on a pine
 and to preserve them safe from errant knights
 natives or foreigners in one short line
 upon the sapling's verdant surface writes
 orlando's arms king charles's paladine
 as he would say `let none this harness move
 who cannot with its lord his prowess prove'

 lviii
 zerbino having done the pious deed
 is bowning him to climb his horse when lo
 the tartar king arrives upon the mead
 he at the trophied pinetree's gorgeous show
 beseeches him the cause of this to read
 who lets him as rehearsed the story know
 when without further pause the paynim lord
 hastes gladly to the pine and takes the sword

 lix
 "none can he said the action reprehend
 nor first i make the faulchion mine today
 and to its just possession i pretend
 where'er i find it be it where it may
 orlando this not daring to defend
 has feigned him mad and cast the sword away
 but if the champion so excuse his shame
 this is no cause i should forego my claim

 lx
 "take it not thence" to him zerbino cried
 "nor think to make it thine without a fight
 if so thou tookest hector's arms of pride
 by theft thou hadst them rather than by right"
 without more parley spurred upon each side
 well matched in soul and valour either knight
 already echoed are a thousand blows
 nor yet well entered are the encountering foes

 lxi
 in scaping durindane a flame in show
 he shifts so quickly is the scottish lord
 he leaps about his courser like a doe
 where'er the road best footing does afford
 and well it is that he should not forego
 an inch of vantage who if once that sword
 smite him will join the enamoured ghosts which rove
 amid the mazes of the myrtle grove

 lxii
 as the swiftfooted dog who does espy
 swine severed from his fellows hunts him hard
 and circles round about but he lies by
 till once the restless foe neglect his guard
 so while the sword descends or hangs on high
 zerbino stands attentive how to ward
 how to save life and honour from surprise
 and keeps a wary eye and smites and flies

 lxiii
 on the other side where'er the foe is seen
 to threaten stroke in vain or make good
 he seems an alpine wind two hills between
 that in the month of march shakes leafy wood
 which to the ground now bends the forest green
 now whirls the broken boughs at random strewed
 although the prince wards many in the end
 one mighty stroke he cannot scape or fend

 lxiv
 in the end he cannot scape one downright blow
 which enters between sword and shield his breast
 as perfect was the plate and corslet so
 thick was the steel wherein his paunch was drest
 but the destructive weapon falling low
 equally opened either iron vest
 and cleft whate'er it swept in its descent
 and to the saddlebow through cuirass went

 lxv
 and but that somewhat short the blow descends
 it would zerbino like a cane divide
 but him so little in the quick offends
 this scarce beyond the skin is scarified
 more than a span in length the wound extends
 of little depth of blood a tepid tide
 to his feet descending with a crimson line
 stains the bright arms which on the warrior shine

 lxvi
 'tis so i sometimes have been wont to view
 a hand more white than alabaster part
 the silver cloth with ribbon red of hue
 a hand i often feel divide my heart
 here little vantage young zerbino drew
 from strength and greater daring and from art
 for in the temper of his arms and might
 too much the tartar king excelled the knight

 lxvii
 the fearful stroke was mightier in show
 than in effect by which the prince was prest
 so that poor isabel distraught with woe
 felt her heart severed in her frozen breast
 the scottish prince all over in a glow
 with anger and resentment was possest
 and putting all his strength in either hand
 smote full the tartar's helmet with his brand

 lxviii
 almost on his steed's neck the tartar fell
 bent by the weighty blow zerbino sped
 and had the helmet been unfenced by spell
 the biting faulchion would have cleft his head
 the king without delay avenged him well
 "nor i for you till other season" said
 "will keep this gift" and levelled at his crest
 hoping to part zerbino to the chest

 lxix
 zerbino on the watch whose eager eye
 waits on his wit wheels quickly to the right
 but not withal so quickly as to fly
 the trenchant sword which smote the shield outright
 and cleft from top to bottom equally
 shearing the sleeve beneath it and the knight
 smote on his arm and next the harness rended
 and even to the champion's thigh descended

 lxx
 zerbino here and there seeks every way
 by which to wound nor yet his end obtains
 for while he smites upon that armour gay
 not even a feeble dint the coat retains
 on the other hand the tartar in the fray
 such vantage o'er the scottish prince obtains
 him he has wounded in seven parts or eight
 and reft his shield and half his helmet's plate

 lxxi
 he ever wastes his blood his energies
 fail though he feels it not as 't would appear
 unharmed the vigorous heart new force supplies
 to the weak body of the cavalier
 his lady during this whose crimson dyes
 where chased by dread to doralice drew near
 and for the love of heaven the damsel wooed
 to stop that evil and disastrous feud

 lxxii
 doralice who as courteous was as fair
 and illassured withal how it would end
 willingly granted isabella's prayer
 and straight to truce and peace disposed her friend
 as well zerbino by the other's care
 was brought his vengeful anger to suspend
 and wending where she willed the scottish lord
 left unachieved the adventure of the sword

 lxxiii
 fair flordelice who ill maintained descries
 the goodly sword of the unhappy count
 in secret garden and so laments the prize
 foregone she weeps for rage and smite her front
 she would move brandimart to this emprize
 and should she find him and the fact recount
 weens for short season will the tartar foe
 exulting in the ravished faulchion go

 lxxiv
 seeking him morn and evening but in vain
 flordelice after brandimart did fare
 and widely wandered from him who again
 already had to paris made repair
 so far the damsel pricked by hill and plain
 she reached the passage of a river where
 she saw the wretched count but what befel
 the scottish prince zerbino let me tell

 lxxv
 for to leave durindana such misdeed
 to him appeared it past all other woes
 though he could hardly sit upon his steed
 though mighty loss of lifeblood which yet flows
 now when his anger and his heat secede
 after short interval his anguish grows
 his anguish grows with such impetuous pains
 he feels that life is ebbing from his veins

 lxxvi
 for weakness can the prince no further hie
 and so beside a fount is forced to stay
 him to assist the pitying maid would try
 but knows not what to do not what to say
 for lack of comfort she beholds him die
 since every city is too far away
 where in this need she could resort to leech
 whose succour she might purchase or beseech

 lxxvii
 she blaming fortune and the cruel sky
 can only utter fond complaints and vain
 "why sank i not in ocean was her cry
 when first i reared my sail upon the main"
 zerbino who on her his languid eye
 had fixt as she bemoaned her felt more pain
 than that enduring and strong anguish bred
 through which the suffering youth was wellnigh dead

 lxxviii
 "so be thou pleased my heart" zerbino cried
 "to love me yet when i am dead and gone
 as to abandon thee without a guide
 and not to die distresses me alone
 for did it me in place secure betide
 to end my days this earthly journey done
 i cheerful and content and fully blest
 would die since i should die upon thy breast

 lxxix
 "but since to abandon thee to whom a prize
 i know not my sad fate compels i swear
 my isabella by that mouth those eyes
 by what enchained me first that lovely hair
 my spirit troubled and despairing hies
 into hell's deep and gloomy bottom where
 to think thou wert abandoned so by me
 of all its woes the heaviest pain will be"

 lxxx
 at this the sorrowing isabel declining
 her mournful face which with her tears o'erflows
 towards the sufferer and her mouth conjoining
 to her zerbino's languid as a rose
 rose gathered out of season and which pining
 fades where it on the shadowy hedgerow grows
 exclaims "without me think not so my heart
 on this your last long journey to depart

 lxxxi
 "of this my heart conceive not any fear
 for i will follow thee to heaven or hell
 it fits our souls together quit this sphere
 together go for aye together dwell
 no sooner closed thine eyelids shall appear
 than either me internal grief will quell
 or has it not such power i here protest
 i with this sword today will pierce my breast

 lxxxii
 "i of our bodies cherish hope not light
 that they shall have a happier fate when dead
 together to entomb them may some wight
 haply by pity moved be hither led"
 she the poor remnants of his vital sprite
 went on collecting as these words she said
 and while yet aught remains with mournful lips
 the last faint breath of life devoutly sips

 lxxxiii
 'twas here his feeble voice zerbino manned
 crying "my deity i beg and pray
 by that love witnessed when thy father's land
 thou quittedst for my sake and if i may
 in any thing command thee i command
 that with god's pleasure thou liveout thy day
 nor ever banish from thy memory
 that well as man can love have i loved thee

 lxxxiv
 "god haply will provide thee with good aid
 to free thee from each churlish deed i fear
 as when in the dark cavern thou wast stayed
 he sent to rescue thee anglante's peer
 so he grammercy succoured thee dismaid
 at sea and from the wicked biscayneer
 and if thou must choose death in place of worse
 then only choose it as a lesser curse"

 lxxxv
 i think not these last words of scotland's knight
 were so exprest that he was understood
 with these he finished like a feeble light
 which needs supply of was or other food
  who is there that has power to tell aright
 the gentle isabella's doleful mood
 when stiff her loved zerbino with pale face
 and cold as ice remained in her embrace

 lxxxvi
 on the ensanguined corse in sorrow drowned
 the damsel throws herself in her despair
 and shrieks so lout that wood and plain resound
 for many miles about nor does she spare
 bosom or cheek but still with cruel wound
 one and the other smites the afflicted fair
 and wrongs her curling lock of golden grain
 aye calling on the wellloved youth in vain

 lxxxvii
 she with such rage such fury was possest
 that in her transport she zerbino's glaive
 would easily have turned against her breast
 ill keeping the command her lover gave
 but that a hermit from his neighbouring rest
 accustomed oft to seek the fountainwave
 his flagon at the cooling stream to fill
 opposed him to the damsel's evil will

 lxxxviii
 the reverend father who with natural sense
 abundant goodness happily combined
 and with ensamples fraught and eloquence
 was full of charity towards mankind
 with efficacious reasons her did fence
 and to endurance isabel inclined
 placing from ancient testament and new
 women as in a mirror for her view

 lxxxix
 the holy man next made the damsel see
 that save in god there was no true content
 and proved all other hope was transitory
 fleeting of little worth and quickly spent
 and urged withal so earnestly his plea
 he changed her ill and obstinate intent
 and made her for the rest of life desire
 to live devoted to her heavenly sire

 xc
 not that she would her mighty love forbear
 for her dead lord nor yet his relics slight
 these did she halt or journey every where
 would isabel have with her day and night
 the hermit therefore seconding her care
 who for his age was sound and full of might
 they on his mournful horse zerbino placed
 and traversed many a day that woodland waste

 xci
 the cautious elder would not bear away
 thus all alone with him that damsel bland
 thither where in a cave concealed from day
 his solitary cell hard by did stand
 within himself exclaiming "i convey
 with peril fire and fuel in one hand"
 nor in such bold experiments the sage
 wisely would trust to prudence or to age

 xcii
 he thought to bear her to provence where near
 the city of marseilles a borough stood
 which had a sumptuous monastery here
 of ladies was a holy sisterhood
 and hither to transport the cavalier
 they stowed his body in a chest of wood
 made in a town by the wayside and which
 was long and roomy and well closed with pitch

 xciii
 so compassing a mighty round they fare
 through wildest parts for many and many a day
 because the war extending every where
 they seek to hide themselves as best they may
 at length a cavalier arrests the pair
 that with foul scorn and outrage bars their way
 of whom you more in fitting time shall learn
 but to the tartar king i now return

 xciv
 after the fight between the two was done
 already told by me the king withdrew
 to a cooling shade and river from the sun
 his horse's reins and saddle to undo
 letting the courser at his pleasure run
 browsing the tender grass the pasture through
 but he reposed short time ere he descried
 an errant knight descend the mountain's side

 xcv
 him doralice as soon as he his front
 uplifted knew and showed him to her knight
 saying "behold the haughty rodomont
 unless the distance has deceived my sight
 to combat with thee he descends the mount
 now it behoves thee put forth all thy might
 to lose me his betrothed a mighty cross
 the monarch deems and comes to venge his loss"

 xcvi
 as a good hawk who duck or woodcock shy
 partridge or pigeon or such other prey
 seeing towards her from a distance fly
 raises her head and shows her blithe and gay
 so mandricardo in security
 of crushing rodomont in that affray
 gladly his courser seized bestrode the seat
 reined him and in the stirrups fixt his feet

 xcvii
 when the two hostile warriors were so near
 that words could be exchanged between the twain
 loudly began the monarch of argier
 to threat with head and hand in haughty strain
 that to repentance he will bring the peer
 who lightly for a pleasure rash and vain
 had scrupled not his anger to excite
 who dearly will the offered scorn requite

 xcviii
 when mandricardo "he but vainly tries
 to fright who threatens me  by words unscared
 woman or child or him he terrifies
 witless of warfare not me who regard
 with more delight than rest which others prize
 the stirring battle and who am prepared
 my foeman in the lists or field to meet
 armed or unarmed on horse or on my feet"

 xcix
 they pass to outrage shout and ire unsheath
 the brand and loudly smites each cruel foe
 like winds which scarce at first appear to breathe
 next shake the oak and ashtree as they blow
 then to the skies upwhirl the dusty wreath
 then level forests and lay houses low
 and bear the storm abroad o'er land and main
 by which the flocks in greenwoodholt are slain

 c
 of those two infidels unmatched in worth
 the valiant heart and strength which thus exceed
 to such a warfare and such blows give birth
 as suits with warrior of so bold a seed
 at the loud sound and horrid trembles earth
 when the swords cross and to the stroke succeed
 quick sparks or rather flashing to the sky
 bright flames by thousands and by thousands fly

 ci
 without once gathering breath without repose
 the champions one another still assail
 striving now here now there with deadly blows
 to rive the plate or penetrate the mail
 nor this one gains nor the other ground foregoes
 but as if girded in by fosse or pale
 or as too dearly sold they deem an inch
 ne'er from their close and narrow circle flinch

 cii
 mid thousand blows so with twohanded swing
 on his foe's forehead smote the tartar knight
 he made him see revolving in a ring
 myriads of fiery balls and sparks of light
 the croupe with head reversed the sarzan king
 now smote as if deprived of all his might
 the stirrups lost and in her sight so well
 beloved appeared about to quit the sell

 ciii
 but as steel arbalest that's loaded sore
 by how much is the engine charged and strained
 by lever or by crane with so much more
 fury returns its ancient bent regained
 and in discharging its destructive store
 inflicts worse evil than itself sustained
 so rose that african with ready blade
 and straight with double force the stroke repaid

 civ
 rodomont smites and in the very place
 where he was smit the tartar in return
 but cannot wound the sarzan in the face
 because his trojan arms the weapon turn
 yes so astounds he leaves him not in case
 if it be morn or evening to discern
 rodomont stopt not but in fury sped
 a second blow still aiming at his head

 cv
 king mandricardo's courser who abhorred
 the whistling of the steel which round him flew
 saved with sore mischief to himself his lord
 in that he backed the faulchion to eschew
 aimed at his master not at him the sword
 smote him across the head and cleft it through
 no trojan helm defends the wretched horse
 like mandricardo and he dies parforce

 cvi
 he falls and mandricardo on the plain
 no more astound slides down upon his feet
 and whirls his sword to see his courser slain
 he storms all over fired with angry heat
 at him the sarzan monarch drives amain
 who stands as firm as rock which billows beat
 and so it happened that the courser good
 fell in the charge while fast the footman stood

 cvii
 the african who feels his horse give way
 the stirrups quits and lightly from the sell
 is freed and springs on earth for the assay
 hence matched anew stands either infidel
 worse than before the battle boils while they
 with pride and anger and with hatred swell
 about to close but that with flowing rein
 a messenger arrives to part the twain

 cviii
 a messenger arrives that from the moor
 with many others news through france conveyed
 who word to simple knight and captain bore
 to join the troops beneath their flags arrayed
 for he the emperor who the lilies wore
 siege to their quarters had already laid
 and save quick succour thither was addrest
 he read their army's scathe was manifest

 cix
 the moorish messenger not only knows
 by ensigns and by vest the warlike pair
 but by the circling blades and furious blows
 with which no other hands could wound the air
 hence dared not 'twixt champions interpose
 nor deemed his orders an assurance were
 from such impetuous fury nor the saw
 which says embassadors are safe by law

 cx
 but to fair doralice approached and said
 marsilius agramant and stordilane
 within weak works with scanty troops to aid
 were close beleaguered by the christian train
 and having told his tale the damsel prayed
 that this she to the warriors would explain
 and would accord the pair and to their post
 dispatch for rescue of the moorish host

 cxi
 the lady with bold heart 'twixt either foe
 threw herself and exclaimed "i you command
 by the large love you hear me as i know
 that you to better use reserve the brand
 and that you instantly in succour go
 of our host menaced by the christian band
 which now besieged within its camp attends
 ruin or speedy succour from its friends

 cxii
 the messenger rehearsed when she had done
 fully the peril of the paynim train
 and said that he bore letters to the son
 of ulien from the son of king troyane
 the message ended every grudge foregone
 'twas finally resolved between the twain
 they should conclude a truce and till the day
 the moorish siege was raised their strife delay

 cxiii
 intending when from siege their chivalry
 shall be relieved  the one and the other knight 
 no longer to remain in company
 but bandy cruel war was with fell despite
 until determined by their arms shall be
 to whom the royal dame belongs of right
 and she between whose hands their solemn troth
 they plighted was security for both

 cxiv
 discord at hearing this impatient grew
 with any truce or treaty ill content
 and that such fair agreement should ensue
 pride who was present could as ill consent
 but love was there more puissant than the two
 equalled of none in lofty hardiment
 and launching from his bow his shafts of proof
 with these made pride and discord stand aloof

 cxv
 to keep the truce the rival warriors swore
 since so it pleased her well who either swayed
 one of their coursers lacked for on the moor
 lifeless king mandricardo's had been laid
 hence thither in good time came brigliador
 who feeding by the river's margin strayed
 but here i find me at my canto's end
 so with your licence shall the tale suspend


 canto 25

 argument
 rogero richardetto from the pains
 of fire preserves doomed by marsilius dead
 he to rogero afterwards explains
 fully the cause while he to death was led
 them mournful aldigier next entertains
 and with them the ensuing morning sped
 vivian and malagigi to set free
 to bertolagi sold for hire and fee


 i
 oh mighty springs of war in youthful breast
 impetuous force of love and thirst of praise
 nor yet which most avails is known aright
 for each by turns its opposite outweighs
 within the bosom here of either knight
 honour be sure and duty strongly sways
 for the amorous strife between them is delayed
 till to the moorish camp they furnish aid

 ii
 yet love sways more for save that the command
 was laid upon them by their lady gay
 neither would in that battle sheathe the brand
 till he was crowned with the victorious bay
 and agramant might vainly with his band
 for either knight's expected succour stay
 then love is not of evil nature still
  he can at times do good if often ill

 iii
 'twas now suspending all their hostile rage
 one and the other paynim cavalier
 the moorish host from siege to disengage
 for paris with the gentle lady steer
 and with them goes as well that dwarfish page
 who tracked the footsteps of the tartar peer
 till he had brought the warrior front to front
 in presence with the jealous rodomont

 iv
 they at a mead arrived where in disport
 knights were reposing by a stream one pair
 disarmed another casqued in martial sort
 and with them was a dame of visage fair
 of these in other place i shall report
 not now for first rogero is my care
 that good rogero who as i have shown
 into a well the magic shield had thrown

 v
 he from that well a mile is hardly gone
 ere he a courier sees arrive at speed
 of those dispatched by king troyano's son
 to knights whom he awaited in his need
 from him rogero hears that so foredone
 by charles are those who hold the paynim creed
 they will save quickly succoured in the strife
 as quickly forfeit liberty and life

 vi
 rogero stood awhile in pensive case
 whom many warring thoughts at once opprest
 but neither fitted was the time nor place
 to make his choice or judge what promised best
 the courier he dismist and turned his face
 whither he with the damsel was addrest
 whom aye the child so hurried on her way
 he left her not a moment for delay

 vii
 pursuing thence their ancient road again
 they reached a city with the westering sun
 which in the midst of france from charlemagne
 marsilius had in that long warfare won
 nor them to interrupt or to detain
 at drawbridge or at gate was any one
 though in the fosse and round the palisade
 stood many men and piles of arms were laid

 viii
 because the troop about that fortress see
 accompanying him the wellknown dame
 they to rogero leave the passage free
 nor even question him from whence he came
 reaching the square of evil company
 he finds it full and bright with ruddy flame
 and in the midst is manifest to view
 the youth condemned with face of pallid hue

 ix
 as on the stripling's face he turns his eyes
 which hangs declined and wet with frequent tear
 rogero thinks he bradamant descries
 so much the youth resembles her in cheer
 more sure the more intently he espies
 her face and shape when thus the cavalier
 "or this is bradamant or i no more
 am the rogero which i was before

 x
 "she hath adventured with too daring will
 in rescue of the youth condemned to die
 and for the enterprise had ended ill
 hath there been taken as i see ah why
 was she so hot her purpose to fulfil
 that she must hither unattended hie
  but i thank heaven that hither have i made
 since i am yet in time to lend her aid"

 xi
 he drew his falchion without more delay
 his lance was broken at the other town
 and though the unarmed people making way
 wounding flank paunch and bosom bore them down
 he whirled his weapon and amid the array
 smote some across the gullet cheek or crown
 screaming the dissipated rabble fled
 the most with cloven limbs or broken head

 xii
 as while at feed in full security
 a troop of fowl along the marish wend
 if suddenly a falcon from the sky
 swoop mid the crowd and one surprise and rend
 the rest dispersing leave their mate to die
 and only to their own escape attend
 so scattering hadst thou seen the frighted throng
 when young rogero pricked that crowd among

 xiii
 rogero smites the head from six or four
 who in escaping from the field are slow
 he to the breast divides as many more
 and countless to the eyes and teeth below
 i grant no helmets on their heads they wore
 but there were shining iron caps enow
 and if fine helmets did their temples press
 his sword would cut as deep or little less

 xiv
 such good rogero's force and valour are
 as never nowadays in warrior dwell
 nor yet in rampant lion nor in bear
 nor whether home or foreign beast more fell
 haply with him the earthquake might compare
 or haply the great devil  not he of hell 
 but he who is my lord's who moves in fire
 and parts heaven earth and ocean in his ire

 xv
 at every stroke he never less o'erthrew
 than one and oftener two upon the plain
 and four at once and even five he slew
 so that a hundred in a thought were slain
 the sword rogero from his girdle drew
 as knife cuts curd divides their plate and chain
 falerina in orgagna's garden made
 to deal orlando death that cruel blade

 xvi
 but to have forged that falchion sorely rued
 who saw her garden wasted by the brand
 what wreck what ruin then must have ensued
 from this when wielded by such warrior's hand
 if e'er rogero force e'er fury shewed
 if e'er his mighty valour well was scanned
 'twas here 'twas here employed 'twas here displayed
 in the desire to give his lady aid

 xvii
 as hare from hound unslipt that helpless train
 defends itself against the cavalier
 many lay dead upon the cumbered plain
 and numberless were they who fled in fear
 meanwhile the damsel had unloosed the chain
 from the youth's hands and him in martial gear
 was hastening with what speed she might to deck
 with sword in hand and shield about his neck

 xviii
 he who was angered sore as best he cou'd
 sought to avenge him of that evil crew
 and gave such signal proofs of hardihood
 as stamped him for a warrior good and true
 the sun already in the western flood
 had dipt his gilded wheels what time the two
 valiant rogero and his young compeer
 victorious issued of the city clear

 xix
 when now rogero and the stranger knight
 clear of the citygates the champaigne reach
 the youth repays with praises infinite
 rogero in kind mode and cunning speech
 who him although unknown had sought to right
 at risk of life and prays his name to teach
 that he may know to whom his thanks he owed
 for such a mighty benefit bestowed

 xx
 "the visage of bradamant i see
 the beauteous features and the beauteous cheer"
 rogero said "and yet the suavity
 i of her wellknown accents do not hear
 nor such return of thanks appears to be
 in place towards her faithful cavalier
 and if in very sooth it is the same
 how has the maid so soon forgot my name"

 xxi
 in wary wise intent the truth to find
 rogero said "you have i seen elsewhere
 and have again and yet again divined
 yet know i not nor can remember where
 say it yourself if it returns to mind
 and i beseech your name as well declare
 which i would gladly hear in the desire
 to know whom i have rescued from the fire"

 xxii
 "  me it is possible you may have seen
 i know not when nor where the youth replied
 for i too range the world in armour sheen
 seeking adventure strange on every side
 or haply it a sister may have been
 who to her waist the knightly sword has tied
 born with me at a birth so like to view
 the family discerns not who is who

 xxiii
 "you not first second or even fourth will be
 who have in this their error had to learn
 nor father brother nor even mother me
 from her such our resemblance can discern
 'tis true this hair which short and loose you see
 in many guise and hers with many a turn
 and in long tresses wound about her brow
 wide difference made between us two till now

 xxiv
 "but since the day that wounded by a moor
 in the head a story tedious to recite
 a holy man to heal the damsel's sore
 cut short to the midear her tresses bright
 excepting sex and name there is no more
 one from the other to distinguish hight
 i richardetto am bradamant she
 rinaldo's brother and his sister we

 xxv
 "and to displease you were i not afraid
 you with a wonder would i entertain
 which chanced from my resemblance to the maid
 begun in pleasure finishing in pain"
 he to whom nought more pleasing could be said
 and to whose ears there was no sweeter strain
 that what in some sort on his lady ran
 besought the stripling so that he began

 xxvi
 "it so fell out that as my sister through
 the neighbouring wood pursued her path a wound
 was dealt the damsel by a paynim crew
 which her by chance without a helmet found
 and she was fain to trim the locks which grew
 clustering about the gash to maker her sound
 of that ill cut which in her head she bore
 hence shorn she wandered through the forest hoar

 xxvii
 "ranging she wandered to a shady font
 where worn and troubled she in weary wise
 lit from her courser and disarmed her front
 and couched upon the greenwood closed her eyes
 a tale more pleasing than what i recount
 in story there is none i well surmise
 thither repaired young flordespine of spain
 who in that wood was hunting with her train

 xxviii
 "and when she found my sister in the shade
 covered except her face with martial gear
  in place of spindle furnished with the blade 
 believed that she beheld a cavalier
 the face and manly semblance she surveyed
 till conquered was her heart with courteous cheer
 she wooed the maid to hunt with her and past
 with her alone into that hold at last

 xxix
 "when now she had her fearless of surprise
 safe in a solitary place that dame
 by slow degrees in words and amorous wise
 showed her deepwounded heart with sighs of flame
 breathed from her inmost breast with burning eyes
 she spake her soul sick with desire became
 now pale now red nor longer selfcontrolled
 ravished a kiss she waxed so passing bold

 xxx
 "my sister was assured the huntress maid
 falsely conceited her a man to be
 nor in that need could she afford her aid
 and found herself in sore perplexity
 ` 'tis better that i now dispel she said
 the foolish thought she feeds and that in me
 the damsel should a gentle woman scan
 rather than take me for a craven man'

 xxxi
 "and she said well for cravenhood it were
 befitting man of straw not warrior true
 with whom so bright a lady deigned to pair
 so wonderous sweet and full of nectarous dew
 to clack like a poor cuckow to the fair
 hanging his coward wing when he should woo
 shaping her speech to this in wary mode
 my sister that she was a damsel showed

 xxxii
 "that like camilla and like hyppolite
 sought fame in battlefield and near the sea
 in afric in arzilla saw the light
 to shield and spear enured from infancy
 a spark this quenched not nor yet burned less bright
 the enamoured damsel's kindled phantasy
 too tardy came the salve to ease the smart
 so deep had love already driven his dart

 xxxiii
 "nor yet less fair to her my sister's face
 appeared less fair her ways less fair her guise
 nor yet the heart returned into its place
 which joyed itself within those dearloved eyes
 flordespine deems the damsel's iron case
 to her desire some hope of ease supplies
 and when she thinks she is indeed a maid
 laments and sobs with mighty woe downweighed

 xxxiv
 "he who had marked her sorrow and lament
 that day himself had sorrowed with the fair
 `what pains she said did ever wight torment
 so cruel but that mine more cruel were
 i need not to accomplish my intent
 in other love impure or pure despair
 the rose i well might gather from the thorn
 my longing only is of hope forlorn

 xxxv
 " `it 'twas thy pleasure love to have me shent
 because by glad estate thine anger stirred
 thou with some torture might'st have been content
 on other lovers used but never word
 have i found written of a female bent
 on love of female mid mankind or herd
 woman to woman's beauty still is blind
 nor ewe delights in ewe nor hind in hind

 xxxvi
 " `tis only i on earth in air or sea
 who suffer at thy hands such cruel pain
 and this thou hast ordained that i may be
 the first and last example in thy reign
 foully did ninus' wife and impiously
 for her own son a passion entertain
 loved was pasiphae's bull and myrrha's sire
 but mine is madder than their worst desire

 xxxvii
 " `here female upon male had set her will
 had hope and as i hear was satisfied
 pasiphae the wooden cow did fill
 others in other mode their want supplied
 but had he flown to me  with all his skill
 dan daedalus had not the noose untied
 for one too diligent hath wreathed these strings
 even nature's self the puissantest of things'

 xxxviii
 "so grieves the maid so goads herself and wears
 and shows no haste her sorrowing to forego
 sometimes her face sometimes her tresses tears
 and levels at herself the vengeful blow
 in pity bradamant the sorrow shares
 and is constrained to hear the tale of woe
 she studies to divert with fruitless pain
 the strange and mad desire but speaks in vain

 xxxix
 "she who requires assistance not support
 still more laments herself with grief opprest
 by this the waning day was growing short
 for the low sun was crimsoning the west
 a fitting hour for those to seek a port
 who would not in the wood set up their rest
 when to this city near her sylvan haunt
 young flordespine invited bradament

 xl
 "my sister the request could ill deny
 and so they came together to the place
 where but for you by that ill squadron i
 had been compelled the cruel flame to face
 there flordespina made her family
 caress and do my sister no small grace
 and having in a female robe arraid
 past her on all beholders for a maid

 xli
 "because perceiving vantage there was none
 in the male cheer by which she was misled
 the damsel held it wise reproach to shun
 which might by any carping tongue be said
 and this the rather that the ill which one
 of the two garments in her mind had bred
 now with the other which revealed the cheat
 she would assay to drive from her conceit

 xlii
 "the ladies share one common bed that night
 their bed the same but different their repose
 one sleeps one groans and weeps in piteous plight
 because her wild desire more fiercely glows
 and on her wearied eyes should slumber light
 all is deceitful that brief slumber shows
 to her it seems as if relenting heaven
 a better sex to bradamant is given

 xliii
 "as the sick man with burning thirst distrest
 if he should sleep  ere he that wish fulfil 
 aye in his troubled interrupted rest
 remembers him of every onceseen rill
 so is the damsel's fancy still possest
 in sleep with images which glad her will
 then from the empty dreams which crowd her brain
 she wakes and waking finds the vision vain

 xliv
 "what vows she vowed how oft that night she prayed
 to all her gods and mahound in despair
  that they by open miracle the maid
 would change and give her other sex to wear
 but all the lady's vows were ill appaid
 and haply heaven as well might mock the prayer
 night fades and phoebus raises from the main
 his yellow head and lights the world again

 xlv
 "on issueing from their bed when day is broken
 the wretched flordespina's woes augment
 for of departing bradamant had spoken
 anxious to scape from that embarrassment
 the princess a prime jennet as a token
 forced on my parting sister when she went
 and gilded housings and a surcoat brave
 which her own hand had richly broidered gave

 xlvi
 "her flordespine accompanied some way
 then weeping to her castle made return
 so fast my sister pricked she reached that day
 mount alban we who for her absence mourn
 mother and brother greet the martial may
 and her arrival with much joy discern
 for hearing nought we feared that she was dead
 and had remained in cruel doubt and dread

 xlvii
 "unhelmed we wondered at her hair which passed
 in braids about her brow she whilom wore
 nor less we wondered at the foreign cast
 of the embroidered surcoat which she wore
 and she to us rehearsed from first to last
 the story i was telling you before
 how she was wounded in the wood and how
 for cure were shorn the tresses from her brow

 xlviii
 "and next how came on her with labour spent
  as by the stream she slept  that huntress bright
 and how with all her false semblance well content
 she from the train withdrew her out of sight
 nor left she any thing of her lament
 untold which touched with pity every wight
 told how the maid had harboured her and all
 which past till she revisited her hall

 xlix
 "of flordespine i knew and i had seen
 in saragossa and in france the maid
 to whose bewitching eyes and lovely mien
 my youthful appetite had often strayed
 yet her i would not make my fancy's queen
 for hopeless love is but a dream and shade
 now i this proffered in such substance view
 straitway the ancient flame breaks forth anew

 l
 "love with this hope constructs his subtle ties
 who other threads for me would vainly weave
 'tis thus he took me and explained the guise
 in which i might the longsought boon achieve
 easy it were the damsel to surprise
 for as the likeness others could deceive
 which i to bradamant my sister bear
 this haply might as well the maid ensnare

 li
 "whether i speed or no i hold it wise
 aye to pursue whatever give delight
 i with no other of my plan devise
 nor any seek to counsel me aright
 well knowing where the suit of armour lies
 my sister doffed i thither go at night
 her armour and her steed to boot i take
 nor stand expecting until daylight break

 lii
 "i rode all night  love served me as a guide 
 to seek the home of beauteous flordespine
 and there arrived before in ocean's tide
 the western sun had hid his orbit sheen
 a happy man was he who fastest hied
 to tell my coming to the youthful queen
 expecting from that lady for his pain
 favour and goodly guerdon to obtain

 liii
 "for bradamant the guests mistake me all
  as you yourself but now  so much the more
 that i have both the courser and the pall
 with which she left them but the day before
 flordespine comes at little interval
 with such festivity and courteous lore
 and with a face so jocund and so gay
 she could not for her life more joy display

 liv
 "her beauteous arms about my neck she throws
 and fondly clasping me my mouth she kist
 if to my inmost heart the arrow goes
 which love directs may well by you be wist
 she leads me to her chamber of repose
 in haste not suffers others to assist
 in taking off my panoply of steel
 disarming me herself from head to heel

 lv
 "then ordering from her store a costly vest
 she spread it and  as i a woman were 
 the lady me in that rich garment drest
 and in a golden net confined my hair
 i gravely moved my eyeballs nor confest
 by gesture or by look the sex i bear
 my voice which might discover the deceit
 i tuned so well that none perceived the cheat

 lvi
 "next to the hall where dame and cavalier
 in crowds are gathered we united go
 who make to us such court and goodly cheer
 as men to queen or highborn lady show
 here oft i laughed at some with secret jeer
 who knowing not the sex concealed below
 my flowing robe of feminine array
 wooed me with wishful eyes in wanton way

 lvii
 "when more advanced in now the festive night
 and the rich board  board plenteously purveyed
 with what in season was most exquisite 
 has been some time removed the royal maid
 expects not till i of myself recite
 the cause which thither me anew conveyed
 by her own courtesy and kindness led
 that lady prays me to partake her bed

 lviii
 "damsels and dames withdrawn  with all the rest 
 pages and chamberlains when now we lay
 one and the other in our bed undrest
 with kindled torches counterfeiting day
 `marvel not lady' her i thus addrest
 `that i return after such short delay
 for haply thou imagined that again
 thou shouldst not see me until heaven knows when

 lix
 " `the reason i departed from thy side
 and next of my return explained shall be
 could i unto thy fever have applied
 by longer sojourn here a remedy
 i in thy service would have lived and died
 nor would have been an hour away from thee
 but seeing how my stay increased thy woe
 i who could do no better fixed to go

 lx
 " `into the middle of a wood profound
 by chance i from the beaten pathway strayed
 where near me plaintive cries i hear resound
 as of a woman who intreated aid
 to a lake of crystal i pursue the sound
 and there amid the waves a naked maid
 caught on the fishhook of a faun survey
 who would devour alive his helpless prey

 lxi
 " `upon the losel sword in hand i ran
 and for i could not aid in other wise
 bereft of life that evil fisherman
 she in an instant to the water flies
  `me hast thou helped not vainly' she began
 and well shalt be rewarded  with what prize
 thou canst demand  for know i am a nymph
 and have my dwelling in this crystal lymph

 lxii
 " `and power is mine to work portentous ends
 nature and elements i force thy prayer
 shape to the scope to which my strength extends
 and leave its satisfaction to my care
 charmed by my song the moon from heaven descends
 fire can i freeze and harden liquid air
 and i at times have stopt the sun and stirred
 this earth beneath me by a simple word'

 lxiii
 "treasure i covet not nor yet aspire
 o'er land or people to hold sovereign sway
 nor greater strength nor valour would acquire
 nor fame in every warfare bear away
 but only to accomplish thy desire
 entreat the damsel she will show some way
 nor one nor other method i forestall
 but to her choice refer me all in all

 lxiv
 "scarce my demand was made before mine eye
 beneath the lymph engulphed that lady viewed
 nor answered she my prayer but for reply
 me with the enchanted element bedewed
 which has no sooner touched my face than i
 i know not how am utterly transmewed
 i see i feel  yet doubting what i scan 
 feel i am changed from woman into man

 lxv  lxix
 stazas lxv  lxix untranslated by rose

 lxx
 "the thing remained concealed between us two
 so that our bliss endured some months at last
 we were espied and as i sorely rue
 the tidings to the spanish monarch past
 thou that whilere preserved'st me from the crew
 which me into the flames designed to cast
 by this mayst fully comprehend the rest
 but god alone can read my sorrowing breast"

 lxxi
 so richardetto spake and by his say
 made the dark path they trod less irksome be
 up a small height this while their journey lay
 girded with cliff and cavern drear to see
 bristling with rocks a steep and narrow way
 was to that rugged hill the stubborn key
 a town called agrismonte crowned the steep
 which aldigier of clermont had in keep

 lxxii
 bastard of buovo brother to the pair
 sir vivian and sir malagigi hight
 who him gerardo's lawful son declare
 are witnesses of little worth and light
  this as it may  strong valiant wise and ware
 liberal humane and courteous was the knight
 and on the fortress of its absent lord
 by night and day kept faithful watch and ward

 lxxiii
 his cousin richardetto as behoved
 was courteously received by aldigier
 who him as dearly as a brother loved
 and made rogero for his sake good cheer
 but not with wonted welcome  inly moved 
 he even wore a visage sad and drear
 for he that day illtidings had received
 and hence in heart and face the warrior grieved

 lxxiv
 to richardetto he exclaims instead
 of greeting "evil news are hither blown
 by a sure messenger today i read
 that faithless bertolagi of bayonne
 with barbarous lanfusa has agreed
 and costly spoils makes over to that crone
 who will consign to him the brethren twain
 thy malagigi and thy viviane

 lxxv
 "these she since ferrau took them aye has stayed
 imprisoned in a dark and evil cell
 till the discourteous and foul pact was made
 with that false maganzese of whom i tell
 and them tomorrow to a place conveyed
 'twixt bayonne and a town of his will sell
 to him who will be present to advance
 the price of the most precious blood in france

 lxxvi
 "one at a gallop even now to report
 tidings to our rinaldo of the wrong
 i sent bur fear that he can ill resort
 to him in time the journey is so long
 men have i not to sally from my fort
 and my power halts where my desire is strong
 the traitor will the knights if rendered slay
 nor know i what to do nor what to say"

 lxxvii
 sir richardetto the ill news displease
 and as they him displease in equal wise
 rogero who when silent both he sees
 nor able any counsel to devise
 exclaims with mickle daring "be at ease
 i challenge for myself the whole emprize
 and to set free your brethren in my hand
 more than a thousand shall avail this brand

 lxxviii
 "i ask not men i ask not aid my spear
 is i believe sufficient to the feat
 i only ask of you a guide to steer
 me to the place where for the exchange they meet
 i even in this place will make you hear
 their cries who for that evil bargain threat"
 he said nor to one listener of the twain
 that had helped his actions spake in vain

 lxxix
 the other heard him not or heard at most
 as we great talkers hear who little do
 but richardetto took aside their host
 and told how him he from the fire withdrew
 and how he was assured beyond his boast
 he would in time and place his prowess shew
 'twas now that better audience than before
 aldigier lent and set by him great store

 lxxx
 and at the feast where plenty for the three
 emptied her horn him honoured as his lord
 here they conclude they can the brethren free
 without more succour from their gaoler's ward
 this while sleep seized on lord and family
 save young rogero no repose afford
 to him the thoughts which evermore molest
 and rankling in his bosom banish rest

 lxxxi
 the siege of agramant to him that day
 told by the messenger he has at heart
 he well discerns that every least delay
 will he dishonour what a ceaseless smart
 will scorn inflict what shame will him appay
 if he against his sovereign lord take part
 oh what foul cowardice how foul a crime
 his baptism will appear at such a time

 lxxxii
 that true religion had the stripling swayed
 men might at any other time conceive
 but now when needed was the warrior's aid
 from siege the moorish monarch to relieve
 that fear and baseness had more largely weighed
 in his designs would every one believe
 that any preference of a better creed
 this thought makes good rogero's bosom bleed

 lxxxiii
 nor less to quit his queen her leave unsought
 did with rogero's other griefs combine
 now this and now that care upon him wrought
 which diversely his doubtful heart incline
 the unhappy lover fruitlessly had thought
 to find her at the abode of flordespine
 whither together went as told whilere
 to succour richardetto maid and peer

 lxxxiv
 he next bethinks him of the promise plight
 to meet at vallombrosa's sanctuary
 deems her gone thither and that 'twill excite
 her wonderment himself not there to see
 could he at least a message send or write
 that he with reason might not censured be
 because not only he had disobeyed
 but was departing hence and nothing said

 lxxxv
 he having thought on many things in the end
 resolves on writing what behoves and though
 he knows not how his letter he shall send
 in the assurance it will safely go
 this hinders not he thinks that as they wend
 chance in his way some faithful post may throw
 nor more delays up leaps the restless knight
 and calls for pen and paper ink and light

 lxxxvi
 that which is needed in obedience meet
 aldigier's valets bring a careful band
 the youth begins to write and first to greet
 the maid as wonted courtesies demand
 next tells how agramant has sent to entreat
 in his dispatches succour at his hand
 and save he quickly to his comfort goes
 must needs be slain or taken by his foes

 lxxxvii
 then adds his sovereign being so bested
 and praying him for succour in his pain
 she must perceive what blame upon his head
 would light if agramant applied in vain
 and since with her he is about to wed
 'tis fitting he should keep him with stain
 for ill he deems a union could endure
 between aught foul and her to passing pure

 lxxxviii
 and if he erst a name renowned and clear
 had laboured to procure by actions fair
 and having gained it thus he held it dear
  if this had sought to keep  with greater care
 he kept it now  and with a miser's fear
 guarded the treasure she with him would share
 who though distinct in body and in limb
 when wedded ought to be one soul with him

 lxxxix
 and as he erst by word he now explained
 anew by writing that the period o'er
 for which he was to serve his king constrained
 unless it were his lot to die before
 he would in deed a christian be ordained
 as in resolve he had been evermore
 and of her kin rinaldo and her sire
 her afterwards in wedlock would require

 xc
 "i would" he said "relieve with your good will
 my king besieged by charlemagne's array
 that the misjudging rabble prone to ill
 might never to my shame and scandal say
 rogero in fair wind and weather still
 waited upon his sovereign night and day
 and now that fortune to king charles is fled
 has with that conquering lord his ensign spread'

 xci
 "i fifteen days or twenty ask that i
 yet once again may to our army speed
 so that by me from leaguering enemy
 the african cantonments may be freed
 i will some fit and just occasion spy
 meanwhile to justify my change of creed
 i for my honour make this sole request
 then wholly yours for life in all things rest"

 xcii
 rogero is such words his thoughts exposed
 which never could by me be fully showed
 and added more nor from his task reposed
 until the crowded paper overflowed
 he next the letter folded and enclosed
 and sealed it and within his bosom stowed
 in hopes to meet next morning by the way
 one who might covertly that writ convey

 xciii
 when he had closed the sheet that amorous knight
 his eyelids closed as well and rest ensued
 for slumber came and steeped his wearied might
 in balmy moisture from a branch imbued
 with lethe's water and he slept till  white
 and red  a rain of flowers the horizon strewed
 painting the joyous east with colours gay
 when from her golden dwelling broke the day

 xciv
 and when the greenwood birds 'gan far and wide
 greet the returning light with gladsome strain
 sir aldigier who wished to be the guide
 upon that journey of the warlike twain
 who would in succour of those brethren ride
 to rescue them from bertolagi's chain
 was first upon his feet and either peer
 issues as well from bed when him they hear

 xcv
 when clad and thoroughly in arms arrayed 
 rogero with the cousins took his way
 having that pair already warmly prayed
 the adventure on himself alone to lay
 but these by love for those two brethren swayed
 and deeming it discourtesy to obey
 stood out against his prayer more stiff than stone
 nor would consent that he should wend alone

 xcvi
 true to the time and place of change they hie
 whither sir aldigier's advices teach
 and there survey an ample band who lie
 exposed to fierce apollo's heat in reach
 nor myrtletree nor laurel they descry
 nor tapering cypress ash nor spreading beech
 but naked gravel with low shrubs discerned
 undelved by mattock and by share unturned

 xcvii
 those three adventurous warriors halted where
 a path went through the uncultivated plain
 and saw a knight arrive upon the lair
 who flourished o'er with gold wore plate and chain
 and on green field that beauteous bird and rare
 which longer than an age extends its reign
 no more my lord for at my canto's close
 i find myself arrived and crave repose


 canto 26

 argument
 of mighty matters sculptured in a font
 does malagigi to his comrades tell
 on them come mandricardo and rodomont
 and forthwith battle follows fierce and fell
 discord goes scattering quarrel and affront
 amid the crew but whither forced by spell
 fair doralice upon her palfrey speeds
 the tartar king and sarzan turn their steeds


 i
 in former ages courteous ladies were
 who worshipt virtue and not worldly gear
 women in this degenerate age are rare
 to whom aught else but sordid gain is dear
 but they who real goodness make their care
 nor with the avaricious many steer
 in this frail life are worthy to be blest
  held glorious and immortal when at rest

 ii
 bradamant well would deathless praise inherit
 who nor in wealth nor empire took delight
 but in rogero's worth excelling spirit
 in his unbounded gentlesse and aright
 for this did good duke aymon's daughter merit
 to be beloved of such a valorous knight
 who what might be for miracles received
 in future ages for her sake achieved

 he with those two of clermont as whilere
 to you i in the former canto said
 i say with richardet and aldigier
 was gone to give the prisoned brethren aid
 i told as well how they a cavalier
 of haughty look approaching had surveyed
 who bore that noble bird by fiery birth
 renewed and ever single upon earth

 iv
 when those three of that warrior were espied
 poised on the wing as if about to smite
 he fain by proof their prowess would have tried
 and if their semblance tallied with their might
 "is there among you one" the stranger cried
 "will prove upon me which is best in fight
 with lance or sword till one to ground be cast
 while in the sell his foe is seated fast"

 v
 "  i at your choice" said aldigier "were fain
 to flourish faulchion or to tilt with spear
 but this with feat which if you here remain
 yourself may witness so would interfere
 that for the present parley time with pain
 suffices and yet less for the career
 six hundred men or more we here attend
 with whom we must today in arms contend

 vi
 "two of our own to rescue from their foes
 and free from chains us love and pity sway"
 he to that stranger next the reason shows
 why thus in steel their bodies they array
 "so just is the excuse which you oppose"
  he answered  "that i ill should this gainsay
 and hold you surely for three cavaliers
 that seldom upon earth will find their peers

 vii
 "with you a lance or two i would have crost
 to prove how great your prowess in the field
 but since 'tis shown me at another's cost
 forego the joust and to your reasons yield
 warmly i pray your leave against that host
 to join with your good arms this helm and shield
 and hope if suffered of your band to be
 no worthless comrade shall you find in me"

 viii
 some one meseems may crave the stranger's name
 who thus the champions on their road delayed
 and so to partnership in arms laid claim
 with those three warriors for the strife arrayed
 she  style no more a man that martial dame 
 marphisa was that on zerbino laid
 the task to bear about against his will
 ribald gabrina prone to every ill

 ix
 the two of clermont and their bold compeer
 gladly received her succour in their cause
 whom certes they believed a cavalier
 and not a damsel and not what she was
 a banner was espied by aldigier
 and shown the others after little pause
 which by the wavering wind was blown about
 and round about it ranged a numerous rout

 x
 and when now nearer the advancing crew
 were better marked in moorish habit stoled
 for saracens the stranger band they knew
 and they upon two sorry jades behold
 i' the middle of that troop the prisoners who
 were to the false maganza to be sold
 marphisa cries "why is the feast delayed
 when lo the guests are here for whom we stayed"

 xi
  "not all" rogero said "of the array
 invited lacks as yet a numerous part
 a solemn festival is held today
 and we to grace it more use every art
 yet they can now but little more delay"
 while thus they parley they from other part
 descry the treacherous maganzese advance
 so all was ready to begin the dance

 xii
 they of maganza from one quarter steer
 and laden mules beneath their convoy go
 bearing vest gold and other costly gear
 on the other side mid faulchion spear and bow
 approached the captive two with doleful cheer
 who found themselves awaited by the foe
 and false and impious bertolagi heard
 as with the moorish captain he conferred

 xiii
 nor buovo's nor duke aymon's valiant son
 can hold when that false maganzese they view
 against him both with rested lances run
 he falls the victim of those furious two
 through belly and through pummel pierced by one
 and by the other in mid visage through
 his bleeding cheeks may like disastrous fate
 o'erwhelm all evil doers soon or late

 xiv
 marphisa with rogero moved her horse
 at this nor waited other trumpetstrain
 nor broke her lance in her impetuous course
 till in succession three had prest the plain
 a mark well worthy fierce rogero's force
 the paynim leader in a thought is slain
 and with him pierced by the same weapon go
 two others to the gloomy realms below

 xv
 'twas hence a foul mistake the assaulted made
 it caused their utter loss and ruined all
 they of maganza deemed themselves betrayed
 by the infidels upon their leader's fall
 on the other side so charged with hostile blade
 the moors those maganzese assassins call
 and with fierce slaughter either angry horde
 'gan bend bow and brandish lance and sword

 xvi
 rogero charging this or the other band
 slays ten or twenty shifting his career
 no fewer by the warlike damsel's hand
 are slaughtered and extinguished there and here
 as many men as feel the murderous brand
 are from the saddle seen to disappear
 before it vanish cuirass helms and shields
 as the dry wood to fire in forest yields

 xvii
 if ever you remember to have viewed
 or heard  what time the wasps divided are
 and all the winged college is at feud
 mustering their swarms for mischief in mid air 
 the greedy swallow swoop amid that brood
 to mangle and devour and kill and tear
 you must imagine so on either part
 the bold rogero and marphisa dart

 xviii
 not so sir richardet and aldigier
 varied the dance between those squadrons twain
 for heedless of the moors each cavalier
 had but an eye to false maganza's train
 the brother of rinaldo charles's peer
 much courage added to much might and main
 and these were now redoubled by the spite
 which against false maganza warmed the knight

 xix
 this cause made him who in his fury shared
 good buovo's bastard seems a lion fell
 he without pause each trusty helmet pared
 with his good blade or crushed it like the shell
 of brittle egg and who would not have dared 
 would not have shown a hector's worth as well
 having two such companions in the stower
 of warlike wights the very choice and flower

 xx
 marphisa waging all the while the fight
 on her companions often turned to gaze
 and as she marked their rivalry in might
 admiring upon all bestowed her praise
 but when she on rogero fixed her sight
 deemed him unparalleled and in amaze
 at times believed that paladin was mars
 who left his heaven to mix in mortal wars

 xxi
 she marvels at the champion's horrid blows
 she marvels how in vain they never fell
 the iron smit by balisarda shows
 like paper not like stubborn plate and shell
 to pieces helm and solid corslet goes
 and men are severed even to the sell
 whom into equal parts those strokes divide
 half dropt on this and half on the other side

 xxii
 with the same downright stroke he overbore
 the horse and rider bleeding in the dust
 the heads of others from their shoulders bore
 and parted from the hips the bleeding bust
 he often at a blow cleft five and more
 and  but i doubt who hears me might distrust
 what of a seeming falsehood bears the impress 
 i would say more but i parforce say less

 xxiii
 good turpin he who knows that he tells true
 and leaves men to believe what they think right
 says of rogero wondrous things which you
 hearing related would as falsehoods slight
 thus with marphisa matched that hostile crew
 appears like ice and she like burning light
 nor her rogero with less marvel eyes
 that she had marked his valour with surprise

 xxiv
 as she had mars in bold rogero seen
 perhaps bellona he had deemed the maid
 if for a woman he had known that queen
 who seemed the contrary in arms arrayed
 and haply emulation had between
 the pair ensued by whom with cruel blade
 most deadly signs of prowess should be shown
 mid that vile herd on sinew flesh and bone

 xxv
 to rout each hostile squadron filled with dread
 sufficed the soul and valour of the four
 nor better arms remained for them who fled
 than the sharp goads which on their heels they wore
 happy was he with courser well bested
 by trot or amble they set little store
 and he who had no steed here learned dismayed
 how wretched is the poor footsoldier's trade

 xxvi
 the conqueror's prize remained both field and prey
 nor was there footman left nor muleteer
 the moor took this maganza took that way
 one leaves the prisoners and one leaves the gear
 with visage glad and yet with heart more gay
 the four united each captive cavalier
 nor were less diligent to free from chains
 the prisoned pages and unload the wains

 xxvii
 besides good quantity of silver fine
 wrought into different vessels with a store
 of feminine array of fair design
 embroidered round about with choicest lore
 and suit of flemish tapestry framed to line
 royal apartments wrought with silk and ore 
  they 'mid more costly things in plenty spread 
 discovered flasks of wine and meat and bread

 xxviii
 when now the conquering troop their temples bare
 all see they have received a damsel's aid
 known by her curling locks of golden hair
 and delicate and beauteous face displayed
 her the knights honoured much and to declare
 her name so well deserving glory prayed
 nor she that ever was of courteous mood
 among her friends their instances withstood

 xxix
 with viewing her they cannot sate their eyes
 who in the battle such had her espied
 she speaks but with the child but him descries
 none prizes values none 'twould seem beside
 meanwhile that ready spread a banquet lies
 to them is by the servants notified
 this they had served about a neighbouring fountain
 screened from the sun by an o'ershadowing mountain

 xxx
 this spring was one of those four fountains rare
 of those in france produced by merlin's sleight
 encompassed round about with marble fair
 shining and polished and then milk more white
 there in the stone choice figures chisseled were
 by that magician's godlike labour dight
 save voice was wanting these you might have thought
 were living and with nerve and spirit fraught

 xxxi
 here to appearance from the forest prest
 a cruel beast and hideous to the eye
 with teeth of wolf an ass's head and crest
 a carcass with long famine lean and dry
 and lion's claws a fox in all the rest
 which seemed to ravage france and italy
 and spain and england's desolated strands
 europe and asia and in fine all lands

 xxxii
 the beast the low and those of proudest port
 had slain or maimed throughout this earthly ball
 yea fiercest seemed on those of noble sort
 sovereign and satrap prince and peer to fall
 and made most havoc in the roman court
 for it had slaughtered pope and cardinal
 had filled st peter's beauteous seat with scathe
 and brought foul scandal on the holy faith

 xxxiii
 whate'er she touches wall or rampire steep
 goes to the ground' where'er the monster wends
 each fortress opens neither castlekeep
 nor city from her rage its wealth defends
 honours divine as well that beast would reap
 it seems while the besotted rabble bends
 and claim withal as to its keeping given
 the sacred keys which open hell and heaven

 xxxiv
 approaching next is seen a cavalier
 his temples circled with imperial bay
 three youths with him in company appear
 with golden lilies wrought in their array
 a lion seems against that monster drear
 to issue with the same device as they
 the name of these are on the marble read
 some on their skirt some written overhead

 xxxv
 of those who so against beast advance
 one to the hilt has in his lifeblood dyed
 his faulchion francis styled the first of france
 with austrian maximilian at his side
 in one who gores his gullet with the lance
 the emperor charles the fifth is signified
 henry the eighth of england is he hight
 who in the monster's breast a dart has pight

 xxxvi
 the tenth in writing on his back displayed
 the lion who that beast is seen to hold
 by both his ears and him so well has bayed
 that thither troop assistants manifold
 'twould seem the world all fear aside has laid
 and in amendment of their errors old
 thitherward nobles troop but these are few
 and so that hideous beast those hunters slew

 xxxvii
 in wonder stood long time that warlike train
 desirous as the storied work they traced
 to know by hands of whom that beast was slain
 which had so many smiling lands defaced
 the names unknown to them though figured plain
 upon the marble which that fountain cased
 they one another prayed if any guessed
 that story he would tell it to the rest

 xxxviii
 vivian on malagigi turned his eyes
 who listening stood this while yet spake he nought
 "with thee" he cried "to tell the meaning lies
 who are they by whose darts and lances dies
 that shouldst by what i see in this be taught
 the hideous monster that to bay is brought"
  and malagigi  "hitherto their glory
 no author has consigned to living story

 xxxix
 "the chiefs whose names are graved upon the stone
 not yet have moved upon this worldly stage
 but will within seven hundred years be known
 to the great honour of a future age
 what time king arthur filled the british throne
 this fountain merlin made enchanter sage
 who things to come upon the marble fair
 made sculpture by a cunning artist's care

 xl
 "this beast when weights and measures first were found
 came out of nether hell when on the plain
 common before men fixed the landmark's bound
 and fashioned written pacts with jealous pain
 yet walked not every where at first her round
 unvisited she left yet many a reign
 through diverse places in our time she wends
 but the vile rabble and the crowd offends

 xli
 "from the beginning even to our day
 aye has that monster grown and aye will grow
 and till much time be past will grow alway
 was never mightier nor worse cause of woe
 that python oft the theme of ancient lay
 so passing wonderful and fierce in show
 came not by half this loathsome monster nigh
 in all its foulness and deformity

 xlii
 "dread desolation shall it make nor place
 will unpolluted or untainted be
 and you in the mysterious sculptured trace
 but little of its foul iniquity
 the world when weary of imploring grace
 those worthy peers whose names you sculptured see
 and which shall blazing carbuncle outshine
 to succour in its utmost need combine

 xliii
 "no one shall more that cruel beast molest
 than francis who the realm of france will steer
 who justly shall be forward in this quest
 whom none shall go beyond whom few shall peer
 since he in splendour as in all the rest
 wanting in worth will many make appear
 who whilom perfect seemed so fade and yield
 all lesser glories to the sun revealed

 xliv
 "in the first year of his successful reign
 the crown yet ill secure upon his front
 he threads the alps and makes their labour vain
 who would against his arms maintain the mount
 impelled by generous and by just disdain
 the unavenged as yet is that affront
 which a french army suffered from their rage
 who poured from beastcote field and pasturage

 xlv
 "and thence shall into the rich lombard plain
 descend with all the flower of france and so
 shall break the switzer that henceforth in vain
 would he uplift his horn against the foe
 to the sore scandal of the church and spain
 and to the florentine's much scathe and woe
 by him that famous castle shall be quelled
 which inexpugnable whilere was held

 xlvi
 "in quelling it his honoured faulchion more
 than other arms availing shall be found
 which first that cruel beast to death will gore
 the foul destroyer of each country round
 parforce will every standard fly before
 that conquering faulchion or be cast to ground
 nor stormed by it will rampart fosse or wall
 secure the city they surround from fall

 xlvii
 "imbued with every generous quality
 which can in great commander be combined
  prudence like his who won thrasymenae
 and trebbia's field with caesar's daring mind
 and alexander's fortune him i see
 without which all designs are mist and wind
 withal so passing liberal i in none
 mark his example or his parragon"

 xlviii
 so malagigi to his comrades said
 and moved in them desire some name to hear
 of others who had laid that monster dead
 which to slay others had been used whilere
 among the first bernardo's name was read
 much vaunted in the writing of the seer
 who said "through him as known as bibbiena
 as her own neighbour florence and siena

 xlix
 "more forward in this chase shall no one show
 than sigismond than lewis and than john
 each to that hideous beast a cruel foe
 one a gonzaga one of arragon
 and one a salviati with them go
 francis gonzaga and frederick his son
 brother and soninlaw their aid afford
 one chief ferrara's one urbino's lord

 l
 "of one of these the son sir guidobald
 will not by sire or other distanced be
 with ottobon de flisco sinibald
 chases the beast both striving equally
 lewis de gazolo its neck has galled
 with one of those keen darts apollo's fee
 given with his bow what time as well his glaive
 the god of war to gird that warrior gave

 li
 "two hercules and two hippolyti
 of este a hercules and hippolyte
 of the gonzagas' and the medici
 hunt and fatigue the monster in his flight
 nor julian lets his good son pass him by
 nor bold ferrant his brother nor less wight
 is andrew doria nor by any one
 is francis sforza in the chase outdone

 lii
 "of good avalo's glorious lineage bred
 two chiefs that mountain for their bearing show
 which hiding him from dragonfeet to head
 the wicked typheus seems to keep below
 'mid those combined to lay the monster dead
 shall none more forward than this couple go
 him francis of pescara names the text
 alphonso hight of guasto is the next

 liii
 "but where leave i gonsalvo ferrant who
 is held in such esteem the pride of spain
 so praised by malagigi that him few
 equal among the worthies of that train
 william surnamed of monferrato view
 'mid those that have the hideous monster slain
 but these are few compared with numbers round
 whom that despiteous beast shall kill or wound"

 liv
 to converse gay the friends themselves addrest
 and seemly pastimes when their meal was done
 through the hot noontide and fine carpets prest
 'mid shrubs by which the limpid river run
 vivian and malagigi that the rest
 might be more tranquil watched with armour on
 when unaccompanied they saw a dame
 who quickly towards their place of shelter came

 lv
 hippalca she from whom was torn away
 frontino that good horse by rodomont
 him had she long pursued the former day
 and now with prayer now followed with affront
 which booting nought she had retraced her way
 to seek rogero out in agrismont
 and how i know not heard upon her round
 he here with richardetto would be found

 lvi
 and for to her well known was that repair
 used by her often she herself addrest
 towards the fount and in that quarter fair
 found him and in what manner was exprest
 but like embassadress who  wise and ware 
 better than was enjoined performs a hest
 when richardetto she beheld made show
 as if she good rogero did not know

 lvii
 she turned her wholly to sir richardet
 as bound direct to him and on his side
 he who well knew her straight uprose and met
 and asked that damsel whitherward she hied
 hippalca with her eyes yet red and wet
 from her long weeping sighing deeply cried
 but cried aloud that young rogero near
 the warrior she addrest her tale might hear

 lviii
 "i from mount alban with a courser sped
 so your good sister had commanded me
 a horse much loved by her and highly bred
 frontino is yclept that charger free
 and him i more than thirty miles had led
 towards marseilles where she designed to be
 within few days by her enjoined to wend
 thither and her arrival there attend

 lix
 "i in the sure belief pursued my course
 was none so stout of heart if i should say
 how sir rinaldo's sister owned the horse
 he would presume to take that steed away
 but vain was my design for him parforce
 a saracen took from me yesterday
 nor when to him his master's name i read
 will that bold robber render back the steed

 lx
 "him i today and all the day before
 have prayed and prayer and menace proving vain
 aye cursing him and execrating sore
 have left at little distance where with pain
 both to his courser and himself the moor
 as best he can a combat does maintain
 against a knight who him so hard has prest
 i trust my injury shall be redrest"

 lxi
 at this rogero leaping on his feet
 who scarcely had endured the whole to hear
 to richardetto turned and as a meet
 guerdon for his good deed the cavalier
 did with beseechings infinite entreat
 to let him singly with that damsel steer
 until she showed the paynim who by force
 had wrested from her hands that goodly horse

 lxii
 richardet though it seems discourtesy
 to yield to other champion that emprize
 which by himself should terminated be
 yet with rogero's earnest suit complies
 who takes farewell of that good company
 and with the damsel on her journey hies
 and leaves those others whom his feats confound
 not merely lost in wonder but astoud

 lxiii
 to him hippalca said when she apart
 had drawn him to some distance from the rest
 she was dispatched by her that in her heart
 bore of his worth the image so imprest
  and added without using farther art
 all that her lady had to him addrest
 and if she told another tale whilere
 of richardetto she was then in fear

 lxiv
 she added how the author of that deed
 had also said to her with mickle pride
 "because i know rogero owns the steed
 more willingly i take him from his guide
 if he would repossess the courser read
 to him what i have no desire to hide
 i am that rodomont whose martial worth
 scatters its splendour through this ample earth"

 lxv
 listening the visage of the youthful knight
 showed with what rage his heart was in a flame
 as well as that the horse was his delight
 as well upon account of whence it came
 and also that 'twas reft in his despite
 he sees dishonour will ensue and blame
 save he from rodomont redeems the prey
 and with a due revenge that wrong repay

 lxvi
 with him without repose the damsel rides
 who with his foe would bring him front to front
 and thither journies where the road divides
 and one branch cuts the plain one climbs the mount
 and either pathway to that valley guides
 where she had newly left king rodomont
 the mountain track was short but trod with pain
 that other longer far but smooth and plain

 lxvii
 hippalca's ardour to retrieve the prey
 and upon rodomont's avenge the wrong
 incites that maid the mountain to assay
 by which as said the journey was less long
 while mandricardo rodomont and they
 of whom i erst made mention in my song
 that easier track across the level hold
 and thus encounter not rogero bold

 lxviii
 until king agramant shall succoured be
 suspended is their quarrel in what wise
 you know and in the champions' company
 doralice cause of all their discord hies
 now hear the upshot of this history
 their way directly by that fountain lies
 beside whose margin are in pastime met
 marphisa and aldigier and richardet

 lxix
 marphisa had at her companions' prayer
 cloathed her in female ornaments and vest
 of those which by maganza's traitour were
 late to lanfusa in full trust addrest
 and though the appearance of that maid was rare
 without her corslet casque and all the rest
  at their entreaty these for once laid down 
 she deigned to seem a maid and donned the gown

 lxx
 as soon as mandricardo saw her face
 in trust that could he win her in affray
 he would that maid in recompense and place
 of doralice to rodomont convey
 as if love trafficked in such contracts base
 and lover could his lady change away
 nor yet with reason at the event be pained
 if he in losing one another gained

 lxxi
 hence with a damsel to provide the peer
 that he himself the other may retain
 deeming her worthy any cavalier
 he would by force of arms the maid obtain
 and as if he could suddenly hold dear
 this maid as that on him bestow the gain
 and all of those whom he about her spied
 forthwith to joust and single fight defied

 lxxii
 vivian and malagigi who were dight
 in arms as guard and surety for the rest
 one and the other champion  prompt for fight
 rose lightly from the herbage which they prest
 deeming they had to joust with either knight
 but rodomont who came not on this quest
 no motion made as he a course would run
 so that they had to tourney but with one

 lxxiii
 sir vivian is the first who moves his horse
 with mighty heart and lays his weapon low
 and he that tartar king renowned for force
 with greater puissance meets the coming foe
 his lance each warrior levels in the course
 where he bests trusts to plant the furious blow
 vainly sir vivian's spear the casque offends
 nor throws that paynim knight nor even bends

 lxxiv
 that tartar's harder weapon makes the shield
 of vivian at their onset fly like grass
 and tumbling from his saddle on the field
 extends the champion amid flowers and grass
 to run his chance sir malagigi steeled
 did to his brother's succour quickly pass
 but such that warrior's hurry to be near
 rather accompanied than venged the peer

 lxxv
 the other of those brethren armed before
 his cousin and had backed his courser wight
 and having first defied encountered sore
 spurring with flowing rein the stranger knight
 against the tempered helm that pagan wore
 sounded the blow an inch below the sight
 heavenhigh the truncheon flew in fragments broke
 but the stout pagan winced not for the stroke

 lxxvi
 him on the left side smote that paynim peer
 and for the blow was with huge force designed
 little his shield and less his iron gear
 availed which opened like the yielding rhind
 the weapon pierced his shoulder aldigier
 now right now left upon his horse inclined
 then him 'mid grass and flowers his comrades view
 with arms of crimson face of pallid hue

 lxxvii
 next richardetto comes and for the blow
 intended levels such a mighty lance
 he showed himself as he was wont to show
 worthy to be a paladin of france
 and has stamped signs of this upon the foe
 if he had warred on him with equal chance
 but prostrate rolled encumbered by his steed
 nor fell the courser through his lord's misdeed

 lxxviii
 when knight appeared not on the other side
 who should in joust the paynim king affront
 he thought the damsel was his prize and hied
 thither where she was seated by the fount
 and  "lady you are mine" the tartar cried
 "save other champion in your succour mount
 nor can you make denial or excuse
 since such the right of war and common use"

 lxxix
 marphisa raised her face with haughty cheer
 and answered him "thy judgment wanders far
 i will concede thy sentence would be clear
 concluding i am thine by right of war
 if either were my lord or cavalier
 of those by thee unhorsed in bloody jar
 nor theirs am i nor other's but my own
 who wins me wins me from myself alone

 lxxx
 "i too with lance and sword do doughty deed
 and more than one good knight on earth have laid
  give me" she cried "my armour and my steed"
 and readily her squires that hest obeyed
 then in her waistcoat stood of flowing weed
 despoiled with wellknit from and charms displayed
 and in all points such strength she shewed and grace
 resembled heavenly mars except her face

 lxxxi
 the damsel donned her sword when armed all o'er
 and on her courser leapt with nimble spring
 and right and left she made him thrice or more
 poised on his haunches turn in narrow ring
 and levelling the sturdy lance she bore
 defied and next assailed the tartar king
 so combating with peleus' son of yore
 penthesilaea warred on trojan shore

 lxxxii
 like brittle crystal in that proud career
 the weapons at the rest to pieces went
 yet neither of those warriors 'twould appear
 backwards one inch at their encounter bent
 marphisa who would willingly be clear
 what of a closer fight would be the event
 for a new combat with the paynim lord
 wheeled to attack that warrior with the sword

 lxxxiii
 that tartar cursed the elements and sky
 when her he saw remaining in her sell
 and she who thought to make his buckler fly
 cursed heaven as loudly as that infidel
 already were their faulchions raised on high
 which on the enchanted arms like hammers fell
 enchanted arms both combatants enclose
 never more needed by those deadly foes

 lxxxiv
 so perfect are the champions' plate and chain
 they thrust or cut of spear or faulchion stay
 so that the two the battle might maintain
 throughout this and throughout another day
 but rodomont leaps in between the twain
 and taxes mandricardo with delay
 crying "if battle here is to be done
 finish we that which we today begun

 lxxxv
 "we made a truce thou knowest upon pact
 of furnishing our baffled forces aid
 nor foe in joust or fight can be attacked
 by us with justice till this debt be paid"
 then to marphisa he in reverent act
 addressed himself and of that courier said
 and next recounted to the martial dame
 how seeking aid for agramant he came

 lxxxvi
 next prays not only with that tartar knight
 she will abandon or defer the fray
 but that troyano's valiant son to right
 she will together with them wend her way
 by which her warlike fame a higher flight
 more easily may even to heaven assay
 than in a quarrel of such paltry guise
 which offers hindrance to such fair emprize

 lxxxvii
 marphisa who had evermore in thought
 to prove the paladins of charles and who
 to france was over land and ocean brought
 from clime so distant with no other view
 than by her own experience to be taught
 if their farspread renown were false or true
 resolved together with the troop to speed
 as soon as she had heard their monarch's need

 lxxxviii
 meanwhile rogero with that guiding may
 had vainly by the rugged pathway sped
 who that king rodomont another way
 had taken when he reached the mountain read
 and thinking that he was not far away
 and the road straight towards that fountain led
 trotting in haste behind the sarzan hied
 where he new prints upon the path espied

 lxxxix
 hippalca he to mont albano prayed
 to wend which distant one day's journey lies
 because to seek anew that fountainglade
 would be to wander in too wide a guise
 and that she need not doubt withal he said
 but that he would retrieve the ravished prize
 and were she in mount alban  or where'er 
 vowed she the tidings speedily should hear

 xc
 and gave the letter to that maid to bear
 which writ by him he in his bosom wore
 and added many matters with the prayer
 she would excuse him by her friendly lore
 hippalca in her memory fixt with care
 the whole took leave and turned her horse once more
 nor ceased that faithful messenger to ride
 till she mount alban reached at eveningtide

 xci
 rogero followed fast the paynim knight
 tracked o'er the level by those footsteps new
 but overtook him not till he got sight
 beside the fount of mandricardo too
 already either had his promise plight
 he nought unknown to his compeer would do
 till they had succour to that host conveyed
 on which king charles his yoke had nearly laid

 xcii
 arrived rogero knew frontino gay
 and through that courser knew the knight astride
 and on his lance with bending shoulder lay
 and in fierce tone the african defied
 job was outdone by rodomont that day
 in that the king subdued his haughty pride
 and the fell fight which he had ever used
 to seek with every instance he refused

 xcii
 the first day this and last that e'er in fight
 king rodomont refused his part to bear
 but his desire appeared to him so right
 in succour of his sovereign to repair
 that if he had believed he clutched the knight
 faster than nimble leopard gripes the hare
 he not so far his purpose would forego
 as on his prey to waste a passing blow

 xciv
 add that he knows rogero is the peer
 who him for good frontino now assails
  so famous that no other cavalier
 like him such eminence of glory scales
  the man of whom he gladly would be clear
 by proof how much in battle he avails
 yet shuns the combat proffered on his part
 so much his monarch's siege has he at heart

 xcv
 three hundred miles a thousand would he ride
  were it not so  to purchase such affray
 but he if him achilles had defied
 had done no otherwise than as i say
 so deeply did the covering ashes hide
 that fire beneath whose fury stifled lay
 he told why he refused the strife and prayed
 as well rogero the design to aid

 xcvi
 adding that he in doing so would do
 what to his lord a faithful vassal owes
 still when the siege was raised might they renew
 and terminate their deadly strife by blows
 to him rogero cried "the fight with you
 i freely will defer till from his foes
 king agramant be rescued by the sword
 provided first frontino be restored

 xcvii
 "would you that i delay to prove by deed
 that you have acted in unworthy sort
  nor did like valiant man to take my steed
 thus from a woman  till we meet at court
 render me my frontino back or read
 upon no other ground will i support
 that battle shall not be between us two
 nor will accord an hour of truce to you"

 xcviii
 while of that african he so demands
 frontino or him threats with instant fray
 and either still the other's claim withstands
 nor this the steed will grant nor that delay
 king mandricardo stirs on the other hand
 another strife who sees that ensign gay
 rogero on his shield was wont to wear
 the bird which reigns o'er other fowls of air

 xcix
 he bore on azure field that eagle white
 the beauteous ensign of the trojan throng
 such glorious bearing showed that youthful knight
 because he drew his line from hector strong
 but mandricardo knew not of this right
 nor would endure  and deemed a crying wrong
 that any other but himself should wield
 famed hector's argent eagle on his shield

 c
 king mandricardo is like blazon wore
 the bird of ide which bore off ganymede
 how in the castle perilous of yore
 he gained that noble ensign for his meed
  that enterprize i ween with matter more
 you bear in mind and how for his good deed
 the fairy gave it him with all the gear
 erst given by vulcan to the trojan peer

 ci
 the tartar and rogero had before
 engaged in battle only on this quest
 divided by what accident my lore
 recites not as already manifest
 nor had till now those knights encountered more
 when mandricardo sees that bird imprest
 on the child's shield he shouts with threatening cry
 to young rogero "take my proud defy"

 cii
 "audacious man mine ensign do'st thou wear
 nor this today for the first time is said
 and think'st thou madman i will thee forbear
 because for once to spare thee i was led
 but since nor menace nor yet counsel are
 of force to drive this folly from thy head
 it shall appear how much it had been best
 for thee forthwith to have obeyed my hest"

 ciii
 "as fire whereon dry heated wood is strown
 roused by a little puff at once ascends
 so burns rogero's wrath to fury blown
 by the first word with which that king offends
 "thou thinkest" he exclaims "to bear me down
 because his knight as well with me contends
 but learn that i can win in fighting field
 from him the horse from thee good hector's shield

 civ
 "yet once before  nor is it long ago 
 twixt us in battle was this question tried
 but i that day restrained the murderous blow
 because thou hadst no faulchion at thy side
 these shall be deeds that strife was but a show
 and ill this argent bird shall thee betide
 this is the ancient bearing of my line
 tis thou usurpest what by right is mine"

 cv
  "say rather thou usurpest mine from me"
 cried mandricardo and that faulchion drew
 which lately underneath the greenwood tree
 orlando from his hand in fury threw
 the child who could not aught but courteous be
 such was his gentle nature at the view
 of mandricardo with his faulchion drawn
 let fall his ready lance upon the lawn

 cvi
 and at the same time strained his goodly sword
 and better braced the covering shield he wore
 but 'twixt those combatants leapt argier's lord
 and quick marphisa spurred the pair before
 and one this foe the other that implored
 and both besought that they would strive no more
 king rodomont complains the tartar knight
 has violated twice the compact plight

 cvii
 first in belief he should marphisa gain
 he more than once had jousted for that fair
 now to bear off rogero's ensign fain
 he for king agramant shows little care
  "if thus" said rodomont "you faith maintain
 to finish our own combat better were
 a cause of strife more fitting and more due
 than either of the pleas maintained by you

 cviii
 "on this condition was the treaty plight
 and the accord between us now in force
 when i with thee shall have performed the fight
 i next shall answer him about the horse
 you then with him if you survive your right
 shall to the shield maintain in warlike course
 but i such work shall give you i conceive
 as will small labour for rogero leave"

 cix
  "the bargain which thou hopest thou shalt not have"
 king mandricardo answered rodomont
 "i will accord thee more than thou do'st crave
 and trust to make thee sweat from feet to front
 and to bestow on others much shall save
 as water never fails in plenteous font
 and for rogero and a thousand more
 and all the world beside reserve a store"

 cx
 their fury waxed and angrier words ensued
 now upon this and now upon that side
 with rodomont and with the child at feud
 fierce mandricardo both at once defied
 rogero not endowed with suffering mood
 would hear no more of peace but vengeance cried
 now here marphisa hurried and now there
 but could not singly such an ill repair

 cxi
 as peasant when a river saps its mounds
 and seeking vent the oozing waters drop
 hastening to shut the stream within its bounds
 and save his pastures and expected crop
 dams right and left yet him the stream confounds
 for if he here the sinking ruin prop
 there he beholds the rotten dyke give out
 and from thick seams the restless water spout

 cxii
 so while the tartar and rogero rage
 and rodomont in hurlyburly fray
 for each of these would fiercest battle wage
 and would outgo his fears in that assay
 marphisa seeks their fury to assuage
 and strives and time and trouble throws away
 for as she makes one knight from strife retire
 she sees the others reengage with ire

 cxiii
 marphisa to appease the warriors bent
 exclaimed "sirs listen to my better lore
 a good remembrance 'tis all argument
 to leave until we agramant restore
 if each is on his own design intent
 with mandricardo will i strive once more
 and fain would see according to his word
 if he can conquer me with spear and sword

 cxiv
 "but if to aid our sovereign duty call
 him let us aid nor civil discord breed"
  "to ground through me such project shall not fall"
 rogero said "so he restore my steed
 let him resign that horse or  once for all
 i say again  to his defence take heed
 i either here my parting breath will yield
 or on my courser will return afield"

 cxv
  "twere not so easy to obtain this quest
 as 'twere that other" rodomont replied
 and thus pursued "i unto thee protest
 if any evil shall our king betide
 thine is the fault not mine for i am prest
 to do whate'er is fitting on my side"
 small heed to that protest rogero paid
 and stung by fury griped his trenchant blade

 cxvi
 on argier's king he sprang like savage boar
 encountering him with shoulder and with shield
 and him disordered and distrest so sore
 that with one stirrup's loss the monarch reeled
  "rogero" mandricardo cried "give o'er
 or else with me divide the battlefield"
 and struck this said with worse than felon spite
 upon the morion of that youthful knight

 cxvii
 even to his courser's neck rogero bends
 nor when he would himself can rear
 because the sword of ulien's son descends
 as well upon the youthful cavalier
 and but that adamant his face defends
 across the cheeks his tempered helm would sheer
 the child in anguish opens either hand
 and this the bridle drops and that the brand

 cxviii
 him o'er the field his courser bears away
 on earth the faulchion lies which he let go
 marphisa with rogero's through that day
 comrade in arms appeared like fire to glow
 enraged that two one knight should overlay
 and as magnanimous and stout for foe
 singled king mandricardo out and sped
 with all her might stroke upon his head

 cxix
 rodomont o'er the plain pursues his man
  another stroke and he has lost the horse
 but richardetto drives and vivian
 between the child and paynim in that course
 this warrior at the king of argier ran
 and from rogero severed him by force
 that it was vivian in rogero's hand
 now from the blow recovered placed his brand

 cxx
 as soon as to himself the child returns
 and is by vivian armed with sword again
 to venge the injury that stripling burns
 and runs at rodomont with flowing rein
 like lion whom a bull upon his horns
 has lifted though he feels this while no pain
 so him his heat of blood disdain and ire
 to venge that cruel outrage goad and fire

 cxxi
 rogero storms upon the paynim's crest
 and could that knight recover his own brand
 which by foul felony as erst exprest
 was ravished from the youthful warrior's hand
 i well believe that the descending pest
 rodomont's iron casque will ill withstand
 that casque which babel's king bade forge who sought
 to war on heaven in his presumptuous thought

 cxxii
 discord believing nothing could ensue
 but stir and strife and combat on that head
 and that there was no place amid the crew
 for truce or treaty to her sister said
 that she her wellbeloved monks to view
 might now again with her securely tread
 let them depart and mark we where in front
 rogero has sore wounded rodomont

 cxxiii
 rogero's blow was levelled with such spite
 that this upon frontino's crupper made
 the helmet and the shell of iron smite
 in which that saracen his limbs arrayed
 and he three times or four to left and right
  as if about to fall  headforemost swayed
 and would have lost withal his trusty brand
 but that the hilt was fastened to his hand

 cxxiv
 marphisa has king mandricardo prest
 meanwhile and makes him sweat breast front and face
 and he marphisa has as sore distrest
 but such good plates each valiant bosom case
 impassable is either iron vest
 and both have hitherto maintained their place
 but at a turn her martial courser made
 marphisa needed young rogero's aid

 cxxv
 marphisa's martial steed in turning short
 where a firm footing that soft mead denied
 on the moist surface slipt and in such sort
 that he fell helpless on his better side
 and as he rose in haste and lacked support
 athwart by furious brigliador was plied
 on which the paynim little courteous came
 so that he fell anew beneath the dame

 cxxvi
 rogero when marphisa on the ground
 he saw unhorsed deferred no more his aid
 who for that deed had leisure since astound
 rodomont far away had been conveyed
 he smote the morion which that tartar crowned
 and cleft like stalk his head on earth had laid
 had he his trusty balisarda born
 or mandricardo other helmet worn

 cxxvii
 rodomont of his senses repossest
 turned round this while and richardetto spied
 and recollecting how when late distrest
 he to rogero succour had supplied
 quickly against that youthful warrior prest
 who an ill guerdon would from him abide
 did malagigi not his malice thwart
 with other magic and with mickle art

 cxxviii
 sage malagigi versed in every sleight
 which by the wisest wizard can be done
 although his book he has not by whose might
 he in his course can stop the passing sun
 the conjuration recollects and rite
 by which he tames the rebel fiends and one
 bids enter into doralice's steed
 whom he to fury stings and headlong speed

 cxxix
 into that gentle palfrey's form who bore
 the beauteous daughter of king stordilane
 sir vivian's brother simply by his lore
 made pass an angel of the dark domain
 and the good horse who never moved before
 except in due obedience to the rein
 now took a leap possest by that ill sprite
 thirty feet long and sixteen feet in height

 cxxx
 it was a mighty leap yet not so wide
 as to make any rider void the sell
 seeing herself so high in air loud cried
 yielding herself for dead that bonnibel
 her palfrey with the daemon for his guide
 after his leap runs goaded by the spell
 the maid still screaming such a furious course
 an arrow had not reached the flying horse

 cxxxi
 at the first hearing of that voice the son
 of ulien on his part the strife suspended
 and thither where the furious palfrey run
 swiftly in succour of the lady wended
 no less was by the tartar monarch done
 who neither child nor damsel more offended
 but without craving time or truce or peace
 pursued king rodomont and doralice

 cxxxii
 marphisa rose meanwhile to fury stirred
 and with disdain all over in a glow
 thought to accomplish her revenge and erred
 for at too great a distance was the foe
 rogero who beheld the war deferred
 rather like lion roared than sighed well know
 those two their coursers they should vainly gore
 following frontino and good brigliador

 cxxxiii
 rogero will not halt till he renew
 and end the unfinished combat for the horse
 marphisa will not quit that tartar who
 will to her satisfaction prove his force
 to leave their quarrel in such guise the two
 esteem foul scandal as their better course
 in chase of those offending knights to fare
 is the conclusion of that valiant pair

 cxxxiv
 they in the paynim camp will find each foe
 if them before they find not on their way
 whom thither bound to raise the siege they know
 ere charlemagne bring all beneath his sway
 so thitherward the twain directly go
 where these they deem will be their certain prey
 yet not so rudely thence rogero broke
 but that he first with his companion spoke

 cxxxv
 thither returns rogero where apart
 is he the brother of his lady fair
 and vows himself his friend with generous heart
 in good or evil fortune everywhere
 him he implores  and frames his speech with art 
 he his salutes will to his sister bear
 and this so well he moves by that request
 no doubt in him nor any of the rest

 cxxxvi
 of malagigi he and viviane
 next takes farewell and wounded aldigier
 their services no less that kindly twain
 proffer as ever debtors to the peer
 marphisa to seek paris is so fain
 that parting she forgets her friends to cheer
 but malagigi and vivian in pursuit
 follow and from afar that maid salute

 cxxxvii
 and so sir richardet as well but low
 on earth lies aldigier and there must rest
 the two first champions towards paris go
 and the two others next pursue that quest
 in other canto sir i hope to show
 of wondrous and of superhuman gest
 wrought to the damage of the christian king
 by those two couples of whose worth i sing


 canto 27

 argument
 by good rogero and those paynims three
 defeated charlemagne to paris flies
 already all throughout their chivalry
 are mad with spite and hatred jars arise
 and strife and means to still their enmity
 their sovereign is unable to devise
 from him departs the monarch of argier
 who is rejected of his lady dear


 i
 a woman for the most part reasons best
 upon a sudden motion and untaught
 for with that special grace the sex is blest
 'mid those so many gifts wherewith 'tis fraught
 but man of a less nimble wit possest
 is ill at counsel save with sober thought
 he ruminates thereon content to spend
 care time and trouble to mature his end

 ii
 that seemed good counsel but was ill indeed
 of malagigi's as before was said
 albeit he so rescued in his need
 his cousin richardet with odds o'erlaid
 when from the paynim monarchs him he freed
 by ready demon who his hest obeyed
 for sure he never deemed they should be borne
 where they would work the christian army scorn

 iii
 had he some little prize for counsel stayed
 we with the same success may well suppose
 he to his cousin might have furnished aid
 yet brought not on the christian host their foes
 that evil sprite he might as well have made
 him who embodied in the palfrey goes
 eastward or west so far that lady bear
 that france should hear no further of the pair

 iv
 so the two lovers following her who flies
 to other place than paris might be brought
 but this calamity was a surprise
 on malagigi through his little thought
 and fiendish malice banished from the skies
 which ever blood and fire and ravage sought
 guided them by that way to charles' disaster
 left to his choice by him the wizard master

 v
 the wayward fiend who makes that palfrey ramp
 bears off the frighted doralice amain
 nor river nor yet yawning ditch or swamp
 wood rock or rugged cliff the steed restrain
 till traversing the french and english camp
 and other squadrons of the mingled train
 beneath the holy flag of christ arraid
 he to granada's king the fair conveyed

 vi
 the sarzan and the tartar the first day
 that royal damsel a long while pursue
 because her distant form they yet survey
 but finally they lose that lady's view
 when like a lymedog whom the hunters lay
 on hare or roebuck's trail the valiant two
 follow upon her track nor halt till told
 that she is harboured in her father's hold

 vii
 guard thyself charles for lo against thee blown
 is such a storm that i no refuge see
 nor these redoubted monarchs come alone
 but those of sericane and circassy
 while fortune who would probe thee to the bone
 has taken those two shining stars from thee
 who kept thee by their wisdom and their light
 and thou remainest blind and wrapt in night

 viii
 'tis of the valiant cousins i would speak
 of these orlando of his wit bereft
 naked in sun or shower by plain or peak
 wanders about the world a helpless weft
 and he in wisdom little less to seek
 rinaldo in thy peril thee has left
 and for in paristown she is not found
 in search of his angelica is bound

 ix
 a cunning old enchanter him deceived
 as in the outlet of my tale was said
 deluded by a phantom he believed
 angelica was with orlando fled
 and hence with jealousy at heart aggrieved
 lover ne'er suffered worse to paris sped
 whence he as soon as he appeared at court
 by chance was named to britain to resort

 x
 now the field won wherein with mickle fame
 he drove king agramant his works behind
 to paris yet again the warrior came
 searched convent tower and house and save confined
 'twixt solid walls or columns be the dame
 her will the restless lover surely find
 nor her nor yet orlando he descries
 so forth in the desire to seek them hies

 xi
 her to anglantes or to brava brought
 he deemed the count enjoyed in mirth and play
 and vainly here and there that damsel sought
 nor here nor there descried the longsought prey
 to paris he repaired again in thought
 the paladin returning to waylay
 because he deemed he could not rove at large
 without that town but on some special charge

 xii
 within he takes a day or two's repose
 and when he finds orlando comes not there
 again to brava and anglantes goes
 inquiring tidings of the royal fair
 nor whether morning dawns or noontide glows
  nor night nor day  his weary steed does spare
 nor once  but twice a hundred times  has run
 the selfsame course by light of moon or sun

 xiii
 but the ancient foe deluded by whose say
 to the forbidden fruit eve raised her hand
 turned his wan eyes on charlemagne one day
 when he the good rinaldo absent scanned
 and seeing what foul rout and disarray
 might at that time be given to charles's band
 of all the saracens the choice and flower
 marshalled in arms against the christian power

 xiv
 king sacripant and king gradasso who
 whilere companionship in war had made
 when from atlantes' palace fled the two
 together to unite their arms in aid
 of royal agramant's beleaguered crew
 and where through unknown lands the warriors hied
 made smooth the way and served them as a guide

 xv
 thither another fiend that ruthless foe
 bade rodomont and mandricardo bear
 through ways by which his comrade was not slow
 with the affrighted doralice to fare
 a third lest they their enterprize forego
 rogero and marphisa has in care
 but their conductor journeys not so fast
 and hence that martial pair arrives the last

 xvi
 later by half an hour against their foes
 so matched rogero and marphisa speed
 because the sable angel who his blows
 aimed at the bands that held the christian creed
 provided that the contest which arose
 about that horse his work should not impede
 which had again been kindled had the twain
 rodomont and rogero met again

 xvii
 the first four ride until themselves they find
 where the besiegers and besieged they view
 and see the banners shaking in the wind
 and the cantonments of those armies two
 here they short counsel took and next opined
 in spite of charlemagne's beleaguering crew
 to carry speedy succour to their liege
 and rescue royal agramant from siege

 xviii
 where thickest camped lay charles's host they spurred
 closing their files against the christian foe
 "afric and spain" is the assailants' word
 whom at all points the franks for paynims know
  "to arms to arms" throughout their camp is heard
 but first is felt the moorish sabre's blow
 even on the rearguard falls the vengeful stroke
 not charged alone but routed beat and broke

 xix
 the christian host throughout is overthrown
 and how they know not in tumultuous wise
 and that it is a wonted insult done
 by switzer or by gascon some surmise
 but  since the reason is to most unknown 
 each several nation to its standard flies
 this to the drum that to the trumpet's sound
 and shriek and shout from earth to heaven redound

 xx
 all armed is charlemagne except his head
 and girt with paladins his faithful stay
 arrived demanding what alarm has bred
 disorder in his host and disarray
 and stopt with menace this or that who fled
 and many fugitives upon their way
 some with maimed face breast arm or hand espied
 and some with head or throat with lifeblood dyed

 xxi
 advancing he on earth saw many more
 or rather in a lake of crimson laid
 horribly weltering in their own dark gore
 beyond the leech's and magician's aid
 and busts dissevered from the heads they bore
 and legs and arms  a cruel show  surveyed
 and from the first cantonments to the last
 saw slaughtered men on all sides as he past

 xxii
 where the small band advances in such wise
 deserving well eternal praise to gain
 vouching their deeds a longdrawn furrow lies
 a signal record of their might and main
 his army's cruel slaughter with surprise
 anger and rage is viewed by charlemagne
 so he whose shattered walls have felt its force
 throughout his mansion tracks the lightning's course

 xxiii
 not to the ramparts of the paynim crew
 of agramant as yet had pierced this aid
 when on the further side these other two
 rogero and marphisa thither made
 when once or twice that worthy pair a view
 have taken of the ground and have surveyed
 the readiest way assistance to afford
 they swiftly move in succour of their lord

 xxiv
 as when we spark to loaded mine apply
 through the long furrow filled with sable grain
 so fast the furious wildfire darts that eye
 pursues the progress of the flash with pain
 and as dire ruin follows and from high
 the loosened rock and solid bastion rain
 so bold rogero and marphisa rush
 to battle so the christian squadrons crush

 xxv
 front and askance the assailants smote and low
 on earth heads arms and severed shoulders lay
 where'er the christian squadrons were too slow
 to free the path and break their close array
 whoe'er has seen the passing tempest blow
 and of the hill or valley in its way
 one portion ravage and another leave
 may so their course amid that host conceive

 xxvi
 many who had escaped by quick retreat
 rodomont and those other furious three
 thank god that he had given them legs and feet
 wherewith to fly from that calamity
 and from the child and damsel new defeat
 encounter while with endlong course they flee
 as man no matter if he stands or run
 seeks vainly his predestined doom to shun

 xxvii
 who 'scape one peril into other fly
 and pay the penalty of flesh and blood
 so by the teeth of dog is wont to die
 the fox together with her infant brood
 by one who dwells her ancient cavern nigh
 unearthed and with a thousand blows pursued
 when from some unsuspected place that foe
 has filled with fire and smoke the den below

 xxviii
 marphisa and the child of danger clear
 enter the paynim ramparts and with eyes
 upturned the saracens with humble cheer
 thank heaven for the success of that emprize
 the paladins no longer are their fear
 the meanest moor a hundred franks defies
 and 'tis resolved without repose again
 to drench with christian blood the thirsty plain

 xxix
 at once a formidable larum rose
 horns drums and shrilling clarions filled the skies
 and the wind ruffles as it comes and goes
 banner and gonfalon of various dyes
 the germans and the warlike bretons close
 ranged on the other part in martial wise
 italians english french were seen and through
 those armies furious war blazed forth anew

 xxx
 the force of the redoubted rodomont
 and that of agrican's infuriate son
 that of rogero valiant's copious font
 gradasso's so renowned for trophies won
 the martial maid marphisa's fearless front
 and might of sacripant excelled by none
 made charles upon saint john and denys call
 and fly for shelter to his paris wall

 xxxi
 of fierce marphisa and her bold allies
 the unconquered daring and the wondrous might
 sir was not of a nature  of a guise 
 to be conceived much less described aright
 the number slaughtered hence may you surmise
 what cruel blow king charles sustained in fight
 add to these warriors of illustrious name
 more than one moor with ferrau known to fame

 xxxii
 many through reckless haste were drowned in seine
 for all too narrow was the bridge's floor
 an wished like icarus for wings in vain
 having grim death behind them and before
 save oliver and ogier hight the dane
 the paladins are prisoners to the moor
 wounded beneath his better shoulder fled
 the first that other with a broken head

 xxxiii
 and like orlando and duke aymon's son
 had faithful brandimart thrown up the game
 charles had from paris into exile gone
 if he had scaped alive so fierce a flame
 brandimart does his best and when 'tis done
 yields to the storm thus fortune fickle dame
 now smiles upon the paynim monarch who
 besieges royal charlemagne anew

 xxxiv
 from earth beneath the widow's outcry swells
 mingled with elder's and with orphan's prayer
 into the pure serene where michael dwells
 rising above this dim and troubled air
 and to the blest archangel loudly tells
 how the devouring wolf and raven tear
 his faithful english french and german train
 whose slaughtered bodies overspread the plain

 xxxv
 red blushed the blessed angel who believed
 he ill obedience to his lord had paid
 and in his anger deemed himself deceived
 by the perfidious discord and betrayed
 he his creator's order had received
 to stir the moors to strife nor had obeyed
 had rather in their eyes who marked the event
 appeared throughout to thwart his high intent

 xxxvi
 as servant faithful to his lord and more
 in love than memory strong who finds that he
 has that forgotten which at his heartcore
 as precious as his life and soul should be
 hastes to repair his error nor before
 he mend that fault again his lord will see
 so not to god st michael will ascend
 until he has achieved his holy end

 xxxvii
 again he to that monastery flew
 where whilom he had discord seen and there
 seated in chapter sees her while anew
 their yearly officers elected are
 she taking huge delight those friers to view
 that at each other hurled their books of prayer
 his hand within her locks the archangel twists
 and deals her endless scathe with feet and fists

 xxxviii
 on her he next a cross's handle broke
 wherewith her back and arms and head he plies
 his mercy with loud voice the wretch bespoke
 and hugged that angel's knees with suppliant cries
 michael suspends not the avenging stroke
 till hunted to the moorish camp she flies
 then thus "believe worse vengeance yet in store
 if i beyond these lines behold thee more"

 xxxix
 albeit in back and arms all over shent
 was discord by that angel in her fear
 of suffering yet again such chastisement
 such horrid fury and such blows severe
 she speedily to take her bellows went
 and adding food to what she lit whilere
 and setting other ready piles afire
 kindled in many hearts a blaze of ire

 xl
 and good rogero she inflames them so
 with rodomont and mandricardo fares
 to agramant and all since now the foe
 the paynims pressed no more the vantage theirs
 to him the seed of their dissensions show
 and what the bitter produce which it bears
 then to the judgment of the king refer
 who first in listed field his claim should stir

 xli
 as well marphisa to troyano's son
 relates her case and will conclude the fray
 which with the tartar king she had begun
 because by him provoked to that assay
 nor will she yield her place to any one
 no not a single hour yet less a day
 but with loud instances maintains her right
 with mandricardo first to wage the fight

 xlii
 to have the first possession of the field
 no less renowned king rodomont contended
 which he the african array to shield
 had interrupted and till now suspended
 rogero to king agramant appealed
 as having borne too long though sore offended
 that rodomont form him detained his horse
 nor yet would meet him first in martial course

 xliii
 the tartar king for more perplexity
 denied on any ground rogero's right
 the bearer of the whitewinged bird to be
 and was so passing wood with wrath and spite
 that if to this those others would agree
 he would at once those several quarrels fight
 and so those others would as well have done
 if agramant's consent they could have won

 xliv
 king agramant with prayer and kingly word
 had willingly appeased that jarring crew
 but since the foes were deaf to all accord
 nor would assent to peace or truce anew
 considered how at least he might afford
 the field of each of them in order due
 and as the best resolve at last decreed
 each should by lot possess the listed mead

 xlv
 four lots the monarch bade prepare which done
 this "rodomont and mandricardo" said
 "rogero and mandricardo" were in one
 in one "rogero and rodomont" were read
 that "mandricardo and marphisa" run
 next as the fickle goddess fortune led
 the lots are drawn and in the first appear
 the tartar king and sovereign of argier

 xlvi
 rogero and mandricardo for that play
 were next rogero and rodomont were third
 marphisa's lot and mardricardo's lay
 at bottom whence the dame was deeply stirred
 nor young rogero seems a whit more gay
 who knows the prowess of those two preferred
 will nothing in the listed combat leave
 for him or for marphisa to achieve

 xlvii
 there lies a place of paris little wide
 covering a mile or somewhat less and round
 like ancient theatre on every side
 encompast by a tall and solid mound
 with castle whilom was it fortified
 which sword and fire had levelled with the ground
 the parmesan like circle does survey
 whenever he to borgo wends his way

 xlviii
 in this place is prepared the listed mead
 which palisades of little height inclose
 a square of just proportions for that need
 with two capacious gates as usage goes
 the day on which to combat have agreed
 those valiant knights who will not balk their foes
 beside the palisades to left and right
 facing each entrance are pavilions pight

 xlix
 in that which looks towards the western sun
 is lodged the giant monarch of argier
 and him assist his serpenthide to don
 bold ferrau and circassia's cavalier
 gradasso and the puissant falsiron
 in that which fronts the morning hemisphere
 clothe with their hands in trojan plate and chain
 the good successor of king agricane

 l
 high on a throne of ample state appeared
 agramant and marsilius next in place
 were stordilane and all the chiefs revered
 throughout the squadrons of the paynim race
 happy was he who found himself upreared
 on mound or tree above that level space
 great was the throng and round the palisade
 on every side the eddying people swayed

 li
 were seated with the queen of fair castille
 queens princesses and dames of noble strain
 from arragon granada and seville
 and atlas' columns and amid the train
 assembled to behold that fierce appeal
 was placed the daughter of king stordilane
 two costly vests  one red one green  she wore
 but ill the first was dyed and faded sore

 lii
 in dress succinct marphisa sate in plight
 such as beseemed a warrior and a maid
 thermodoon haply witnessed hippolyte
 and her fair squadron in like garb arrayed
 afield already in his livery dight
 agramant's herald made proclaim and said
 it was forbid to all men far and wide
 in act or word with either part to side

 liii
 the frequent crowd expects the double foe
 and often in impatience they complain
 and call those famous cavaliers too slow
 when from the tartar's tent an angry strain
 is heard and cries which multiply sir know
 it was the martial king of sericane
 and puissant tartar who that question stirred
 and made the mighty tumult which has heard

 liv
 sericane's monarch having with his hand
 equipt the king of tartary all o'er
 approached to gird him with that sovereign brand
 with which orlando went adorned of yore
 when durindana on the hilt he scanned
 graved with the quartering that almontes wore
 which from that wretched man beside a font
 youthful orlando reft in aspramont

 lv
 he seeing this agnised it for the blade
 so famous which anglantes' warrior bore
 for which he had the fairest fleet arrayed
 which ever put to sea from eastern shore
 and had castille's rich kingdom overlaid
 and conquered fruitful france some years before
 but cannot now imagine how that sword
 is in possession of the tartar lord

 lvi
 and asks had he by force or treaty won
 and when and where and how that faulchion bright
 and mandricardo said that he had done
 fierce battle for that sword with brava's knight
 who feigned himself of sober sense foregone
 hoping that so he should conceal his fright
  "for i on him would ceaseless war have made"
 he added "while he kept the goodly blade"

 lvii
 saying the count in yielding to his foe
 that sword the beavers' known device had tried
 who followed closely by the hunter know
 their fell pursuer covers nought beside
 ere he had heard him out  "nor i forego
 that sword to thee nor any one" replied
 gradasso fierce "well earned by me at cost
 of treasure and of pain and people lost

 lviii
 "some other faulchion for thyself purvey
 this will i have nor deem my reasons new
 whether orlando wise or foolish stray
 i make it mine where'er it meets my view
 with none to witness thou beside the way
 usurped that sword i claim it as my due
 for this my scimeter shall reasons yield
 and we will try the cause in listed field

 lix
 "prepare to win the sword before thou rear
 that goodly blade against king rodomont
 to win his arms is use of cavalier
 before his foe in duel he affront"
  "no sweeter music ever soothes my ear"
 replied the tartar as he raised his front
 "than voice which champions me to martial field
 but see that his consent the sarzan yield

 lx
 "be thou the first and next on listed ground
 let sarza's valiant lord the question try
 nor doubt but i in readiness be found
 to thee and every other to reply"
 "  thou shalt not so the ordered lots confound
 or break our compact was rogero's cry
 either first rodomont shall take the field
 or shall to me his right of battle yield

 lxi
 "it that be true gradasso has averred
 that knight should win the arms he would assay
 thou hast no title to my whitewinged bird
 save this from me thou first shalt bear away
 but since forsooth whilere i said the word
 i will not what i once pronounced unsay
 that mine shall be the second battle so
 that argier's monarch first affront his foe

 lxii
 "i will confuse the order of the field
 throughout if partially confused by thee
 abandon will i not my blazoned shield
 unless thou combat for it now with me"
  "were one and the other mars for battle steeled
 replies enraged the king of tartary
 "nor one nor the other's might should make me waive
 my title to that shield and goodly glaive"

 lxiii
 and over mastered by his choler flies
 with a clenched fist at him of sericane
 and smites him with his righthand in such wise
 as makes him quit his hold of durindane
 gradasso bold was taken by surprise
 not deeming him so furious and insane
 and while he looked not to the tartar lord
 found himself robbed of good orlando's sword

 lxiv
 fury and scorn gradasso's visage heats
 which seems to flash with fire at that disgrace
 and with more rage and pain his bosom beats
 in that 'twas offered in such public place
 to draw his scimeter the king retreats
 intent upon revenge some little space
 so mandricardo on himself relies
 rogero he to fight as well defies

 lxv
 "come on in arms against me both combined
 and be king rodomont the third" he said
 "come spain and afric and all human kind
 ne'er will i turn" and he at nought dismaid
 so saying in his fury sawed the wind
 about him with almontes' noble blade
 embraced his shield and full of choler stood
 against gradasso and rogero good

 lxvi
 "leave me the care" the fierce gradasso cried
 "the phrensy of this madman to subdue"
  "not so by heaven" rogero wroth replied
 "for i this field claim justly as my due"
  "stand back" and "stand thou back" on either side
 they shout yet neither of the twain withdrew
 and thus among those three began a feud
 and thence some strange result would have ensued

 lxvii
 if many had not interposed and sought
 with little wit their fury to restrain
 who had wellnigh too dear the experience bought
 of saving others at their proper pain
 nor to accord the world had ever brought
 those knights but that the worthy king of spain
 came thither with renowned troyano's heir
 awed by whose sovereign presence all forbear

 lxviii
 agramant those contending warriors made
 the cause of their so burning strife display
 next earnestly bestirred himself and prayed
 gradasso that he would in courteous way
 concede the trojan hector's goodly blade
 to mandricardo solely for that day
 until the cruel fight was at an end
 wherein he should with rodomont contend

 lxix
 while royal agramant would peace restore
 and now with this and now with that conferred
 from the other tent between the sarzan moor
 and sacripant another strife was heard
 valiant king sacripant as said before
 to equip sir rodomont himself bestirred
 and he and ferrau had that champion drest
 in his forefather nimrod's iron vest

 lxx
 and there had they arrived where with his spume
 the horse was making his rich bridle white
 i of the good frontino speak for whom
 rogero urged with yet unfelt despite
 king sacripant who plays the part of groom
 and has to bring afield the sarzan knight
 marks narrowly the courser's gear and shoes
 and sell and furniture throughout reviews

 lxxi
 and as his points and nimble parts more near
 he in this view observes with better heed
 the youthful king beyond all doubt is clear
 he sees his frontilatte in that steed
 him he of old had held so passing dear
 whilom of such debates the fruitful seed
 and for whose loss whilere he was so woe
 he evermore on foot resolved to go

 lxxii
 this from beneath him had brunello borne
 before albracca on the very day
 angelica's rare ring and roland's horn
 and balisarda he conveyed away
 with fierce marphisa's blade  and on return
 to afric  to rogero from his prey
 gave balisarda and the courser who
 was by the child frontino named anew

 lxxiii
 assured 'twas no mistake circassia's chief
 turned him about to rodomont and cried
 "reft from me in albracca by a thief
 this horse is mine which might be certified
 by them whose words would warrant well belief
 but as my witnesses are distant wide
 if it be questioned i will make it plain
 and will with sword in hand the truth maintain

 lxxiv
 "yet am i well contented for that we
 have for these some few days together gone
 to lend him for today since well i see
 that not without him could the fight be done
 but on condition that the courser be
 acknowledged mine and furnished as a loan
 otherwise hope not for that horse save first
 me on this quarrel thou in combat worst"

 lxxv
 the furious king of argier that in pride
 surpassed all knights that ever girt the sword
 whose paragon for heart and prowess tried
 meseems no ancient histories record
 cried "sacripant if any one beside
 thyself to me should utter such a word
 he should deem quickly from its bitter fruit
 he from his birth would better have been mute

 lxxvi
 "but for that fellowship in which we went
 as thou hast said together i to show
 such patience and forbearance am content
 as warning thee thy purpose to forego
 until thou shalt have witnessed the event
 of strife between me and my tartar foe
 when him i such example hope to make
 that thou shalt humbly say `the courser take' "

 lxxvii
 fierce and enraged replied circassia's peer
 "to play the churl with thee is courteous deed
 but i to thee repeat more plain and clear
 thou ill wouldst aught design against that steed
 for while i an avenging sabre rear
 this i prohibit thee and should it need
 and every better means of battle fail
 with thee for this would battle tooth and nail"

 lxxviii
 they from dispute proceed to ribaldry
 from words to blows and through their mickle ire
 fierce battle was inflamed and blazed more high
 than ever lightlykindled straw took fire
 king rodomont is steeled in panoply
 sacripant neither plate nor mail attire
 yet so in fence is skilled that nimble lord
 he seems all over sheltered by his sword

 lxxix
 no greater were the daring and the might
 though infinite which rodomont displaid
 than the precaution and the nimble sleight
 which the circassian summoned to his aid
 no millwheel ever turns with swifter flight
 the circling stone by which the grain is brayed
 than sacripant at need moves foot or hand
 and shifts now here now there his restless stand

 lxxx
 but serpentine and ferrau interfere
 they with drawn swords the twain asunder bore
 with them grandonio was and isolier
 and many other leaders of the moor
 this was the tumult which was heard whilere
 in the other tent what time they laboured sore
 rogero vainly to a peace to bring
 with tartary's and sericana's king

 lxxxi
 this while some voice to agramant the news
 reports aright that ulien's might seed
 with sacripant circassia's king pursues
 a fierce and furious quarrel for the steed
 agramant whom so many jars confuse
 exclaims to king marsilius "take thou heed
 that no worse evil mid these knights betide
 while for this new disorder i provide"

 lxxxii
 rodomont reined his anger and retired
 some deal at his approaching sovereign's view
 nor less respect in sacripant inspired
 the moorish monarch of the furious two
 he with grave voice and royal mien inquired
 what cause of strife such deadly discord blew
 and having searched their quarrel to the root
 would fain accord them but with little fruit

 lxxxiii
 circassia's monarch would not on his side
 longer his horse to argier's lord allow
 save humbly rodomont to him applied
 that steed for this occasion to bestow
 to him sir rodomont with wonted pride
 returned for answer "neither heaven nor thou
 shall make me recognize as gift or loan
 what i with this good hand can make mine own"

 lxxxiv
 the king bade sacripant explain his right
 and how that horse was taken from him sought
 and this from first to last circassia's knight
 rehearsed and reddened as the tale he taught
 relating to the king the robber's sleight
 who had surprised him overwhelmed with thought
 upon four spears his courser's saddle stayed
 and from beneath the naked horse conveyed

 lxxxv
 marphisa whom these cries mid others bring
 when of the robbery of the horse advised
 in visage is disturbed remembering
 how on that day her faulchion was surprised
 and when that courser which equipt with wing
 appeared when flying her she recognized
 and recognized as well  at first unknown 
 the valiant king who filled circassia's throne

 lxxxvi
 the others who stood round her wont to hear
 brunello often boast of the deceit
 'gan turn towards that wretch and made appear
 by open signs they knew him for the cheat
 marphisa who the subtle knave whilere
 suspected as the author of that feat
 now questions this now that who all accord
 in saying 'twas brunello stole her sword

 lxxxvii
 who well deserving as a fitting pain
 to dangle from the gallowstree in air
 by agramant the crown of tingitane
 an ill example was preferred to wear
 this fires anew marphisa's old disdain
 nor she from instant vengeance will forbear
 for this as well as other shame and scorn
 she on her road had from that caitiff born

 lxxxviii
 a squire laced on her helmet at her hest
 she wore the remnant of her armour sheen
 nor without martial cuirass on her breast
 find i that she ten times was ever seen
 even from the day when first that iron vest
 braced on her limbs the passingvaliant queen
 with helm on head where mid the highest rows
 brunello sits among the first she goes

 lxxxix
 him by mid breast marphisa griped amain
 and lifted up the losel from the ground
 as is rapacious eagle wont to strain
 the pullet in her talons circled round
 and bore him where the sons of king troyane
 heard the two knights their jarring claims propound
 he who perceives himself in evil hands
 aye weeps and mercy of that maid demands

 xc
 above the universal noise and shout
 which rose nigh equally on either side
 brunello who from all the crowd about
 for pity now and now for succour cried
 so loud was heard that of that ample rout
 he gathered round himself the pressing tide
 arrived before the moorish army's head
 to him with haughty mien marphisa said

 xci
 "this thief said she thy vassal will i slay
 and with this hand of mine will knot the cord
 about his neck because the very day
 he stole this courser he purloined my sword
 but is there any one who deems i say
 amiss let him stand forth and speak the word
 for i on him will prove before thine eyes
 i have done right and who gainsays me lies

 xcii
 "but because haply some one may pretend
 i have till such a time of strife delayed
 my vengeance when such famous knights contend
 for three days shall the wretch's doom be stayed
 in the mean time let him who would defend
 that caitiff come himself or send him aid
 for afterwards if none the deed prevent
 his carcass shall a thousand birds content

 xciii
 "i hence to yonder tower which distant nigh
 three leagues o'erlooks a little copse repair
 but with one varlet in my company
 and with one waitingmaid if any dare
 rescue the thief let him come thither i
 wait the approach of his defenders there"
 thus she and thither quickly wends her ways
 whither was said nor any answer stays

 xciv
 held on the pommel grappled by his hair
 brunello on marphisa's courser lies
 the caitiff weeps and shrieking in despair
 on all in whom he hopes for succour cries
 in such confusion is troyano's heir
 he sees no way through these perplexities
 and that marphisa thence brunello bore
 in such a guise yet grieved the monarch more

 xcv
 not that he loved the losel or esteemed
 rather to him some time had borne despite
 and often had to hand the caitiff schemed
 since he had forfeited the ring of might
 but here his honour touched the monarch deemed
 so that his visage reddened at the slight
 he would in person follow her at speed
 and to his utmost power avenge the deed

 xcvi
 but the wise king sobrino who was by
 him from the quest endeavoured to dissuade
 and that with his exalted majesty
 such enterprize were ill assorted said
 although firm hope nay full security
 he had to overcome that martial maid
 if he with pain subdued a woman shame
 rather than honour would pursue his name

 xcvii
 small profit and much peril would succeed
 from any fight he should with her maintain
 and he advised him as the better deed
 to leave that wretched caitiff to his pain
 and albeit but a simple nod should need
 to free him from that nod he should refrain
 in that the monarch would do ill to force
 evenhanded justice from her destined course

 xcviii
 "thou to the fierce marphisa may'st apply
 to leave his trial he pursued to thee
 with promise her in this to satisfy
 and to suspend him from the gallowstree
 and even should the maid thy prayer deny
 let her in every wish contented be
 and rather than that she desert thy side
 let her hang him and every thief beside"

 xcix
 right willingly king agramant gave way
 to king sobrino's counsel sage and staid
 and let renowned marphisa wend her way
 nor scathed he nor let scathe that martial maid
 neither endured that any her should pray
 and heaven knows with what courage he obeyed
 that wise advice to calm such ruder strife
 and quarrel as throughout his camp were rife

 c
 at this mad discord laughed no more in fear
 that any truce or treaty should ensue
 and scowered the place of combat there and here
 nor could stand still for pleasure at the view
 pride gamboled and rejoiced with her compeer
 and on the fire fresh food and fuel threw
 and shouted so that michael in the sky
 knew the glad sign of conquest in that cry

 ci
 paristown rocked and turbid ran the flood
 of seine at that loud voice that horrid roar
 and so it echo rang in arden's wood
 beasts left their caverns in that forest hoar
 alp and cevenne's mountainsolitude
 and blois and arles and rouen's distant shore
 rhine rhone and saone and garonne heard the pest
 scared mothers hugged their children to their breast

 cii
 five have set up their rest resolved to be
 the first their different quarrels to conclude
 and tangled so is one with other plea
 that ill apollo's self could judge the feud
 to unravel that first cause of enmity
 the king began  the strife which had ensued
 because of beauteous doralice between
 the king of scythia and her algerine

 ciii
 king agramant oft moved between the pair
 now here now there to bring them to accord
 now there now here admonishing that pair
 like faithful brother and like righteous lord
 but when he found that neither would forbear
 deaf and rebellious to his royal word
 nor would consent that lady to forego
 the cause of strife in favour of his foe

 civ
 as his best lore at length the monarch said
 and to obey his sentence both were fain
 that he who was by her preferred should wed
 the beauteous daughter of king stordilane
 and that what was established on his head
 should not be changed to either's loss or gain
 the compromise was liked on either side
 since either hoped she would for him decide

 cv
 the mighty king of sarza who long space
 before the tartar had loved doralice
 who had preferred that sovereign to such grace
 as modest lady may nor do amiss
 believed when she past sentence on the case
 she must pronounce what would ensure his bliss
 nor thus alone king rodomont conceived
 but all the moorish host with him believed

 cvi
 all know what exploits wrought by him had been
 for her in joust and war they all unsound
 and weak king mandricardo's judgment ween
 but he who oft was with her on their round
 and oftener private with the youthful queen
 what time the telltale sun was under ground
 he knowing well how sure he was to speed
 laughed at the silly rabble's idle creed

 cvii
 they after ratify the king's award
 between his hands and next the suitors twain
 before that damsel go that on the sward
 fixing her downcast eyes in modest vein
 avows her preference of the tartar lord
 at which sore wondering stand the paynim train
 and rodomont remains so sore astound
 he cannot raise his visage from the ground

 cviii
 but wonted anger chasing shame which dyed
 the sarzan's face all over he arraigned
 the damsel's sentence of the faulchion tied
 about his manly waist the handle strained
 and in the king's and others' hearing cried
 "by this the question shall be lost or gained
 and not by faithless woman's fickle thought
 which thither still inclines where least it ought"

 cix
 kind mandricardo on his feet once more
 exclaims "and be it as it pleases thee"
 so that ere yet the vessel made the shore
 unploughed remained a mighty space of sea
 but that this king reproved the sarzan sore
 ruling that to appeal upon that plea
 no more with mandricardo could avail
 and made the moody sarzan strike his sail

 cx
 branded with double scorn before those peers
 by noble agramant whose sovereign sway
 he as in loyal duty bound reveres
 and by his lady on the selfsame day
 there will no more the monarch of algiers
 abide but of his band  a large array 
 two serjeants only for his service takes
 and with that pair the paynim camp forsakes

 cxi
 as the afflicted bull who has foregone
 his heifer nor can longer warfare wage
 seeks out the greenwoodholt and stream most lone
 or sands at distance from his pasturage
 there ceases not in sun or shade to moan
 yet not for that exhales his amorous rage
 so parts constrained his lady to forego
 the king of argier overwhelmed with woe

 cxii
 rogero moved his courser to regain
 and had already donned his warlike gear
 then recollecting that on listed plain
 at mandricardo he must couch the spear
 followed not rodomont but turned his rein
 to end his quarrel with the tartar ere
 he met in combat sericana's lord
 within close barriers for orlando's sword

 cxiii
 to have frontino ravished in his sight
 and be unable to forbid the deed
 he sorely grieves but when he shall that fight
 have done resolves he will regain the steed
 but sacripant whom like the youthful knight
 no quarrels in the moor's pursuit impede
 and who was unengaged in other quest
 upon the sarzan's footsteps quickly prest

 cxiv
 and would have quickly joined him that was gone
 but for the chance of an adventure rare
 which him detained until the day was done
 and made him lose the track of ulien's heir
 a woman who had fallen into the saone
 and who without his help had perished there
 the warrior drowning in that water found
 and stemmed the stream and dragged the dame aground

 cxv
 when afterwards he would remount the sell
 from him his restless charger broke astray
 who fled before his lord till evening fell
 nor lightly did the king that courser stay
 at last he caught him but no more could spell
 where he had wandered from the beaten way
 two hundred miles he roved 'twist hill and plain
 ere he came up with rodomont again

 cxvi
 how he by sacripant was overtaken
 and fought by him to his discomfit sore
 and how he lost his courser how was taken
 i say not now who have to say before
 with what disdain and with what anger shaken
 against his liege and love the sarzan moor
 forth from the saracen cantonments sped
 and what he of the one and other said

 cxvii
 wherever that afflicted paynim goes
 he fills the kindling air with sighs that burn
 and echo oft for pity of his woes
 with him from hollow rock is heard to mourn
 "o female mind how lightly ebbs and flows
 your fickle mood" he cries "aye prone to turn
 object most opposite to kindly faith
 lost wretched man who trusts you to his scathe

 cxviii
 "neither my love nor length of servitude
 though by a thousand proofs to you made clear
 had power even so to fix your faithless mood
 that you at least so lightly should not veer
 nor am i quitted because less endued
 with worth than mandricardo i appear
 nor for your conduct cause can i declare
 save this alone that you a woman are

 cxix
 "i think that nature and an angry god
 produced thee to the world thou wicked sex
 to be to man a plague a chastening rod
 happy wert thou not present to perplex
 so serpent creeps along the grassy sod
 so bear and ravening wolf the forest vex
 wasp fly and gadfly buzz in liquid air
 and the rich grain lies tangled with the tare

 cxx
 "why has not bounteous nature willed that man
 should be produced without the aid of thee
 as we the pippin pear and service can
 engraft by art on one another's tree
 but she directs not all by certain plan
 rather upon a nearer view i see
 in naming her she ill can act aright
 since nature is herself a female hight

 cxxi
 "yet be not therefore proud and full of scorn
 women because man issues from your seed
 for roses also blossom on the thorn
 and the fair lily springs from loathsome weed
 despiteous proud importunate and lorn
 of love of faith of counsel rash in deed
 with that ungrateful cruel and perverse
 and born to be the world's eternal curse"

 cxxii
 these plaints and countless others to the wind
 poured forth the paynim knight to fury stirred
 now easing in low tone his troubled mind
 and now in sounds which were at distance heard
 in shame and in reproach of womankind
 yet certes he from sober reason erred
 for we may deem a hundred good abound
 where one or two perchance are evil found

 cxxiii
 though none for whom i hitherto have sighed
  of those so many  have kept faith with me
 all with ingratitude or falsehood dyed
 i deem not i accuse my destiny
 many there are and have been more beside
 unmeriting reproach but if there be
 'mid hundreds one or two of evil way
 my fortune wills that i should be their prey

 cxxiv
 yet will i make such search before i die
 rather before my hair shall wax more white
 that haply on some future day even i
 shall say "that one has kept her promise plight"
 and should not the event my trust belie
 nor am i hopeless i with all my might
 will with unwearied pain her praise rehearse
 with pen and ink and voice in prose and verse

 cxxv
 the saracen whom rage no less profound
 against his sovereign lord than lady swayed
 and who of reason thus o'erpast the bound
 and ill of one and of the other said
 would fain behold that monarch's kingdom drowned
 with such a tempest with such scathe o'erlaid
 as should in africk every house aggrieve
 nor one stone standing on another leave

 cxxvi
 and would that from his realm in want and woe
 king agramant a mendicant should wend
 that through his means the monarch brought thus low
 his fathers' ancient seat might reascend
 and thus he might the fruit of fealty show
 and make his sovereign see a real friend
 was aye to be preferred in wrong or right
 although the world against him should unite

 cxxvii
 and thus the saracen pours forth his moan
 with rage against his liege and love possest
 and on his way is by long journeys gone
 giving himself and courser little rest
 the following day or next upon the saone
 he finds himself who has his course addrest
 towards the coast of provence with design
 to his african domain to cross the brine

 cxxviii
 from bank to bank the stream was covered o'er
 with boat of little burden which conveyed
 for the supply of the invading moor
 victual from many places round purveyed
 since even from paris to the pleasant shore
 of acquamorta all his rule obeyed
 and  fronting spain  whate'er of level land
 was seen extending on the better hand

 cxxix
 the victual disembarked from loaded barge
 was laid on sumpterhorse or ready wain
 and sent with escort to protect the charge
 where barges could not come about the plain
 fat herds were feeding on the double marge
 brought thither from the march of either reign
 and by the riverside at close of day
 in different homesteads lodged the drovers lay

 cxxx
 the king of argier for the dusky air
 of night began upon the world to close
 here listened to a villagelandlord's prayer
 that in his inn besought him to repose
  his courser stalled  the board with plenteous fare
 is heaped and corsic wine and grecian flows
 for in all else a moor the sarzan drank
 of the forbidden vintage like a frank

 cxxxi
 to warlike rodomont with goodly cheer
 and kindlier mien the landlord honour paid
 for he the port of an illustrious peer
 in his guest's lofty presence saw pourtrayed
 but sore beside himself the cavalier
 had scarce his heart within him which had strayed
 to her  whilere his own  in his despite
 nor word escaped the melancholy knight

 cxxxii
 mine host most diligent in his vocation
 of all the trade who throughout france were known
 in that he had 'mid strange and hostile nation
 and every chance of warfare kept his own
  prompt to assist him in his occupation
 some of his kin had called whereof was none
 who dared before the warrior speak of aught
 seeing that paynim mute and lost in thought

 cxxxiii
 from thought to thought the sarzan's fancy flies
 himself removed from thence a mighty space
 who sits so bent and with such downcast eyes
 he never once looks any in the face
 next after silence long and many sighs
 as if deep slumber had but then given place
 his spirits he recalls his eyelids raises
 and on the family and landlord gazes

 cxxxiv
 then silence broke and with a milder air
 and visage somewhat less disturbed applied
 to him the host and those bystanders there
 to know if any to a wife were tied
 and landlord and attendants  that all were
 to sarza's moody cavalier replied
 he asked what each conceited of his spouse
 and if he deemed her faithful to her vows

 cxxxv
 except mine host those others were agreed
 that chaste and good their consorts they believed
  "think each man as he will but well i read"
 the landlord said "you fondly are deceived
 your rash replies to one conclusion lead
 that you are all of common sense bereaved
 and so too must believe this noble knight
 unless he would persuade us black is white

 cxxxvi
 "because as single is that precious bird
 the phoenix and on earth there is but one
 so in this ample world it is averred
 one only can a woman's treason shun
 each hopes alike to be that wight preferred
 the victor who that single palm has won
  how is it possible that what can fall
 to one alone should be the lot of all

 cxxxvii
 "erewhile i made the same mistake as you
 and that more dames than one were virtuous thought
 until a gentleman of venice who
 for my good fortune to this inn was brought
 my ignorance by his examples true
 so ably schooled he better wisdom taught
 valerio was the name that stranger bore
 a name i shall remember evermore

 cxxxviii
 "of wives and mistresses the treachery
 was known to him with all their cunning lore
 he both from old and modern history
 and from his own was ready with such store
 as plainly showed that none to modesty
 could make pretension whether rich or poor
 and that if one appeared of purer strain
 'twas that she better hid her wanton vein

 cxxxix
 "he of his many tales among the rest
 whereof a third is from my memory gone
 so well one story in my head imprest
 it could not be more firmly graved in stone
 and what i thought and think would be professed
 for that ill sex i ween by every one
 who heard and sir  if pleased to lend an ear 
 to their confusion yon that tale shall hear"

 cxl
 "what could'st thou offer which could better please
 at present" made reply the paynim knight
 "than sample chosen from thine histories
 which hits the opinion that i hold aright
 that i may hear thee speak with better ease
 sit so that i may have thee in my sight"
 but in the following canto i unfold
 what to king rodomont the landlord told


 canto 28

 argument
 to whatsoever evil tongue can tell
 of womankind king rodomont gives ear
 then journeys homeward but that infidel
 finds by the way a place he holds more dear
 here him new love inflames for isabel
 but so the wishes of the cavalier
 a friar impedes who with that damsel wends
 him by a cruel death the felon ends


 i
 ladies and all of you that ladies prize
 afford not for the love of heaven an ear
 to this the landlord's tale replete with lies
 in shame and scorn of womankind though ne'er
 was praise or fame conveyed in that which flies
 from such a caitiff's tongue and still we hear
 the sottish rabble all things rashly brand
 and question most what least they understand

 ii
 omit this canto and  the tale untold 
 my story will as clear and perfect be
 i tell it since by turpin it is told
 and not in malice or in rivalry
 besides that never did my tongue withhold
 your praises how you are beloved by me
 to you i by a thousand proofs have shown
 vouching i am and can but be your own

 iii
 let him who will three leaves or four passby
 nor read a line or let him who will read
 as little of that landlord's history
 as of a tale or fiction make his creed
 but to my story  when his auditory
 he saw were waiting for him to proceed
 and that a place was yielded him o'eright
 the cavalier he 'gan his tale recite

 iv
 "astolpho that the lombard sceptre swayed
 who was king monacho his brother's heir
 by nature with such graces was purveyed
 few e'er with him in beauty could compare
 such scarce apelles' pencil had pourtrayed
 zeuxis' or worthier yet if worthier were
 beauteous he was and so by all was deemed
 but far more beauteous he himself esteemed

 v
 "he not so much rejoiced that he in height
 of grandeur was exalted o'er the rest
 and that for riches subjects and for might
 of all the neighbouring kings he was the best
 as that superior to each other wight
 he beauty was throughout the world confest
 this pleased the monarch who the praise conferred
 as that wherein he most delighted heard

 vi
 "faustus latinus one of his array
 who pleased the king a roman cavalier
 hearing ofttimes astolpho now display
 the beauties of his hand now of his cheer
 and questioned by that monarch on a day
 if ever in his lifetime far or near
 he any of such beauty had espied
 to him thus unexpectedly replied

 vii
 "faustus to him replied `by what i see
 and what i hear is said by every one
 few are there that in beauty rival thee
 and rather i those few confine to one
 jocundo is that one my brother he
 and well i ween that saving him alone
 thou leavest all in beauty far behind
 but i in him thy peer and better find'

 viii
 "impossible astolpho deemed the thing
 who hitherto had thought the palm his own
 and such a longing seized the lombard king
 to know that youth whose praises so were blown
 he prest till faustus promised him to bring
 the brother praised by him before his throne
 though 'twould be much if thither he repaired
 the courier added and the cause declared

 ix
 "because the youth had ne'er been known to measure
 in all his life a single pace from rome
 but on what fortune gave him lived at leisure
 contented in his own paternal dome
 nor had diminished nor encreased the treasure
 wherewith his father had endowed that home
 and he more distant would paris deem
 than tanais another would esteem

 x
 "and that a greater difficulty were
 to tear jocundo from his consort who
 was by such love united to that fair
 no other will but hers the husband knew
 yet at his sovereign's hest he would repair
 to seek the stripling and his utmost do
 the suit with offers and with gifts was crowned
 which for that youth's refusal left no ground

 xi
 "faustus set forth and after few days' ride
 reached rome and his paternal mansion gained
 there with entreaties so the brother plied
 he to that journey his consent obtained
 and wrought so well though difficult to guide
 silent even young jocundo's wife remained
 he showing her what good would thence ensue
 besides what gratitude would be her due

 xii
 "jocundo names a time to wend his way
 and servingmen meanwhile purveys and steeds
 and a provision makes of fair array
 for beauty borrows grace from glorious weeds
 beside him or about him night and day
 aye weeping to her lord the lady reads
 she knows not how she ever can sustain
 so long an absence and not die with pain

 xiii
 "for the mere thought produced such misery
 it seemed from her was ravished her heart's core
  `alas my love jocundo cried let be
 thy sorrows'  weeping with her evermore 
 `so may this journey prosper as to thee
 will i return ere yet two months are o'er
 nor by a day o'erpass the term prescribed
 though me the king with half his kingdom bribed'

 xiv
 "this brought his troubled consort small content
 she that the period was too distant said
 and that 'twould be a mighty wonderment
 if her at his return he found not dead
 the grief which day and night her bosom rent
 was such that lady neither slept nor fed
 so that for pity oft the youth repented
 he to his brother's wishes had consented

 xv
 "she from her neck unloosed a costly chain
 that a gemmed cross and holy reliques bore
 which one a pilgrim of bohemia's reign
 had gathered upon many a distant shore
 him did her sire in sickness entertain
 returning from jerusalem of yore
 and hence was made that dying pilgrim's heir
 this she undoes and gives her lord to wear

 xvi
 "and round his neck entreats him for her sake
 that chain in memory of herself to wind
 her gift the husband is well pleased to take
 not that a token needs his love to bind
 for neither time nor absence e'er will shake
 nor whatsoever fortune is behind
 her memory which rooted fast and deep
 he still has kept and after death will keep

 xvii
 "the night before that morning streaked the sky
 fixt for his journey to his sore dismay
 her husband deemed that in his arms would die
 the wife from whom he was to wend his way
 she slumbered not to her a last goodbye
 he bade while yet it lacked an hour of day
 mounted his nag and on his journey sped
 while his afflicted spouse returned to bed

 xviii
 "jocundo was not two miles on his road
 when he that jewelled cross recalled to mind
 which he beneath his pillow had bestowed
 and through forgetfulness had left behind
 `alas the youth bethought him in what mode
 shall i excuse for my omission find
 so that from this my consort shall not deem
 i little her unbounded love esteem

 xix
 "he pondered an excuse then weened' twould be
 of little value if it were exprest
 by page or other  save his embassy
 he did himself his brother he addrest
 `  now to baccano ride you leisurely
 and there at the first inn setup your rest
 for i must back to rome without delay
 but trust to overtake you by the way

 xx
 " `no other but myself my need could do
 doubt not but i shall speedily be back'
  no servant took he but with an adieu
 jocundo at a trot wheeled round his hack
 and when that cavalier the stream was through
 the rising sun 'gan chase the dusky rack
 at home he lighted sought his bed and found
 the consort he had quitted sleeping sound

 xxi
 "he without saying aught the curtains drew
 and what he least believed within espied
 for he beneath the quilt his consort true
 and chaste saw sleeping at a stripling's side
 forthwith jocundo that adulterer knew
 by practice of his features certified
 in that he was a footboy in his train
 nourished by him and come of humble strain

 xxii
 "to imagine his distress and wonderment
 and warrant it that other may believe
 is better than to make the experiment
 and like this wretch the cruel proof receive
 by anger stirred it was his first intent
 to draw his sword and both of life bereave
 but love which spite himself he entertained
 for that ungrateful woman him restrained

 xxiii
 "you see if like a vassal he obeyed
 this ribald love who left him not the force
 to wake her lest to know her guilt surveyed
 should in his consort's bosom move remorse
 as best he could he forth in silence made
 the stair descended and regained his horse
 goaded by love he goads his steed again
 and ere they reach their inn rejoins his train

 xxiv
 "his change of mien to all was manifest
 all saw his heart was heavy yet not one
 mid these in any sort the reason guessed
 nor read the secret woe which caused his moan
 all thought he had to rome his steps addrest
 woe to the town surnamed of horns had gone
 that love has caused the mischief all surmise
 though none of them conjectures in what wise

 xxv
 "his brother weened he was in grief immersed
 for his deserted wife he on his side
 for other reason inly chafed and cursed
  that she was but too well accompanied
 meanwhile with swelling lips and forehead pursed
 the ground that melancholy stripling eyed
 faustus who vainly would apply relief
 ill cheered him witless what had caused his grief

 xxvi
 "he for his sore an evil salve had found
 and where he should retire encreased his woes
 who with the mention of his wife that wound
 inflamed and opened which he sought to close
 he rests not night nor day in sorrow drowned
 his appetite is gone with his repose
 ne'er to return and whilom of such fame
 his lovely visage seems no more the same

 xxvii
 "his eyeballs seem deepburied in his head
 his nose seems grown  his cheeks are pined so sore 
 nor even remains his beauty so is fled
 enough to warrant what he was before
 such fever burns him of his sorrow bred
 he halts on arbia's and on arno's shore
 and if a charm is left 'tis faded soon
 and withered like a rosebud plucked at noon

 xxviii
 "besides that faustus sorrowed to descry
 him so bested worse cause for sorrowing
 was to that courtier to appear to lie
 before astolpho he was pledged to bring
 one that was fairest deemed in every eye
 who must appear the foulest to that king
 yet he continued on his way to wend
 and brought him to pavia in the end

 xxix
 "not that forthwith he lets the youth be seen
 lest him the king of little wit arraign
 he first by his dispatches lets him ween
 that thither he jocundo brings with pain
 saying that of his beauteous air and mien
 some secret cause of grief had been the bane
 accompanied by a distemper sore
 so that he seemed not what he was before

 xxx
 "glad was the monarch of his coming taught
 as of a friend's arrival he could be
 since in the universal world was nought
 that he so much desired as him to see
 nor was the lombard's king displeased in ought
 to mark his guest's inferiority
 though but for his misfortune it was clear
 he his superior would have been or peer

 xxxi
 "lodged by him in his palace every day
 and every hour the stranger youth he sees
 studious to honour him and bids purvey
 store of provision for his better ease
 while still his thoughts to his ill consort stray
 jocundo languishes nor pastimes please
 that melancholy man nor music's strain
 one jot diminishes his ceaseless pain

 xxxii
 "above his chambers on the upper floor
 nearest the roof there was an ancient hall
 thither in solitary mood for sore
 pastime and company the stripling gall
 he aye betakes himself while evermore
 sad thoughts some newer cause of grief recall
 he here who would believe the story found
 a remedy unhoped which made him sound

 xxxiii
 "at that hall's farther end more feebly lighted
 for windows ever closed shut out the day
 where one wall with another ill united
 he through the chink beheld a brighter ray
 there laid his eye and saw what he had slighted
 as hard to credit were it but hearsay
 he hears it not but this himself descries
 yet hardly can believe his very eyes

 xxxiv
 "he of the queen's apartment here was sight
 her choicest and her priviest chamber where
 was never introduced whatever wight
 save he most faithful was esteemed he there
 as he was peeping saw an uncouth fight
 a dwarf was wrestling with the royal fair
 and such that champion's skill though undergrown
 he in the strife his opposite had thrown

 xxxv
 "as in a dream jocundo stood beside
 himself awhile of sober sense bereaved
 nor but when of the matter certified
 and sure it was no dream his sight believed
  `a scorned and crooked monster' then he cried
 `is as her conqueror by a dame received
 wife of the comeliest of the curtiest wight
 and greatest monarch oh what appetite'

 xxxvi
 "and he the consort to whom he was wed
 her he most used to blame recalled to mind
 and for the stripling taken to her bed
 to deem the dame less culpable inclined
 less of herself than sex the fault he read
 which to one man could never be confined
 and thought if in one taint all women shared
 at least his had not with a monster paired

 xxxvii
 "to the same place jocundo made return
 at the same hour upon the following day
 and putting on the king the selfsame scorn
 again beheld that dwarf and dame at play
 and so upon the next and following morn
 for  to conclude  they made no holiday
 while she what most jocundo's wonder moved
 the pigmy for his little love reproved

 xxxviii
 "one day amid the rest the youth surveyed
 the dame disordered and opprest with gloom
 having twice summoned by her waitingmaid
 the favoured dwarf who yet delayed to come
 a third time by the lady sent she said
  `engaged at play madonna is the groom
 nor lest he lose a doit his paltry stake
 will that discourteous churl his game forsake'

 xxxix
 "at such strange spectacle the roman knight
 cleared up his brow his visage and his eyes
 he jocund as in name became in sprite
 and changed his tears for smiles with altered guise
 he waxed ruddy gay and plump in plight
 and seems a cherubim of paradise
 so that such change with wonderment all see
 brother and king and royal family

 xl
 "if from the youth astolpho wished to know
 from whence this sudden light of comfort came
 no less jocundo this desired to show
 and to the king such injury proclaim
 but willed that like himself he should forego
 revenge upon the author of that shame
 hence that he might discern her guilt yet spare
 he made him on the agnus dei swear

 xli
 "he made him swear that he for nothing said
 or seen which might to him displeasing be
 though he in what he should discover read
 an outrage offered to his majesty
 would now or ever venge him on his head
 moreover him he bound to secrecy
 that the ill doer ne'er through deed or word
 might guess his injured king that case had heard

 xlii
 "the monarch who to every thing beside
 could better have given credit freely swore
 to him the cause jocundo signified
 why he had many days lamenting sore
  because he had his evil wife espied
 in the embraces of a serjeant poor
 and vowed he should in fine have died of grief
 if he for longer time had lacked relief

 xliii
 "but that within his highness' palace said
 he had witnessed what had much appeased his woe
 for if foul shame had fallen upon his head
 at least he was not single saying so
 he to that chink the lombard monarch led
 who spied the mannikin of hideous show
 lines 7 & 8 untranslated by rose

 xliv
 "you may believe he shameless deemed that act
 without my swearing it he at the sight
 it seemed would go distraught  with fury racked
 he against every wall his head would smite 
 would cry aloud  would break the solemn pact
 yet kept parforce the promise he had plight
 and gulped his anger down and bitter scorn
 since on the holy water he had sworn

 xlv
 "then to jocundo `what remains to me
 to do in this misfortune brother speak
 since vengeance with more noted cruelty
 thou wilt not let me on the sinners wreak'
 jocundo answered `let these ingrates be
 and try we if all women are as weak
 and if the wives of others can be won
 to do what others by our own have done

 xlvi
 " `both fair and youthful measured by this scale
 nor easily our equals shall we find
 what woman but to us shall strike her sail
 if even to the ugly these are kind
 at least if neither youth nor grace avail
 the money may with which our bags are lined
 nor will i that we homeward more return
 ere the chief spoils we from a thousand earn

 xlvii
 " `long absence seeing with a distant part
 converse with different women oft allay
 as it would seem the troubles of a heart
 whereof love's angry passions make their prey'
 the king is pleased to hear the youth impart
 this counsel nor his journey will delay
 thence on their road with but two squires beside
 he and the roman knight together ride

 xlviii
 "disguised they go through france and italy
 they flanders next and england scower and where
 a woman they of lovely visage spy
 aye find the dame complaint with their prayer
 they upon some bestow what others buy
 and oft replaced their squandered treasures are
 our travellers to the wives of many sued
 and by as many other dames were wooed

 xlix
 "by solid proof those comrades ascertain
 here tarrying for a month and there for two
 that their own wives are of no other vein
 than those of others and as chast and true
 after some season wearied are the twain
 with ever running after something new
 for without risk of death thus evermore
 the intruders ill could enter other's door

 l
 " 'twere best to find a girl whose natural bent
 and face to both of us should pleasing be
 a girl that us in common might content
 nor we in her find cause for jealousy
 and wherefore wouldst thou that i should lament
 more than with other to go halves with thee'
 exclaimed astolpho `well i know is none
 of all the female sex content with one

 li
 " `one damsel that in nought shall us constrain
  then only when disposed to please the fair 
 will we in peace and pleasure entertain
 nor we about her have dispute or care
 nor deem i she with reason could complain
 for if two fell to every other's share
 better than one might she keep faith with two
 nor haply we such frequent discord view'

 lii
 "much seems the king's proposal to content
 the roman youth and thus it is the twain
 to execute astolpho's project bent
 journey by many a hill and many a plain
 and find at last well fitting their intent
 the daughter of a publican of spain
 of presence and of manners framed to win
 whose father at valencia kept his inn

 liii
 as yet upon the bloom of spring the maid
 was a fresh flower that scarce began to blow
 her sire with many children was o'erlaid
 and was to poverty a mortal foe
 hence 'tis an easy matter to persuade
 mine host his buxom daughter to forego
 and let them where they will the damsel bear
 in that to treat her well the travellers swear

 they to zattiva come upon the day
 that from valencia they had bent their way

 lv
 "the travellers from their inn to street and square
 and places public and divine resort
 who wheresoever they had made repair
 themselves were so accustomed to disport
 the girl is with the valets left in care
 who make the beds and wearied hackneys sort
 while others in the hostelkitchen dight
 the meal against their lords' return at night

 lvi
 "as groom a stripling in the hostel plied
 who in the other landlord's house had been
 he from her childhood at the damsel's side
 had joyed her love they without change of mien
 on meeting closely one another eyed
 since either apprehended to be seen
 but when alone  now left together  raised
 their eyelids and on one another gazed

 lvii
 "the stripling asked her whitherward they sped
 and of the two which claimed her as his right
 this point by point to him flammetta read
 flammetta she the greek that boy was hight
 `  when i had hoped the time was coming' said
 the greek  `that i should live with thee my light
 flammetta thou alas art lost to me
 nor know i if i more thy face shall see

 lviii
 " `i to the bitter dregs the cup must drain
 of promised sweets since thou art others' prey
 'twas my design having with mickle pain
 and labour sore some money put away
 which i had hoarded out of frequent gain
 from parting guests and from my yearly pay
 to seek again valencia and demand
 thee from thy sire in lawful wedlock's band

 lix
 "the damsel shrugs her shoulders and complains
 and  that he is too late  is her reply
 the greek laments and sobs and partly feigns
 `  wilt thou he answered her thus let me die
 let me at least exhale my amorous pains
 let me but once in thine embrace lie
 for every moment in thy presence spent
 ere thou depart will make me die content'

 lx
 "to him the damsel full of pity cries
 `believe i covet this no less than thee
 but here surrounded by so many eyes
 is neither time nor opportunity'
 `  i feel assured' to her that youth replied
 `were i beloved by you as you by me
 this very night you would find out a place
 wherein to solace us some little space'

 "she bade him come  when she awhile had thought 
 when he believed that all asleep were laid
 and how by him her chamber should be sought

 and when he found all silent thither made
 he pushed till it gave way the chamberdoor
 and upon tiptoes softly paced the floor

 stanzas lxiii  lxx untranslated by rose

 lxxi
 "gazing on one another with surprise
 the monarch and jocundo are confused
 nor even to have heard a case surmise
 of two that ever thus had been abused
 then laughed so that they sate with winking eyes
 and open mouth and lungs which breath refused
 and wearied with the mirth her tale had bred
 fell backwards both exhausted on the bed

 lxxii
 "when they had laughed so loud a laugh the dew
 stood in their eyes and each with aching breast
 remained the pair exclaimed `what shall we do
 in order not to be a woman's jest
 since we with all our heed between us two
 could not preserve the one by us possest
 a husband furnished with more eyes than hair
 perforce must be betrayed with all his care

 lxxiii
 " `a thousand beauteous all have we found kind
 nor one of those so many has stood fast
 if tried all women we by proof should find
 like these but be the experiment our last
 then we may deem our own not worse inclined
 than are the wives of others and as chaste
 and if like others we our own discern
 i hold it best that we to them return'

 lxxiv
 "when they have come to this resolve they through
 flammetta call the youth into their bower
 and with the girl her leman in the view
 of many gift and add a fitting dower
 they mount and to the east their way pursue
 accustomed westward hitherto to scower
 to their deserted wives again repair
 nor of their after deeds take farther care"

 lxxv
 here paused mine host to whom on every side
 his audience had with careful heed attended
 rodomont listened nor a word replied
 until the landlord's story was suspended
 then  "fully i believe" that paynim cried
 "the tale of women's frauds would ne'er be ended
 nor could that man in any volume note
 the thousandth part who would their treasons quote"

 lxxvi
 of sounder judgement 'mid that company
 there was an elder one more wise and bold
 that undefended so the sex to see
 was inly wroth and could no longer hold
 to the relater of that history
 he turned and "many things we have been told"
 exclaimed that ancient "wherein truth is none
 and of such matters is thy fable one

 lxxvii
 "him i believe not that told this truth to you
 though in all else he gospeltruths exprest
 as less by his experience than untrue
 conceit respecting women prepossest
 the malice which he bears to one or two
 makes him unjustly hate and blame the rest
 but you shall hear him if his wrath o'erblow
 yet greater praise than blame on these bestow

 lxxviii
 "and he a larger field for speaking well
 will find than blaming womankind withal
 and of a hundred worthy fame may tell
 for one whose evil deeds for censure call
 he should exalt the many that excel
 culled from the multitude not rail at all
 if otherwise your friend valerio said
 he was by wrath and not by reason led

 lxxix  lxxxiii
 stanzas lxxix  lxxxiii untranslated by rose

 lxxxiv
 so reasoning that just elder and sincere
 with ready instances supports his creed
 showing there many women are who ne'er
 sinned against chastity in word or deed
 but him with impious visage and severe
 the paynim scared ill pleased the truth to read
 so that through fear he further speech forbore
 but changed not therefore aught his former lore

 lxxxv
 having stopt further question in this wise
 the paynim monarch from the table rose
 then lays him on his bed till from the skies
 the dusky shades depart and morning glows
 but spends a larger part of night in sighs
 at his liegelady's sin than in repose
 rodomont thence departs at dawn of day
 resolved by water to pursue his way

 lxxxvi
 for with such care for his good horse's plight
 as is becoming a good cavalier
 the courser fair and good made his in spite
 of young rogero and circassia's peer
 seeing he for two days that horse's might
 had taxed too hardly in his long career
  as well he for his ease embarked the steed
 as to pursue his way with better speed

 lxxxvii
 he straight makes launch the vessel from the marge
 and bids put forth the oars from either side
 nor big nor deeply laden she at large
 descends the saone transported by the tide
 care never quits him though the shifting barge
 the king ascend or nimble horse bestride
 this he encounters aye on prow or poop
 and bears behind him on his courser's croup

 lxxxviii
 rather within his head or heart always
 care sits whence every comfort is o'erthrown
 no remedy the wretched man surveys
 in that his enemies are in the town
 from others hope is none since they who raise
 this fearful war against him are his own
 vext by that cruel one aye night and day
 whom he might hope to find his natural stay

 lxxxix
 rodomont navigates the day and night
 ensuing aye by heavy thoughts opprest
 nor can he ever banish the despite
 suffered from king and lady from his breast
 the selfsame grief sate heavy on his sprite
 aboard the bark as when his steed he prest
 such fire was not by water to be drowned
 nor he his nature changed by changing ground

 xc
 as the sick man who with a fever grows
 and weak and weary shifts his place in vain
 whether he right or left himself bestows
 and hopes in turning some relief to gain
 finds neither on this side nor that repose
 but everywhere encounters equal pain
 the pagan monarch so found small relief
 by land or water for his secret grief

 xci
 rodomont brooked no more aboard to stay
 but bade them land him and by lyons hied
 by vienne and valence next took his way
 and the rich bridge in avignon descried
 for these and more which 'twixt the river lay
 and celtiberian hills upon that side
 theirs from the day they conquered the champaigne
 obeyed the kings of afric and of spain

 xcii
 to pass to afric straight the cavalier
 kept to the right towards acquamorta's shore
 and lighted on a stream and hamlet dear
 to ceres and to bacchus which that moor
 found quitted by the peasants in their fear
 as often by the soldier harried sore
 the beach upon one side broad ocean laved
 and on the other yellow harvests waved

 xciii
 here newly built upon a hillock's crest
 a little church the saracen espied
 abandoned by its priesthood like the rest
 for war was flaming upon every side
 rodomont of this place himself possest
 which from its site as well as lying wide
 of fields from whence he tidings loathed to hear
 so pleased him he for it renounced argier

 xciv
 he changed his scheme of seeking afric's land
 so this fair spot seemed fit for his behoof
 and here housed carriages and steed and band
 together with himself beneath one roof
 at few leagues' distance did montpelier stand
 and other wealthy towns not far aloof
 the village was upon a river's side
 so that its every need might be supplied

 xcv
 here standing full of thought upon a day
 such was his common wont the paynim spied
 advancing by a narrow path which lay
 through a green meadow from the adverse side
 a lovely damsel that upon her way
 was by a bearded monk accompanied
 and these behind them led a lusty steed
 who bore a burden trapt with sable weed

 xcvi
 who that attendant monk and damsel were
 and what that burden will to you be clear
 remembering isabella is the fair
 charged with the corse of her zerbino dear
 i left her where from provence in the care
 of that good sire she bowned herself to steer
 by whom persuaded had the lady given
 the remnant of her virtuous life to heaven

 xcvii
 although in her pale face and troubled guise
 the sorrow of that dame is manifest
 although two fountains are her streaming eyes
 and sobs aye issue from her burning breast
 and more beside of suffering testifies
 with what a load of grief she is opprest
 yet in her faded cheek such beauties meet
 love and the graces there might fix their seat

 xcviii
 as soon as he of sarza saw appear
 the beauteous dame he laid the thought aside
 of hatred to that gentle race and dear
 by whom alone the world is glorified
 and best by isabel the cavalier
 believed his former love would be supplied
 and one love by another be effaced
 as bolt by bolt in timber is displaced

 xcix
 her with the kindest mien and mildest tone
 that he could fashion met the sarzan knight
 to whom the dame her every thought made known
 and said when she was questioned of her plight
 she would with holy works  this world forgone 
 seek favour in her heavenly father's sight
 loud laughed that godless paynim at the thought
 who every faith and worship held at nought

 c
 and said that she from reason wandered wide
 and termed her project sudden and unsound
 nor deemed her less to blame than those who hide
 through greediness their treasure under ground
 and keep it from the use of all beside
 though hence no profit to themselves redound
 rightly were prisoned lion snake and bear
 but ill whate'er is innocent and fair

 ci
 the monk that to this talk has lent an ear
 prompt with advice that mournful dame to stay
 and lest she quit her course prepared to steer
 his bark like practised pilot on her way
 a sumptuous table rich in spiritual cheer
 had speedily bestirred him to array
 but born with evil taste that paynim rude
 no sooner tasted than he loathed the food

 cii
 and having interrupted him in vain
 nor having power to make him stint his lore
 that paynim stirred to fury broke the rein
 of patience and assailed the preacher hoar
 but haply wearisome might seem the strain
 if i upon this theme dilated more
 so here i close nor words will idly spend
 admonished by that ancient's evil end


 canto 29

 argument
 isabel makes the paynim take her head
 rather than he his wicked will should gain
 who having his unhappy error read
 seeks to appease his wounded spirit in vain
 he builds a bridge and strips those thither led
 but falls from it with roland the insane
 who thence of him regardless endlong speeds
 and by the road achieves prodigious deeds


 i
 o feeble and unstable minds of men
 how quickly our intentions fluctuate
 all thoughts we lightly change but mostly when
 these from some lover's quarrel take their date
 but now so wroth i saw that saracen
 with woman so outrageous in his hate
 i weened not only he would ill assuage
 but never more would calm his amorous rage

 ii
 that which he rashly uttered to your blame
 ye gentle dames does so my spirit grieve
 till i his error teach him to his shame
 he shall no quarter at my hands receive
 so him with pen and page will i proclaim
 that whosoever reads me shall believe
 he had better held  aye better bit his tongue
 than ever have your sex with slander stung

 iii
 but that in this the witless infidel
 spake as a fool the event demonstrates clear
 even now with dagger drawn that paynim fell
 in fury on all women whomsoe'er
 next him so touched one look of isabel
 she quickly made his fickle purpose veer
 for her scarce seen and to that warrior strange
 he would his doralice already change

 iv
 and as new love the king did heat and goad
 he moved some arguments of small avail
 to shake her stedfast spirit which abode
 wholly with god but he her shield and mail
 that hermit lest she from the better road
 should wander and her chaste intention fail
 with stronger arguments with him contended
 and still as best he could the dame defended

 v
 the king who long had taxed himself to bear
 the monk's bold sermon to his sore displeasure
 and vainly bade him to his cell repair
 anew without that damsel at his leisure
 yet seeing he would still his patience dare
 nor peace with him would keep nor any measure
 upon that preacher's chin his righthand laid
 and whatsoe'er he grasped as rudely flayed

 vi
 and so his fury waxed that as it were
 with tongs he griped his neck and after he
 had whirled him once or twice about in air
 dismist him form his hand towards the sea
 i say not  know not what befel him there
 many the rumours are and disagree
 one says he burst upon a rock's rude bed
 and lay one shapeless jelly heels and head

 vii
 he fell into the sea by one is said
 distant three miles and more and in that sound
 he having prayer and ave vainly made
 because he knew not how to swim was drowned
 others report a saint bestowed his aid
 and dragged him with a visible hand aground
 whichever be the reading of this mystery
 of him i speak no further in mine history

 viii
 cruel king rodomont when from his side
 he had removed the prating eremite
 with visage less disturbed again applied
 to that sad lady heartless with affright
 and in the language used by lovers cried
 she was his very heart his life his light
 she was his comfort and his dearest hope
 with all such words as have that common scope

 ix
 and now so temperate showed that infidel
 'twould seem that he no violence designed
 the gentle semblance of fair isabel
 enamoured him so tamed his haughty mind
 and though he might that goodly kernel shell
 the paynim would not pass beyond the rhind
 who that its favour would be lost believed
 unless 'twere as a gift from her received

 x
 and by degrees so thought to mould the dame
 to his desires she in that lone retreat
 and savage open to his evil aim
 and like a mouse beneath grimalkin's feet
 had liefer found herself i' the midst of flame
 and ever on one thought her fancy beat
 if any mode if any way remained
 to scape that wilful man untouched unstained

 xi
 sad isabella in her mind is bent
 to slay herself with her own hand before
 that fell barbarian compass his intent
 and be the means to make her wrong so sore
 that cavalier by cruel fortune spent
 within her loving arms to whom she swore
 with mind to him devoted his to be
 vowing to heaven perpetual chastity

 xii
 she sees that paynim monarch's passion blind
 increasing still nor what to do she knows
 well knows what foul intention is behind
 which she is all too feeble to oppose
 yet moving many matters in her mind
 finds out at last a refuge for her woes
 and means to save her chastity from shame
 how i shall say with clear and lasting fame

 xiii
 she cried unto that paynim foul to see
 already threatening her with word and act
 and now devoid of all that courtesy
 which he in the beginning did enact
 "if thou mine honour wilt ensure to me
 beyond suspicion i upon this pact
 will upon thee bestow what shall o'erpay
 by much that honour thou wouldst take away

 xiv
 "for pleasure which endures so brief a space
 wherewith this ample world does so o'errun
 reject not lightly a perpetual grace
 a real joy to be postponed to none
 of women everywhere of pleasing face
 a hundred and a thousand may be won
 but none beside me or few others live
 who can bestow the boon which i can give

 xv
 "i know and on my way a herb did view
 and nearly know where i on this could light
 which being boiled with ivy and with rue
 over a fire with wood of cypress dight
 and squeezed when taken from the caldron through
 innocent hands affords a juice of might
 wherewith whoever thrice his body laves
 destructive steel or fire securely braves

 xvi
 "if thrice therewith he bathe himself i say
 his flesh no weapon for a month shall score
 he once a month must to his body lay
 mine unction for its virtue lasts not more
 this liquor can i make and will today
 and thou today shalt also prove my lore
 and well i trust thou shalt more grateful be
 than were all europe won today by thee

 xvii
 "in guerdon for this present i request
 that thou to me upon thy faith wilt swear
 thou never wilt my chastity molest
 in word or deed" so spake that damsel fair
 and rodomont who heard again represt
 his evil will for so he longed to bear
 a charmed life that readily he more
 than isabel of him demanded swore

 xviii
 and will maintain his promise till the fact
 vouched of that wondrous water shall appear
 and force himself meanwhile to do no act
 to show no sign of violence but the peer
 resolves he will not after keep the pact
 as one who holds not god or saint in fear
 and to that king regardless of his oath
 all lying afric yields in breach of troth

 xix
 argier's perfidious king to isabel
 more than a thousand times assurance swore
 in case that water rendered him what fell
 achilles and what cygnus were of yore
 she aye by beetling cliff and darksome dell
 away from city and from farm a store
 of herbs collected nor this while e'er
 abandoned by the paynim cavalier

 xx
 when herbs enow by them in many a beat
 with or without their roots collected were
 at a late hour the twain to their retreat
 betook them and throughout night's remnant there
 that paragon of continence did heat
 what simples she had culled with mickle care
 while to those mysteries and her every deed
 the pagan present still gave curious heed

 xxi
 who wearing out the weary night in sport
  he and those followers that with him remained 
 had suffered thirst in such a grievous sort
 from the fierce fire in that small cave contained
 that drinking round in measure full or short
 of graecian wine two barrels had they drained
 a booty which those squires who served the moor
 from travellers seized a day or two before

 xxii
 to argier's warlike king unused to wine
 cursed and forbidden by his law esteemed
 the liquor tasted once appeared divine
 sweeter than nectar or than manna seemed
 he quaffing largely now of ishmael's line
 the sober use deserving censure deemed
 so fast their cups with that good wine they fill
 each reveller's head is whirling like a mill

 xxiii
 meanwhile that lady from the fire does lift
 the pot wherein she cooked those herbs and cries
 to rodomont "in proof i not adrift
 have launched the words i spake in random guise
  by that which can the truth form falsehood sift
 experience which can make the foolish wise
 even now the thing shall to thyself be shown
 not on another's body but my own

 xxiv
 "i first will trial make" that lady said
 "of this choice liquor with rare virtue blest
 lest haply thou shouldst harbour any dread
 that mortal poison form these herbs be prest
 with this will i anoint myself from head
 downwards below the naked neck and breast
 then prove on me thy faulchion and thine arm
 and prove if one can smite the other harm"

 xxv
 she washed as said and gladly did decline
 her neck to that unthinking pagan's brand
 unthinking and perhaps o'ercome by wine
 which neither helm nor mail nor shield withstand
 that brutish man believed her and in sign
 of faith so struck with cruel steel and hand
 that her fair head erewhile love's place of rest
 he severed from the snowy neck and breast

 xxvi
 this made three bounds and thence in accents clear
 was heard a voice which spake zerbino's name
 to follow whom escaping sarza's peer
 so rare a way was taken by the dame
 spirit which nobly didst esteem more dear
 thy plighted faith and chaste and holy name
 things hardly known and foreign to our time
 than thine own life and thine own blooming prime

 xxvii
 depart in peace o spirit blest and fair
  so had my verses power as evermore
 i would assay with all that happy care
 which so adorns and points poetic lore
 and as renowned should be thy story rare
 thousands and thousands of long years and more
  depart in peace to radiant realms above
 and leave to earth the example of thy love

 xxviii
 his eyes from heaven did the creator bend
 at the stupendous and unequalled feat
 and said "i thee above that dame commend
 whose death drove tarquin from his royal seat
 and i to register a law intend
 'mid those which ages change not as they fleet
 which  i attest the inviolable river 
 unchanged through future times shall last for ever

 xxix
 "i will that all in every future age
 who bear thy name be blest with genius high
 be courteous gentle beautiful and sage
 and to the real pitch of honour fly
 that to their glory the historic page
 they may with worthy argument supply
 so that for aye parnassus' hill and well
 shall ring with isabel and isabel"

 xxx
 so spake the sire and cleared the ambient air
 and hushed beyond its wont the heaving main
 to the third heaven her chaste soul made repair
 and in zerbino's arms was locked again
 on earth with shame and sorrow for his share
 that second breuse sans pity did remain
 who when digested was the maddening bowl
 lamented sore his error sad at soul

 xxxi
 that placated or in some content
 the sainted soul of isabel might be
 that if to death that damsel he had shent
 he might at least revive her memory
 he as a means to compass his intent
 would turn into a tomb that church where he
 inhabited and where she buried lies
 to you shall be related in what wise

 xxxii
 in all parts round about this chosen site
 for love or fear he mastermasons found
 and making full six thousand men unite
 stript of their heavy stones the mountains round
 and raised a fabric ninety yards in height
 from its extremest summit to the ground
 and he within its walls the church enclosed
 wherein entombed the lovers twain reposed

 xxxiii
 this nearly imitates that pile beside
 old tyber's stream by adrian built and nigh
 the sepulchre will he a tower provide
 wherein he purposes some time to lie
 a narrow bridge and only two yards wide
 he flung across the stream which rolled fast by
 long but so scanty is that bridge with pain
 the narrow pass two coursers can contain

 xxxiv
 two coursers that abreast have thither made
 or else encountering on that causeway meet
 nor any where was ledge or barricade
 to stay the horses's fall who lost his feet
 he wills that bridge's toll be dearly paid
 by christian or by moor who pass his seat
 for with a thousand trophies arms and vest
 that damsel's tomb is destined to be drest

 xxxv
 within ten days or shorter time was placed
 the bridge whose arch across the stream was dight
 but not that pile and tower with equal haste
 were so conducted to their destined height
 yet was the last so high a sentry paced
 its top who whensoever any knight
 approached the bridge was wont his lord to warn
 sounding a signal on his buglehorn

 xxxvi
 whereat he armed and issued for the stower
 now upon one and now the other side
 for when a warrior pricked towards the tower
 him from the adverse bank that king defied
 the bridge affords the field their steeds must scour
 and should one but a little swerve aside
 peril unparalleled the horse will go
 into the deep and dangerous stream below

 xxxvii
 the pagan had imagined as a pain
 that risking oft to tumble in the course
 headfirst into that stream where he must drain
 huge draughts of water in his fall parforce
 he would assoil and cleanse him from that stain
 whereof excess in wine had been the source
 as if what ill wine prompts to do or say
 water as well as wine could wash away

 xxxviii
 soon thitherward flocked many a cavalier
 some who pursued the beaten road and plain
 since for wayfaring men who southward steer
 no straighter lay for italy or spain
 their courage and their honour held more dear
 than life excited others of the train
 and all where they had hoped the meed of strife
 had lost their arms and many arms and life

 xxxix
 if those he conquers are of pagan strain
 he is content to take their arms and vest
 and of those first arrived the titles plain
 are written and their arms suspended rest
 but he in prison pens the christened train
 'twould seem to be to argier's realm addrest
 not yet was brought that building to a head
 when thitherward the crazed orlando sped

 xl
 it chanced orlando in his furious mood
 came thither where that foaming river ran
 where rodomont beside the mighty flood
 was hurrying on his work nor yet were done
 the tower and tomb the bridge scarce finished stood
 here  save his casque was open  ulien's son
 steeled capapee stood ready armed for fight
 when to the bridge approached anglantes' knight

 xli
 orlando running thus his wild career
 the barrier tops and o'er the bridge would fly
 but sullen rodomont with troubled cheer
 afoot as he that tower is standing nigh
 for he disdains to brandish sword or spear
 shouts to him from afar with threatening cry
 "halt thou intrusive churl and indiscreet
 rash meddling saucy villain stay thy feet

 xlii
 "only for lord and cavalier was made
 and not for thee dull slave that bridge was meant"
 to this no heed insane orlando paid
 but fixt upon his purpose forward went
 "this madman must i school" the paynim said
 and was approaching with the fell intent
 him into that deep river to dispatch
 nor deeming in such foe to find his match

 xliii
 this while a gentle damsel sought the place
 that towards that bridge across the river rode
 richly arraid and beautiful of face
 who sage reserve in her demeanor showed
 'tis she that of her brandimart in chase
 if you remember sir through every road
 and place her lover seeks in anxious wise
 excepting paris where the warrior lies

 xliv
 when flordelice that bridge and tower was near
 so was by name the wandering damsel hight
 grappling with roland stood the sarzan peer
 and would into that river pitch the knight
 she conversant with brava's cavalier
 the miserable county knew aright
 and mighty marvel in that dame it raised
 to see him rove a naked man and crazed

 xlv
 she stopt the issue of that strife to know
 wherein those two so puissant warriors vied
 his opposite by might and main to throw
 into the stream each doughty champion tried
 "how can a fool such mighty prowess show"
 between his teeth the furious paynim cried
 and shifting here and there was seen to strain
 brimfull of pride and anger and disdain

 xlvi
 this hand and now that other he puts out
 to take new hold where he his vantage spies
 now within roland's legs and now without
 locks his right foot or left in skilful wise
 and thus resembles in that wrestling bout
 the stupid bear who in his fury tries
 the tree from whence he tumbled to o'erthrow
 deeming it sole occasion of his woe

 xlvii
 roland whose better wit was lost withal
 i know no where and who used force alone
 that utmost force to which this earthly ball
 haply affords few paragons or none
 let himself backwards in that struggle fall
 embracing as he stood with ulien's son
 together in the foaming stream they sank
 high flashed the wave and groaned the echoing bank

 xlviii
 quickly the stream asunder bore the pair
 roland was naked and like fish could swim
 here shot his feet his arms extended there
 and gained the bank nor when upon the brim
 halted to mark if his adventure were
 achieved with praise or shame in evil trim
 the pagan by his arms impeded sore
 with heavier pain and trouble toiled ashore

 xlix
 along the bridge which spanned that foaming tide
 did flordelice meantime securely pace
 and having vainly sought on every side
 brandimart's bearing since nor iron case
 nor vest of his she anywhere espied
 she hoped to find the knight in other place
 but here return we of the count to tell
 who left behind him stream bridge tower and cell

 l
 'twere phrensy of his every frantic feat
 to promise the relation one by one
 so many and many  should i these repeat
 i know not when my story would be done
 yet some of his notorious deeds and meet
 for mention in my song will i make known
 nor will i not that wondrous one recount
 near thoulouse on the pyrenaean mount

 li
 much country had been traversed by the knight
 urged by the furious rage which him misguides
 at last he reached the hill whose boundary height
 arragonese and neighbouring frank divides
 thither directing aye his course outright
 where the descending sun his visage hides
 he reached a path upon the rugged steep
 which overhung a valley dark and deep

 lii
 here he by chance encountered in mid road
 two youths that wood men were and drove before
 an ass along that pathway with a load
 of logs they marking well what scanty store
 of brain in poor orlando's head was stowed
 called to the approaching knight and threatened sore
 bidding him stand aside or else go back
 nor to their hindrance block the common track

 liii
 to this address orlando answered nought
 save that his foot he to their beast applied
 smote in midbreast which with that vigour fraught
  that force exceeding every force beside 
 tost him so hight that the beholders thought
 it was a bird in air which they descried
 the ass upon a mountainsummit fell
 which rose above a mile beyond that dell

 liv
 upon those youths next sprang the furious knight
 with better luck than wit one woodman shear
 from that tall cliff twice thirty yards in height
 cast himself headlong downward in his fear
 him a moist patch of brambles in his flight
 received and amid grass and bushes here
 from other mischief safe the stripling lit
 and for some scratches in his face was quit

 lv
 that other to a jutting fragment clung
 who so to gain the higher steep would strive
 because he hopes if once those crags among
 to keep him from that fool he may contrive
 but by the feet orlando ere he sprung
 seized him who will not leave the wretch alive
 and stretching them as wide as he could strain
 so stretched his arms he rent his prey in twain

 lvi
 even in such mode as often we descry
 falconer by heron or by puller do
 whose entrails he plucks out to satisfy
 merlin or falcon that the game pursue
 how happy was that other not to die
 who risqued his neck in that deep bottom who
 rehearsed the tale so often turpin heard
 and handed down to us the wondrous word

 lvii
 these and more marvels does the count who bends
 his steps across that mountain to the plain
 and seeking long a path at length descends
 towards the south upon the land of spain
 his way along the beach he after wends
 near arragon beside the rumbling main
 and ever prompted by his phrensy rank
 will make himself a dwelling on the bank

 lviii
 where he somedeal may shun the noontide ray
 with dry and powdery seasand covered o'er
 and here while so employed upon their way
 arrives angelica with her medore
 who as you have been told in former lay
 had from the hills descended on that shore
 within a yard or less approached the fair
 ere yet she of his presence was aware

 lix
 so different from himself was he to sight
 nought of orlando she in him surveyed
 for from the time that rage possest his sprite
 he had gone naked forth in sun and shade
 had he been born on hot syene's site
 or sands where worship is to ammon paid
 or nigh those hills whence nile's full waters spin
 orlando had not borne a dingier skin

 lx
 nigh buried in their sockets are his eyes
 spare in his visage and as dry as bone
 dishevelled is his hair in woeful wise
 with frightful beard his cheek is overgrown
 no sooner is he seen than backward flies
 angelica who trembling sore is flown
 she shrieking loud all trembling and dismaid
 betakes her to her youthful guide for aid

 lxi
 when crazed orlando was of her aware
 to seize the damsel he upsprang in haste
 so pleased the wretched count her visage fair
 so quickly was his mood inflamed effaced
 in him all ancient recollections are
 how she by him was whilom served and graced
 behind her speech the count and hunts that dame
 as questing dog pursues the sylvan game

 lxii
 the youth that sees him chase his love who fled
 his courser spurs and in pursuit is gone
 with naked faulchion after him he sped
 and cut and thrust at roland as he run
 he from his shoulders hoped to cleave his head
 but found the madman's skin as hard as bone
 yea harder far than steel nor to be harmed
 so good orlando at his birth was charmed

 lxiii
 when on his back orlando felt him beat
 he turned and turning on his youthful foe
 smote with clenched fist and force which nought can meet
  smote on his horse's head a fearful blow
 and with skull smashed like glass that courser fleet
 was by the madman's furious stroke laid low
 in the same breath orlando turned anew
 and chased the damsel that before him flew

 lxiv
 at speed angelica impelled her mare
 and whipt and spurred her evermore whom slow
 she would esteem albeit that palfrey were
 yet faster than a shaft dismist from bow
 her ring she thought upon and this the fair
 placed in her mouth nor failed its virtue now
 for putting it between her lips like light
 extinguished by a puff she past from sight

 lxv
 was it through fear or was she while she stript
 this from her finger shaken in her seat
 or was it rather that her palfrey tript
 for neither this nor that i surely weet
 angelica while 'twixt her lips she slipt
 the virtuous ring and hid her visage sweet
 her stirrups lost and tumbling form the sell
 reversed upon the sand that lady fell

 lxvi
 if but two inches short had fallen his prey
 upon her would have pounced orlando near
 who would have crushed her in his furious way
 but that kind fortune saved her from the peer
 let her by other theft herself purvey
 with other palfrey as she did whilere
 for never will she have this courser more
 who chased by swift orlando scours the shore

 lxvii
 doubt not that she another will provide
 and follow we in mad orlando's rear
 whose rage and fury nevermore subside
 wroth that angelica should disappear
 after that beast along the sands he hied
 aye gaining on the mare in this career
 now now he touches her and lo the mane
 he grasps and now secures her by the rein

 lxviii
 orlando seizes her with that delight
 that other man might seize a damsel fair
 the bit and bridle he adjusts aright
 springs on her back and o'er the seabeach bare
 for many miles impels the palfrey's flight
 without repose or pause now here now there
 nor ever sell or bridle be displaced
 nor let her grass or heartening forage taste

 lxix
 as in this course to o'erleap a ditch he sought
 head over heels she with her rider went
 nor harmed was he nor felt that tumble aright
 but she with shoulder slipt lay foully shent
 long how to bear her thence orlando thought
 and in the end upon his shoulders hent
 he from the bottom climbed thus loaded sore
 and carried her three bowshots' length and more

 lxx
 next for he felt that weight too irksome grow
 he put her down to lead her by the rein
 who followed him with limping gait and slow
 "come on" orlando cried and cried in vain
 and could the palfrey at a gallop go
 this ill would satisfy his mood insane
 the halter from her head he last unloosed
 wherewith her hind offfoot the madman noosed

 lxxi
 'tis thus he comforts and drags on that mare
 that she may follow with more ease so led
 who whiles despoiled of flesh and whiles of hair
 is scathed by stones which that ill road o'erspread
 at length the misused beast with wear and tear
 of the rude rocks and suffering sore lies dead
 orlando nought the slaughtered mare regards
 nor anywise his headlong course retards

 lxxii
 to drag that palfrey ceased he not though dead
 continuing still his course towards the west
 and all this while sacked hamlet farm and stead
 whenever he by hunger was distrest
 and aye to glut himself with meat and bread
 and fruit he every one by force opprest
 one by his hand was slain one foully shent
 seldom he stopt and ever onward went

 lxxiii
 as much or little less would do the knight
 by his own love did not that damsel hide
 because the wretch discerns not black from white
 and harms where he would help a curse betide
 the wonderworking ring and eke the wight
 who gave it to that lady full or pride
 since roland but for this would venge the scorn
 he and a thousand more from her had borne

 lxxiv
 would that of her orlando were possest
 and of all women that are above ground
 for one and all are ingrates at the best
 nor is in all an ounce of goodness found
 but it is meet i let my hearer rest
 ere my strained chords return a faltering sound
 and that he may less tedious deem the rhyme
 defer my story till another time


 canto 30

 argument
 great feats achieve orlando by the way
 the tartar king is by rogero slain
 for whom fair bradamant his spouse does stay
 but fate forbade that he who wounded lay
 to her his plighted promise should maintain
 he after boldly with the brethren made
 their lord rinaldo in his need to aid


 i
 when reason giving way to heat of blood
 herself from hasty choler ill defends
 and hurried on by blind and furious mood
 we with the tongue or hand molest our friends
 though the offence is after wept and rued
 the penance which we pay is poor amends
 alas i sorrow and lament in vain
 for what i said in other angry strain

 ii
 but like sick man am i who sore bested
 suffering with patience many and many a day
 when against pain he can no more make head
 yields to his rage and curses pain give way
 and with it the impetuous wrath is fled
 which moved his ready tongue such ill to say
 and he is left his willful rage to rue
 but cannot that which he has done undo

 iii
 well hope i from your sovereign courtesy
 your pardon since i crave it ladies bright
 you will excuse if moved by madness i
 rave in my passion let your censure light
 on foe who treats me so despiteously
 i could not be reduced to worser plight
 who prompts what sore repents me heaven above
 knows how she wrongs me knows how well i love

 iv
 no less beside myself than brava's peer
 and i nor less my pardon should obtain
 he who by mead or mountain far or near
 had scowered large portion of the land of spain
 dragging that jennet in his wild career
 dead as she was behind him by the rein
 but where a river joined the sea parforce
 abandoned on the bank her mangled corse

 v
 and he who could like any otter swim
 leapt in and rose upon the further side
 behold a mounted shepherd at the brim
 arrived his horse to water in the tide
 nor when he saw orlando coming him
 eschewed whom naked and alone he spied
  "my jennet for thy hackney were i fain
 to barter" cried the madman to the swain

 vi
 "her will i show thee if thou wilt who dead
 upon the river's other margin fell
 at leisure may'st thou have her cured" he said
 "and of no other fault have i to tell
 give me thy hackney with some boot instead
 prythee dismount thee for he likes me well"
 the peasant laughing answered not a word
 but left the fool and pricked towards the ford

 vii
 "hearest thou not hola i want thy steed"
 cried roland and advanced with wrathful cheer
 a solid staff and knotted for his need
 that shepherd had wherewith he smote the peer
 whose violence and ire all bounds exceed
 who seems withal to wax more fierce than e'er
 a cuff he levels at that rustic's head
 and splits the solid bone and lays him dead

 viii
 then leaping on his horse by different way
 the country scowers to make more spoil and wrack
 that palfrey never more tastes corn or hay
 so that few days exhaust the famished hack
 but not afoot does fierce orlando stray
 who will not while he lives conveyance lack
 as many as he finds so many steeds
  their masters slain  he presses for his needs

 ix
 he came at last to malaga and here
 did mightier scathe than he had done elsewhere
 for now  besides that the infuriate peer
 of all its people left the country bare
 nor such the ravage could another year
 the desperate havoc of the fool repair 
 so many houses burnt he or cast down
 sacked was a third of that unhappy town

 x
 departing thence insane orlando flees
 to zizera a seaward town whose site
 is in gibraltar's bay or if you please
 say gibletar's for either way 'tis hight
 here loosening from the land a boat he sees
 filled with a party and for pleasure dight
 which for their solace to the morning gale
 upon that summer sea had spread their sail

 xi
 "hoah the boat put back" the count 'gan cry
 who was in mind to go aboard their barge
 but vainly on their ears his clamours die
 for of such freight none willingly take charge
 as swiftly as a swallow cleaves the sky
 furrowing the foamy wave the boat goes large
 orlando urges on with straightening knee
 and whip and spur his horse towards the sea

 xii
 he plunged into the waves at last parforce
 for vainly would he shun the waters green
 bathed are knees paunch and croup till of that horse
 scarcely the head above the wave is seen
 let him not hope to measure back his course
 while smitten with the whip his ears between
 woe worth him he must founder by the way
 or into africa his load convey

 xiii
 nor poops nor prows does roland more descry
 for all have launched their shallops which are wide
 of that dry shore while from his level eye
 their hulls the tall and shifting surges hide
 he spurs his horse amid the billows high
 wholly resolved to reach the farther side
 the courser ends his swim and life in fine
 drained of his strength and drenched brimfull of brine

 xiv
 he sinks and would with him draw down his load
 but that himself the madman's arms upbear
 with sinewy arms and either palm he rowed
 and puffed and blew the brine before the air
 breathed softly and the water gently flowed
 and well was needed weather more than fair
 for if the waters yet a little rise
 whelmed by the waxing tide orlando dies

 xv
 but fortune that of madmen is the guide
 him from the water drew near ceuta's shore
 upon that beach and of those walls as wide
 as twice an archer's hand could shoot at score
 for many days along the bank he hied
 at hazard ever westward hurrying sore
 until he came where on the seabeat strand
 encamped a host of blacks a countless band

 xvi
 leave we the paladin at will to stray
 to speak of him occasion will come round
  sir what befel the lady of catay
 who scaped in time from him of wit unsound
 and afterwards upon her homeward way
 was with good bark and better weather bound
 and how she made medoro india's king
 perchance some voice in happier verse may sing

 xvii
 to say so many things i am intent
 i mean not to pursue the cavalier
 to mandricardo my fair argument
 it now behoves me in his turn to veer
 he happily enjoyed his rival spent
 the beauty left in europe without peer
 since fair angelica from hence had wended
 and virtuous isabel to heaven ascended

 xviii
 king mandricardo proud that in his right
 his lady had adjudged the amorous suit
 enjoys not her award with full delight
 since others with him other points dispute
 by young rogero claimed that eagle white
 of one disastrous quarrel is the root
 another moves the king of sericana
 against the tartar king for durindana

 xix
 agramant and marsilius strive in vain
 with labour sore this tangle to undo
 nor only cannot they persuade the twain
 in peace and concord to unite anew
 but cannot make the valiant child refrain
 from claiming hector's buckler as his due
 nor yet gradasso move the sword to lend
 'till this or till that quarrel have an end

 xx
 rogero brooks not that in other fight
 his shield be braced nor will gradasso bear
 that save against himself the tartar knight
 should wield the sword orlando used to wear
 "see we in fine on whom the chance will light
 cries agramant and further words forbear
 how fortune rules the matter let us see
 and choose him that of her shall chosen be

 xxi
 "and  would ye do what most would me delight
 and be an obligation evermore 
 you shall by casting lots decide your right
 premising he whose lot is drawn before
 the other shall upon two quarrels fight
 so he who wins on his companion's score
 shall win as well as on his own and who
 loses the battle lose alike for two

 xxii
 "between rogero and gradasso we
 deem there is little difference rather none
 and wot whichever shall elected be
 in arms will make his martial prowess known
 as for the rest let doubtful victory
 descend on him whom heaven is pleased to own
 upon the vanquished knight no blame shall fall
 but we to fortune will impute it all"

 xxiii
 rogero and gradasso at this say
 of agramant stood silent and agreed
 that he whose lot first issued the assay
 should undertake for both in listed mead
 thus in two scrolls inscribed in the same way
 their names are writ as destined to succeed
 these afterwards are cast into an urn
 which much they shake and topsy turvy turn

 xxiv
 a seely boy then dipt his hand and drew
 a billet from the vase and if befel
 thereon rogero's name the assistants knew
  gradasso's left behind  i cannot tell
 how joyed renowned rogero at the view
 and can as little say what sorrow fell
 upon gradasso on the other side
 but he parforce his fortune must abide

 xxv
 gradasso every thought and every deed
 employs rogero to instruct and aid
 that in the strife his champion may succeed
 and teaches every sleight he has assaid
  how best to manage sword and shield at need 
  what strokes are feints and what with vantage made 
 and when he should tempt fortune when eschew 
 reminds him one by one in long review

 xxvi
 after the drawing lots and king's award
 what of the day remained the champions spent
 as wont in giving tokens of regard
 to this or to that other warrior sent
 the people greedy for the fight toward
 the field is gone and many not content
 with wending thither ere the dawn of light
 upon the place of combat watch all night

 xxvii
 the foolish rabble anxiously attends
 those goodly champions' contest for the prize
 a crowd which neither sees nor comprehends
 other than that which is before its eyes
 but they who know what boots and what offends
  marsilius and sobrino and the wise 
 censure the fight and monarch that affords
 a field of combat to those martial lords

 xxviii
 nor what a heavy loss he would sustain
 cease they to royal agramant to read
 were mandricardo or rogero slain
 a thing by cruel destiny decreed
 since they to combat against charlemagne
 of one of these alone have greater need
 than of ten thousand more amid which crew
 they scarce would find one champion good and true

 xxix
 agramant recognized this truth but thought
 that ill his royal word could be repealed
 yet mandricardo and the child besought
 that they the right conferred by him would yield
 more that the question was a thing of nought
 nor worthy to be tried in martial field
 and prayed them  would they not obey his hest
 at least somewhile to let their quarrel rest

 xxx
 five or six months would they the strife delay
 or more or less till charles defeated were
 and stript of mantle crown and royal sway
 but each though he would willingly forbear
 and much desired his sovereign to obey
 stood out against the moorish monarch's prayer
 since either deemed he would be foully shent
 who to this treaty first should yield consent

 xxxi
 but more than king than all who sought in vain
 to soften agrican's infuriate son
 the beauteous daughter of king stordilane
 lamented besought him woebegone
 besought him he would do what all would fain
 behold by the relenting warrior done
  lamenting her as through the cavalier
 for ever kept in agony and fear

 xxxii
 "alas and what exclaims she can i find
 which may avail to minister repose
 if aye by this or that desire inclined
 you don your harness to affront new foes
 what boots it to restore my harassed mind
 that i behold one fearful quarrel's close
 against one champion moved for love of me
 if one as fierce already kindled be

 xxxiii
 "woe worth me i was proud with little right
 so good a king so stout a cavalier
 for he should in the fierce and dangerous fight
 peril his life who now i see to clear
 upon a ground of strife so passing light
 with the same risk prepares to couch the spear
 you more than love for me to strife impels
 the natural rage wherewith your bosom swells

 xxxiv
 "but if the love you force yourself to show
 be in good earnest that which you profess
 by this i pray you by that chastening woe
 which does my spirit does my heart oppress
 be not concerned because the bird of snow
 rogero pictured on his shield possess
 i know not wherefore you should joy or grieve
 that he the blazoned buckler bear or leave

 xxxv
 "much evil may ensue and little gain
 out of the battle you to wage prepare
 small guerdon will be bought with mickle pain
 if from rogero you his eagle bear
 but if your fortune shifts on listed plain
 she whom you hold not captive by her hair
 you cause an evil with such mischief fraught
 my heart is broken at the simple thought

 xxxvi
 "if of small value life to you appear
 and you esteem a painted bird more high
 at least for my life's sake esteem yours dear
 for one without the other shall not die
 with you to die excites in me no fear
 with you prepared for life or death am i
 yet would i fain not die so ill content
 as i should die if you before me went"

 xxxvii
 accompanying words with tears and sighs
 in such or such like speech she him did pray
 throughout that livelong night in piteous wise
 hoping her lover's anger to allay
 and mandricardo sucking from her eyes
 those sweet tears glittering in their humid ray
 and that sweet moan from lips more deeply dyed
 than crimson rose himself in tears replied

 xxxviii
 "alack my dearest life take thou no dread
 alack for love of heaven of thing so light
 for if to my sole harm with banners spread
 their following of the frank or paynim rite
 king agramant and charles united led
 this need not cause you matter for affright
 what poor account you make of me is clear
 if this one sole rogero breeds such fear

 xxxix
 "and yet should you remember how alone
 nor had i scimetar or sword in hand
 of knights with a spear's truncheon overthrown
 i singly cleared the field an armed band
 though to his shame and sorrow this he own
 gradasso tells to them who make demand
 he was my prisoner in the syrian tower
 yet other than rogero's is his power

 xl
 "not king gradasso will the truth deny
 sacripant knows it and your isolier
 i say king sacripant of circassy
 and aquilant and gryphon famous peer
 with hundreds  yea and more  from far and nigh
 made prisoners at that fearful pass whilere
 baptized or infidel and all by me
 from prison on the selfsame day set free

 xli
 "and even yet they marvel evermore
 at the great feat which i performed that day
 greater than if the squadrons of the moor
 and frank united i had held at bay
 and shall rogero new to martial lore
 me onto to one with scathe or scorn appay
 and me shall now this young rogero scare
 when hector's sword and hector's arms i wear

 xlii
 "ah as i might have won you from my foe
 why did i not for you in arms contend
 i so had them my valour shown i know
 you would have well foreseen rogero's end
 for heaven's sake dry your tears nor by such woe
  an evil omen for my arms  offend
 and learn 'tis honour pricks me to the field
 and not an argent bird and blazoned shield"

 xliii
 so said he and with reasons passing good
 to him that dame replied with saddest face
 nor only would have changed his sullen mood
 but would have moved a pillar from its place
 she would the champion quickly have subdued
 though she was gowned he locked in iron case
 and make him satisfy the moorish lord
 if agramant spake further of accord

 xliv
 and had but that aurora  on his way
 ushering aye the sun  no sooner stirred
 than young rogero anxious to display
 that rightfully he bore jove's beauteous bird
 to cut the quarrel short and lest delay
 be further interposed in act or word
 where round the palisade the people close
 appears in armour and his bugle blows

 xlv
 when that loud sound is by the tartar heard
 which the proud warrior to the strife defies
 no more of treaty will he hear a word
 from bed upspringing "arms" the monarch cries
 and shows a visage with such fury stirred
 doralice dares no longer peace advise
 nor speak of treaty or of truce anew
 and now parforce the battle must ensue

 xlvi
 the tartar arms himself in haste with pain
 the wonted service of his squires he tarries
 this done he springs upon the steed amain
 erewhile the champion's who defended paris
 and him with speed towards the listed plain
 fixt for that fierce assay the courser carries
 even then the king and barons thither made
 so that the strife was little time delaid

 xlvii
 put on and laced the shining helmets were
 and given to either champion was the spear
 quickly the trumpet's blast was heard in air
 whose signal blanched a thousand cheeks with fear
 levelled those cavaliers their lances bear
 spurring their warlike steeds to the career
 and in mid champaign meet with such a shock
 that earth appears to rive and heaven to rock

 xlviii
 from this side and from that the eagle flew
 which jove in air was wonted to sustain
 so hurtled but with plumes of different hue
 those others often on thessalian plain
 the beamy lances rested by the two
 well warranted the warriors' might and main
 and worse than that encounter had withstood
 so towers resist the wind so rocks the flood

 xlix
 as turpin truly writes into the sky
 upwent the splinters broke in the career
 for two or three fell flaming from on high
 which had ascended to the starry sphere
 the knights unsheathed their faulchions from the thigh
 and like those who were little moved by fear
 for new encounter wheeled and man to man
 pointing at one another's vizor ran

 l
 they pointing at the vizors' sight attacked
 nor with their faulchions at the steeds took aim
 each other to unhorse unseemly act
 since in that quarrel they are nought to blame
 those err nor know the usage why by pact
 deem they were bound their horses not to maim
 without pact made 'twas reckoned a misdeed
 and an eternal blot to smite a steed

 li
 they level at the vizor which is double
 and yet resists such mighty blows with pain
 the champions evermore their strokes redouble
 faster than pattering hail which mars the grain
 and bruises branch and leaf and stalk and stubble
 and cheats the hopes of the expecting swain
 to you is known the force of either brand
 and known the force of either warrior's hand

 lii
 but yet no stroke well worthy of their might
 those peers have dealt so cautious are the twain
 the tartar's faulchion was the first to bite
 by which was good rogero well nigh slain
 by one of those fell blows which either knight
 so well could plant his shield was cleft in twain
 beneath his cuirass opened to the stroke
 and to the quick the cruel weapon broke

 liii
 the assistants' hearts were frozen at the blow
 so did rogero's danger them appal
 on whom the many's favor well they know
 and wishes rest if not of one and all
 and then had fortune ordered matters so
 as the most part desired they should befall
 taken had been the tartar king or slain
 so had that blow offended all the train

 liv
 i think that blow was by some angel stayed
 to save rogero from the mischief near
 yet at the king nor answer he delayed
 he dealt a stroke more terrible than e'er
 as mandricardo's head he aims his blade
 but such the fury of the cavalier
 and such his haste he less my blame deserves
 if slanting from the mark his faulchion swerves

 lv
 had balisarda smote him full though crowned
 with hector's helm the enchantment had been vain
 so reels the tartar by that stroke astound
 he from the bristlehand lets go the rein
 thrice with his head he threats to smite the ground
 while his unguided courser scowers the plain
 that brigliadoro whom by name you know
 yet for his change of master full of woe

 lvi
 never raged trampled serpent never so
 raged wounded lion as in fell despite
 raged mandricardo rallying from that blow
 which had deprived of sense the astonied knight
 and as his pride and fury waxes grow
 as much yea more his valour and his might
 he at rogero makes his courser vault
 with sword uplifted high for the assault

 lvii
 poised in his stirrups stood the tartar lord
 and aiming at his foeman's casque believed
 he with the stroke of his descending sword
 rogero to the bosom should have cleaved
 but from that youth yet quicker in his ward
 a wound beneath his arm the king received
 which made wide daylight in the stubborn mail
 that clothed the better armpit with its scale

 lviii
 rogero drawing balisarda back
 out sprang the tepid blood of crimson stain
 hence mandricardo's arm did vigour lack
 and with less dint descended durindane
 yet on the croup the stripling tumbled back
 closing his eyelids through excess of pain
 and memorable aye had been that blow
 had a worse helmet clothed the warrior's brow

 lix
 for this he pauses not but spurs amain
 and mandricardo smites in the right side
 here little boots the texture of the chain
 and the well wealded metal's temper tried
 against that sword which never falls in vain
 which was enchanted to no end beside
 but that against it nothing should avail
 enchanted corselet or enchanted mail

 lx
 whate'er that sword takesin it shears outright
 and in the tartar's side inflicts a wound
 he curses heaven and raves in such despite
 less horribly the boisterous billows sound
 he now prepares to put forth all his might
 the shield with argent bird and azure ground
 he hurls with rage transported from his hand
 and grasps with right and left his trenchant brand

 lxi
 "marry" rogero cried "it needs no more
 to prove your title to that ensign vain
 which now you cast away and cleft before
 nor can you more your right in it maintain"
 so saying he parforce must prove how sore
 the danger and the dint of durindane
 which smites his front and with such weight withal
 a mountain lighter than that sword would fall

 lxii
 if cleft his vizor through the midst 'twas well
 that from the sight diverged the trenchant blade
 which on the saddle's plated pommel fell
 nor yet its double steel the faulchion stayed
 it reached his armour like soft wax the shell
 oped and the skirts wherewith 'twas overlaid
 and trenched upon his thigh a grievous wound
 so that 'twas long ere he again waxed sound

 lxiii
 the spouting blood of either cavalier
 their arms had crimsoned in a double drain
 hence diversly the people guessed which peer
 would have the better of the warlike twain
 but soon rogero made the matter clear
 with that keen sword so many a champion's bane
 with this he at that part in fury past
 whence mandricardo had his buckler cast

 lxiv
 he the left side of his good cuirass gored
 and found a passage to the heart below
 which a full palm above the flank he bored
 so that parforce the tartar must forego
 his every title to the famous sword
 the blazoned buckler and its bird of snow
 and yield together with these seeds of strife
  dearer than sword and shield  his precious life

 lxv
 not unavenged the unhappy monarch dies
 for in the very moment he is smit
 the sword  for little period his  he plies
 and good rogero's vizor would have split
 but that he stopt the stroke in wary wise
 and broke its force and vigour ere it lit
 its force and vigour broke for he below
 the better arm first smote his tartar foe

 lxvi
 smit was the child by mandricardo's hand
 at the same moment he that monarch slew
 he albeit thick divides an iron band
 and good steel cap beneath it inches two
 lies buried in the head the trenchant brand
 the solid bone and sinew severed through
 astound rogero fell on earth reversed
 and from his head a stream of lifeblood burst

 lxvii
 rogero was the first who went to ground
 and so much longer did the king delay
 nigh every one of those who waited round
 weened he the prize and vaunt had borne away
 so erred his doralice that oft was drowned
 in tears and often clad in smiles that day
 she thanked her god with hands to heaven extended
 that in such wise the fearful fight had ended

 lxviii
 but when by tokens manifest appear
 the live man living and the dead man slain
 the favourers of those knights with change of cheer
 some weep and some rejoice an altered train
 king lord and every worthiest cavalier
 crowd round rogero who has risen with pain
 him to embrace and gratulate they wend
 and do him grace and honour without end

 lxix
 each with rogero is rejoiced and feels
 that which he utters in his heart among
 the crowd the sericane alone conceals
 other than what he vouches with his tongue
 he pleasure in his countenance reveals
 with envy at the conquest inly stung
 and  were his destiny or chance to blame 
 curses whiche'er produced rogero's name

 lxx
 what of rogero's favour can be said
 what of caresses many true and kind
 from agramant that not without his aid
 would have unrolled his ensigns the wind
 who had to move from africk been afraid
 nor would have trusted in his host combined
 he now king mandricardo is no more
 esteems him the united world before

 lxxi
 nor to rogero lean the men alone
 to him incline as well the female train
 who for the land of france had left their own
 amid the troops of africk or of spain
 and doralice herself although she moan
 and for her lover cold and pale complain
 save by the griding curb of shame represt
 her voice perchance had added to the rest

 lxxii
 i say perchance nor warrant it i dare
 albeit the thing may easily be true
 for such his manners such his merits are
 so beauteous is rogero's form to view
 she from experience we are well aware
 so prone to follow whatsoe'er is new
 that not to play the widow's lovelorn part
 she on rogero well might set her heart

 lxxiii
 though he did well alive what could be done
 with mandricardo after he was dead
 'tis fitting she provide herself with one
 that her by night or day may bravely stead
 meanwhile to young rogero's succour run
 the king's physician in his art best read
 who having seen the fruits of that fell strife
 already has ensured rogero's life

 lxxiv
 agramant bids them diligently lay
 the wounded warrior in his tent and there
 is evermore beside him night and day
 him with such love he watches with such care
 to his bed the tartar's arms and buckler gay
 so bade the moorish king suspended were
 suspended all save trenchant durindana
 relinquished to the king of sericana

 lxxv
 with mandricardo's arms his other weed
 was to rogero given and given with these
 was warlike brigliador whom on the mead
 orlando left distraught with his disease
 to agramant rogero gave the steed
 well knowing how that goodly gift would please
 no more of this parforce my strain returns
 to her that vainly for rogero burns

 lxxvi
 bradamant's torment have i to recount
 while for the courier damsel she did stay
 with tidings of her love to alban's mount
 to her hippalca measured back her way
 she of frontino first and rodomont
 and next of good rogero had to say
 how to the fount anew he had addrest
 his way with richardetto and the rest

 lxxvii
 and how the child in rescue of the steed
 had gone with her to find the paynim rude
 and weened to have chastized his foul misdeed
 that from a woman took frontino good
 and how the youth's design did ill succeed
 because the king had other way pursued
 the reason too why to mount alban's hold
 rogero had not come at full she told

 lxxviii
 and fully she to bradamant exprest
 what to excuse himself rogero said
 she after drew the letter from her breast
 wherewith entrusted she had thither sped
 with visage which more care than hope confest
 the paper bradamant received and read
 which but that she expected to have seen
 rogero's self more welcome would have been

 lxxix
 to find herself with written scroll appaid
 in good rogero's place whom she attends
 marred her fair visage which such fear pourtrayed
 despite and sorrow as her bosom rends
 ten times the page she kisses while the maid
 as oft to him who writes her heart commends
 the tears alone which trickle from her eyes
 keep it from kindling at her burning sighs

 lxxx
 four times nay six she that epistle read
 and willed moreover that as many more
 the message by that damsel should be said
 who word and letter to mount alban bore
 this while unceasing tears the lady shed
 nor i believe would ever have given o'er
 save by the hope consoled that she anew
 should briefly her beloved rogero view

 lxxxi
 rogero's word was pledged for his return
 when fifteen days or twenty were gone by
 so had he after to hippalca sworn
 bidding her boldly on his faith rely
 "from accidents that chance at every turn"
 cried bradamant "what warranty have i
 alas  and such are commonest in war 
 that none the knight's return for ever bar

 ` lxxxii
 "alas alas rogero that above
 myself hast evermore been prized by me
 who would have thought thou more than me could'st love
 any and most thy mortal enemy
 and harm'st where thou should'st help nor do i see
 if thou as worthy praise or blame regard
 such tardiness to punish and reward

 lxxxiii
 "i know not if thou knowest  the stones know 
 how by troyano was thy father slain
 and yet troyano's son against his foe
 thou would'st defend and keep from harm or stain
 such vengeance upon him do'st thou bestow
 and do his vengers as their meed obtain
 that i descended of his stock should be
 the martyr of the mortal cruelty"

 lxxxiv
 to her rogero in his absence said
 the lady these sad words and more beside
 lamenting aye while her attendant maid
 nor once alone but often certified
 the stripling would observe his faith and prayed
 her  who could do no better  to abide
 the child's arrival till the time came round
 when he by promise to return was bound

 lxxxv
 the comfort that hippalca's words convey
 and hope companion of the loving train
 bradamant's fear and sorrow so allay
 that she enjoys some respite from her pain
 this moves her in mount alban's keep to stay
 nor ever thence that lady stirred again
 until the day that day the youthful knight
 had fixt who ill observed his promise plight

 lxxxvi
 but in that he his promise ill maintained
 no blame upon rogero should be cast
 him one or other cause so long detained
 the appointed time parforce he overpast
 on a sick bed long time he sorely pained
 was laid wherein a month or more he past
 in doubt of death so deeply him had gored
 erewhile in fight the tartar monarch's sword

 lxxxvii
 him on the day prefixed the maid attended
 nor other tidings of the youth had read
 but those he through hippalca had commended
 and that which after richardetto said
 who told how him rogero had defended
 and freed the captive pair to prison led
 the tidings overjoyed she hears repeat
 yet blended with some bitter is the sweet

 lxxxviii
 for she had heard as well in that discourse
 for might and beauty voiced marphisa's praise
 heard how rogero thither bends his course
 together with that lady as he says
 where in weak post and with unequal force
 king agramant the christian army stays
 such fair companionship the lady lauds
 but neither likes that union nor applauds

 lxxxix
 nor light suspicion has she of that queen
 for were marphisa beauteous as was said
 and they together till that time had been
 't were marvel but rogero loved the maid
 yet would she not believe but hung between
 her hopes and fears and in mount alban stayed
 and close and anxious there until the day
 which was to bring her joy or sorrow lay

 xc
 this while mount alban's prince and castellain
 rinaldo first of that fair brotherhood
  i say in honour not in age for twain
 in right of birth before the warrior stood
 who  as the sun illumes the starry train 
 had by his deeds ennobled aymon's blood
 one day at noon with none beside a page
 to serve him reached that famous fortilage

 xci
 hither had good rinaldo now repaired
 because returning paris ward again
 from brava whither had he often fared
 as said to seek angelica in vain
 he of that pair those evil news had heard
 his malagigi and his viviane
 how they were to maganza to be sent
 and hence to agrismont his way had bent

 xcii
 there hearing of the safety of that pair
 and of their enemies' defeat and fall
 and how rogero and marphisa were
 the authors of their ruin and how all
 his valiant brethren and his cousins are
 returned and harboured in mount alban's hall
 until he there embrace the friendly throng
 each hour appears to him a twelvemonth long

 xciii
 his course to mont albano had he ta'en
 and there embracing wife and children dear
 mother and brethren and the cousins twain
 they who were captives to their foe whilere
 a parent swallow seems amid that train
 which with full beak its fasting youth doth cheer
 with them a day or more the warrior stayed
 then issued forth and others thence conveyed

 xciv
 guichard duke aymon's eldest born and they
 richard alardo and richardet' combined
 vivian and malagigi wend their way
 in arms the martial paladin behind
 bradamant waiting the appointed day
 which she in her desire too slow opined
 feigned herself ailing to the brethren true
 nor would she join in arms the banded crew

 xcv
 and saying that she ailed most truly said
 yet 'twas not corporal pain or fever sore
 it was desire that on her spirit preyed
 diseased with love's disastrous fit no more
 rinaldo in mount alban's castle stayed
 with him his kinsman's flower the warrior bore
 how he for paris journeyed and how well
 he succoured charles shall other canto tell


 canto 31

 argument
 rinaldo and dudon fight then friendship make
 and to each other fitting honour pay
 agramant's host the united champions break
 and scatter it like chaff in disarray
 brandimart wages war for roland's sake
 with rodomont and loses in the fray
 this while for good baiardo with more pain
 contend rinaldo and the sericane


 i
 what sweeter gladder state could be possest
 than falls to the enamoured bosom's share
 what happier mode of life what lot more blest
 than evermore the chains of love to wear
 were not the lover 'mid his joys distrest
 by that suspicious fear that cruel care
 that martyrdom which racks the suffering sprite
 that phrensied rage which jealousy is hight

 ii
 for by all bitters else which interpose
 before enjoyment of this choicest sweet
 love is augmented to perfection grows
 and takes a finer edge to drink and eat
 hunger and thirst the palate so dispose
 and flavour more our beverage and our meat
 feebly that wight can estimate the charms
 of peace who never knew the pain of arms

 iii
 that which the heart aye sees though undiscerned
 of human eye we can support in peace
 to him long absent to his love returned
 a longer absence is but joy's increase
 service may be endured though nought is earned
 so that the hope of guerdon does not cease
 for worthy service in the end is paid
 albeit its wages should be long delaid

 iv
 scorn and repulse and finally each pain
 of suffering love his every martyrdom
 through recollection make us entertain
 delights with greater rapture when they come
 but if weak mind be poisoned by that bane
 that filthy pest conceived in stygian home
 though joy ensue with all its festive pleasures
 the wretched lover ill his comfort measures

 v
 this is that cruel and envenomed wound
 where neither salve nor portion soothes the smart
 nor figure made by witch nor murmured sound
 nor star benign observed in friendly part
 nor aught beside by zoroaster found
 inventor as he was of magic art
 fell wound which more than every other woe
 makes wretched man despair and lays him low

 vi
 o' cruel wound incapable of cure
 inflicted with such ease on lover's breast
 no less by false suspicion than by sure
 o wound whose pangs so wofully molest
 they reason and our better wit obscure
 and from it natural bent our judgment wrest
 wound which against all reason didst destroy
 the damsel of dordona's every joy

 vii
 i speak not of what fatal mischief wrought
 hippalca's and the brother's bitter blow
 i speak of fell and cruel tidings brought
 some few days after for the former woe
 weighed with this other was a thing of nought
 this after some digression will i show
 but first rinaldo's feats i must declare
 who with his troop to paris made repair

 viii
 the following day they met a cavalier
 towards evening with a lady by his side
 sable his shield and sable was his gear
 whose ground a bar of silver did divide
 as foremost and of seeming force the peer
 young richardetto to the joust defend
 he prompt for battle wheeled his courser round
 and for the tourney took sufficient ground

 ix
 between those knights no further parley past
 without more question charged the martial two
 rinaldo with the friendly troop stood fast
 and looked to see what issue would ensue
 "him from his saddle will i quickly cast
 if firm the footing and mine arm prove true"
 within himself young richardetto cries
 but that encounter ends in other wise

 x
 him underneath the vizor's sight offends
 the stranger champion of the sable weed
 with force so fell that he the youth extends
 above two lances' length beyond his steed
 quickly to venge the knight alardo wends
 but falls himself astounded on the mead
 sore handled and unhorsed by such a stroke
 his buckler in the cruel shock is broke

 xi
 his lance guichardo levelled when he spied
 outstretched upon the field the brethren two
 although "halt halt" renowned rinaldo cried
 "for this third course to me is justly due"
 but he as yet his helmet had not tied
 so that guichardo to the combat flew
 he kept his seat no better than the twain
 forthwith like them extended on the plain

 xii
 all to be foremost in the joust contend
 richardo malagigi viviane
 but to their strife rinaldo puts an end
 he shows himself in arms before the train
 saying " 'tis time that we to paris wend
 for us too long the tourney will detain
 if i expect till each his course has run
 and ye are all unseated one by one"

 xiii
 so spake the knight yet spake not in a tone
 to be o'erheard in what he inly said
 who thus foul scorn would to the rest have done
 both now had wheeled and fierce encounter made
 in the career rinaldo was not thrown
 who all the banded kinsmen much outweighed
 their spears like brittle glass to pieces went
 but not an inch the champions backward bent

 xiv
 the chargers such a rough encounter made
 that on his crupper sank each staggering horse
 rinaldo's rose so quick he might be said
 scarcely to interrupt his rapid course
 the stranger's broke his spine and shoulderblade
 that other shocked him with such desperate force
 when his lord sees him slain he leaves his seat
 and in an instant springs upon his feet

 xv
 and to his foe that having wheeled anew
 approached with hand unarmed the warrior cried
 "sir to the goodly courser whom ye slew
 because whenas he lived he was my pride
 i deem i ill should render honour due
 if thus unvenged by my good arm he died
 and so fall on and do as best ye may
 for we parforce must meet in new assay"

 xvi
 to him rinaldo "if we for thy horse
 have to contend in fight and nought beside
 take comfort for i ween that with no worse
 thou in his place by me shalt be supplied"
  "thou errest if thou deem'st his loss the source
 of my regret" the stranger knight replied
 "but i since thou divinest not my speech
 to thee my meaning will more plainly teach

 xvii
 "i should esteem it were a foul misdeed
 unless i proved thee also with the brand
 i if thou in this other dance succeed
 better or worse than me would understand
 then as it please afoot or on thy steed
 attack me so it be with arms in hand
 i am content all vantage to afford
 such my desire to try thee with the sword"

 xviii
 not long rinaldo paused he cried "i plight
 my promise not to balk thee of the fray
 and for i deem thou art a valiant knight
 and lest thou umbrage take at mine array
 these shall go on before nor other wight
 beside a page to hold my horse shall stay"
 so spake mount alban's lord and to his band
 to wend their way the warrior gave command

 xix
 to that king paladin with praise replied
 the stranger peer alighting on the plain
 rinaldo to the valet at his side
 consigned the goodly steed baiardo's rein
 and when his banner he no longer spied
 now widely distant with the warrior's train
 his buckler braced his biting faulchion drew
 and to the field defied the knight anew

 xx
 and now each other they in fight assail
 was never seen a feller strife in show
 neither believes his foeman can avail
 long in that fierce debate against his blow
 but when they knew well neighed in doubtful scale
 that they were fitly matched for weal or woe
 they laid their fury and their pride apart
 and for their vantage practised every art

 xxi
 their cruel and despiteous blows resound
 reechoing wide what time the valiant twain
 with cantlets of their shields now strew the ground
 now with their faulchions sever plate and chain
 yet more behoves to parry than to wound
 if either knight his footing would maintain
 for the first fault in fence by either made
 will with eternal mischief be appaid

 xxii
 one hour and more than half another stood
 the knights in battle and the golden sun
 already was beneath the tumbling flood
 and the horizon veiled with darkness dun
 nor yet had they reposed nor interlude
 had been since that despiteous fight begun
 'twixt these whom neither ire nor rancour warms
 but simple thirst of fame excites to arms

 xxiii
 rinaldo in himself revolving weighed
 who was the stranger knight so passing stout
 that not alone him bravely had gainsaid
 but oft endangered in that deadly bout
 and has so harassed with his furious blade
 he of its final issue stands in doubt
  he that the strife was ended would be fain
 so that his knightly honour took no stain

 xxiv
 the stranger knight upon the other side
 as little of his valiant foeman knew
 nor in that lord mount alban's chief descried
 in warfare so renowned all countries through
 and upon whom with such small cause defied
 his faulchion he in deadly combat drew
 he was assured he could not have in fight
 experience of a more redoubted wight

 xxv
 he gladly would be quit of the emprize
 he undertook to venge his courser's fall
 and could he without blame a mean devise
 would fain withdraw from that disastrous brawl
 so overcast already were the skies
 their cruel strokes well nigh fell harmless all
 both blindly strike more blindly yet those lords
 parry the stroke who scarce discern their swords

 xxvi
 he of mount alban is the first to say
 they should not combat darkling on the plain
 but should their duel till such time delay
 as slow arcturus should have turned his wain
 and adds as safely as himself might stay
 the foe in his pavilion of his train
 as duly tended honoured and well seen
 as he in any place had ever been

 xxvii
 to pray him has rinaldo little need
 he courteously accepts him for his host
 and thither the united warriors speed
 where lies mount alban's troop in chosen post
 from his attendant squire a goodly steed
 with sumptuous housings gorgeously embossed
 rinaldo takes with tempered sword and spear
 and these bestows upon the cavalier

 xxviii
 for montalbano's lord the stranger guest
 the baron recognised with whom he came
 because before they reached their place of rest
 the paladin had chanced himself to name
 and for they brethren were with love opprest
 his tenderness him wholly overcame
 and touched with kind affection at his heart
 from his full eyes the tears of pleasure start

 xxix
 guido the savage was that cavalier
 who with marphisa leagued the martial maid
 sansonet and the sons of olivier
 long sailed the sea as i erewhile have said
 from earlier meeting with his kindred dear
 by pinnabel the felon knight delaid
 seized by that traitor and by him detained
 to enforce the wicked law he had ordained

 xxx
 sir guido when he knew his host to be
 rinaldo famed above each famous knight
 whom he had burned with more desire to see
 than ever blindman covets the lost light
 in rapture cries "what fortune tempted me
 with you my lord to strive in deadly fight
 whom long i have beloved and love whose worth
 i prize above all dwellers' upon earth

 xxxi
 "me on the distant bank of euxine's flood
 i guido am yclept constantia bare
 conceived of the illustrious seed and good
 of generous aymon as ye likewise are
 to visit you and my bold brotherhood
 is the occasion hither i repair
 and where to honour you i had in thought
 i see my coming has but mischief wrought

 xxxii
 "but that i neither ye nor the others knew
 must for so foul a fault be my excuse
 and if i can amend it bid me do
 whate'er thou wilt nor ought will i refuse"
 when on this part and that between the two
 of interchanged embraces there was truce
 "take you no farther thought upon your side
 the battle to excuse" rinaldo cried

 xxxiii
 "for in complete assurance that you are
 a real offset of our ancient tree
 you could no better testimony bear
 than the tried valour which in you we see
 if your demeanour more pacific were
 we ill should have believed your ancestry
 since neither lion from the doe proceeds
 nor fearful pigeon hawk or eagle breeds"

 xxxiv
 while neither they through talk their journey stay
 neither through speed abate their talk those two
 reached the pavilions where the kinsmen lay
 there good rinaldo crying to his crew
 that this was guido whom so many a day
 they had impatiently desired to view
 much pleased the friendly troop and at his sight
 all like his father deemed the stranger knight

 xxxv
 i will not tell what welcome to the peer
 made richardet alardo and those twain
 what malagigi what sir aldigier
 and gallant vivian of that kindred train
 what every captain every cavalier
 what guido spake what they replied again
 i for conclusion of my tale will say
 he was well greeted of the whole array

 xxxvi
 ever i deem good guido would have been
 dear to his brethren bold but welcomed more
 was now the valiant knight and better seen
 that at another time as needed sore
 when the sun garlanded with radiance sheen
 upraised his visage from the watery floor
 sir guido and his kinsmen in a band
 beneath rinaldo's banner took their stand

 xxxvi
 so one day and another prick the train
 that they to paris' leaguered gates are nigh
 scarce ten miles distant on the banks of seine
 when as good fortune wills it they descry
 gryphon and aquilant the two that stain
 their virtuous armour with a different dye
 sable was aquilant's white gryphon's weed
 good olivier's and sigismonda's seed

 xxxviii
 in parley were they by a damsel stayed
 nor she of mean condition to behold
 that in a snowy samyte was arraid
 the vesture edged about with list of gold
 graceful and fair although she was dismaid
 and down her visage tears of sorrow rolled
 who with such mien and act her speech enforced
 it seemed of some high matter she discoursed

 xxxix
 as guido them they gallant guido knew
 he with the pair had been few days before
 and to rinaldo "behold those whom few
 in valour and in prowess go before
 and if they join your banner against you
 feebly will stand the squadrons of the moor"
 rinaldo vouched what valiant guido told
 how either champion was a warrior bold

 xl
 nor them he less had recognized at sight
 because such was the usage of the pair
 one by a vest all black and one all white
 he knows and by the ornaments they wear
 the brethren know as well mount alban's knight
 and give the warlike kinsmen welcome fair
 they both embrace rinaldo as a friend
 and of their ancient quarrel make an end

 xli
 they  erst at feud and with sore hate possest
 through truffaldino  which were long to say
 each other with fraternal love carest
 now putting all their enmity away
 rinaldo next sir sansonet addrest
 who somewhat later joined that fair array
 and knowing well his force and mighty thew
 received the cavalier with honour due

 xlii
 when she that gentle damsel now more near
 beholds renowned rinaldo him she knows
 acquainted with each paladin and peer
 she news which sorely grieve the warrior shows
 and thus begin "my lord your cousin dear
 to whom its safety church and empire owes
 roland erewhile so honoured and so sage
 now roves the world possest with frantic rage

 xliii
 "whence woe so direful and so strange ensued
 cannot by me to you be signified
 i saw on earth his sword and armour strewed
 doffed by that peer and scattered far and wide
 and i a pious knight and courteous viewed
 those arms collecting upon every side
 who in the guise of trophy to a tree
 fastened that fair and pompous panoply

 xliv
 "but from the trophied stem the sword withdrew
 the son of agrican that very day
 thou mayst conceive what mischief may ensue
 to charles and to the christened host's array
 from loss of durindana if anew
 the infidels that goodly blade should sway
 good brigliador as well who roved forsaken
 about those arms was by the paynim taken

 xlv
 "few days are past since i in shameful wise
 saw roland running naked in his mood
 sending forth piteous shrieks and fearful cries
 in fine that he is frantic i conclude
 nor this had i believed save with these eyes
 that strange and cruel wonder i had viewed"
 she added next how from the bridge's top
 embraced by rodomont she saw him drop

 xlvi
 "to whosoe'er i deem not roland's foe
 i tell my tale" pursued the dame again
 "that of the crowd who hear this cruel woe
 some one in pity to his cruel pain
 may strive the peer in paris to bestow
 or other friendly place to purge his brain
 well wot i if such tidings he receive
 nought unattempted brandimart will leave"

 xlvii
 fair flordelice was she the stranger dame
 that his own self to brandimart more dear
 who in pursuit of him to paris came
 that damsel after tells the cavalier
 how hate and strife were blown into a flame
 between gradasso and the tartar peer
 for roland's faulchion fierce gradasso's prey
 when slain in combat mandricardo lay

 xlviii
 by accident so strange and sad distrust
 rinaldo is distraught with ceaseless woe
 he feels his heart dissolve within his breast
 as in the sun dissolves the flake of snow
 and with unchanged resolve upon the quest
 of good orlando every where will go
 in hopes if he discover him to find
 some means of cure for his distempered mind

 xliv
 but since his band already had he dight
 did him the hand of heaven or fortune sway
 he first to put the saracens to flight
 and raise the siege of paris will assay
 but for it promised vantage he till night
 the assault of their cantonments will delay
 till the third watch or fourth when heavy sleep
 their senses shall in lethe's water steep

 l
 his squadron in the wood he placed and there
 ambushed he made them lie the daylight through
 but when the sun leaving this nether air
 in darkness to his ancient nurse withdrew
 and fangless serpent now and goat and bear
 with other beasts adorned the heavens anew
 which by the greater blaze had been concealed
 rinaldo moved his silent troop afield

 li
 a mile anend with aquilant he prest
 gryphon alardo and vivian of his race
 guido and sansonetto and the rest
 without word spoken and with stealthy pace
 the moorish guard they find with sleep opprest
 they slaughter all nor grant one paynim grace
 and ere they were by others seen or heard
 into their midmost camp the squadron spurred

 lii
 at the first charge on that unchristened band
 their guard and sentries taken by surprise
 so broken are by good rinaldo's brand
 no wight is left save he who slaughtered lies
 their first post forced the paynims understand
 no laughing matter is the lord's emprize
 for sleeping and dismaid their naked swarms
 make small resistance to such warriors' arms

 liii
 to strike more dread into the moorish foe
 mount alban's champion leading the assault
 bade beat his drums and bade his bugles blow
 and with loud echoing cries his name exalt
 he spurs baiardo that is nothing slow
 he clears the lofty barriers at a vault
 trampling down foot o'erturning cavalier
 and scatters booth and tent in his career

 liv
 is none so bold of all that paynimry
 but what his stiffened hair stands up on end
 hearing mount alban's and rinaldo's cry
 from earth into the starry vault ascend
 him the twin hosts of spain and afric fly
 nor time in loading baggage idly spend
 who will not wait that deadly fury more
 which to have proved so deeply irks them sore

 lv
 guido succeeds no less their foe pursue
 the valiant sons of warlike olivier
 alardo richardet and the other two
 sansonet's sword and horse a pathway clear
 and well is proved upon that paynim crew
 the force of vivian and of aldigier
 thus each bestirs himself like valorous knight
 who follows clermont's banner to the fight

 lvi
 seven hundred men with good rinaldo speed
 drawn from mount alban and the townships nigh
  no fiercer erst obeyed achilles' lead 
 enured to summer and to winter sky
 so stout each warrior is so good at need
 a hundred would not from a thousand fly
 and better than some famous cavaliers
 many amid that squadron couch their spears

 lvii
 if good rinaldo gathers small supplies
 from rents or cities which his rule obey
 so these he bound by words and courtesies
 and sharing what he had with his array
 is none that ever from his service buys
 deserter by the bribe of better pay
 of montalbano these are left in care
 save pressing need demands their aid elsewhere

 lviii
 them now in succour of king charles he stirred
 and left with little guard his citadel
 among the africans that squadron spurred
 that squadron of whose doughty feats i tell
 doing by them what wolf on woolly herd
 does where galesus' limpid waters well
 or lion by the bearded goat and rank
 that feeds on cinyphus's barbarous bank

 lix
 tidings to charles rinaldo had conveyed
 that he for paris with his squadron steers
 to assail by night the paynims ill purveyed
 and ready and in arms the king appears
 he when his help is needed comes in aid
 with all his peerage and beside his peers
 brings monodantes' son amid that crew
 of flordelice the lover chaste and true

 lx
 whom by such long and by such tedious way
 she sought throughout the realm of france in vain
 here by the cognizance his old display
 afar by her distinguished from the train
 at the first sight of her he quits the fray
 and wears a semblance loving and humane
 he clipt her round with many a fond caress
 and kissed a thousand times or little less

 lxi
 to dame and damsel in that ancient age
 they trusted much that in their wandering vein
 roved unescorted many a weary stage
 through foreign countries and by hill and plain
 whom they returning hold for fair and sage
 nor of their faith suspicion entertain
 here brandimart by flordelice was taught
 how roland wandered of his wits distraught

 lxii
 had he such strange and evil tidings heard
 from other lips he scarce had these believed
 but credited fair flordelice's word
 from whom more wondrous things he had received
 nor this as told by other she averred
 this had she seen and ill could be deceived
 for well as any she orlando knows
 and both the when and where that damsel shows

 lxiii
 she tells him how the perilous bridge's floor
 from cavaliers king rodomont defends
 where on a pompous sepulchre the moor
 his prisoners' ravished arms and vest suspends
 tells how she saw orlando raging sore
 do fearful deeds and her relation ends
 describing how the paynim fell reversed
 to his great peril in the stream immersed

 lxiv
 brandimart who the country loves as dear
 as man can love a brother friend or son
 disposed to seek orlando far and near
 nor pain nor peril in the adventure shun
 till something for the comfort of that peer
 by wizard's or by leech's art be done
 armed as he is leaps lightly on his steed
 and takes his way beneath the lady's lead

 lxv
 thitherward were orlando she had spied
 in company the knight and lady made
 they daily post till to that bridge they ride
 which argier's king maintained in arms arraid
 to him the guard their coming signified
 courser and arms his squires as well conveyed
 and brandimart no sooner is at hand
 than rodomont is armed and at his stand

 lxvi
 with lofty voice the sovereign of argier
 assorting with his moody rage 'gan say
 "  whoe'er thou art sir knight and whencesoe'er 
 brought by mistake of purpose or of way
 light from thine horse and doff thy warlike gear
 to deck this sepulchre ere thee i slay
 an offering to its lovely tenant's spirit
 and thou in thy forced homage have no merit"

 lxvii
 brandimart at the paynim's proud discourse
 his weapon in the rest for answer layed
 he good batoldo spurred his gentle horse
 and at the champion with such fury made
 as showed that he for courage and for force
 with any warrior in the world had weighed
 king rodomont as well with rested spear
 thundered along the bridge in fierce career

 lxviii
 the paynim's courser ever used to go
 upon that bridge's fearful pass where one
 fell prone parforce into the stream below
 securely to the fierce encounter run
 while trembling and irresolute in show
 that other to the unwonted course is gone
 quivers the bridge beneath as it would sink
 narrow that passage is unfenced the brink

 lxix
 with heavy spears the growth of forest hoar
 saplings roughhewn those masters of the just
 upon the perilous bridge encountering sore
 exchange on either side no gentle thrust
 nor much their mighty strength or manegelore
 avails the steeds for prostrate in the dust
 crumbles each knight and charger in midcourse
 whelmed in one fate the rider and his horse

 lxx
 when either steed would nimbly spring from ground
 as the spur galled and gored his bleeding flank
 he on that little bridge no footing found
 for all to narrow was the scanty plank
 hence both fall headlong and the deafening sound
 reecho vaulted skies and grassy bank
 so rang our stream when from the heavenly sphere
 was hurled the sun's illfated charioteer

 lxxi
 with all their weight down hurtled from the steep
 coursers and cavaliers who sate them well
 and dived into the river's darksome deep
 to search for beauteous nymph in secret cell
 nor this the first nor yet the second leap
 which from the bridge had made that infidel
 who often floundering in its oozy bed
 well in the soundings of that stream was read

 lxxii
 he where 'tis hand and where 'tis softer knows
 where shallow is the water where profound
 with breast and flanks above the waves he rose
 and brandimart assailed on safer ground
 brandimart whirling with the current goes
 while his steed's feet the faithless bottom pound
 he with his lord stands rooted in the mud
 with risk to both of drowning in the flood

 lxxiii
 whelming them upsidedown the waters flow
 and plunge them in the river's deepest bed
 the horse is uppermost the knight below
 from the bridge looks his lady sore bested
 and tear employs and prayer and suppliant vow
  "ah rodomont for love of her whom dead
 ye worship do not deed of such despite
 permit not sir the death of such a knight

 lxxiv
 "ah courteous lord if e'er you loved withal
 have pity upon me who love this peer
 let it suffice that he become thy thrall
 for if thou on this stone suspend his gear
 amid whatever spoils adorn the wall
 the best and worthiest will his spoils appear"
 she ended and her prayer so well addrest
 it touched though hard to move the paynim's breast

 lxxv
 moved by her words he lent her lover aid
 so by his courser in the stream immersed
 and largely drank albeit with little thirst
 but rodomont a while his help delayed
 and seized the warrior's sword and helmet first
 him half exhausted from the stream he drew
 and prisoned with that other captive crew

 lxxvi
 all happiness was in that damsel spent
 when taken she her brandimart espied
 although to see him captive more content
 than to behold him perish in the tide
 none but herself she blames for the event
 who thitherward had been the champion's guide
 she having to that faithful warrior shown
 how at the bridge orlando she had known

 lxxvii
 she parts and has anew already planned
 thither with good rinaldo to resort
 with guido sansonet of doughty hand
 or other cavalier of pepin's court
 some warrior good by water and by land
 that with the saracen will well assort
 who if no stronger than her baffled knight
 with better fortune may maintain the fight

 lxxviii
 for many days the damsel vainly strayed
 ere she encountered any one who bore
 semblance of knight that might afford her aid
 and free her prisoned lover from the moor
 after she long and fruitless search had made
 at length a warrior crost her way that wore
 a richly ornamented vest whose ground
 with trunks of cypresses was broidered round

 lxxix
 who was that champion shall be said elsewhere
 for i to paris must return and show
 how malagigi and rinaldo are
 victorious o'er the routed moorish foe
 to count the flyers were a useless care
 or many drowned in stygian streams below
 the darkness rendered turpin's labour vain
 who tasked himself to tell the pagans slain

 lxxx
 king agramant in his pavilion lies
 from his first sleep awakened by a knight
 he that the king will be a prisoner cries
 save he with speed betake himself to flight
 the monarch looks about him and espies
 his paynim bands dispersed in panic fright
 naked they far and near desert the field
 nay never halt to snatch the covering shield

 lxxxi
 uncounselled and confused the king arrayed
 his naked limbs in knightly plate and chain
 when thither falsiron the spaniard made
 grandonio balugantes and their train
 they to the moorish king the risk displayed
 of being taken in that press or slain
 and vouched if thence he should in safety fare
 he well might thank propitious fortune's care

 lxxxii
 marsilius so sobrino so their fear
 express so one and all the friendly band
 they warn him that destruction is as near
 as swift mount alban's lord is nigh at hand
 and if against so fierce a cavalier
 and such a troop he seeks to make a stand
 he and his friends in that disastrous strife
 will surely forfeit liberty or life

 lxxxiii
 but he to arles and narbonne may retreat
 with such few squadrons as his rule obey
 since either is well fortified and meet
 the warfare to maintain above one day
 and having saved his person the defeat
 may venge upon the foe by this delay
 his troops may rally quickly in that post
 and rout in fine king charles' conquering host

 lxxxiv
 agramant to those lords' opinion bent
 though that hard counsel he could ill endure
 as if supplied with wings towards arles he went
 by roads which offered passage most secure
 beside safe guides much favoured his intent
 his setting out when all things were obscure
 scaping the toils by good rinaldo spread
 some twenty thousand of the paynims fled

 lxxxv
 those whom rinaldo whom his brethren slew
 whom oliviero's sons the valiant twain
 those who were slaughtered by mount alban's crew
  the fierce seven hundred good rinaldo's train 
 those whom the valiant sansonet o'erthrew
 and those that in their flight were drowned in seine
 he who would count might count as well what flowers
 zephyr and flora shed mid aprilshowers

 lxxxvi
 here one conjectures malagigi bore
 a part in the alarum of that night
 not that he stained the mead with paynim gore
 nor splintered heads but that the wizard wight
 infernal angels by his magic lore
 called from tartarean caverns into light
 whose many spears and banners waving wide
 two kingdoms such as france had scarce supplied

 lxxxvii
 and with them such sonorous metal brayed
 so many drums and martial noises sounded
 so many steeds in that encounter neighed
 so many cries  with rush of foot confounded 
 rose all about that hill dale wood and glade
 from distant parts the deafening din rebounded
 and struck into the moors such sudden dread
 they turned and from the field in panic fled

 lxxxviii
 their king forgets no how rogero lay
 sore wounded and as yet in evil case
 him with what care they could he made convey
 from that dread field on horse of easy pace
 borne to the sea by the securest way
 they in a bark the suffering warrior place
 and thence commodiously to arles transport
 whither their wasted squadrons make resort

 lxxxix
 chased by rinaldo and king charlemagne
 a hundred thousand or well nigh i ween
 by wood by mountain valley and by plain
 flying the fury of the franks are seen
 more find the passage blocked and widely stain
 with crimson what before was white and green
 not so gradasso's puissant troops was spent
 who farther from the field had pitched his tent

 xc
 nay when he hears it is mount alban's knight
 by whom assailed the paynim quarters are
 he in his heart exults with such delight
 that he for very joy leaps here and there
 he thanks and lauds his god who him that night
 blest with so high a fortune and so rare
 hoping to win the horse without a peer
 baiardo from the christian cavalier

 xci
 gradasso had desired long time before
 i think you will have read the tale elsewhere
 to back that courser which rinaldo bore
 and durindana by his side to wear
 he with a hundred thousand men and more
 to france with this design had made repair
 and had erewhile to bloody fight defied
 even for that good steed mount alban's pride

 xcii
 hence had that king repaired to the seashore
 the place assigned to end their discord fell
 but all was marred by malagigi's lore
 who cheating good rinaldo with a spell
 to sea the champion in a pinnace bore
 too tedious were the tale at length to tell
 hence evermore gradasso had opined
 the gentle baron was of craven kind

 xciii
 now that gradasso learns mount alban's peer
 is he that storms the camp in huge delight
 armed on alfana leaps the cavalier
 and through the pitchy darkness seeks the knight
 o'erturning all who cross his fierce career
 he leaves afflicted and in piteous plight
 the broken bands of afric and of france
 all food alike for his widewasting lance

 xciv
 he seeks the paladin now here now there
 echoing his name as loud as he can shout
 and thitherward inclines his courser where
 the bodies are most thickly strown about
 at length encounter sword to sword the pair
 for broken are alike their lances stout
 which shivering in their hands had flown upright
 and smote the starry chariot of the night

 xcv
 when king gradasso recognized the foe
 not by the blazoned bearing of his shield
 but by baiardo  by that horrid blow
 which made him seem sole champion of the field
 he to reproach the knight was nothing slow
 and of unworthy action him appealed
 in that he had not kept his ground and day
 erewhile appointed for the fierce assay

 xcvi
 "belike thou hoped" said he of sericane
 "if for that time my vengeance thou couldst fly
 we should not meet in this wide world again
 but we are met thou seest anew and i
 be sure though thou shouldst seek the stygian reign
 or be from earth translated to the sky
 will hunt thee save that courser thou forego
 be it through heaven above or hell below

 xcvii
 "dost thou as matched with me mistrust thy force
 and that thou wert ill paired was seen whilere
 and more esteemest life than fame a course
 remains which thee may from thy peril clear
 and thou if thou in peace resign the horse
 may'st live if life be deemed so passing dear
 but live afoot unmeriting a steed
 that dost by chivalry such foul misdeed"

 xcviii
 guido the savage as he spake was nigh
 with richardetto and the warlike twain
 brandished alike their trenchant swords on high
 to teach more wit to him of sericane
 but them rinaldo stopt with sudden cry
 nor brooked that he should injury sustain
 "am i too weak" he cried "without your aid
 to answer him that dares my deeds upbraid"

 xcix
 then to the pagan thus "gradasso hear
 and wilt thou listen thou shalt understand
 and i will prove it manifest and clear
 i came to seek thee out upon the strand
 and afterwards on thee will made appear
 the truth of all i say with arms in hand
 know then thou liest if e'er with slanderous speech
 thou taxest me with aught in knighthood's breach

 c
 "but warmly i beseech thee that before
 the battle be thou fully comprehend
 my just excuses that thou may'st no more
 me for my failure wrongly reprehend
 next for baiardo as agreed of yore
 'tis my desire that we afoot contend
 even as ordained by thee in desert place
 alone in knightly duel face to face"

 ci
 courteous was sericana's cavalier
 for generous bosoms aye such practise use
 and is content to listen to the peer
 how he his breach of promise will excuse
 with him he seeks the river side and here
 in simple words what chanced rinaldo shews
 form the true history removes the veil
 and cites all heaven to witness to his tale

 cii
 next calls upon the son of buovo who
 is of that history informed aright
 and now from point to point relates anew
 nor more nor less rehearsed the magic sleight
 when thus rinaldo "what i warrant true
 by witness i with arms in single fight
 for better proof will vouch upon thy crest
 both now and ever as it likes thee best"

 ciii
 the king of sericane as loath to leave
 the second quarrel for the former breach
 though doubtful how that tale he should receive
 takes in good part the bold rinaldo's speech
 not as upon the former battle's eve
 they choose their ground on barcellona's beach
 but on the morn ensuing and fast by
 a neighbouring fountain will the question try

 civ
 thither rinaldo will the steed convey
 there to be placed in common 'twixt the two
 if good gradasso take his foe or slay
 he wins baiardo without more ado
 but if gradasso fails in that affray
  should he be slain or else for mercy sue
 a prisoner to mount alban's valiant lord
 rinaldo shall possess the virtuous sword

 cv
 with mighty marvel and with greater pain
 the paladin from flordelice as shown
 had heard how troubled was his cousin's brain
 and from the damsel's lips as well had known
 how he his arms had scattered on the plain
 and heard the quarrel which from thence had grown
 in fine how king gradasso had the brand
 which won such thousand palms in roland's hand

 cvi
 when they so agreed gradasso made
 thither where camped apart his servants lay
 albeit warmly by rinaldo prayed
 he would with him in his pavillion stay
 the paynim king in armour was arrayed
 and so the paladin by break of day
 and to the destined fount came either lord
 the field of combat for the horse and sword

 cvii
 it seemed rinaldo's friends were all in fear
 and dreaded much before it was begun
 the issue of the fight their cavalier
 should wage against gradasso one to one
 much force much daring and much skill appear
 in that fierce king and since of milo's son
 the goodly sword was to his girdle tied
 all cheeks looked pale upon rinaldo's side

 cviii
 and malagigi more than all the rest
 sore doubted the event which would ensue
 he willingly himself would have addrest
 to disappoint the destined fight anew
 but fears if he that deadly strife arrest
 rinaldo's utter enmity to rue
 yet wroth with him upon that other score
 when he conveyed the warrior from the shore

 cix
 let others nourish idle grief and fears
 rinaldo wends afield secure and gay
 hoping that shame which to the knight appears
 too foul to be endured to wipe away
 so that of altafoglia and poictiers
 he may for ever silence the missay
 boldly and in his heart secure to win
 that battle's honour wends the paladin

 cx
 when now from either side those warriors meet
 nigh at the same time at the fountainside
 so in all points the pair each other greet
 with countenance so kind so satisfied
 'twould seem by kindred and by friendship sweet
 rinaldo and gradasso were allied
 but how they after closed in fierce affray
 i till another season shall delay


 canto 32

 argument
 to her that does for her rogero stay
 tidings are brought which irk the damsel sore
 that fair marphisa caused the youth's delay
 she bent to slay her grieving evermore
 departs and overtakes upon the way
 ullania with the three kings who rode before
 these she o'ercomes and had o'ercome that maid
 but that an evil law she disobeyed


 i
 i recollect that i was bound to sing
 i promised so but it escaped my mind
 of a suspicion fraught with suffering
 to bradamant of more displeasing kind
 and made by keener and more venomed sting
 than caused that other wound wherewith she pined
 which hearing richardet his news impart
 had pierced her breast and preyed upon her heart

 ii
 so was i bound to sing but i begun
 another song rinaldo crossed my way
 and then those deeds by savage guido done
 kept me employed and caused no small delay
 and so from subject i to subject run
 that i forgot of bradamant to say
 i now remember and will tell you ere
 you of rinaldo or gradasso hear

 iii
 but it behoves ere more of these be said
 i should awhile of agramant discourse
 who had from that night's raging fire conveyed
 to arles the remnant of his scattered force
 since to unite his troops and furnish aid
 and victual 'twas a place of much resource
 seated upon a river nigh the shore
 with spain in front and africa before

 iv
 with horse and foot of good or evil sort
 marsilius throughout spain their loss repairs
 and each armed back in barcellona's port
 furnished through love or fear for sea prepares
 the moor to council daily calls his court
 nor care nor cost the watchful monarch spares
 meanwhile sore taxes and repeated cess
 all africa's o'erburdened towns oppress

 v
 he offers rodomont if to his side
 he will return but offers him in vain
 renowned almontes' daughter as a bride
 his cousin she her portion oran's reign
 he lures not from his bridge that knight of pride
 who has so many sells such plate and chain
 collected there from cavaliers o'erthrown
 as serve to hide the monumental stone

 vi
 marphisa would not such a course pursue
 nay the redoubted damsel hearing said
 that agramant subdued by charles's crew
  his choicest warriors taken chased or dead 
 in arles was sheltered with his broken few
 thither unbidden by the monarch sped
 prompt to assist him with her friendly blade
 and proffered purse and person in his aid

 vii
 as a free gift to him the martial fair
 brunello bore nor had she done him wrong
 he for ten days and nights to swing in air
 had sorely feared from lofty gallows hung
 but seeing him unhelped by force or prayer
 of any one amid the paynim throng
 she thought foul scorn to stain her generous hands
 with such base blood and loosed the losel's bands

 viii
 she pardoned every ancient injury
 and him to agramant in arles conveyed
 well may you fancy with what joy and glee
 the monarch greeted her who brought him aid
 he in brunello's fate wills all shall see
 in what esteem he holds that warlike maid
 for he in earnest does upon her foe
 what fierce marphisa menaced but in show

 ix
 the hangman hung his corpse in desert field
 the craving vulture and the crow to feed
 rogero that erewhile had been his shield
 and from the noose that caitiff would have freed
 heaven's justice willed now lay with wound unhealed
 nor could assist the craven in his need
 and when the news were known the knot was tied
 so that brunello unassisted died

 x
 this while does good duke aymon's daughter mourn
 because those twenty days so slowly trail
  which term elapsed  rogero should return
 and be received into her church's pale
 time halts not more with him to foreign bourne
 exiled with prisoner pent in noisome jail
 pines the poor wretch for liberty and light
 or his loved land desired and gladsome sight

 xi
 aye sick with hope deferred the expecting maid
 that phoebus' steeds were foundered one while deemed
 then that his wheels were out of frame so stayed
 beyond the wonted term his chariot seemed
 yet longer than that day when faith delayed
 the sun which on the righteous hebrew beamed
 or than that night alcides was conceived
 she every day and every night believed

 xii
 how oft of dormouse badger or of bear
 the heavy slumber would she fain partake
 for she that time in sleep would waste and wear
 nor such prolonged repose desired to break
 nor wished the damsel any sound to hear
 until rogero's voice should her awake
 but not alone is this beyond her power
 she cannot close her eyes one single hour

 xiii
 she here and there throughout the livelong night
 tosses and turns nor ever finds repose
 and still impatient for the dawn of light
 from time to time she to her window goes
 to see if tithon's spouse the lily white
 yet scatters mingled with the crimson rose
 nor less desires the damsel when 'tis morn
 to see the golden stars the heaven adorn

 xiv
 when saving some four days the term was ended
 appointed for the youthful warrior's stay
 she full of hope the messenger attended
 from hour to hour that should arrive and say
 "behold rogero comes" and oft ascended
 a turret from whose top she might survey
 gay champaign wood and mid the wide expanse
 a portion of the road that led to france

 xv
 when shining arms at distance she perceives
 or any thing that speaks a cavalier
 'tis her desired rogero she believes
 and her fair eyes and brows are seen to clear
 if footman or unarmed the maid conceives
 it is a courier from the youthful peer
 and though fallacious every hope she feeds
 another and another aye succeeds

 xvi
 and then she arms and will the warrior meet
 and from the hill descends into the plain
 she finds him not and to montalban's seat
 hopes he by other road his way has ta'en
 in the design wherewith she moved her feet
 from thence she to her fort returns in vain
 nor finds him here nor there meanwhile expired
 the period whose approach she so desired

 xvii
  the period so prefixt o'erpast by one
 by two three six by eight by twenty days 
 she seeing not her spouse and tidings none
 receiving of the youth laments 'gan raise
 which had from snakehaired furies pity won
 in those dark realms that rhadamanthus sways
 she smote her eyes divine and bosoms fair
 she rent the tresses of her golden hair

 xviii
 "can it be true"  she cried  "shall i be fain
 to follow one that strives to hide and fly
 esteem a man that has me in disdain
 pray him that never hears my suppliant cry
 suffer who hates me o'er my heart to reign
 one that his lofty virtues holds so high
 'twere need some heavenborn goddess should descend
 from realms above his stubborn heart to bend

 xix
 "proud youth he knows my worship and my love
 nor me will have for lover or for slave
 the cruel stripling knows what pangs i prove
 yet will not aid me till i am in my grave
 nor let me tell my sorrows lest they move
 him his perverse and evil will to wave
 shunning me like malignant asp that fears
 to change his mood if he the charmer hears

 xx
 "ah love arrest this wight who runs so free
 outstripping my slow feet or me install
 in the condition whence thou tookest me
 such as i was ere thine or other's thrall
  alas how vain the hope that thou shouldst be
 ever to pity moved by suppliant call
 who sport yea feed and live in streams that rise
 from the distracted lover's brimming eyes

 xxi
 "but woe is me alas and what can i
 save my irrational desire lament
 which makes me soar a pitch so passing high
 i reach a region where my plumes are brent
 then unsustained fall headlong from the sky
 nor ends my woe on other flight intent
 again i imp my wings again i soar
 to flame and fall tormented evermore

 xxii
 "yea rather of myself should i complain
 than the desire to which i bared my breast
 whereby was reason hunted from her reign
 and all my powers by stronger force opprest
 thus borne from bad to worse without a rein
 i cannot the unbridled beast arrest
 who makes me see i to destruction haste
 that i more bitterness in death may taste

 xxiii
 "yet ah why blame myself wherein have i
 ever offended save in loving thee
 what wonder was it then that suddenly
 a woman's feeble sense opprest should be
 why fence and guard myself lest bearing high
 wise words and beauty rare should pleasure me
 most wretched is the mortal that would shun
 to look upon the visage of the sun

 xxiv
 "besides that me my destiny entrained
 words worthy credence moved me much that drew
 a picture of rare happiness ordained
 as meed of this fair unless to ensue
 if these persuasive words were false and feigned
 if famous merlin's counsel was untrue
 wrath at the wizard may i well profess
 but cannot therefore love rogero less

 xxv
 "both merlin and melissa have i need
 to blame and shall for ever blame the twain
 that to exhibit suckers of my seed
 conjured up spirits from infernal reign
 who with this empty hope my fancy feed
 me in perpetual bondage to detain
 nor other cause for this can i suppose
 save that they grudge me safe and sweet repose"

 xxvi
 sorrow the maid so wholly occupies
 room has she none for comfort or for rest
 yet maugre her affliction hope will rise
 and form a lodgement in her harassed breast
 and to the damsel's memory still supplies
 rogero's parting words to her addrest
 so makes her in all seeming facts' despite
 await from hour to hour the youthful knight

 xxvii
 for a month's space beyond those twenty days
 this hope affords fair bradamant content
 hence sorrow not on her so heavy weighs
 as it would else her harassed soul have shent
 she one day that along the road she strays
 by which she oft to meet rogero went
 hears tidings that of hope  last comfort left 
 like every other good her breast bereft

 xxviii
 bound homeward from the hostile camp where lay
 king agramant she met a gascon knight
 a prisoner to those paynims from the day
 that fought nigh paris was the famous fight
 the damsel prest him all he knew to say
 then to the point she covets led the knight
 asks of rogero on that theme abides
 listens to that not aught inquires besides

 xxix
 of him a full account did he afford
 as well acquainted with the court he said
 how matched with mandricardo strove that lord
 and layed the martial king in combat dead
 and how sore wounded by the tartar's sword
 above a month the stripling kept his bed
 and had the stranger here but closed his news
 well might his tale the missing knight excuse

 xxx
 but then subjoins the gascon cavalier
 how in the moorish camp a damsel lies
 by name marphisa hight of beauteous cheer
 bold and as skilled in arms of every guise
 who loves rogero and to him is dear
 and then the host so rarely sundered spies
 that every one throughout the paynim train
 deems that betrothed in wedlock are the twain

 xxxi
 and hope when healed shall be the youthful knight
 the marriage of those lovers will succeed
 for sure with pleasure and sincere delight
 those tidings paynim prince and monarch read
 since knowing either's superhuman might
 they augur from their loins will spring a breed
 in little season which shall pass in worth
 the mightiest race that ever was on earth

 xxxii
 what he rehearsed the gascon knight believed
 nor without cause believed the news he bore
 a rumour universally received
 and bruited through the squadrons of the moor
 who had that notion of their love conceived
 from signs of kindness witnessed evermore
 for  good or bad  though from one mouth it flows
 fame to a boundless torrent quickly grows

 xxxiii
 that she with him had brought the paynim aid
 and ne'er was seen without the cavalier
 the first foundation of the rumour layed
 but what confirmed that fame in every ear
 was that she having from the camp conveyed
 the thief brunello as i sang whilere
 as if alone to see rogero brought
 had to the camp returned uncalled unsought

 xxxiv
 she solely to the camp had ta'en her way
 to visit him that on a sickbed smarted
 nor once alone but often all the day
 there passed that maid and but at eve departed
 who gave yet greater cause of her to say
 that  known as one so haughty and hardhearted
 who all the world despised  she now was grown
 benign and humble to the child alone

 xxxv
 when bradamant the gascon's story heard
 that lady suffered such tormenting pain
 such cruel woe her inmost bosom stirred
 from falling she preserved herself with pain
 she turned her courser round without a word
 inflamed with jealousy and fierce disdain
 from her all hope the wretched damsel spurns
 and to her chamber breathing wrath returns

 xxxvi
 turned on her face her body on the bed
 armed as she is th4e grieving damsel throws
 and that the sad lament by sorrow bred
 may be unheard of any bites the clothes
 and so repeating what the stranger said
 to such a pitcher her smothered anguish grows
 her plaints no longer able to restrain
 so vents the maid parforce her piteous pain

 xxxvii
 "who ever can be trusted woe is me
 all false and cruel well may be esteemed
 if thou rogero false and cruel be
 that i so pious and so faithful deemed
 what foul and felon act what treachery
 was ever yet by tragic poet dreamed
 but will fall short of thine if thou wilt set
 the sum of my desert against thy debts

 xxxviii
 "wherefore rogero since no cavalier
 mates thee in beauteous form and daring feat
 since thou in matchless valour hast no peer
 and none with thee in gentleness compete
 why cannot we 'mid godlike gifts and clear
 allow thee truth thy graces to complete
 the praise of spotless truth to thee allow
 to which all other virtues yield and bow

 xxxix
 "knowest thou not without it worthless are
 all gentle bearing and all martial might
 as there is nothing howsoever fair
 that can be seen without the aid of light
 easily mightest thou a maid ensnare
 lord as thou was and idol in her sight
 her with thy honied words thou might'st have won
 to deem that cold and darksome was the sun

 xl
 "cruel what sin can trouble thee if thou
 do'st not her murder who loved thee repent
 if held so lightly be a breach of vow 
 beneath what burden will thy heart be bent
 what treatment will thine adversary know
 if one who loves like me thou so torment
 justice is none in heaven i well may say
 if heaven its vengeance for my wrongs delay

 xli
 "if of all human sins of deepest dye
 be fell ingratitude if doomed to smart
 for this the fairest angel of the sky
 was banished into foul and darksome part
 if mighty sins for mighty vengeance cry
 where due atonement cleanses not the heart
 beware lest thou beneath such vengeance groan
 ingrate that wouldest not thy sin atone

 xlii
 "cruel rogero i of theft beside
 all other sins may justly thee arraign
 that thou my heart has ravished form my side
  of this offence i will not i complain 
 but having made it mine that thou defied
 all right and took away thy gift again
 restore it well thou know'st what pains requite
 his sin who keeps what is another's right

 xliii
 "thou hast left me rogero thee to leave
 alas i neither will nor power possess
 but will and power have i my life to reave
 to scape from this o'erwhelming wretchedness
 to die at strife with thee alone i grieve
 for had the gods so pleased my lot to bless
 as to require my life when loved of thee
 never so welcome had been death to me"

 xliv
 resolved to die 'twas so the damsel cried
 and starting from her bed by passion warmed
 to her left breast her naked sword applied
 then recollected she was wholly armed
 meanwhile her better spirit at her side
 with these persuasive words her fury charmed
 "o lady born to such illustrious name
 would'st thou conclude thy life with such foul shame

 xlv
 "were it not better to the field to go
 where aye thy breath with glory may be spent
 there should rogero chance to lay thee low
 he to have slain thee haply may repent
 but should his faulchion deal the mortal blow
 what death could ever yield thee more content
 reason it were thou should'st by him be slain
 who dooms thee living to such passing pain

 xlvi
 "haply of that marphisa too before
 thou die thou yet may deadly vengeance take
 who with dishonest love and treacherous lore
 did thy beloved rogero's fealty shake"
 this seemed to please the mournful lady more
 than her first thought and she forthwith bade make
 a mantle for her arms which should imply
 her desperation and desire to die

 xlvii
 the vest is of that colour which is spied
 in leaf when gray and yellow are at strife
 when it is gathered from the branch or dried
 is the green blood that was it's parent's life
 embroidered is the surcoat's outer side
 with stems of cypress which disdain the knife
 which shoot not when by biting steel laid low
 a habit well according with her woe

 xlviii
 she took the courser that was wont to bear
 astolpho and with him the lance of gold
 by whose sole touch unhorsed all champions were
 needless anew i deem it to unfold
 why by astolpho given and when and where
 or how that spear obtained the warrior bold
 the lady took the lance but nothing guessed
 of the stupendous virtue it possessed

 xlix
 without attendants without squire alone
 the hill descending by the nearest way
 toward paris is the mournful damsel gone
 where camped erewhile the moorish forces lay
 for yet to her the tidings were unknown
 that good rinaldo and his bold array
 had raised with charles' and malagigi's aid
 the siege the paynims had to paris laid

 l
  cadurci and cahors city left behind 
 bradamant sees the mountain far and near
 whence dordogne's waters to the valley wind
 and montferrant's and clermont's towers appear
 when she a lady fair of semblance kind
 beholds by that same road towards her steer
 three knights were nigh and  at the pommel hung 
 a buckler from the damsel's saddle swung

 li
 before the lady and behind her ride
 more squires and maids a numerous company
 fair bradamant of one that past beside
 demanded who the stranger dame might be
 "that lady to the king of france" replied
 the squire "is sent upon an embassy
 from the lost isle which lies mid seas that roll
 their restless waves beyond the northern pole

 lii
 "some the lost isle some iceland call the reign
 whereof a royal lady fills the throne
 whose charms before those charms all beauties wane
 are such as heaven had dealt to her alone
 the shield you see she sends to charlemagne
 but with the pact and purpose plainly shown
 he should confer it on the knight whose worth
 is in his judgment fairest upon earth

 liii
 "she as she deems herself and it is true
 she is the fairest of all womankind
 a cavalier that should in heart and thew
 surpass all other warriors fain would find
 resolved should her a hundred thousand woo
 none shall unfix the purpose of her mind
  but he held worthiest by the world's accord
 alone shall be her lover and her lord

 liv
 "in france in royal charles's famous court
 the damsel hopes to find the cavalier
 who in a thousand feats of high report
 has shown that he excels each puissant peer
 all three are monarchy who the dame escort
 and what their kingdoms ye as well shall hear
 one sweden rules one gothland norway one
 surpast in martial praise by few or none

 lv
 "these three whose kingdoms at some distance lie
 yet the least distant lie from the lost isle
 because few mariners its shore descry
 as little known that island so they style
 wooed and yet woo her for a wife and vie
 in valour and to win the lady's smile
 illustrious deeds have done which fame shall sound
 while heaven shall circle in its wonted round

 lvi
 "yet she not these will wed nor cavalier
 that does not as she deems all else excell
  `lightly i hold your proof of valour here'
 those northern monarchs was she wont to tell
 `and if like sun amid the stars one peer
 outshines his fellows him i honour well
 but therefore hold him not in fierce alarms
 of living men the bravest knight at arms

 lvii
 " `to charlemagne whom i esteem and hold
 as wisest among reigning kings by me
 shall be dispatched a costly shield of gold
 on pact and on condition that it be
 bestowed on him deemed boldest of the bold
 amid the martial ranks of chivalry
 serves the king charlemagne or other lord
 i will be governed by that king's award

 lviii
 " `if when king charles the buckler shall receive
 and give to one so stout that best among
 all others he that warrior shall believe
 do they to his or other court belong
 for me the golden buckler shall retrieve
 one of you three in his own virtue strong
 my every love and thought shall he possess
 him for my spouse and lord will i confess'

 lix
 "moved by these stirring speeches hither hie
 from that widedistant sea those monarchs bold
 resolved to win the buckler or to die
 beneath his hand who has that shield of gold"
 bradamant ponders much the squire's reply
 he give his horse the head  his story told 
 and plies him so with restless heel and hand
 he overtakes the damsel's distant band

 lx
 after him gallops not nor hurries ought
 bradamant who pursues her road at ease
 much evermore evolving in her thought
 things that may chance she finally foresees
 that through the buckler by that damsel brought
 will follow strife and boundless enmities
 amid king charles's peerage and the rest
 if with that shield he shall reward the best

 lxi
 this grieved the damsel's heart but far above
 that grief the former fear her heard did goad
 that young rogero had withdrawn his love
 from her and on the warlike queen bestowed
 so buried in the thoughts wherewith she strove
 was bradamant she heeded nor her road
 nor took she care where at the close of light
 to find befitting shelter for the night

 lxii
 as when from squall or other chance a barge
 drives from the riverside where late it lay
 under no mariner or pilot's charge
 the winds and waves at will transport their prey
 so rabican with bradamant at large
  she musing on rogero  wends his way
 for thence by many miles was distant wide
 that mind which should her courser's bridle guide

 lxiii
 she raised her eyes at last and saw the sun
 had turned his back on bocchus' towers and wall
 then like a cormorant his journey done
 into his nurse's lap beheld him fall
 beyond marocco and for her to run
 to tree for shelter from the rising squall
 had been a foolish thought for now 'gan blow
 a blustering wind which threatened rain or snow

 lxiv
 to better speed fair bradamant aroused
 her courser yet but little way did ride
 when with his flock which on the champaign browsed
 leaving the fields a shepherd she espied
 to him where well or ill she might be housed
  with many instances the maid applied 
 for never house could such ill shelter yield
 but that in rain 'twere worse to lodge afield

 lxv
 to her the shepherd said "i know of none
 whereto i could direct you near at hand
 at least six leagues are distant all but one
 named tristram's tower throughout the neighbouring land
 but not to all men is the door undone
 for it behoves that they with lance in hand
 achieve their footing first and the defend
 who to be lodged within its walls pretend

 lxvi
 "if there be room within to stranger knight
 the castellain gives kindly welcome there
 but is a lodging claimed by other wight
 to joust with all new comers makes him swear
 if none he need not move but arms and fight
 he must what stranger thither shall repair
 and he that worst his warlike arms shall ply
 must wander forth beneath the naked sky

 lxvii
 "if two three four or more seek shelter they
 that first arrive in peace their quarters take
 who follows has a harder game to play
 for war upon those many must he make
 so if one only in that mansion stay
 he with those two or more a lance must break
 then with as many others as succeed
 thus he what strength he has shall sorely need

 lxviii
 "as well if wife or maid seek that repair
 is she alone is she accompanied
 and afterwards another the most fair
 is housed that other must without abide"
 bradamant asked the kindly shepherd where
 that castle stood and he with signs replied
 as well as words and pointed with his hand
 where five or six miles wide the tower did stand

 lxix
 though rabican's good paces merit praise
 to hurry him the damsel had no skill
 by those so passing foul and broken ways
 by season somewhat rainy rendered ill
 so as to reach the tower ere night o'erlays
 the world whose every nook dark shadows fill
 arrived that lady finds the portal barred
 and that she seeks a lodging tells the guard

 lxx
 he answers that the place is occupied
 by dame and knight already housed who met
 about the fire in that chill eveningtide
 wait till their supper be before them set
 to him that maid "the board is not supplied
 i deem for them unless the meal be eat
 now say i wait their coming" she pursues
 who know and will observe your castle's use"

 lxxi
 the guard his message bore where at their ease
 reposed the weary cavaliers his tale
 not overlikely was those kings to please
 for cold and peevish blew the wintry gale
 and now fast fell the rain yet forced to seize
 their arms they slowly don the martial mail
 the rest remain within while they proceed
 against the damsel but with little speed

 lxxii
 three cavaliers they were of might so tried
 few champions but to them in prowess yield
 the same that she that very day beside
 the courier maid encountered in the field
 they that in iceland boasted in their pride
 to bear away from france the golden shield
 who for they had the martial maid outrode
 arrived before her at that lord's abode

 lxxiii
 in feats of arms few warriors were more stout
 but she besure will be among those few
 she that on no account will wait without
 fasting and wet night's weary watches through
 within from window and from lodge the rout
 look forth and will the joust by moonlight view
 which streams from underneath a covering cloud
 albeit the furious rain beats fast and loud

 lxxiv
 such transport as the longing gallant cheers
 about to seize the stolen fruits of love
 when after long delay the listener hears
 the bold within its socket softly move
 such transport cheered her of those cavaliers
 the prowess and the pith afire to prove
 when now the opened portals she descried
 and drawbridge dropt and issuing knights espied

 lxxv
 when she beheld how of the drawbridge clear
 those knights together or scarce sundered came
 she took her ground and next in fierce career
 with flowing bridle drove the furious dame
 levelling against those kings that virtuous spear
 her cousin's gift which never missed its aim
 whose touch each warrior must unseat parforce
 yea mars should mars contend in mortal course

 lxxvi
 the king of sweden foremost of those knights
 in falling too is foremost of the train
 with such surpassing force his helmet smites
 that spear which never yet was couched in vain
 gothland's good king next meets the maid and lights
 with feet in air at distance on the plain
 the third unhorsed by aymon's beauteous daughter
 half buried lies in mire and marshy water

 lxxvii
 when at three strokes she had unhorsed them all
 lighting with head on earth and heels in air
 retiring from the field she sought the hall
 in search of lodging but ere harboured there
 to issue forth at whosoever's call
 is by the warder's hest obliged to swear
 that lord who well had weighed her famous feats
 the damsel with surpassing honour greets

 lxxviii
 so does by her the lady that erewhile
 had thither journeyed with those monarchs three
 as i related sent from the lost isle
 to france's king upon an embassy
 kind as she is and affable of style
 she renders back the stranger's courtesy
 rises to welcome her with smiling air
 and to the fire conducts that warlike fair

 lxxix
 as bradamant unarms and first her shield
 and after puts her polished casque away
 a caul of shining gold wherein concealed
 and clustering close her prisoned tresses lay
 she with the helmet doffs and now revealed
 while the long locks about her shoulders play
 a lovely damsel by that band is seen
 no fiercer in affray than fair of mien

 lxxx
 as when the stage's curtain is uprolled
 mid thousand lamps appears the mimic scene
 adorned with arch and palace pictures gold
 and statues or as limpid and serene
 the sun his visage glorious to behold
 unveils emerging from a cloudy screen
 so when the lady doffs her iron case
 all paradise seems opened in her face

 lxxxi
 already so wellgrown and widely spread
 were the bright tresses which the hermit shore
 these gathered in a knot behind her head
 though shorter than their wont the damsel wore
 and he that castle's master plainly read
 who often had beheld her face before
 that this was bradamant and now he paid
 yet higher honours to the martial maid

 lxxxii
 with modest and with mirthful talk this while
 seated about the fire they feed the ear
 and in this way the weary time beguile
 till they are heartened with more solid cheer
 if new or ancient were his castle's style
 bradamant asks the courteous cavalier
 by whom begun and how it took its rise
 and thus that castellain to her replies

 lxxxiii
 "when pharamond of france possessed the throne
 his son prince clodion had a mistress rare
 and damsel in that ancient age was none
 more graceful beauteous or more debonair
 so loved of pharamond's enamoured son
 that he lost sight no oftener of the fair
 than io's shepherd of his charge whilere
 for jealous as enamoured was the peer

 lxxxiv
 "her in this mansion which his sire bestowed
 he kept and rarely issued from his rest
 with him were lodged ten cavaliers allowed
 through france to be the boldest and the best
 hither while in this castle he abode
 sir tristram and a dame their course addrest
 whom from a furious giant in her need
 short time before that gentle knight had freed

 lxxxv
 "sir tristram and his lady reached the hall
 when now the sun had seville left behind
 they for admission on the porter call
 since they for ten miles round no shelter find
 but clodion that loved much and was withal
 sore jealous was determined in his mind
 no stranger in his keep should ever inn
 so long as that fair lady lodged therein

 lxxxvi
 "when after long entreaties made in vain
 the castellain refused to house the knight
 he said `what supplication cannot gain
 i hope to make thee do in they despite'
 and loudly challenged him with all his train
 those ten which he maintained to bloody fight
 offering with levelled lance and lifted glaive
 to prove sir clodion a discourteous knave

 lxxxvii
 "on pact if he sate fast and overthrown
 should be the warder and his warlike rout
 he in that castle should be lodged alone
 and clodion with his knights remain without
 against him goes the king of france's son
 at risque of death to venge that galling flout
 but falls astound the rest partake his fate
 and on the losers tristram bars the gate

 lxxxviii
 "entering the tower he finds her harboured there
 whereof i spake so dear in clodion's eyes
 whom she had equalled with the loveliest fair
 nature so niggard of such courtesies
 with her sir tristram talks while fell despair
 aye racks the houseless prince in horrid wise
 who prays the conquering knight with suppliant cry
 not to his arms the damsel to deny

 lxxxix
 "though she small worth in tristram's sight possess
 nor any saving yseult please his sight
 nor other dame to love or to caress
 the philtre drunk erewhile allows the knight
 yet for he would that foul discourteousness
 of clodion with a fit revenge requite
 he cries `i deem it were foul wrong and sore
 if so such beauty i should shut the door

 xc
 " `and should sir clodion grieve beneath the tree
 to lodge alone and company demand
 although less beautiful i have with me
 a fair and youthful damsel here at hand
 who i am well content his mate shall be
 and do in all things as he shall command
 but she that is most fair to the most strong
 meseemeth in all justice should belong'

 xci
 "shut out all night the moody clodion strayed
 puffing and pacing round his lofty tower
 as if that prince the sentinel had played
 on them that slept at ease in lordly bower
 him sorer far than wind and cold dismayed
 that lovely lady's loss in tristram's power
 but he with pity touched upon the morrow
 rendered her back and so relieved his sorrow

 xcii
 "because he said and made it plain appear
 such as he found her he returned the fair
 and though for his discourtesy whilere
 clodion had every scorn deserved to bear
 he was content with having made the peer
 outwatch the weary night in open air
 accepting not that cavalier's excuse
 who would have thrown on love his castle's use

 xciii
 "for love should make a churlish nature kind
 and not transform to rude a gentle breast
 when tristram hence was gone not long behind
 remained the enamoured prince who changed his rest
 but first he to a cavalier consigned
 the tower whereof that baron he possest
 on pact that he and his in the domain
 henceforth this usage ever should maintain

 xciv
 "that cavalier of greater heart and power
 should in this hall be harboured without fail
 they that less worthy were should void the tower
 and seek another inn by hill or dale
 in fine that law was fixt which to this hour
 endures as you have seen" while so his tale
 to bradamant recounts that castle's lord
 the sewer with savoury meats has heaped the board

 xcv
 in the great hall that plenteous board was laid
 none fairer was in all the world beside
 then came where those beauteous ladies stayed
 and them with torches lit did thither guide
 on entering bradamant the room surveyed
 and she that other fair on every side
 who as they gaze about the gorgeous hall
 filled full of picture mark each storied wall

 xcvi
 so beauteous are the figures that instead
 of eating on the painted walls they stare
 albeit of meat they have no little need
 who wearied sore with that day's labour are
 with grief the sewer with grief the cook takes heed
 how on the table cools the untasted fare
 nay there is one amid the crowd who cries
 "first fill your bellies and then feast your eyes"

 xcvii
 the guests were placed and now about to eat
 when suddenly bethought that castellain
 to house two damsels were a thing unmeet
 one lady must dislodge and one remain
 the fairest stay and she least fair retreat
 where howls the wind where beats the pattering rain
 because they separate came 'tis ordered so
 one lady must remain one lady go

 xcviii
 the lord some matrons of his household crew
 calls with two elders in such judgments wise
 he marks the dames and bids them of the two
 declare which is most beauteous in their eyes
 and all upon examination due
 cry aymon's daughter best deserves the prize
 and vouch as she in might those kings outweighed
 no less in beauty she surpassed the maid

 xcix
 the warder cries to that islandic dame
 who of her sentence has a shrewd suspicion
 "o lady let it be no cause of blame
 that we observe our usage and condition
 to seek some other rest must be thine aim
 since by our universal band's admission
 though unadorned that martial maid be seen
 thou canst not match her charms and lovely mien"

 c
 as in a moment's time a cloud obscure
 steams from the bottom of some marshy dale
 which the sun's visage late so bright and pure
 mantles all over with its dingy veil
 so that poor damsel sentenced to endure
 without the pelting shower and blustering gale
 is seen to change her cheer and is no more
 the fair and mirthful maid she was before

 ci
 the maid turns pale and all her colour flies
 who dreads so stern a sentence to obey
 but generous bradamant in prudent guise
 who could not bear to see her turned away
 cried to that baron "partial and unwise
 your judgment seems as well all judgments may
 wherein the losing party has not room
 to plead before the judge pronounces doom

 cii
 "i who this cause take on me to defend
 say whether fairer or less fair i be
 i came not as a woman nor intend
 that now mine actions shall be womanly
 but saving i undress who shall pretend
 to say i am or am not such as she
 neither should aught be said but what we know
 and least of all what works another woe

 ciii
 "many as well as i long tresses wear
 yet are not therefore women if as guest
 i have admittance gained to your repair
 like woman or like man is manifest
 then why should i the name of woman bear
 that in my actions stand a man confest
 'tis ruled that woman should a woman chase
 nor that a knight a woman should displace

 civ
 "grant we what i confess not howsoe'er
 that you the woman in my visage read
 but that in beauty i am not her peer
 not therefore deem i of my valour's meed
 ye would deprive me though in beauteous cheer
 the palm i to that damsel should concede
 'twere hard before i yield to her in charms
 that i should forfeit what i won in arms

 cv
 "and if it be your usage that the dame
 who yields in beauty from your tower must wend
 here to remain i my design to proclaim
 should my resolve have good or evil game
 hence i infer unequal were the game
 if she and i in beauty should contend
 for if such strife 'twixt her and me ensues
 nought can the damsel gain and much may lose

 cvi
 "and save the gain and loss well balanced be
 in every match the contest is unfair
 so that by right no less than courtesy
 may she a shelter claim in you repair
 but are there any here that disagree
 and to impugn my equal sentence dare
 behold my prompt at such gainsayer's will
 to prove my judgment right his judgment ill"

 cvii
 bradamant  grieved that maid of gentle kind
 should from that castle wrongfully be sped
 to bide the raging of the rain and wind
 where sheltering house was none nor even shed 
 with reasons good in wary speech combined
 persuades that lord but mostly what she said
 on ending silences the knight and he
 allows the justice of that damsel's plea

 cviii
 as when hot summer sun the soil has rived
 and most the thirsty plant of moisture drains
 the weak and wasting flower well nigh deprived
 of that quick sap which circled in its veins
 sucks in the welcome rain and is revived
 so when bold bradamant so well maintains
 the courier maid's defence her beauteous cheer
 and mirth revive and brighten as whilere

 cix
 at length the supper which had long been dight
 nor yet was touched enjoys each hungry guest
 nor any further news of errant knight
 them seated at the festive board molest
 all saving bradamant enjoy whose sprite
 as wont is still afflicted and opprest
 for that suspicious fear that doubt unjust
 which racked her bosom marred the damsel's gust

 cx
 the supper done  brought sooner to a close
 haply from their desire to feast their eyes 
 first of the set duke aymon's daughter rose
 and next the courier maid is seen to rise
 with that the warder signs to one that goes
 and many torches fires in nimble wise
 whose light on storied wall and ceiling fell
 what followed shall another canto tell

 bradamant sees in picture future fight

 while soaring through the world the english knight

 driving the harpies from the royal board
 hunts to the mouth of hell that impious horde

 iii
 the painters we have seen and others who
 thousands of years ago in honour stood
 things which had been with matchless pencil drew
 some working upon wall and some on wood
 but never amid masters old or new
 have ye of pictures heard or pictures viewed
 of things to come yet such have been pourtrayed
 before the deeds were done which they displayed

 iv
 yet let not artist whether new or old
 boast of his skill such wondrous works to make
 but leave this feat to spell wherewith controlled
 the spirits of the infernal bottom quake
 the hall whereof in other strain i told
 with volume sacred to avernus' lake
 or norsine grot throught subject demons' might
 was made by merlin in a single night

 v
 that art whereby those ancient erst pourtrayed
 such wonders is extinguished in our day
 but to the troop by whom will be surveyed
 the painted chamber i return and say
 a squire attendant on a signal made
 bore thither lighted torches by whose ray
 were scattered from that hall the shades of night
 nor this in open day had shown more bright

 vi
 when thus the castle's lord addressed that crew
 "know of adventures in this chamber wrought
 up to our days have yet been witnessed few
 a warfare storied but its fields unfought
 who limned the battles these as well foreknew
 here of defeats to come and victories taught
 whate'er in italy our host befalls
 you may discern as painted on these walls

 vii
 "the wars wherein french armies should appear
 beyond the alps of foul event or fair
 even from his days until the thousandth year
 by the prophetic merlin painted were
 hither great britain's monarch sent the seer
 to him that of king marcomir was heir
 why hither sent and why this hall was made
 at the same time to you shall be displayed

 viii
 "king pharamond the first of those that passed
 the rhine amid his franks' victorious train
 when gaul was won bethought him how to cast
 on restive italy the curbing rein
 and this that evermore he wasting fast
 beheld the roman empire's feeble reign
 and for both reigned at once would make accord
 to compass his design with britain's lord

 ix
 "the royal arthur by whom nought was done
 without the ripe advice of merlin sage
 merlin i say the devils mighty son
 well versed in what should chance in future age
 knowing through him to pharamond made known
 he would in many woes his host engage
 entering that region which with rugged mound
 apennine parts and alp and sea surround

 x
 "to him sage merlin shows that well nigh all
 those other monarchs that in france will reign
 by murderous steel will see their people fall
 consumed by famine or by fever slain
 and that short joy long sorrow profit small
 and boundless ill shall recompense their pain
 since vainly will the lily seek to shoot
 in the italian fields its withered root

 xi
 "king pharamond so trusted to the seer
 that he resolved to turn his arms elsewhere
 and merlin who beheld with sight as clear
 the things to be as things that whilom were
 'tis said was brought by magic art to rear
 the painted chamber at the monarch's prayer
 wherein whatever deeds the franks shall do
 as if already done are plain to view

 xii
 "that king who should succeed might comprehend
 as he renown and victory would obtain
 whene'er his friendly squadrons should defend
 from all barbarians else the italian reign
 so if to damage her he should descend
 thinking to bind her with the griding chain
  might comprehend i say and read his doom 
 how he beyond these hills should find a tomb"

 xiii
 so said he leads the listening ladies where
 those pictured histories begin to show
 how sigisbert his arms will southward bear
 for what imperial maurice shall bestow
 "behold him from the mount of jove repair
 thither where ambra and ticino flow
 eutar behold who not alone repels
 but puts the foe to flight and routs and quells

 xiv
 "where they with clovis tread the mountain way
 more than a hundred thousand warriors trace
 see benevento's duke the monarch stay
 whose thinner files his hostile army face
 lo these who feign retreat an ambush lay
 lo where through danger havoc and disgrace
 the franks who to the lombard winefat hie
 drugged by the bait like poisoned mullets die

 xv
 "where childibert the boundary hills has crost
 heading what bands of france and captains see
 yet shall no more than baffled clovis boast
 the conquest or the spoil of lombardy
 heaven's sword descends so heavy on his host
 choked with their bodies every road shall be
 so pined with watery flux and withering sun
 that out of ten unharmed returns not one"

 xvi
 he shows king pepin shows king charlemagne
 how into italy their march they bend
 and one and the other fair success obtain
 because her land they came not to offend
 but stephen one the other adriane
 and after injured leo would defend
 this quells astolpho and that takes his heir
 and reestablishes the papal chair

 xvii
 a youthful pepin of the royal line
 he after shows who seemed to spread his host
 even from the kilns to the isle of palestine
 and with a bridge achieved at mighty cost
 at malamocco to bestride the brine
 and on rialto's shore his battle post
 then fly and leave his drowning bands behind
 his bridge destroyed by wasting waves and wind

 xviii
 "burgundian lewis ye behold descend
 thither with his invading squadrons where
 vanquishing and taken nevermore to offend
 with hostile arms he is compelled to swear
 behold he slights his solemn oath  to wend
 anew with reckless steps into the snare
 lo there he leaves his eyes and his array
 blind as the moldwarp hence their lord convey

 xix
 "you see him named from arles victorious hugh
 from italy the berengari chase
 whom quelled and broken twice and thrice anew
 now the bavarians now the huns replace
 o'ermatched he then for peace is fain to sue
 nor long survives nor he who fills his place
 to berengarius yielding his domains
 who repossest of all his kingdom reigns

 xx
 "you see her goodly pastor to sustain
 another charles set fire to italy
 who has two kings in two fierce battles slain
 manfred and conradine and after see
 his bands who seem to vex the newwon reign
 with many wrongs and who dispersedly
  some here some there  in different cities dwell
 slain on the rolling of the vesperbell"

 xxi
 he shows them next but after interval
 'twould seem of many and many an age not years
 how through the alps a captain out of gaul
 to war upon the great viscontis steers
 and seems to straiten alexandria's wall
 girt with his forces foot and cavaliers
 a garrison within an ambuscade
 without the works the warlike duke has laid

 xxii
 and the french host decoyed in cunning wise
 thither where the surrounding toils are spread
 conducted on that evil enterprise
 by armagnac the gallic squadron's head
 slaughtered throughout the spacious champaign lies
 or is to alexandria captive led
 while swoln not more with water than with blood
 tanarus purples wide po's ample flood

 xxiii
 successively that castellain displayed
 one hight of marca of the anjouites three
 how "marsi daunians salentines" he said
 "and bruci these shall oft molest you see
 yet not by frank or latian's friendly aid
 shall one delivered from destruction be
 lo from the realm as oft as they attack
 alphonso and gonsalvo beat them back

 xxiv
 "you see the eighth charles amid his martial train
 the flower of france through alpine pass has pressed
 who liris fords and takes all naples' reign
 yet draws not sword nor lays a lance in rest
 all save that rock which  typheus' endless pain 
 lies on the giant's belly arms and breast
 by inigo del guasto here withstood
 derived from avalo's illustrious blood"

 xxv
 the warder of the castle who makes clear
 to beauteous bradamant that history
 says having shown her ischia's island "ere
 i lead you further other things to see
 i'll tell what my greatgrandfather whilere
  i then a child  was wont to tell to me
 which in like manner that greatgrandsire said
 as well to him his father whilome read

 xxvi
 "and his from sire or grandsire heard recite
 so son from sire even to that baron who
 heard it related by the very wight
 that these fair pictures without pencil drew
 which you see painted azure red and white
 he when to pharamond as now to you
 was shown the castle on the rocky mount
 heard him relate the things i now recount

 xxvii
 "heard him relate how in that fortilage
 from that good knight should spring who 'twould appear
 guards it so well he scorns the fires that rage
 even to the pharo flaming far and near
 then or within short space and in that age
 and named the week and day as well as year
 a noble warrior unexcelled in worth
 by other that has yet appeared on earth

 xxviii
 "nereus less fair achilles was less strong
 less was ulysses famed for daring feat
 nestor that knew so much and lived so long
 less prudent nimble ladas was less fleet
 less liberal and less prompt to pardon wrong
 caesar whose praises ancient tales repeat
 so that compared with him in ischia born
 each might appear of vaunted virtues shorn

 xxix
 "and if illustrious crete rejoiced of old
 in giving birth to coelus' godlike heir
 if thebes in hercules and bacchus bold
 if delos boasted of her heavenly pair
 nought should as well this happy isle withhold
 from lifting high her glorious head in air
 when that great marquis shall in her be born
 whom with its every grace shall heaven adorn

 xxx
 "sage merlin said  and oft renewed that say 
 he was reserved to flourish in an age
 when most opprest the roman empire lay
 that he might free that holy heritage
 but as some deeds of his i must display
 hereafter these i will not now presage
 so spake that wizard and renewed the story
 which told of charlemagne's predestined glory

 xxxi
 "lewis so learned merlin said is woe
 to have brought to italy king charlemagne
 whom he called in to harass not o'erthrow
 that ancient rival of his goodly reign
 at his return declares himself his foe
 and leagued with venice would the king detain
 behold that valiant monarch couch his spear
 and in his foes' despite a passage clear

 xxxii
 "but his new kingdom leaving to his band
 far other destiny awaits that throng
 for with the mantuan's friendly succour manned
 gonsalvo to the war returns so strong
 he leaves not in few months by sea or land
 one living head his slaughtered troops among
 but then because of one by treason spent
 in him appears the joy of triumph shent"

 xxxiii
 so saying to his guests the cavalier
 alphonso of pescara hight displayed
 "who in a thousand feats will shine more clear
 than the resplendent carbuncle" he said
 "behold deceived by faithless treaty here
 mid snares by the malignant aethiop laid
 transfixt with deadly dart the warrior lies
 in whom the age's worthiest champion dies"

 xxxiv
 under italian escort next they see
 where the twelfth lewis o'er the hills is gone
 has by its roots uptorn the mulberry
 and in viscontis' land the lilies sown
 "treading in charles's steps by him shall be
 bridges athwart the garigliano thrown
 yet after shall he mourn his army's slaughter
 dispersed and drowning in that fatal water"

 xxxv
 the lord pursues "with no less overthrow
 broken in puglia see the gallic train
 in him who twice entraps the routed foe
 gonslavo you behold the pride of spain
 fortune to lewis a fair face shall show
 as late a troubled mien upon that plain
 which even to where vext adria pours her tides
 po between alp and apennine divides"

 xxxvi
 the host reproved himself while so he said
 and pieced his tale as having left untold
 things first in order next to them displayed
 a royal castle by its warder sold
 a prisoner by the faithless switzer made
 he shows the lord who hired him with his gold
 which double treason without couching lance
 has given the victory to the king of france

 xxxvii
 that warder then shows caesar borgia grown
 puissant in italy through this king's grace
 for all rome's peerage and all lords that own
 her sway he into exile seems to chase
 then shows the king that will the saw take down
 and papal acorns in bologna place
 then genoa's burghers by this monarch broke
 and rebel city stooping to his yoke

 xxxviii
 "you see" pursued that warder "how with dead
 covered is ghiaradada's green champaign
 it seems each city opes her gates through dread
 and venice scarce her freedom can maintain
 you see he suffers not the church's head
 passing the narrow confines of romagne
 modena from ferrara's duke to reave
 who would not to that prince a remnant leave

 xxxix
 "nay he bologna rescues from his sway
 whither the bentivogli them betake
 you next see lewis siege to brescia lay
 and the closestraitened city storm and take
 felsina almost at the same time stay
 with succour and the papal army break
 and next 'twoud seem that either hostile band
 lies tented upon chassis' level strand

 xl
 "on this side france upon the other spain
 extend their files and battle rages high
 fast fall the men at arms in either train
 and the green earth is tinged with crimson dye
 flooded with human gore seems every drain
 mars doubts to whom to give the victory
 when through alphonso's worth the spaniards yield
 and the victorious franks maintain the field

 xli
 "and for ravenna sacked and ravaged lies
 the roman pastor bites his lips through woe
 called by him from the hills in tempest's guise
 swoop the fierce germans on the fields below
 it seems each frenchman unresisting flies
 chased by their bands beyond the mountain snow
 and that they set the mulberry's thriving shoot
 there whence they plucked the golden lily's root

 xlii
 "behold the frank returns and here behold
 is broken by the faithless swiss betrayed
 he that his royal father seized and sold
 whose succour dearly by the youth is paid
 those over whom false fortune's wheel had rolled
 erewhile beneath another king arraid
 you here behold preparing to efface
 with vengeful deed novara's late disgrace

 xliii
 "and see with better auspices return
 the valiant francis foremost of his train
 who so shall break the haughty switzer's horn
 that little short of spent their bands remain
 and them shall nevermore the style adorn
 usurped by that foul troop of churlish vein
 of scourge of princes and the faith's defence
 to which those rustics rude shall make pretence

 xliv
 "lo he takes milan in the league's despite
 lo with the youthful sforza makes accord
 lo bourbon the fair city keeps in right
 of francis from the furious german horde
 lo while in other high emprize and fight
 elsewhere is occupied his royal lord
 nor knows the pride and license of his host
 through these the city shall anew be lost

 xlv
 "lo other french who his grandsire's vein
 inherits not his generous name alone
 who by the church's favour will regain
  the gaul expelled  a land which was his own
 france too returns but keeps a tighter rein
 nor over italy as wont has flown
 for mantua's noble duke the foe shall stay
 and at ticino's passage bar his way

 xlvi
 "though on his cheek youth's blossoms scarce appear
 worthy immortal glory frederick shines
 and well that praise deserves since by his spear
 but more by care and skill pavia's lines
 against the french defends that cavalier
 and frustrates the sealion's bold designs
 you see two marquises italia's boast
 and both alike the terror of our host

 xlvii
 "both of one blood and of one nest they are
 the foremost is the bold alphonso's seed
 whom led by that false black into the snare
 you late beheld in purple torrent bleed
 you see defeated by his counsel ware
 how oft the franks from italy recede
 the next of visage so benign and bright
 is lord of guasto and alphonso hight

 xlviii
 "this is that goodly knight whose praise you heard
 when rugged ischia's island i displayed
 of whom sage merlin with prophetic word
 to pharamond such mighty matters said
 whose birth should to that season be deferred
 when more than ever such a champion's aid
 against the barbarous enemy's attack
 vext italy and church and empire lack

 xlix
 "he in his cousin of pescara's rear
  prosper colonna chief of that emprize 
 makes the rude switzer pay bicocca dear
 paid by the frenchman in yet dearer wise
 behold where france prepares for fresh career
 and to repair her many losses tries
 behold one host on lombardy descend
 behold that other against naples wend

 l
 "bust she that moves us like the dust which flies
 before the restless wind which whirls it round
 lifts if aloft awhile and from the skies
 blows back anew the rising cloud to ground
 to a hundred thousand swells in francis' eyes
 the soldiers who pavia's walls surround
 the monarch sees but that which he commands
 nor marks how wax or waste his leaguering bands

 li
 " `tis thus that through the greedy servant's sin
 and easy sovereign's goodness on his side
 the files beneath his banners muster thin
 when in his midnight camp `to arms' is cried
 for by the wary spaniards charged within
 his ramparts is he foes that with the guide
 of avalo's fair lineage would assay
 to make to heaven or hell their desperate way

 lii
 "you see the best of the nobility
 of all fair france extinguished on the field
 how many swords how many lances see
 the spaniards round the valiant monarch wield
 behold his horse falls under him yet he
 will neither own himself subdued or yield
 though to assault him from all sides is run
 by wrathful bands and succour there is none

 liii
 "the monarch well defends him from the foe
 all over bathed with blood of hostile vein
 but valour stoops at last to numbers lo
 the king is taken is conveyed to spain
 and all upon pescara's lord bestow
 and him of that inseparable twain 
 of guasto hight  the praise and prime renown
 for that great king captived and host o'erthrown

 liv
 "this host o'erthrown upon pavia's plains
 that bound for naples halts upon its way
 as an illnourished lamp or taper wanes
 for want of wax or oil with flickering ray
 lo the king leaves his sons in spanish chains
 and home returns his own domain to sway
 lo while in italy he leads his band
 another wars upon his native land

 lv
 "in every part you see how rome is woe
 mid ruthless rapine murder fire and rape
 see all to wasting rack and ruin go
 and nothing human or divine escape
 the league's men hear the shrieks behold the glow
 of hostile fires and lo they backward shape
 their course where they should hurry on their way
 and leave the pontiff to his foes a prey

 lvi
 "lautrec the monarch sends with other bands
 yet not anew to war on lombardy
 but to deliver from rapacious hands
 the church's head and limbs already free
 so slowly he performs the king's commands
 next overrun by him the kingdom see
 and his strong arms against the city turned
 wherein the syren's body lies inurned

 lvii
 "lo the imperial squadrons thither steer
 aid to the leaguered city to convey
 and lo burnt sunk destroyed they disappear
 encountered by the doria in midway
 behold how fortune light does shift and veer
 so friendly to the frenchman till this day
 who slays their host with fever not with lance
 nor of a thousand one returns to france

 lviii
 these histories and more the pictures shew
 for to tell all would ask too long a strain
 in beauteous colours and of different hue
 since such that hall it these could well contain
 the painting twice and thrice those guests review
 nor how to leave them knows the lingering train
 'twould seem perusing oft what they behold
 inscribed below the beauteous work in gold

 lix
 when with these pictures they their sight had fed
 and talked long while  these ladies and the rest 
 they to their chambers by that lord were led
 wont much to worship every worthy guest
 already all were sleeping when her bed
 at last duke aymon's beauteous daughter prest
 she here she there her restless body throws
 now right now left but vainly seeks repose

 lx
 yet slumber toward dawn and in a dream
 the form of her rogero seems to view
 the vision cries "why vex yourself and deem
 things real which are hollow and untrue
 backwards shall sooner flow the mountainstream
 than i to other turn my thought from you
 when you i love not then unloved by me
 this heart these apples of mine eyes will be

 lxi
 "hither have i repaired it seemed he said
 to be baptized and do as i professed
 if i have lingered i have been delaid
 by other wound than that of love opprest"
 with that he vanished from the martial maid
 and with the vision broken was her rest
 new floods of tears the awakened damsel shed
 and to herself in this sad fashion said

 lxii
 "what pleased was but a dream alas a sheer
 reality is this my waking bane
 my joy a dream and prompt to disappear
 no dream my cruel and tormenting pain
 ah wherefore what i seemed to see and hear
 cannot i waking see and hear again
 what ails ye wretched eyes that closed ye show
 unreal good and open but on woe

 lxiii
 "sweet sleep with promised peace my soul did buoy
 but i to bitter warfare wake anew
 sweet sleep but brought with it fallacious joy
 but  sure and bitter  waking ills ensue
 if falsehood so delight and truth annoy
 never more may i see or hear what's true
 if sleeping brings me weal and watching woe
 the pains of waking may i never know

 lxiv
 "blest animals that sleep through half the year
 nor ope your heavy eyelids night nor day
 for if such tedious sleep like death appear
 such watching is like life i will not say
 since  such my lot beyond all wont severe 
 i death in watching life in sleep assay
 but oh if death such sleep resemble death
 even now i pray three stop my fleeting breath"

 lxv
 the clouds were gone the horizon overspread
 with glowing crimson by the newborn sun
 and in these signs unlike the past was read
 a better promise of the day begun
 when bradamant upstarted from her bed
 and armed her for the journey to be done
 her thanks first rendered to the courteous lord
 for his kind of cheer and hospitable board

 lxvi
 and found the lady messenger with maid
 and squire had issued from the castled hold
 and was afield where her arrival stayed
 those three good warriors those the damsel bold
 the eve before had on the champaign laid
 cast from their horses by her lance of gold
 and who had suffered to their mighty pain
 all night the freezing wind and pattering rain

 lxvii
 add to such ill that hungering sore for food
 they and their horses through the livelong night
 trampling the mire with chattering teeth had stood
 but what wellnigh engendered more despite
  say not well nigh  more moved the warrior's mood
 was that they knew the damsel would recite
 how they had been unhorsed by hostile lance
 in the first course which they had run in france

 lxviii
 and  each resolved to die or else his name
 forthwith in new encounter to retrieve 
 that ulany the messagebearing dame
 whose style no longer i unmentioned leave
 a fairer notion of their knightly fame
 than heretofore might haply now conceive
 bold bradamant anew to fight defied
 when of the drawbridge clear they her descried

 lxix
 not thinking howsoe'er she was a maid
 who in no look or act the maid confest
 duke aymon's daughter loth to be delaid
 refuses as a traveller that is pressed
 but they so often and so sorely prayed
 that she could ill refuse the kings' request
 her lance she levels at three strokes extends
 all three on earth and thus the warfare ends

 lxx
 for bradamant no more her courser wheeled
 but turned her back upon the foes o'erthrown
 they that intent to gain the golden shield
 had sought a land so distant from their own
 rising in sullen silence from the field
 for speech with all their hardihood was gone
 appeared as stupefied by their surprise
 nor to ulania dared to lift their eyes

 lxxi
 for they as thither they their course addrest
 had vaunted to the maid in boasting vein
 no paladin or knight with lance in rest
 against the worst his saddle could maintain
 to make them vail yet more their haughty crest
 and look upon the world with less disdain
 she tells them by no paladin or peer
 were they unhorsed but by a woman's spear

 lxxii
 "now what of roland's and rinaldo's might
 not without reason held in such renown
 ought you to think she said when thus in fight
 ye by a female hand are overthrown
 say if the buckler one of these requite
  better than by a woman ye have done
 will ye by those redoubted warriors do
 so think not i nor haply think so you

 lxxiii
 "this may suffice you all and need in none
 a clearer proof of prowess to display
 and who desires if rashly any one
 desires again his valour to assay
 would add but scathe to shame now made his own
 now and the same today as yesterday
 unless perchance he thinks it praise and gain
 by such illustrious warriors to be slain"

 lxxiv
 when they by ulany were certified
 a woman's hand had caused their overthrow
 who with a deeper black than pitch had dyed
 their honour heretofore so fair of show
 and more than ten her story testified
 where one sufficed  with such o'erwhelming woe
 were they possest they with such fury burned
 they well nigh on themselves their weapons turned

 lxxv
 what arms they had upon them they unbound
 and cast them strung by rage and fury sore
 into the moat which girt that castle round
 nor even kept the faulchions which they wore
 and since a woman them had cast to ground
 o'erwhelmed with rage and shame the warriors swore
 themselves of such a crying shame to clear
 they without bearing arms would pass a year

 lxxvi
 and that they evermore afoot would fare
 up hill or down by mountain or by plain
 nor when the year was ended would they wear
 the knightly mail or climb the steed again
 save that from other they by force should bear
 in battle other steeds and other chain
 so without arms to punish their misdeeds
 these wend afoot those others on their steeds

 lxxvii
 lodged in a township at the fall of night
 duke aymon's daughter journeying parisward
 hears how king agramant was foiled in fight
 good harbourage withal of bed and board
 she in her hostel found but small delight
 this and all comforts else to her afford
 for the sad damsel meat and sleep foregoes
 nor finds a resting place far less repose

 lxxviii
 but so i will not on her story dwell
 as not to seek anew the valiant twain
 who by consent beside a lonely well
 had tied their goodly coursers by the rein
 i of their war to you somedeal will tell
 a war not waged for empire or domain
 but that the best should buckle to his side
 good durindana and baiardo ride

 lxxix
 no signal they no trumpet they attend
 to blow them to the lists no master who
 should teach them when to foin and when to fend
 or wake their sleeping wrath their swords they drew
 then one against the other boldly wend
 with lifted blades the quick and dextrous two
 already 'gan the champions' fury heat
 and fast and hard their swords were heard to beat

 lxxx
 none e'er by proof two other faulchions chose
 for sound and solid able to endure
 three strokes alone of such conflicting foes
 passing all means and measure but so pure
 so perfect was their temper from all blows
 by such repeated trial so secure
 they in a thousand strokes might clash on high
  nay more nor yet the solid metal fly

 lxxxi
 with mickle industry with mighty pain
 and art rinaldo shifting here and there
 avoids the deadly dint of durindane
 well knowing how 'tis wont to cleave and tear
 gradasso struck with greater might and main
 but well nigh all his strokes were spent in air
 of if he sometimes smote he smote on part
 where durindana wrought less harm than smart

 lxxxii
 rinaldo with more skill his blade inclined
 and stunned the arm of sericana's lord
 him oft he reached where casque and coat confined
 and often raked his haunches with the sword
 but adamantine was his corslet's rind
 nor link the restless faulchion broke or bored
 if so impassive was the paynim's scale
 know charmed by magic was the stubborn mail

 lxxxiii
 without reposing they long time had been
 upon their deadly battle so intent
 that save on one another's troubled mien
 their angry eyes the warriors had not bent
 when such despiteous war and deadly spleen
 diverted by another strife were spent
 hearing a mighty noise both champions turn
 and good baiardo sore bested discern

 lxxxiv
 they good baiardo by a monster view
  a bird and bigger than that courser  prest
 above three yards in length appeared to view
 the monster's beak a bat in all the rest
 equipt with feathers black as ink in hue
 and piercing talons was the winged pest
 an eye of fire it had a cruel look
 and like shipsails two spreading pinions shook

 lxxxv
 perhaps it was a bird but when or where
 another bird resembling this was seen
 i know not i nor have i any where
 except in turpin heard that such has been
 hence that it was a fiend to upper air
 evoked from depths of nether hell i ween
 which malagigi raised by magic sleight
 that so he might disturb the champions' fight

 lxxxvi
 so deemed rinaldo too and contest sore
 'twixt him and malagigi hence begun
 but he would not confess the charge nay swore
 even by the light which lights the glorious sun
 that he might clear him of the blame he bore
 he had not that which was imputed done
 whether a fiend or fowl the pest descends
 and good baiardo with his talons rends

 lxxxvii
 quickly the steed possessed of mickle might
 breaks loose and in his fury and despair
 against the monster strives with kick and bite
 but swiftly he retires and soars in air
 he thence returning prompt to wheel and smite
 circles and beats the courser here and there
 wholly unskilled in fence and sore bested
 baiardo swiftly from the monster fled

 lxxxviii
 baiardo to the neighbouring forest flies
 seeking the closest shade and thickest spray
 above the feathered monster flaps with eyes
 intent to mark where widest is the way
 but that good horse the greenwood threads and lies
 at last within a grot concealed from day
 when the winged beast has lost baiardo's traces
 he soars aloft and other quarry chases

 lxxxix
 rinaldo and gradasso who descried
 baiardo's flight the conqueror's destined meed
 the battle to suspend on either side
 till they regained the goodly horse agreed
 saved from that fowl which chased him far and wide
 conditioning whichever found the steed
 with him anew should to that fountain wend
 beside whose brim their battle they should end

 xc
 quitting the fount they follow where they view
 new prints upon the forest greensward made
 by much baiardo distances the two
 whose tardy feet their wishes ill obeyed
 himself the king on his alfana threw
 that near at hand was tethered in the glade
 leaving his foe behind in evil plight
  never more malcontent and vext in sprite

 xci
 rinaldo ceased in little time to spy
 baiardo's traces who strange course had run
 and made for thorny thicket wet or dry
 tree rock or river with design to shun
 those cruel claws which pouncing from the sky
 to him such outrage and such scathe had done
 rinaldo after labour vain and sore
 to await him at the fount returned once more

 xcii
 in case as erst concerted by the twain
 the king should thither with the steed resort
 but having sought him there with little gain
 fared to his camp afoot with piteous port
 return we now to him of sericane
 he that had sped withal in other sort
 who not by judgement guided to his prey
 but his rare fortune heard baiardo neigh

 xciii
 and found him shrowded in his caverned lair
 so sore moreover by his fright opprest
 he feared to issue into open air
 thus of that horse himself the king possest
 well he remembered their conditions were
 to bring him to the fount but little pressed
 now was that knight to keep the promise made
 and thus within himself in secret said

 xciv
 "win him who will in war and strife i more
 desire in peace to make the steed my own
 from the world's further side did i of yore
 wend hitherward and for this end alone
 having the courser he mistakes me sore
 that thinks the prize by me will be foregone
 him would rinaldo conquer let him fare
 to ind as i to france have made repair

 xcv
 "for him no less secure is sericane
 than twice for me has been his france" he said
 and pricked for arles along the road most plain
 and in its haven found the fleet arrayed
 freighted with him the steed and durindane
 a wellrigged galley from that harbour weighed
 of these hereafter  i at other call
 now quit rinaldo king and france and all

 xcvi
 astolpho in his flight will i pursue
 that made his hippogryph like palfrey flee
 with reins and sell so quick the welkin through
 that hawk and eagle soar a course less free
 o'er the wide land of gaul the warrior flew
 from pyrenees to rhine from sea to sea
 he westward to the mountains turned aside
 which france's fertile land from spain divide

 xcvii
 to arragon he past out of navarre
  they who beheld sore wondering at the sight 
 then leaves he tarragon behind him far
 upon his left biscay upon his right
 traversed castile gallicia lisbon are
 seville and cordova with rapid flight
 nor city on seashore nor inland plain
 is unexplored throughout the realm of spain

 xcviii
 beneath him cadiz and the strait he spied
 where whilom good alcides closed the way
 from the atlantic to the further side
 of egypt bent o'er africa to stray
 the famous balearic isles descried
 and ivica that in his passage lay
 toward arzilla then he turned the rein
 above the sea that severs it from spain

 xcix
 morocco fez and oran looking down
 hippona argier he and bugia told
 which from all cities bear away the crown
 no palm or parsley wreath but crown of gold
 noble biserta next and tunistown
 capys alzerba's isle the warrior bold
 tripoli berniche ptolomitta viewed
 and into asia's land the nile pursued

 c
 'twixt atlas' shaggy ridges and the shore
 he viewed each regions in his spacious round
 he turned his back upon carena hoar
 and skimmed above the cyrenaean ground
 passing the sandy desert of the moor
 in albajada reached the nubian's bound
 left battus' tomb behind him on the plain
 and ammon's now dilapidated fane

 ci
 to other tremizen he posts where bred
 as well the people are in mahound's style
 for other aethiops then his pinions spread
 which face the first and lie beyond the nile
 between coallee and dobada sped
 bound for the nubian city's royal pile
 threading the two where ranged on either land
 moslems and christians watch with arms in hand

 cii
 in aethiopia's realm senapus reigns
 whose sceptre is the cross of cities brave
 of men of gold possest and broad domains
 which the red sea's extremest waters lave
 a faith well nigh like ours that king maintains
 which man from his primaeval doom may save
 here save i err in what their rites require
 the swarthy people are baptized with fire

 ciii
 astolpho lighted in the spacious court
 intending on the nubian king to wait
 less strong than sumptuous is the wealthy fort
 wherein the royal aethiop keeps his state
 the chains that serve the drawbridge to support
 the bolts the bars the hinges of the gate
 and finally whatever we behold
 herewrought in iron there is wrought in gold

 civ
 high prized withal albeit it so abound
 is that best metal lodges built in air
 which on all sides the wealthy pile surround
 clear colonnades with crystal shafts upbear
 of green white crimson blue and yellow ground
 a frieze extends below those galleries fair
 here at due intervals rich gems combine
 and topaz sapphire emerald ruby shine

 cv
 in wall and roof and pavement scattered are
 full many a pearl full many a costly stone
 here thrives the balm the plants were ever rare
 compared with these which were in jewry grown
 the musk which we possess from thence we bear
 in fine those products from this clime are brought
 which in our regions are so prized and sought

 cvi
 the soldan king of the egyptian land
 pays tribute to this sovereign as his head
 they say since having nile at his command
 he may divert the stream to other bed
 hence with its district upon either hand
 forthwith might cairo lack its daily bread
 senapus him his nubian tribes proclaim
 we priest and prester john the sovereign name

 cvii
 of all those aethiop monarchs beyond measure
 the first was this for riches and for might
 but he with all his puissance all his treasure
 alas had miserably lost his sight
 and yet was this the monarch's least displeasure
 vexed by a direr and a worse despite
 harassed though richest of those nubian kings
 by a perpetual hunger's cruel stings

 cviii
 whene'er to eat or drink the wretched man
 prepared by that resistless need pursued
 forthwith  infernal and avenging clan 
 appeared the monstrous harpies' craving brood
 which armed with beak and talons overran
 vessel and board and preyed upon the food
 and what their wombs suffice not to receive
 foul and defiled the loathsome monsters leave

 cix
 and this because upborn by such a tide
 of full blown honours in his unripe age
 for he excelled in heart and nerve beside
 the riches of his royal heritage
 like lucifer the monarch waxed in pride
 and war upon his maker thought to wage
 he with his host against the mountain went
 where egypt's mighty river finds a vent

 cx
 upon this hill which wellnigh kissed the skies
 piercing the clouds the king had heard recite
 was seated the terrestrial paradise
 where our first parents flourished in delight
 with camels elephants and footmen hies
 thither that king confiding in his might
 with huge desire if peopled be the land
 to bring its nations under his command

 cxi
 god marred the rash emprise and from on high
 sent down an angel whose destroying sword
 a hundred thousand of that chivalry
 slew and to endless night condemned their lord
 emerging next from hellish caverns fly
 these horrid harpies and assault his board
 which still pollute or waste the royal meat
 nor leave the monarch aught to drink or eat

 cxii
 and him had plunged in uttermost despair
 one that to him erewhile had prophesied
 the loathsome harpies should his daily fare
 leave unpolluted only when astride
 of winged horse arriving through the air
 an armed cavalier should be descried
 and for impossible appears the thing
 devoid of hope remains the mournful king

 cxiii
 now that with wonderment his followers spy
 the english cavalier so make his way
 o'er every wall o'er every turret high
 some swiftly to the king the news convey
 who calls to mind that ancient prophecy
 and heedless of the staff his wonted stay
 through joy with outstretched arms and tottering feet
 comes forth the flying cavalier to meet

 cxiv
 within the castle court astolpho flew
 and there with spacious wheels on earth descended
 the king conducted by his courtly crew
 before the warrior knelt with arms extended
 and cried "thou angel send of god thou new
 messiah if too sore i have offended
 for mercy yet bethink thee 'tis our bent
 to sin and thine to pardon who repent

 cxv
 "knowing my sin i ask not i to be
  such grace i dare not ask  restored to light
 for well i ween such power resides in thee
 as being accepted in thy maker's sight
 let it suffice that i no longer see
 nor let me with perpetual hunger fight
 at least expel the harpies' loathsome horde
 nor let them more pollute my ravaged board

 cxvi
 "and i to build thee in my royal hold
 a holy temple made of marble swear
 with all its portals and its roof of gold
 and decked within and out with jewels rare
 here shall thy mighty miracle be told
 in sculpture and thy name the dome shall bear"
 so spake the sightless king of nubia's reign
 and sought to kiss the stranger's feet in vain

 cxvii
 "nor angel"  good astolpho made reply 
 "nor new messiah i from heaven descend
 no less a mortal and a sinner i
 to such high grace unworthy to pretend
 to slay the monsters i all means will try
 or drive them from the realm which they offend
 if i shall prosper be thy praises paid
 to god alone who sent me to thine aid

 cxviii
 "offer these vows to god to him well due
 to him thy churches build thine altars rear"
 discoursing so together wend the two
 'mid barons bold that king and cavalier
 the nubian prince commands the menial crew
 forthwith to bring the hospitable cheer
 and hopes that now the foul rapacious band
 will not dare snatch the victual from his hand

 cxix
 forthwith a solemn banquet they prepare
 within the gorgeous palace of the king
 seated alone here guest and sovereign are
 and the attendant troop the viands bring
 behold a whizzing sound is heard in air
 which echoes with the beat of savage wing
 behold the band of harpies thither flies
 lured by the scent of victual from the skies

 cxx
 all bear a female face of pallid dye
 and seven in number are the horrid band
 emaciated with hunger lean and dry
 fouler than death the pinions they expand
 ragged and huge and shapeless to the eye
 the talon crook'd rapacious is the hand
 fetid and large the paunch in many a fold
 like snake's their long and knotted tails are rolled

 cxxi
 the fowls are heard in air then swoops amain
 the covey well nigh in that instant rends
 the food o'erturns the vessels and a rain
 of noisome ordure on the board descends
 to stop their nostrils king and duke are fain
 such an insufferable stench offends
 against the greedy birds as wrath excites
 astolpho with his brandished faulchion smites

 cxxii
 at croup or collar now he aims his blow
 now strikes at neck or pinion but on all
 as if he smote upon a bag of tow
 the strokes without effect and languid fall
 this while nor dish nor goblet they forego
 nor void those ravening fowls the regal hall
 till they have feasted full and left the food
 waste or polluted by their rapine rude

 cxxiii
 that king had firmly hoped the cavalier
 would from his royal seat the harpies scare
 he now that hope foregone with nought to cheer
 laments and sighs and groans in his despair
 of his good horn remembers him the peer
 whose clangours helpful aye in peril are
 and deems his bugle were the fittest mean
 to free the monarch from those birds unclean

 cxxiv
 and first to fill their ears to king and train
 with melted wax astolpho gives command
 that every one who hears the deafening strain
 may not in panic terror fly the land
 he takes the reins his courser backs again
 grasps the enchanted bugle in his hand
 and to the sewer next signs to have the board
 anew with hospitable victual stored

 cxxv
 the meats he to an open galley bears
 and other banquet spreads on other ground
 behold as wont the harpysquad appears
 astolpho quickly lifts the bugle's round
 and for unguarded are their harassed ears
 the harpies are not proof against the sound
 in terror form the royal dome they speed
 nor meat nor aught beside the monsters heed

 cxxvi
 after them spurs in haste the valiant peer
 and on the winged courser forth is flown
 leaving beneath him in his swift career
 the royal castle and the crowded town
 the bugle ever pealing far and near
 the harpies fly toward the torrid zone
 nor light until they reach that loftiest mountain
 where springs if anywhere nile's secret fountain

 cxxvii
 almost at that aerial mountain's feet
 deep under earth extends a gloomy cell
 the surest pass for him as they repeat
 that would at any time descend to hell
 hither the predatory troop retreat
 as a safe refuge from the deafening yell
 as far and farther than cocytus' shore
 descending till that horn is heard no more

 cxxviii
 at that dark hellish inlet which a way
 opens to him who would abandon light
 the terrifying bugle ceased to bray
  the courser furled his wings and stopt his flight
 but ere astolpho further i convey
  not to depart from my accustomed rite 
 since on all sides the paper overflows
 i shall conclude my canto and repose


 canto 34

 argument
 in the infernal pit astolpho hears
 of lydia's woe by smoke wellnigh opprest
 he mounts anew and him his courser bears
 to the terrestrial paradise addrest
 by john advised in all to heaven he steers
 of some of his lost sense here repossest
 orlando's wasted wit as well he takes
 sees the fates spin their threads and earthward makes


 i
 o fierce and hungry harpies that on blind
 and erring italy so full have fed
 whom for the scourge of ancient sins designed
 haply just heaven to every board has sped
 innocent children pious mothers pined
 with hunger die and see their daily bread
  the orphan's and the widow's scanty food 
 feed for a single feast that filthy brood

 ii
 too foul a fault was his who did unclose
 that cave long shut and made the passage free
 from whence that greediness that filth arose
 our italy's infection doomed to be
 then was good life extinguished and repose
 so banished that with strife and poverty
 with fear and trouble is she still perplext
 and shall for many a future year be vext

 iii
 till she her sons has shaken by the hair
 and from lethaean sloth to life restored
 exclaiming "will none imitate that pair
 zethes and calais with avenging sword
 rescue from claws and stench our goodly fare
 and cleanse and glad anew the genial board
 as they king phineus from those fowls released
 and england's peer restored the nubian's feast"

 iv
 hunting those hideous birds that cavalier
 aye scared them with the bugle's horrid sound
 till at the mountaincave his long career
 he closed and ran the monstrous troop to ground
 attentive to the vent he held his ear
 and in that troubled cavern heard rebound
 weeping and wailing and eternal yell
 proof certain that its entrance led to hell

 v
 astolpho doubts if he within shall wend
 and see those wretched ones expelled from day
 into the central pit of earth descend
 and the infernal gulfs around survey
 "why should i fear that on my horn depend
 for certain succour" did the warrior say
 "satan and pluto so will i confound
 and drive before me their threeheaded hound"

 vi
 he speedily his winged horse forsook
 him to a sapling near at hand he ties
 the cavern entered next but first he took
 his horn whereon the knight in all relies
 not far has he advanced before a smoke
 obscure and foul offends his nose and eyes
 ranker than pitch and sulphur is the stench
 yet not thereat does good astolpho blench

 vii
 but as he more descends into that lair
 so much he finds the smoke and vapour worse
 and it appears he can no further fare
 nay backward must retrace his way parforce
 lo something what he knows not he in air
 espies that seems in motion like a corse
 upon whose wasted form long time had beat
 the winter's rain and summers scorching heat

 viii
 in that dim cavern was so little light
  yea wellnigh might be said that light was none 
 nought sees or comprehends the english knight
 what wavers so above that vapour dun
 for surer proof a stroke or two would smite
 with his good faulchion otho's valiant son
 then deemed that duke it was a spirit whom
 he seemed to strike amid the misty gloom

 ix
 when him a melancholy voice addressed
 "ah without harming other downward wend
 me but too sore the sable fumes molest
 which hither form the hellish fires ascend"
 thereat the duke amazed his steps represt
 and to the spirit cried "so may heaven send
 a respite from the vapours that exhale
 as thou shalt deign to tell thy mournful tale

 x
 "and to be known on earth shouldst thou be fain
 thee will i satisfy" to him the sprite
 so sweet it seems to me in fame again
 thus to return into the glorious light
 my huge desire such favour to obtain
 forces my words from me in my despite
 constraining me to tell the things ye seek
 though 'tis annoyance and fatigue to speak

 xi
 "lydia the child of lydia's king am i
 to proud estate and princely honours born
 condemned by righteous doom of god on high
 in murky smoke eternally to mourn
 because a kindly lover's constancy
 i while i lived repaid with spite and scorn
 with countless others swarm these grots below
 for the same sin condemned to the same woe

 xii
 "yet lower down harsh anaxarete
 suffers worse pain where thicker fumes arise
 heaven changed her flesh to stone and here to be
 tormented her afflicted spirit sties
 in that unmoved she hung in air could see
 a lover vest by her barbarities
 here daphne learns how rashly she had done
 in having given apollo such a run"

 xiii
 "of hosts of ingrate women in this cell
 confined it would be tedious to recite
 if one by one i upon these should dwell
 so many their amount is infinite
 'twould be more tedious of the men to tell
 whose base ingratitude due pains requite
 and whom in a more dismal prison pent
 smoke blinds and everlasting fires torment

 xiv
 "since to belief soft woman is more prone
 he that deceives her merits heavier pain
 to theseus and to jason this is known
 and him that vexed of old the latian reign
 and him that of his brother absalon
 erewhile provoked the pestilent disdain
 because of thamar countless is the horde
 of those who left a wife or wedded lord

 xv
 "but rather of my state than theirs to shew
 and sin which brought me hither  i was fair
 but so much haughtier was than fair of hue
 i know not if i ever equalled were
 nor which was most excessive of the two
 my pride of beauty could to thee declare
 though it is certain pride but took its rise
 in that rare loveliness which pleased all eyes

 xvi
 "there lived a thracian knight for warlike skill
 and prowess upon earth without a peer
 who voiced by many a worthy witness still
 the praises of my matchless charms did hear
 so that of forethought and his own free will
 fixed all his love on me that cavalier
 weening this wife that i upon my part
 should for his valour duly prize his heart

 xvii
 "he came to lydia and by faster tie
 was fettered at my sight and there enrolled
 amid my royal father's chivalry
 in mickle fame increased that baron bold
 his feats of many a sort and valour high
 would make a tale too tedious to be told
 with what his boundless merit had deserved
 if a more grateful master he had served

 xviii
 "pamphylia caria and cilicia's reign
 through him my father brought beneath his sway
 who never moved afield his martial train
 but when that warrior pointed out the way
 he when he deemed he had deserved such gain
 pressed close the lydian king upon a day
 and craved me from the monarch as his wife
 as meed of all that booty made in strife

 xix
 "rejected of the monarch was the peer
 who was resolved his child should highly wed
 not him who was a simple cavalier
 who saving valour was with nought bested
 for on my father bent on gain and gear
 and avarice of all vice the fountainhead
 manners and merit for as little pass
 as the lute's music on the lumpish ass

 xx
 "alcestes he of whom i speak so hight
 that warrior when he sees his suit denied
 repulsed by one by whom he had most right
 to think that he should most be gratified
 craves his discharge and threatens he this slight
 will make the lydian monarch dear abide
 the armenian an old rival of my sire
 and mortal for he sought with this desire

 xxi
 "and so the monarch urged he made him rear
 his banner and attack my sire and through
 his famous feats that thracian cavalier
 was named the captain of the invading crew
 for the armenian sovereign far and near
 all things so said the knight he would subdue
 but claiming as his share when all was won
 my sovereign beauties for the service done

 xxii
 "i ill to you the mischief could express
 alcestes did us in that war o'erthrown
 by him four armies were and he in less
 than one short twelvemonth left us neither town
 not tower save one where cliffs forbade access
 'twas here my sire amid those of his own
 whom most he loved took refuge in his need
 with all the wealth he could collect with speed

 xxiii
 "us in this fortilage the knight attacked
 and shortly to such desperation drave
 that gladly would the king have made a pact
 to yield me for his consort yea his slave
 with half our realm if certain by that act
 himself from every other loss to save
 right sure he otherwise should forfeit all
 and after die in bonds a captive thrall

 xxiv
 "before this happened to try every way
 of remedy the lydian king was bent
 and thither where alcestes' army lay
 me the first cause of all the mischief sent
 to yield my person to him as a prey
 i with intention to alcestes went
 to bid him take what portion of our reign
 he pleased and pacify his fierce disdain

 xxv
 "when of my coming that good knight does know
 me he encounters pale and trembling sore
 'twould seem a vanquished man's a prisoner's brow
 he rather than a victor's semblance bore
 i who perceive he loves address not now
 the warrior as i was resolved before
 my vantage i descry and shift my ground
 to fit the state wherein that knight was found

 xxvi
 "to curse the warrior's passion i begun
 and of his crying cruelty complained
 since foully by my father had he done
 and me would have by violence constrained
 who with more grace my person would have won
 nor waited many days had he maintained
 his course of courtship as begun whilere
 to king and all of us so passing dear

 xxvii
 "and if the honest suit he hoped to gain
 had been at first rejected by my sire
 'twas he was somedeal of a churlish vein
 nor ever yielded to a first desire
 he should not therefore restive to the rein
 have left his goodly task so prompt to ire
 sure passing aye from good to better deed
 in little time to win the wishedfor meed

 xxviii
 "and if my father would not have been won
 to him i would so earnestly have prayed
 that he my lover should have made his son
 nay had my royal sire my suit gainsayed
 for him in secret that i would have done
 wherewith he should have deemed himself appaid
 but since it seemed he other means designed
 never to love him had i fixed my mind

 xxix
 "and though i sought him at my father's hest
 and pious love for him had been my guide
 he might be sure not long should be possest
 the bliss that i in my despite supplied
 for the red blood should issue from my breast
 as soon as his ill will was satisfied
 on this my wretched person which alone
 he so by brutal force should make his own

 xxx
 "with these and words like these i moved the peer
 when i such puissance in myself espied
 and him so contrite made in desert drear
 was never seen a saint more mortified
 before my feet the doleful cavalier
 fell down and snatched a poniard from his side
 which he protested i parforce should take
 and for so foul a sin my vengeance slake

 xxxi
 "to push my mighty victory to an end
 i scheme when him i see in such distress
 and give him hopes he may even yet pretend
 that i deservedly his love should bless
 if he his ancient error will amend
 will of his realm my father repossess
 and will in future time deserve my charms
 by love and service not by force of arms

 xxxii
 "so promised he to do and set me free
 and let me as i came untouched depart
 nor even to kiss my lips he ventured see
 if he is yoked securely if his heart
 love has well touched with the desire of me
 if he for him need feather other dart
 he seeks the armenian why by pact should take
 whatever spoil the conquering armies make

 xxxiii
 "and him as best he might would fain persuade
 to leave to lydia's monarch his domain
 upon whose wasted lands his host had preyed
 and rest content with his armenian reign
  he would not hear of this the monarch said
 with cheers with fury swolen nor would refrain
 from pressing lydia's king with armed band
 so long as he possessed a palm of land

 xxxiv
 "and if the knight when a vile woman sues
 his purpose shift let him the evil bear
 he will not for the warrior's asking lose
 what he has hardly conquered in a year
 alcestes to the king his suit renews
 and next complains that he rejects his prayer
 at length the thracian fires and threatens high
 by love or force the monarch shall comply

 xxxv
 "so kindling anger waxed between the two
 it urged them from ill words to worser deed
 upon the king his sword alcestes drew
 though thousands aid the monarch in his need
 and in despite of all their sovereign slew
 and made that day as well the armenian bleed
 backed by the thracians' and cilicians' aid
 and other followers by the warrior paid

 xxxvi
 "his conquest he pursued and at his cost
 without expense to us in less than one
 short month the kingdom by my father lost
 restored and to repair the mischief done
 beside spoil given he conquered with his host
  taxing or taking what his arms had won 
 armenia and cappadocia which confine
 and scowered hyrcania to the distant brine

 xxxvii
 "him not to greet with triumphs but to slay
 returning from that warfare we intend
 but fearing failure our design delay
 in that we find too many him befriend
 feeding him aye with hope from day to day
 i for the thracian warrior love pretend
 but first declare my will that he oppose
 and prove his valour on our other foes

 xxxviii
 "and him now sole now ill accompanied
 on strange and perilous emprize i speed
 wherein a thousand knights might well have died
 but all things happily with him succeed
 for victory was ever on his side
 and oft with horrid foes of monstrous breed
 with giants and with lestrigons who brought
 damage in our domains the warrior fought

 xxxix
 nor juno nor eurystheus in such chase
 ever renowned alcides vext so sore
 in erymanth nemaea lerna thrace
 aetolia africa by tyber's shore
 by ebro's sunny bank or other place
 as hiding murderous hate while i implore
 i exercise my lover still in strife
 with the same fell design upon his life

 xl
 "unable to achieve my first intent
 i on a scheme of no less mischief fall
 through me all deemed his friends by him are shent
 who thus bring down on him the hate of all
 the thracian leader never more content
 than to obey whatever be the call
 is at my bidding ever prompt to smite
 without regarding who or what the wight

 xli
 "when i perceive that through the warrior's mean
 extinguished is my father's every foe
 and conquered by himself that knight is seen
  friendless through us  i now the masque forego
 what i from him beneath a flattering mien
 had hitherto concealed i plainly show
  what deep and deadly hate by bosom fired
 and that i but to work his death desired

 xlii
 "then thinking if such course i should pursue
 that public shame would still the deed attend
 for men too well my obligations knew
 and would be prompt my cruelty to shend
 meseemed enough to drive him from my view
 so that he should no more my eyes offend
 nor would i more address or see the peer
 nor letter would receive or message hear

 xliii
 "this my ingratitude in him such pain
 at length produced that mastered by his woe
 after entreating mercy long in vain
 he sickened sore and sank beneath the blow
 for pain which fits my sin dark fumes now stain
 my cheek and with salt rheum mine eyes o'erflow
 thus in eternal torment shall i dwell
 for saving mercy helpeth not in hell"

 xliv
 since wretched lydia spake no more the peer
 would fain discern if more in torment lay
 but those false ingrates' curse the darkness drear
 so waxed before him and obscured the way
 that not one inch advanced the cavalier
 nay back parforce returns that warrior nay
 himself from that increasing smoke to save
 makes for the mouth of the disastrous cave

 xlv
 the motion of his quickly shifting feet
 more savours of a run than walk or trot
 thus mounting the ascent in swift retreat
 astolpho sees the outlet of the grot
 where through the darkness of that dismal seat
 and those foul fumes a dawn of daylight shot
 he from the cavern sorely pained and pined
 issues at last and leaves the smoke behind

 xlvi
 and next to bar the way against that band
 whose greedy bellies so for victual crave
 picks stones and trees lays level with his brand
 which charged with pepper or amomum wave
 and what might seem a hedge with busy hand
 as best he can constructs before the cave
 and so succeeds in blocking that repair
 the harpies shall no more revisit air

 xlvii
 while in that cave astolpho did remain
 the fumes that from the sable pitch arose
 not only what appeared to sight did stain
 but even so searched the flesh beneath his clothes
 he sought some cleansing stream long sought in vain
 but found at length a limpid till which rose
 out of a living rock within that wood
 and bathed himself all over in the flood

 xlviii
 then backed the griffinhorse and soared a flight
 whereby to reach that mountain's top he schemes
 which little distant with its haughty height
 from the moon's circle good astolpho deems
 and such desire to see it warms the knight
 that he aspires to heaven nor earth esteems
 through air so more and more the warrior strains
 that he at last the mountainsummit gains

 xlix
 here sapphire ruby gold and topaz glow
 pearl jacinth chrysolite and diamond lie
 which well might pass for natural flowers which blow
 catching their colour from that kindly sky
 so green the grass could we have such below
 we should prefer it to our emerald's dye
 as fair the foliage of those pleasant bowers
 whose trees are ever filled with fruit and flowers

 l
 warble the wanton birds in verdant brake
 azure and red and yellow green and white
 the quavering rivulet and quiet lake
 in limpid hue surpass the crystal bright
 a breeze which with one breath appears to shake
 aye without fill or fall the foliage light
 to the quick air such lively motion lends
 that day's oppressive noon in nought offends

 li
 and this mid fruit and flower and verdure there
 evermore stealing divers odours went
 and made of those mixt sweets a medley rare
 which filled the spirit with a calm content
 in the mid plain arose a palace fair
 which seemed as if with living flames it brent
 such passing splendour and such glorious light
 shot from those walls beyond all usage bright

 lii
 thither where those transparent walls appear
 which cover more than thirty miles in measure
 at ease and slowly moved the cavalier
 and viewed the lovely region at his leisure
 and deemed  compared with this  that sad and drear
 and seen by heaven and nature with displeasure
 was the foul world wherein we dwell below
 so jocund this so sweet and fair in show

 liii
 astound with wonder paused the adventurous knight
 when to that shining palace he was nigh
 for than the carbuncle more crimson bright
 it seemed one polished stone of sanguine dye
 o mighty wonder o daedalian sleight
 what fabric upon earth with this can vie
 let them henceforth be silent that in story
 exalt the world's seven wonders to such glory

 liv
 an elder in the shining entrancehall
 of that glad house towards astolpho prest
 crimson his waistcoat was and white his pall
 vermillion seemed the mantle milk the vest
 white was that ancient's hair and white withal
 the bushy beard descending to his breast
 and from his reverend face such glory beamed
 of the elect of paradise he seemed

 lv
 he with glad visage to the paladin
 who humbly from his sell had lighted cries
 "o gentle baron that by will divine
 have soared to this terrestrial paradise
 albeit nor you the cause of your design
 nor you the scope of your desire surmise
 believe you not without high mystery steer
 hitherward from your arctic hemisphere

 lvi
 "you for instruction how to furnish aid
 to charles and to the church in utmost need
 with me to counsel hither are conveyed
 who without counsel from such distance speed
 but son ascribe not you the journey made
 to wit or worth nor through your winged steed
 nor through your virtuous bugle had ye thriven
 but that such helping grace from god was given

 lvii
 "we will discourse at better leisure more
 and you what must be done shall after hear
 but you that through long fast must hunger sore
 first brace your strength with us with genial cheer"
 continuing his discourse that elder hoar
 raised mighty wonder in the cavalier
 when he avouched as he his name disclosed
 that he the holy gospel had composed

 lviii
 he of our lord so loved the blessed john
 of whom a speech among the brethren went
 he never should see death and hence the son
 of god with this rebuke st peter shent
 in saying "what is it to thee if one
 tarry on earth till i anew be sent"
 albeit he said not that he should not die
 that so he meant to say we plain descry

 lix
 translated thither he found company
 the patriarch enoch and the mighty seer
 elias nor as yet those sainted three
 have seen corruption but in garden clear
 of earth's foul air will joy eternity
 of spring till they angelic trumpets hear
 sounding through heaven and earth proclaim aloud
 christ's second advent on the silvery cloud

 lx
 the holy ancients to a chamber lead
 with welcome kind the adventurous cavalier
 and in another then his flying steed
 sufficiently with goodly forage cheer
 astolpho they with fruits of eden feed
 so rich that in his judgment 'twould appear
 in some sort might our parents be excused
 if for such fruits obedience they refused

 lxi
 when with that daily payment which man owes
 nature had been contented by the peer
 as well of due refreshment as repose
 for all and every comfort found he here
 and now aurora left her ancient spouse
 not for his many years to her less dear
 rising from bed astolpho at his side
 the apostle so beloved of god espied

 lxii
 much that not lawfully could here be shown
 taking him by the hand to him he read
 "to you though come from france may be unknown
 what there hath happened" next the apostle said
 "learn your orlando for he hath foregone
 the way wherein he was enjoined to tread
 is visited of god that ever shends
 him whom he loveth best when he offends

 lxiii
 "he your orlando at his birth endowed
 with sovereign daring and with sovereign might
 on whom beyond all usage god bestowed
 the grace that weapon him should vainly smite
 because he was selected from the crowd
 to be defender of his church's right
 as he elected sampson called whilere
 the jew against the philistine to cheer

 lxiv
 "he your orlando for such gifts has made
 unto his heavenly lord an ill return
 who left his people when most needing aid
 then most abandoned to the heathens' scorn
 incestuous love for a fair paynim maid
 had blinded so that knight of grace forlorn
 that twice and more in fell and impious strife
 the count has sought his faithful cousin's life

 lxv
 "hence god hath made him mad and in this vein
 belly and breast and naked flesh expose
 and so diseased and troubled is his brain
 that none and least himself the champion knows
 nebuchadnezzar whilom to such pain
 god in his vengeance doomed as story shows
 sent for seven years of savage fury full
 to feed on grass and hay like slavering bull

 lxvi
 "but yet because the christian paladine
 has sinned against his heavenly maker less
 he only for three months by will divine
 is doomed to cleanse himself of his excess
 nor yet with other scope did your design
 of wending hither the redeemer bless
 but that through us the mode you should explore
 orlando's missing senses to restore

 lxvii
 " `tis true to journey further ye will need
 and wholly must you leave this nether sphere
 to the moon's circle you i have to lead
 of all the planets to our world most near
 because the medicine that is fit to speed
 insane orlando's cure is treasured here
 this night will we away when over head
 her downward rays the silver moon shall shed"

 lxviii
 in talk the blest apostle is diffuse
 on this and that until the day is worn
 but when the sun is sunk i' the salt sea ooze
 and overhead the moon uplifts her horn
 a chariot is prepared erewhile in use
 to scower the heavens wherein of old was borne
 from jewry's misty mountains to the sky
 sainted elias rapt from mortal eye

 lxix
 four goodly coursers next and redder far
 than flame to that fair chariot yokes the sire
 who when the knight and he well seated are
 collects the reins and heavenward they aspire
 in airy circles swiftly rose the car
 and reached the region of eternal fire
 whose heat the saint by miracle suspends
 while through the parted air the pair ascends

 lxx
 the chariot towering threads the fiery sphere
 and rises thence into the lunar reign
 this in its larger part they find as clear
 as polished steel when undefiled by stain
 and such it seems or little less when near
 as what the limits of our earth contain
 such as our earth the last of globes below
 including seas which round about it flow

 lxxi
 here doubly waxed the paladin's surprize
 to see that place so large when viewed at hand
 resembling that a little hoop in size
 when from the globe surveyed whereon we stand
 and that he both his eyes behoved to strain
 if he would view earth's circling seas and land
 in that by reason of the lack of light
 their images attained to little height

 lxxii
 here other river lake and rich champaign
 are seen than those which are below descried
 here other valley other hill and plain
 with towns and cities of their own supplied
 which mansions of such mighty size contain
 such never he before of after spied
 here spacious hold and lonely forest lay
 where nymphs for ever chased the panting prey

 lxxiii
 he that with other scope had thither soared
 pauses not all these wonder to peruse
 but led by the disciple of our lord
 his way towards a spacious vale pursues
 a place wherein is wonderfully stored
 whatever on our earth below we lose
 collected there are all things whatsoe'er
 lost through time chance or our own folly here

 lxxiv
 nor here alone of realm and wealthy dower
 o'er which aye turns the restless wheel i say
 i speak of what it is not in the power
 of fortune to bestow or take away
 much fame is here whereon time and the hour
 like wasting moth in this our planet prey
 here countless vows here prayers unnumbered lie
 made by us sinful men to god on high

 lxxv
 the lover's tears and sighs what time in pleasure
 and play we here unprofitably spend
 to this of ignorant men the eternal leisure
 and vain designs aye frustrate of their end
 empty desires so far exceed all measure
 they o'er that valley's better part extend
 there wilt thou find if thou wilt thither post
 whatever thou on earth beneath hast lost

 lxxvi
 he passing by those heaps on either hand
 of this and now of that the meaning sought
 formed of swollen bladders here a hill did stand
 whence he heard cries and tumults as he thought
 these were old crowns of the assyrian land
 and lydian  as that paladin was taught 
 grecian and persian all of ancient fame
 and now alas wellnigh without a name

 lxxvii
 golden and silver hooks to sight succeed
 heaped in a mass the gifts which courtiers bear
  hoping thereby to purchase future meed 
 to greedy prince and patron many a snare
 concealed in garlands did the warrior heed
 who heard these signs of adulation were
 and in cicalas which their lungs had burst
 saw fulsome lays by venal poets versed

 lxxviii
 loves of unhappy end in imagery
 of gold or jewelled bands he saw exprest
 then eagles' talons the authority
 with which great lords their delegates invest
 bellows filled every nook the fume and fee
 wherein the favourites of kings are blest
 given to those ganymedes that have their hour
 and reft when faded is their vernal flower

 lxxix
 o'erturned here ruined town and castle lies
 with all their wealth "the symbols" said his guide
 "of treaties and of those conspiracies
 which their conductors seemed so ill to hide"
 serpents with female faces felonies
 of coiners and of robbers he descried
 next broken bottles saw of many sorts
 the types of servitude in sorry courts

 lxxx
 he marks mighty pool of porridge spilled
 and asks what in that symbol should be read
 and hears 'twas charity by sick men willed
 for distribution after they were dead
 he passed a heap of flowers that erst distilled
 sweet savours and now noisome odours shed
 the gift if it may lawfully be said
 which constantine to good sylvester made

 lxxxi
 a large provision next of twigs and lime
  your witcheries o women  he explored
 the things he witnessed to recount in rhyme
 too tedious were were myriads on record
 to sum the remnant ill should i have time
 'tis here that all infirmities are stored
 save only madness seen not here at all
 which dwells below nor leaves this earthly ball

 lxxxii
 he turns him back upon some days and deeds
 to look again which he had lost of yore
 but save the interpreter the lesson reads
 would know them not such different form they wore
 he next saw that which man so little needs
  as it appears  none pray to heaven for more
 i speak of sense whereof a lofty mount
 alone surpast all else which i recount

 lxxxiii
 it was as 'twere a liquor soft and thin
 which save well corked would from the vase have drained
 laid up and treasured various flasks within
 larger or lesser to that use ordained
 that largest was which of the paladin
 anglantes' lord the mighty sense contained
 and from those others was discerned since writ
 upon the vessel was orlando's wit

 lxxxiv
 the names of those whose wits therein were pent
 he thus on all those other flasks espied
 much of his own but with more wonderment
 the sense of many others he descried
 who he believed no dram of theirs had spent
 but here by tokens clear was satisfied
 that scantily therewith were they purveyed
 so large the quantity he here surveyed

 lxxxv
 some waste on love some seeking honour lose
 their wits some scowering seas for merchandise
 some that on wealthy lords their hope repose
 and some befooled by silly sorceries
 these upon pictures upon jewels those
 these on whatever else they highest prize
 astrologers' and sophists' wits mid these
 and many a poet's too astolpho sees

 lxxxvi
 since his consent the apostle signified
 who wrote the obscure apocalypse his own
 he took and only to his nose applied
 when it appeared it to its place was gone
 and henceforth has sir turpin certified
 that long time sagely lived king otho's son
 till other error as he says again
 deprived the gentle baron of his brain

 lxxxvii
 the fullest vessel and of amplest round
 which held the wit orlando erst possessed
 astolpho took nor this so light he found
 as it appeared when piled among the rest
 before from those bright spheres now earthward bound
 his course is to our lower orb addressed
 him to a spacious palace by whose side
 a river ran conducts his holy guide

 lxxxviii
 filled full of fleeces all its chambers were
 of wool silk linen cotton in their hue
 of diverse dyes and colours foul and fair
 yarns to her reel from all those fleeces drew
 in the outer porch a dame of hoary hair
 on summerday thus village wife we view
 when the new silk is reeled its filmy twine
 wind from the worm and soak the slender line

 lxxxix
 a second dame replaced the work when done
 with other and one bore it off elsewhere
 a third selected from the fleeces spun
 and mingled by that second foul from fair
 "what is this labour" said the peer to john
 and the disciple answered otho's heir
 "know that the parcae are those ancient wives
 that in this fashion spin your feeble lives

 xc
 "as long as one fleece lasts life in such wise
 endureth nor outlasts it by a thought
 for death and nature have their watchful eyes
 on the hour when each should to his end be brought
 the choicest threads are culled for paradise
 and after for its ornaments are wrought
 and fashioned from the strands of foulest show
 are galling fetters for the damned below"

 xci
 on all the fleeces that erewhile were laid
 upon the reel and culled for other care
 the names were graved on little plates which made
 of silver or of gold or iron were
 these piled in many heaps he next surveyed
 whence an old man some skins was seen to bear
 who seemingly unwearied hurried sore
 his restless way retracing evermore

 xcii
 that elder is so nimble and so prest
 that he seems born to run he bears away
 out of those heaps by lapfulls in his vest
 the tickets that the different names display
 wherefore and whither he his steps addrest
 to you i shall in other canto say
 if you in sign of pleasure will attend
 with that kind audience ye are wont to lend


 canto 35

 argument
 the apostle praises authors to the peer
 duke aymon's martial daughter in affray
 conquers the giant monarch of argier
 and of the good frontino makes a prey
 she next from arles defies her cavalier
 and while he marvels who would him assay
 grandonio and ferrau she with her hand
 and serpentine unhorses on the strand


 i
 madonna who will scale the high ascent
 of heaven to me my judgment to restore
 which since from your bright eyes the weapon went
 that pierced my heart is wasting evermore
 yet will not i such mighty loss lament
 so that it drain no faster than before
 but  ebbing further  i should fear to be
 such as orlando is described by me

 ii
 to have anew that judgment through the skies
 i deem there is no need for me to fly
 to the moon's circle or to paradise
 for i believe mine is not lodged so high
 on your bright visage on your beauteous eyes
 alabastrine neck and paps of ivory
 wander my wits and i with busy lip
 if i may have them back these fain would sip

 iii
 astolpho wandered through that palace wide
 observing al the future lives around
 when those already woven he had spied
 upon the fatal wheel for finish wound
 he a fair fleece discerned that far outvied
 fine gold whose wondrous lustre jewels ground
 could these into a thread be drawn by art
 would never equal by the thousandth part

 iv
 the beauteous fleece he saw with wondrous glee
 equalled by none amid that countless store
 and when and whose such glorious life should be
 longed sore to know "this" said the apostle hoar
 concealing nothing of its history
 "shall have existence twenty years before
 dating from the incarnate word the year
 shall marked my men with m and d appear

 v
 "and as for splendor and for substance fair
 this fleece shall have no like or equal so
 shall the blest age wherein it shall appear
 be singular in this our world below
 because all graces excellent and rare
 which nature or which study can bestow
 or bounteous fortune upon men can shower
 shall be its certain and eternal dower

 vi
 "between the king of rivers' horns" he cries
 "stands what is now a small and humble town
 before it runs the po behind it lies
 a misty pool of marsh this  looking down
 the stream of future years  i recognize
 first of italian cities of renown
 not only famed for wall and palace rare
 but noble ways of life and studies fair

 vii
 "such exaltation reached so suddenly
 is not fortuitous nor wrought in vain
 but that is may his worthy cradle be
 whereof i speak shall so the heaven ordain
 for where men look for fruit they graff the tree
 and study still the rising plant to train
 and artist uses to refine the gold
 designed by him the precious gem to hold

 viii
 "nor ever in terrestrial realm so fine
 and fair a raiment spirit did invest
 and rarely soul so great from realms divine
 has been or will be thitherward addrest
 as that whereof the eternal had design
 to fashion good hippolytus of este
 hippolytus of este shall he be hight
 on whom so rich a gift of god shall light

 ix
 "all those fair graces that on many spent
 would have served many wholly to array
 are all united for his ornament
 of whom thou hast entreated me to say
 to prop the arts the virtues is he sent
 and should i seek his merits to display
 so long a time would last my tedious strain
 orlando might expect his wits in vain"

 x
 'twas so christ's servant with the cavalier
 discoursed they having satisfied their view
 with sight of that fair mansion far and near
 that whence conveyed were human lives the two
 issued upon the stream whose waves appear
 turbid with sand and of discoloured hue
 and found that ancient man upon the shore
 who names engraved on metal thither bore

 xi
 i know not if you recollect of him
 i speak whose story i erewhile suspended
 ancient of visage and so swift of limb
 that faster far than forest stag he wended
 with names he filled his mantle to the brim
 aye thinned the pile but ne'er his labour ended
 and in that stream hight lethe next bestowed
 yea rather cast away his costly load

 xii
 i say that when upon the river side
 arrives that ancient of his store profuse
 he all those names into the turbid tide
 discharges as he shakes his mantle loose
 a countless shoal they in the stream subside
 nor henceforth are they fit for any use
 and out of mighty myriads hardly one
 is saved of those which waves and sand o'errun

 xiii
 along that river and around it fly
 vile crows and ravening vultures and a crew
 of choughs and more that with discordant cry
 and deafening din their airy flight pursue
 and to the prey all hurry when from high
 those ample riches they so scattered view
 and with their beak or talon seize the prey
 yet little distance they their prize convey

 xiv
 when they would raise themselves in upward flight
 they have not strength the burden to sustain
 so that parforce in lethe's water light
 the worthy names which lasting praise should gain
 two swans there are amid those birds as white
 my lord as is your banner's snowy grain
 who catch what names they can and evermore
 with these return securely to the shore

 xv
 thus counter to that ancient's will malign
 who them to the devouring river dooms
 some names are rescued by the birds benign
 wasteful oblivion all the rest consumes
 now swim about the stream those swans divine
 now beat the buxom air with nimble plumes
 till near that impious river's bank they gain
 a hill and on that hill a hallowed fane

 xvi
 to immortality 'tis sacred there
 a lovely nymph that from the hill descends
 to the lethean river makes repair
 takes from those swans their burden and suspends
 the names about an image raised in air
 upon a shaft which in mid fane ascends
 there consecrates and fixes them so fast
 that all throughout eternity shall last

 xvii
 of that old sire and why he would dispense
 idly all those fair names as 'twould appear
 and of the birds and holy place from whence
 the nymph was to the river seen to steer
 the solemn mystery and the secret sense
 astolpho marvelling desired to hear
 and prayed the man of god would these unfold
 who to the warrior thus their meaning told

 xviii
 "there moves no leaf beneath thou hast to know
 but here above some sign thereof we trace
 since all in heaven above or earth below
 must correspond though with a different face
 that ancient with his sweeping beard of snow
 by nought impeded and so swift of pace
 works the same end and purpose in our clime
 as are on earth below performed by time

 xix
 "the life of man its final close attains
 when on the wheel is wound the fatal twine
 there fame and here above the mark remains
 for both would be immortal and divine
 but for that bearded sire's unwearied pains
 and his below that for their wreck combine
 one drowns them as thou seest mid sand and surges
 and one in long forgetfulness immerges

 xx
 "and even as here above the raven daw
 vulture and divers other birds of air
 all from the turbid water seek to draw
 the names which in their sight appear most fair
 even thus below pimps flatterers men of straw
 buffoons informers minions all who there
 flourish in courts and in far better guise
 and better odour than the good and wise

 xxi
 "and by the crowd are gentle courtiers hight
 because they imitate the ass and swine
 when the just parcae or to speak aright
 venus and bacchus cut their master's twine
  these base and sluggish dullards whom i cite 
 born but to blow themselves with bread and wine
 in their vile mouths awhile such names convey
 then drop the load which is oblivion's prey

 xxii
 "but as the joyful swans that singing sweet
 convey the medals safely to the fane
 so they whose praises poets well repeat
 are rescued from oblivion direr pain
 than death o princes wary and discreet
 that wisely tread in caesar's steps and gain
 authors for friends they doubt it not shall save
 your noble names from lethe's laxy wave

 xxiii
 "rare as those gentle swans are poets too
 that well the poet's name have merited
 as well because it is heaven's will that few
 great rulers should the paths of glory tread
 as through foul fault of sordid lordlings who
 let sacred genius beg his daily bread
 who putting down the virtues raise the tribe
 of vices and the liberal arts proscribe

 xxiv
 "believe it that these ignorant men should be
 blind and deprived of judgment is god's doom
 who makes them loathe the light of poetry
 that envious death may wholly them consume
 besides that song can quicken and set free
 him that is prisoned in the darkness tomb
 though foul his name if cirrha him befriend
 its savour myrrh and spikenard shall transcend

 xxv
 "aeneas not so pious nor of arm
 so strong achilles hector not so bold
 was as 'tis famed and mid the nameless swarm
 thousands and thousands higher rank might hold
 but gift of palace and of plenteous farm
 bestowed by heirs of them whose deeds they told
 have moved the poet with his honoured hand
 to place them upon glory's highest stand

 xxvi
 "augustus not so holy and benign
 was as great virgil's trumpet sounds his name
 because he savoured the harmonious line
 his foul proscription passes without blame
 that nero was unjust would none divine
 nor haply would he suffer in his fame
 though heaven and earth were hostile had he known
 the means to make the tuneful tribe his own

 xxvii
 "homer a conqueror agamemnon shows
 and makes the trojan seem of coward vein
 and from the suitors faithful to her vows
 penelope a thousand wrongs sustain
 yet  would'st thou i the secret should expose 
 by contraries throughout the tale explain
 that from the trojan bands the grecian ran
 and deem penelope a courtezan

 xxviii
 "what fame eliza she so chaste of sprite
 on the other hand has left behind her hear
 who widely is a wanton baggage hight
 solely that she to maro was not dear
 marvel not this should cause me sore despite
 and if my speech diffusive should appear
 authors i love and pay the debt i owe
 speaking their praise an author i below

 xxix
 "there earned i above all men what no more
 time nor yet death from me shall take away
 and it behoved our lord of whom i bore
 such testimony so my paints to pay
 it grieves me much for them on whom her door
 courtesy closes on a stormy day
 who meagre pale and worn with hopeless suit
 knock night and day and ever without fruit

 xxx
 henceforth with that apostle let the peer
 remain for i have now to make a spring
 as far as 'tis from heaven to earth for here
 i cannot hang for ever on the wing
 i to the dame return who was whilere
 wounded by jealousy with cruel sting
 i left her where successively o'erthrown
 three kings she quickly upon earth had strown

 xxxii
 and afterwards arriving in a town
 at eve which on the road to paris lay
 heard tidings of rinaldo's victory blown
 and how in arles the vanquished paynim lay
  sure her rogero with the king is gone 
 as soon as reappears the dawning day
 towards fair provence whither as she hears
 king charlemagne pursues her way she steers

 xxxiii
 she towards provence by the nearest road
 so journeying met a maid of mournful air
 who though her cheeks with tears were overflowed
 was yet of visage and of manners fair
 she was it so transfixed with love's keen goad
 who sighed for monodante's valiant heir
 who at the bridge had left her lord a thrall
 when with king rodomont he tried a fall

 xxxiv
 she sought one of an otter's nimbleness
 by water and by land a cavalier
 so fierce that she that champion  to redress
 her wrongs  might match against the paynim peer
 when good rogero's lady comfortless
 to that fair dame as comfortless drew near
 her she saluted courteously and next
 demanded by what sorrow she was vext

 xxxv
 flordelice marked the maid that in her sight
 appeared a warrior fitted for her needs
 and of the bridge and river 'gan recite
 where argier's mighty king the road impedes
 and how he had gone nigh to slay her knight
 not that more doughty were the monarch's deeds
 but that the wily paynim vantageground
 in that streight bridge and foaming river found

 xxxvi
 "are you she said so daring and so kind
 as kind and daring you appear in show
 venge me of him that has my lord confined
 and makes me wander thus opprest with woe
 for love of heaven or teach me where to find
 at least a knight who can resist the foe
 and of such skill that little boot shall bring
 his bridge and river to the pagan king

 xxxvii
 "besides that so you shall achieve an end
 befitting courteous man and cavalier
 you will employ your valour to befriend
 the faithfullest of lovers far and near
 his other virtues i should ill commend
 so many and so many that whoe'er
 knoweth not these may well be said to be
 one without ears to hear or eyes to see"

 xxxviii
 the highminded maid to whom aye welcome are
 all noble quests by which she worthily
 may hope a great and glorious name to bear
 straight to the paynim's bridge resolves to hie
 and now so much the more  as in despair 
 wends willingly although it were to die
 in that she ever with herself at strife
 deeming rogero lost detested life

 xxxix
 "o loving damsel she made answer i
 offer mine aid for such as 'tis to do
 the hard and dread adventure passing by
 causes beside that move me most that you
 a matter of your lover testify
 which i in sooth hear warranted of few
 that he is constant for i'faith i swear
 i well believed all lovers perjured were"

 xl
 with these last words a sigh that damsel drew
 a sigh which issued from her heart then said
 "go we" and with the following sun those two
 at the deep stream arrived and bridge of dread
  seen of the guard that on his bugle blew
 a warning blast when strangers thither sped 
 the pagan arms him girds his goodly brand
 and takes upon the bridge his wonted stand

 xli
 and as the maid appears in martial scale
 the moody monarch threatens her to slay
 unless her goodly courser and her mail
 as an oblation to the tomb she pay
 fair bradamant who knew the piteous tale
 how murdered by him isabella lay
 the story gentle flordelice had taught
 replied in answer to that paynim haught

 xlii
 "wherefore o brutish man for your misdeed
 should penance by the innocent be done
 'tis fitting to appease her you should bleed
 you killed her and to all the deed is known
 so that of trophied armour or of weed
 of those so many by your lance o'erthrown
 your armour should the blest oblation be
 and you the choicest victim slain by me

 xliii
 "and dearer shall the gift be from my hand
 since i a woman am as she whilere
 nor save to venge her have i sought this strand
 in this desire alone i hither steer
 but first 'tis good some pact we understand
 before we prove our prowess with the spear
 you shall do by me if o'erthrown what you
 by other prisoners have been wont to do

 xliv
 "but if as i believe and trust you fall
 i will your horse and armour have she cried
 and taking down all others from the wall
 hang on the tomb alone those arms of pride
 and will that you release each warlike thrall"
  "the pact is just king rodomont replied
 but those my prisoners are not here confined
 and therefore cannot be to you consigned

 xlv
 "these have i sent into mine africk reign
 but this i promise thee and pledge my fay
 if by strange fortune thou thy seat maintain
 and i shall be dismounted in the fray
 delivered all shall be the captive train
 within what time suffices to convey
 an order thither that they our of hand
 'should do what thou if conqueror may'st command

 xlvi
 "but art thou undermost as fitter were
 and as thou surely wilt be i from thee
 not therefore will thy forfeit armour tear
 nor shall thy name inscribed as vanquished be
 to thy bright face bright eyes and beauteous hair
 all breathing love and grace the victory
 will i resign let it suffice that thou
 then stoop to love me as thou hatest now

 xlvii
 "to fall by me thou needest not disdain
 i with such strength such nerve am fortified"
 somedeal she smiled but smiled in bitter vein
 savouring of anger more than aught beside
 she spake not to that haughty man again
 to the bridgeend returned the damsel plied
 her courser with the rowels couched her spear
 and rode to meet the furious cavalier

 xlviii
 king rodomont prepares his course to run
 comes on at speed and with such mighty sound
 echoes that bridge the thundering noise might stun
 the ears of many distant from the ground
 the golden lance its wonted work has done
 for that fierce moor in tourney so renowned
 this from the saddle lifts in air suspends
 then headlong on the narrow bridge extends

 xlix
 scarce for her horse the martial damsel can
 find space to pass when she has thrown her foe
 and little lacked and mighty risque she ran
 of falling into that deep stream below
 but born of wind and flame good rabican
 so dextrous was and could so lightly go
 he picked a path along the outer ledge
 and could have paced upon a faulchion's edge

 l
 the damsel wheeled towards the cavalier
 returned and him bespoke in sportive way
 "who is the loser now to thee is clear
 and who is undermost in this assay"
 silent remained the monarch of argier
 amazed that woman him on earth should lay
 he cannot or he will not speak and lies
 on earth like one astound in idiot guise

 li
 silent and sad he raised himself from ground
 and when he some few paces thence had gone
 his shield unbraced and helm and mail unbound
 he flung against the tomb and thence alone
 afoot the moody monarch left that ground
 yet not till he had given command to one
 of his four squires was he to do his hest
 relating to those captives as exprest

 lii
 he parts and save that in a caverned cell
 he dwelt no further news of him were known
 meanwhile the harness of that infidel
 bradamant hung upon the lofty stone
 and having thence removed all plate and shell
 wherewith as by the writing it was shown
 the cavaliers of charles their limbs had drest
 she moved not nor let other move the rest

 liii
 besides the arms of monodantes' heir
 were those of sansonet and olivier
 who bound in search of good orlando were
 thither conducted by the road most near
 the day before here taken was the pair
 and sent by that proud paynim to argier
 these warriors' arms the martial maid bade lower
 from that fair tomb and stored them in the tower

 liv
 all others taken from the paynim train
 bradamant left suspended from the stone
 mid these a king's that idly and in vain
 had thither seeking frontalatte gone
 i say his arms that ruled circassia's reign
 who after wandering long by date and down
 here to his grief another courser left
 and lightly went his way of arms bereft

 lv
 stript of his armour and afoot did part
 that paynim monarch from the bridge of dread
 as rodomont permitted to depart
 those other knights that in his faith were bred
 but to his camp to wend he had no heart
 for there he was ashamed to show his head
 since in such fashion thither to return
 after his boasts had been too foul a scorn

 lvi
 yet still with new desire the warrior burned
 to seek her fixed alone in his heart's core
 and such the monarch's chance he quickly learned
 i cannot tell you who the tidings bore
 she was towards her native land returned
 hence as love spurs and goads him evermore
 he bowns him straight her footsteps to pursue
 but i to bradamant return anew

 lvii
 when she in other writing had displaid
 how she had freed that passage from the foe
 to mournful flordelice the martial maid
 she that still held her weeping visage low
 turned her and courteously that lady prayed
 to tell her whither she designed to go
 to her afflicted flordelice replied
 "to arles where camp the paynims would i ride

 lviii
 "which bark i hope and fitting company
 to carry me to africk may afford
 nor will i halt upon my way till i
 once more rejoin my husband and my lord
 all means and measures there resolved to try
 that may release him from his jailer's ward
 and should the saracen deceitful prove
 others and others yet i mean to move"

 lix
 "my company replied the martial fair
 for some part of the road i offer thee
 till we have sight of arles then to repair
 thither will pray you for the love of me
 to find king agramant's rogero there
 whose glorious name is spread o'er land and sea
 and render to that knight this goodly horse
 whence the proud moor was flung in martial course

 lx
 "say thus from point to point `a cavalier
 that would in combat prove his chivalry
 and to the world at large would fain make clear
 thy breach of faith with him that thou may'st be
 ready and well prepared for the career
 gave me this horse that i might give it thee
 he bids thee promptly mail and corslet dight
 and wait him who with thee will wage the fight'

 lxi
 "say this and nought beside and would he hear
 my name declare that 'tis to thee unknown"
 with wonted kindness cried that dame "i ne'er
 in spending life itself not words alone
 should weary in your service since whilere
 you would in my behalf as much have done"
 her aymon's daughter thanked in courteous strain
 and to her hand consigned frontino's rein

 lxii
 through long days' journey by that rivershore
 together go the lovely pilgrim pair
 till they see arles and hear the hollow roar
 of billows breaking on the seabeach bare
 almost without the suburbs and before
 the furthest barrier stops the martial fair
 to furnish flordelice what time might need
 for the conveyance of rogero's steed

 lxiii
 she forward rode within the enclosure sped
 and o'er the bridge and through the gateway wended
 and furnished with a guide who thither led
 to young rogero's inn and there descended
 she to the child as bid her message said
 and gave the courser to her care commended
 then for she waits not for an answer speeds
 in haste to execute her proper needs

 lxiv
 rogero stands confused he finds no end
 to his perplexing thoughts and cannot see
 who should defy him who that message send
 to speak him ill and do him courtesy
 who thus as faithless him should reprehend
 or any reprehend whoe'er it be
 nor knows he nor imagines least of all
 on bradamant the knight's suspicions fall

 lxv
 to think 'twas rodomont the youthful peer
 was more inclined than any other wight
 and wherefore even from him he this should hear
 muses nor can the cause divine aright
 save him in all the world the cavalier
 knows not of one that has him at despite
 meanwhile dordona's lady craved the field
 and loud that martial damsel's bugle pealed

 lxvi
 to agramant and king marsilius flew
 the news that one craved battle on the plain
 serpentine stood by chance before the two
 and gained their leave to don his plate and chain
 and vowed to take that haughty man the crew
 of people over wall and rampart strain
 nor child nor elder was there but he pressed
 to see which champion should bestir him best

 lxvii
 in beauteous arms and costly surcoat drest
 serpentine of the star to combat sped
 the ground he at the first encounter prest
 as if equipt with wings his courser fled
 the damsel flew his charger to arrest
 and by the bride to that paynim led
 exclaiming "mount and bid your monarch send
 a knight that better can with me contend"

 lxviii
 the moorish king that on the rampart's height
 stood with a mighty following next the plain
 marking the joust much marvelled at the sight
 of the foe's courtesy to him of spain
 "he takes him not although he may of right"
 he cries i' the hearing of the paynim train
 serpentine comes and as the maid commands
 a better warrior of that king demands

 lxix
 grandonio de volterna fierce of mood
 and in all spain the proudest cavalier
 the second for that fell encounter stood
 such favour had his suit obtained whilere
 "to thee thy courtesy shall do no good"
 he threats "for if unhorsed in the career
 a prisoner to my lord shalt thou be led
 but if i fight as wonted thou art dead"

 lxx
 she cries "i would not thy discourtesy
 should make me so forget my courteous vein
 but that aforehand i should caution thee
 back to thy fortress to return again
 ere on hard earth thy bones shall battered be
 go tell thy king no champion of thy grain
 i seek but hither come to crave the fight
 with warrior that is worthy of my might"

 lxxi
 bradamant's sharp and stinging answer stirred
 the paynim's fury to a mighty flame
 so that without the power to speak a word
 he wheeled his courser filled with rage and shame
 wheeling as well at that proud paynim spurred
 her horse with levelled lance the warlike dame
 as the charmed weapon smites grandonio's shield
 with heels in air he tumbles on the field

 lxxii
 to him the highminded damsel gave his horse
 and said "yet was this fate to thee foreshown
 instead of craving thus the knightly course
 better mine embassy wouldst thou have done
 some other knight that equals me in force
 i pray thee bid the moorish king send down
 nor weary me by forcing me to meet
 champions like thee untried in martial feat"

 lxxiii
 they on the walls that know not who the peer
 that in the joust so well maintains his seat
 name many a warrior famous in career
 that often make them shake in fiercest heat
 brandimart many deem the cavalier
 more guesses in renowned rinaldo meet
 many would deem orlando was the knight
 but that they knew his pitiable plight

 lxxiv
 the third encounter craved lanfusa's son
 and cried "not that i better hope to fare
 but that to warriors who this course have run
 my fall may furnish an excuse more fair"
 next with all arms that martial jousters don
 clothed him and of a hundred steeds that were
 ready for service kept in lordly stall
 for speed and action chose the best of all

 lxxv
 he bowned him for the tournay on his side
 but first saluted her and she the knight
 "if 'tis allowed to ask" the lady cried
 "tell me in courtesy how ye are hight"
 in this ferrau the damsel satisfied
 who rarely hid himself form living wight
 "ye will i not refuse" subjoined the dame
 "albeit i to meet another came"

 lxxvi
  "and who" the spaniard said  the maid replied
 "rogero" and pronounced the word with pain
 and in so saying her fair face was dyed
 all over with the rose's crimson grain
 she after added "hither have i hied
 to prove how justly famed his might and main
 no other care have i no other call
 but with that gentle youth to try a fall"

 lxxvii
 she spoke the word in all simplicity
 which some already may in malice wrest
 ferrau replied "assured i first must be
 which of us two is schooled in warfare best
 if what has chanced to many falls on me
 hither when i return shall be addrest
 to mend my fault that gentle cavalier
 with whom you so desire to break a spear"

 lxxviii
 discoursing all this while the martial maid
 spake with her beavor up without disguise
 ferrau as that fair visage he surveyed
 perceived he was half vanquished by its eyes
 and to himself in under tone he said
 "he seems an angel sent from paradise
 and though he should not harm me with his lance
 i am already quelled by that sweet glance"

 lxxix
 they take their ground and to the encounter ride
 and like those others ferrau goes to ground
 his courser bradamant retained and cried
 "return and keep thy word with me as bound"
 shamed he returned and by his monarch's side
 among his peers the young rogero found
 and let the stripling know the stranger knight
 without the walls defied him to the fight

 lxxx
 rogero for not yet that warrior knows
 what champion him in duel would assail
 nigh sure of victory with transport glows
 and bids his followers bring his plate and mail
 nor having seen beneath those heavy blows
 the rest dismounted makes his spirit quail
 but how he armed how sallied what befell
 that knight in other canto will i tell


 canto 36

 argument
 while with the fierce marphisa at despite
 duke aymon's daughter wages fierce affray
 one and the other host engage in fight
 with bradamant rogero wends his way
 with other war disturbs their great delight
 marphisa bold but when that martial may
 has for her brother recognized the peer
 they end their every strife with joyous cheer


 i
 where'er they be all hearts of gentle strain
 still cannot choose but courtesy pursue
 for they from nature and from habit gain
 what they henceforth can never more undo
 alike the heart that is of churlish vein
 where'er it be its evil kind will shew
 nature inclines to ill through all her range
 and use is second nature hard to change

 ii
 among the warriors of antiquity
 much gentleness and courtesy appear
 virtues but seldom seen with us while we
 of evil ways on all sides see and hear
 hippolytus when you with ensignry
 won from the foe and with his captive gear
 adorned our temples and his galleys bore
 laden with prey to your paternal shore

 iii
 all the inhuman deeds which wrought by hand
 of moor or turk or tartar ever were
 yet not by the venetians' ill command
 that evermore the praise of justice bear
 were practised by that foul and evil band
 of soldiers who their mercenaries are
 of those so many fires not now i tell
 which on our farms and pleasant places fell

 iv
 though a foul vengeance in that blow was meant
 mainly at you who being at caesar's side
 when padua by his leaguering host was pent
 'twas known that oft through you was turned aside
 more than one ravening flame and oft was spent
 the fire in fane and village blazing wide
 what time the destined mischief ye withstood
 as to your inborn courtesy seemed good

 v
 this will i pass nor their so many more
 discourteous and despiteous doings tell
 save one alone whereat from rockstone hoar
 whene'er the tale is told warm tears might well
 that day you sent your family before
 thither my lord where under omens fell
 your foes into a well protected seat
 abandoning their barks had made retreat

 vi
 as hector and aeneas mid the flood
 fire to the banded fleet of greece applied
 i hercules and alexander viewed
 urged by too sovereign ardour side by side
 spurring before all others in their mood
 even within the hostile ramparts ride
 and prick so far the second 'scaped with pain
 and on the foremost closed the opposing train

 vii
 feruffine 'scaped the good cantelmo left
 what counsel sora's duke was thine what heart
 when thy bold son thou saw'st of helm bereft
 amid a thousand swords when  dragged apart 
 thou saw'st his young head from his shoulders cleft
 a shipboard on a plank i on my part
 marvel that seeing but the murder done
 slew thee not as the faulchion slew thy son

 viii
 cruel sclavonian say whence hast thou brought
 thy ways of warfare by what scythian rite
 to slay the helpless prisoner is it taught
 who yields his arms nor fends himself in fight
 was it a crime he for his country fought
 ill upon thee the sun bestows his light
 remorseless aera which hast filled the page
 with atreus' tantalus' thyestes' rage

 ix
 barbarian thou madest shorter by the head
 the boldest of his age on whom did beam
 the sun 'twixt pole and pole 'twixt indus' bed
 and where he sinks in ocean's western stream
 whose years and beauty might have pity bred
 in anthropophagus in polypheme
 not thee that art in wickedness outdone
 by any cyclops any lestrigon

 x
 i ween mid warriors in the days of yore
 no such example was they all in field
 were full of gentleness and courteous lore
 nor against conquered foe their bosom steeled
 not only gentle bradamant forbore
 to harm the knights whom smitten on the shield
 her lance unhorsed but for the vanquished crew
 detained their steeds that they might mount anew

 xi
 i of that lady fair of mickle might
 told you above how she had overthrown
 serpentine of the star in single fight
 grandonio and ferrau and then upon
 their coursers had replaced each baffled knight
 i told moreover how the third was gone
 rogero to defy to the career
 upon her call who seemed a cavalier

 xii
 rogero heard the call in joyous vein
 and bade his arms be brought now while in view
 of agramant he donned the plate and chain
 those lords the former question moved anew
 who was the knight that on the martial plain
 the manage of the lance so quaintly knew
 and of ferrau who spake with him whilere
 craved if to him was known that cavalier

 xiii
 "be ye assured" to them ferrau replied
 "he is not one of those i hear you cite
 to me for i his open face descried
 rinaldo's youthful brother seemed the knight
 but since his doughty valour i have tried
 and wot not such is richardetto's might
 i ween it is his sister who i hear
 resembles much in mien that martial peer

 xiv
 "the damsel equals well so rumour tells
 rinaldo and every paladin in fray
 but brother she and cousin both excels
 measured by that which i have seen today"
 hearing him while upon her praise he dwells
 as the sky reddens with the morning ray
 rogero's face is flushed with crimson hue
 and his heart throbs nor knows he what to do

 xv
 stung at these tidings by the amorous dart 
 within new fire inflames the cavalier
 and strait together with the burning smart
 shoots through his bones a chill produced by fear
 fear that new wrath had stifled in her heart
 that mighty love wherewith she burned whilere
 confused he stands irresolute and slow
 and undecided if to stay or go

 xvi
 now fierce marphisa who was there and prest
 by huge desire to meet the stranger wight
 and armed withal for save in iron vest
 her seldom would you find by day or night
 hearing rogero is in armour drest
 fearing to lose the honour of the fight
 if first that champion with the stranger vies
 thinks to prevent the youth and win the prize

 xvii
 she leapt upon her horse and thither hied
 where aymon's daughter on the listed plain
 with palpitating heart upon her side
 waited rogero whom the damsel fain
 would make her prisoner and but schemed to guide
 her lance in mode the stripling least to pain
 marphisa from the city portal fares
 and on her gallant helm a phoenix wears

 xviii
 whether the maid would publish in her pride
 that she was single in the world for might
 or whether by that symbol signified
 that she would live exempt from bridal rite
 her closely aymon's martial daughter eyed
 when seeing not those features her delight
 she craves the damsel's name before they move
 and hears that it is she who joys her love

 xix
 or rather she that gentle lady thought
 had joyed her love and whom she hated so
 her to death's door her anger would have brought
 unless she venged her sorrow on the foe
 she wheeled her courser round with fury fraught
 less with desire to lay her rival low
 than with the lance to pierce her in mid breast
 and put her every jealousy at rest

 xx
 parforce to ground must go the royal maid
 to prove it hard or soft the listed plain
 and be with such unwonted scorn appaid
 that she is nearly maddened by disdain
 scarce was she thrown before her trenchant blade
 she bared and hurried to avenge the stain
 cried aymon's daughter no less proud of heart
 "what art thou doing thou my prisoner art"

 xxi
 "though i have courtesy for others none"
 she said "from me marphisa shalt thou find
 since evermore i hear of thee as one
 to pride and every churlishness inclined"
 marphisa at these words was heard to groan
 as roars in some searock the prisoned wind
 she screamed an answer but its sense was drowned
 such rage confused that damsel in the sound

 xxii
 she whirls this while her faulchion and would fain
 wound horse or rider in the paunch or breast
 but aymon's watchful daughter turns the rein
 and on one side her courser leaps possest
 with furious anger and with fierce disdain
 she at her opposite her lance addrest
 and hardly touched the damsel ere astound
 marphisa fell reversed upon the ground

 xxiii
 scarce down marphisa started from the plain
 intent fell mischief with her sword to do
 bradamant couched her golden spear again
 and yet again the damsel overthrew
 yet bradamant though blest with might and main
 was not so much the stronger of the two
 as to have flung the maid in every just
 but that such power was in the lance's thrust

 xxiv
 this while some knights some knights upon our side
 i say forth issuing from the city go
 towards the field of strife which did divide
 the squadrons here and there of either foe
  not half a league of one another wide 
 seeing their knight such mighty prowess show
 their knight but whom no otherwise they knew
 than as a warrior of the christian crew

 xxv
 troyano's generous son who had espied
 this band approaching to the citywall
 for due defence would every means provide
 and every peril every case forestall
 and orders many to take arms who ride
 forth from the ramparts at the monarch's call
 with them rogero goes in armour cased
 balked of the battle by marphisa's haste

 xxvi
 the enamoured youth with beating heart intent
 stood by the issue of the just to view
 for his dear cousin fearing the event
 in that he well marphisa's valour knew
  at the beginning i would say  when bent
 on mischief fiercely closed the furious two
 but when that duel's turn the stripling eyes
 he stands amazed and stupid with surprize

 xxvii
 and when he saw unfinished was the fight
 at the first onset like the justs whilere
 misdoubting some strange accident in sprite
 sore vexed this while remained the cavalier
 to either maid wished well that youthful knight
 for both were loved but not alike were dear
 for this the stripling's love was fury fire
 for that 'twas rather fondness than desire

 xxviii
 if so rogero could with honour do
 he willingly the warriors would divide
 but his companions in the fear to view
 victory with king charles's knight abide
 esteeming him the better of the two
 break in between and turn their arms aside
 upon the other part the christian foes
 advance and both divisions come to blows

 xxix
 on this side and that other rings the alarm
 which in those camps is sounded every day
 bidding the unmounted mount the unarmed arm
 and all their standards seek without delay
 where under separate flags the squadrons swarm
 more than one shrilling trump is heard to bray
 and as their rattling notes the riders call
 rousing the foot beat drum and ataball

 xxx
 as fierce as thought could think 'twixt either host
 kindled the fell and sanguinary fray
 the daring damsel fair dordona's boast
 sore vexed and troubled that in the affray
 she cannot compass what she covets most
  marphisa with avenging steel to slay 
 now here not there amid the medley flies
 hoping to see the youth for whom she sighs

 xxxi
 by the eagle argent on the shield of blue
 she recognized rogero mid the rest
 with eyes and thought intent she stops to view
 the warrior's manly shoulders and his breast
 fair face and movements full of graceful shew
 and then the maid with mickle spite possest
 thinking another joys the stripling's love
 thus speaks as sovereign rage and fury move

 xxxii
 "shall then another kiss those lips so bright
 and sweet if those fair lips are lost to me
 ah never other shall in thee delight
 for it not mine no other's shalt thou be
 rather than die alone and of despite
 i with this hand will slay myself and thee
 that if i lose thee here at least in hell
 with thee i to eternity may dwell

 xxxiii
 "if thou slay'st me there is good reason i
 the comfort too of vengeance should obtain
 in that all edicts and all equity
 the death of him that causes death ordain
 nor since you justly i unjustly die
 deem i that thine is equal to my pain
 i him who seeks my life alas shall spill
 thou her that loves and worships thee wouldst kill

 xxxiv
 "my hand why hast thou not the hardiment
 to rive with steel the bosom of my foe
 that me so many times to death has shent
 under the faith of love in peaceful show
 him who to take my life can now consent
 nor even have pity of my cruel woe
 dare valiant heart this impious man to slay
 and let his death my thousand deaths appay"

 xxxv
 so said she spurred at him amid the throng
 but first  "defend thee false rogero"  cried
 "no more if i have power in spoil and wrong
 done to a virgin heart shalt thou take pride"
 hearing that voice the hostile ranks among
 he deems  and truly deems  he hears his bride
 whose voice the youth remembers in such wise
 that mid a thousand would he recognize

 xxxvi
 her further meaning well did he divine
 weening that him she in that speech would blame
 for having broke their pact and  with design
 the occasion of his failure to proclaim 
 of his desire for parley made a sign
 but she with vizor closed already came
 raging and grieved intent with vengeful hand
 to fling the youth nor haply upon sand

 xxxvii
 rogero when he saw her so offended
 fixed himself firmly in his arms and seat
 he rests his lance but holds the stave suspended
 so that it shall not harm her when they meet
 she that to smite and pierce the child intended
 pitiless and inflamed with furious heat
 has not the courage when she sees him near
 to fling or do him outrage with the spear

 xxxviii
 void of effect 'tis thus their lances go
 and it is well since love with burning dart
 tilting this while at one and the other foe
 has lanced the enamoured warriors in midheart
 unable at the child to aim her blow
 the lady spent her rage in other part
 and mighty deeds achieved which fame will earn
 while overhead the circling heavens shall turn

 xxxix
 above three hundred men in that affray
 in little space by her dismounted lie
 alone that warlike damsel wins the day
 from her alone the moorish people fly
 to her rogero circling threads his way
 and says "unless i speak with you i die
 hear me for love of heaven  what done i done
 alas that ever mine approach ye shun"

 xl
 as when soft southern breezes are unpent
 which with a tepid breath from seaward blow
 the snows dissolve and torrents find a vent
 and ice so hard erewhile is seen to flow
 at those entreaties at that brief lament
 rinaldo's sister's heart is softened so
 forthwith compassionate and pious grown
 which anger fain had made more hard than stone

 xli
 would she not could she not she nought replied
 but spurred aslant the ready rabicane
 and signing to rogero rode as wide
 as she could wend from that embattled train
 then to a sheltered valley turned aside
 wherein embosomed was a little plain
 in the mid lawn a wood of cypress grew
 whose saplings of one stamp appeared to view

 xlii
 within that thicket of white marble wrought
 is a proud monument and newly made
 and he that makes enquiry here is taught
 in few brief verses who therein is laid
 but of those lines methinks took little thought
 fair bradamant arriving in that glade
 rogero spurred his courser and pursued
 and overtook that damsel in the wood

 xliii
 but turn we to marphisa that anew
 during this space was seated on her steed
 and sought again the valiant champion who
 at the first onset cast her on the mead
 and saw how from the mingling host withdrew
 rogero after that strange knight to speed
 nor deemed the youth pursued in love she thought
 he but to end their strife and quarrel sought

 xliv
 she pricks her horse behind the two and gains
 well nigh as soon as they that valley how
 her coming thither either lover pains
 who lives and loves untaught by me may know
 but sorest vext sad bradamant remains
 beholding her whence all her sorrows flow
 who shall persuade the damsel but that love
 for young rogero brings her to that grove

 xlv
 and him perfidious she anew did name
  "perfidious was it not enough she said
 that i should know thy perfidy from fame
 but must the witness of thy guilt be made
 i wot to drive me from thee is thine aim
 and i that thy desires may be appaid
 will die but strive in yielding up my breath
 she too shall die the occasion of my death"

 xlvi
 angrier than venomed viper with a bound
 so saying she upon marphisa flies
 and plants so well the spear that she astound
 fell backward on the champaigne in such guise
 nigh half her helm was buried in the ground
 nor was the damsel taken by surprise
 nay did her best the encounter to withstand
 yet with her helmed head she smote the sand

 xlvii
 bradamant who will die or in that just
 will put to death marphisa rages so
 she has no mind again with lance to thrust
 again that martial maid to overthrow
 but thinks her head to sever from the bust
 where it half buried lies with murderous blow
 away the enchanted lance that damsel flings
 unsheathes the sword and from her courser springs

 xlviii
 but is too slow withal for on her feet
 she finds marphisa with such fierce disdain
 inflamed at being in that second heat
 so easily reversed upon the plain
 she hears in vain exclaim in vain entreat
 rogero who beholds their strife with pain
 so blinded are the pair with spite and rage
 that they with desperate fury battle wage

 xlix
 at halfsword's engage the struggling foes
 and  such their stubborn mood  with shortened brand
 they still approach and now so fiercely close
 they cannot choose but grapple hand to hand
 her sword no longer needful each foregoes
 and either now new means of mischief planned
 rogero both implores with earnest suit
 but supplicates the twain with little fruit

 l
 when he entreaties unavailing found
 the youth prepared by force to part the two
 their poniards snatched away and on the ground
 beneath a cypresstree the daggers threw
 when they no weapons have wherewith to wound
 with prayer and threat he interferes anew
 but vainly for since better weapons lack
 each other they with fists and feet attack

 li
 rogero ceased not from his task he caught
 by hand or arm the fiercely struggling pair
 till to the utmost pitch of fury wrought
 the fell marphisa's angry passions were
 she that this ample world esteemed at nought
 of the child's friendship had no further care
 plucked from the foe she ran to seize her sword
 and fastened next upon that youthful lord

 lii
 "like a discourteous man and churl ye do
 rogero to disturb another's fight
 a deed she cried this hand shall make ye rue
 which i intend shall vanquished both" the knight
 sought fierce marphisa's fury to subdue
 with gentle speech but full of such despite
 he found her and inflamed with such disdain
 all parley was a waste of time and pain

 liii
 at last his faulchion young rogero drew
 for ire as well had flushed that cavalier
 nor is it my belief that ever shew
 athens or rome or city whatsoe'er
 witnessed which ever so rejoiced the view
 as this rejoices as this sight is dear
 to bradamant when through their strife displaced
 every suspicion from her breast is chased

 liv
 bradamant took her sword and to descry
 the duel of those champions stood apart
 the god of war descended from the sky
 she deemed rogero for his strength and art
 if he seemed mars marphisa to the eye
 seemed an infernal fury on her part
 'tis true that for a while the youthful knight
 against that damsel put not forth his might

 lv
 he knew the virtues of that weapon well
 such proof thereof the knight erewhile had made
 where'er it falls parforce is every spell
 annulled or by its stronger virtue stayed
 hence so rogero smote it never fell
 upon its edge or point but still the blade
 descended flat he long this rule observes
 yet once he from his patient purpose swerves

 lvi
 in that a mighty stroke marphisa sped
 meaning to cleave the brainpan of her foe
 he raised the buckler to defend his head
 and the sword smote upon its bird of snow
 nor broke nor bruised the shield by spell bested
 but his arm rang astounded by the blow
 nor aught but hector's mail the sword had stopt
 whose furious blow would his left arm have lopt

 lvii
 and had upon his head descended shear
 whereat designed to strike the savage fair
 scarce his left arm can good rogero rear
 can scarce the shield and blazoned bird upbear
 all pity he casts off and 'twould appear
 as in his eyes a lighted torch did glare
 as hard as he can smite he smites and woe
 to thee marphisa if he plants the blow

 lviii
 i cannot tell you truly in what wise
 that faulchion swerves against a cypressstock
 in such closeserried ranks the saplings rise
 buried above a palm within the block
 as this the mountain and the plain that lies
 beneath it with a furious earthquake rock
 and from that marble monument proceeds
 a voice that every mortal voice exceeds

 lix
 the horrid voice exclaims "your quarrel leave
 for 'twere a deed unjust and inhumane
 that brother should of life his sister reave
 or sister by her brother's hand be slain
 rogero and marphisa mine believe
 the tale which i deliver is not vain
 seed of one father on one womb ye lay
 and first together saw the light of day

 lx
 "galaciella's children are ye whom
 she to rogero hight the second bare
 whose brothers having by unrighteous doom
 of your unhappy sire deprived that fair
 not heeding that she carried in her womb
 ye who yet suckers of their lineage are
 her in a rotten carcase of a boat
 to founder in mid ocean set afloat

 lxi
 "but fortune that had destined you whilere
 and yet unborn to many a fair emprize
 your mother to that lonely shore did steer
 which overright the sandy syrtes lies
 where having given you birth that spirit dear
 forthwith ascended into paradise
 a witness of the piteous case was i
 so heaven had willed and such your destiny

 lxii
 "i to the dame as descent burial gave
 as could be given upon that desert sand
 ye well enveloped in my vest i save
 and bear to mount carena from the strand
 and make a lioness leave whelps and cave
 and issue from the wood with semblance bland
 ye twice ten months with mickle fondness bred
 and from her paps the milky mother fed

 lxiii
 "needing to quit my home upon a day
 and journey through the country as you can
 haply remember ye we are on our way
 were overtaken by an arab clan
 those robbers thee marphisa bore away
 while young rogero 'scaped who better ran
 bereaved of thee they woful loss i wept
 and with more watchful care thy brother kept

 lxiv
 "rogero if atlantes watched thee well
 while yet he was alive thou best dost know
 i the fixed stars had heard of thee foretell
 that thou shouldst perish by a treacherous foe
 in christian land and still their influence fell
 was ended laboured to avert the blow
 nor having power in fine thy will to guide
 i sickened sore and of my sorrow died

 lxv
 "but here before my death for in this glade
 i knew thou should'st with bold marphisa fight
 i with huge stones amassed by hellish aid
 had this fair monument of marble dight
 and i to charon with loud outcries said
 i would not he should hence convey my sprite
 till here prepared in deadly fray to strive
 rogero and his sister should arrive

 lxvi
 "thus has my spirit for this many a day
 waited thy coming in these beauteous groves
 so be no more to jealous fears a prey
 o bradamant because rogero loves
 but me to quit the cheerful realms of day
 and seek the darksome cloisters it behoves"
 here ceased the voice which in the child amazed
 and those two damsels mighty marvel raised

 lxvii
 gladly a sister in the martial queen
 rogero she in him a brother knows
 who now embrace nor move her jealous spleen
 that with the love of young rogero glows
 and citing what and when and where had been
 their childish deeds as they to memory rose
 in summing up past times more sure they hold
 the things whereof the wizard's spirit told

 lxviii
 rogero from marphisa does not hide
 how bradamant to him at heart is dear
 and by what obligations he is tied
 in moving words relates the cavalier
 nor ceases till he has on either side
 turned to firm love the hate they bore whilere
 when as a sign of peace and discord chased
 they at his bidding tenderly embraced

 lxix
 marphisa to rogero makes request
 to say what sire was theirs and what their strain
 and how he died by banded foes opprest
 or at close barriers was the warrior slain
 and who it was had issued the behest
 to drown their mother in the stormy main
 for of the tale if ever heard before
 little or nothing she in memory bore

 lxx
 "of trojan ancestors are we the seed
 through famous hector's line" rogero said
 "for after young astyanax was freed
 from fierce ulysses and the toils he spread
 leaving another stripling in his stead
 of his own age he out of phrygia fled
 who after long and wide seawandering gained
 sicily's shore and in messina reigned

 lxxi
 "part of calabria within faro held
 the warrior's heirs who after a long run
 of successors departed thence and dwelled
 in mars' imperial city more than one
 famed king and emperor who that list have swelled
 in rome and other part has filled the throne
 and from constantius and good constantine
 stretched to the son of pepin is their line

 lxxii
 "rogero gambaron buovo hence succeed
 and that rogero second of the name
 who filled our fruitful mother with his seed
 as thou atlantes may'st have heard proclaim
 of our fair lineage many a noble deed
 shalt thou hear blazed abroad by sounding fame"
 of agolant's inroad next the stripling told
 with agramant and with almontes bold

 lxxiii
 and how a lovely daughter who excelled
 in feats of arms that king accompanied
 so stout she many paladins had quelled
 and how in fine she for rogero sighed
 and for his love against her sire rebelled
 and was baptized and was rogero's bride
 and how a traitor loved him bertram name
 his brother's wife with an incestuous flame

 lxxiv
 and country sire and brethren two betrayed
 hoping he so the lady should have won
 how risa open to the foe he laid
 by whom all scathe was on those kinsmen done
 how agolant's two furious sons conveyed
 their mother great with child and six months gone
 aboard a helmless boat and with its charge
 in wildest winter turned adrift the barge

 lxxv
 valiant marphisa with a tranquil face
 heard young rogero thus his tale pursue
 and joyed to be descended of a race
 which from so fair a font its waters drew
 whence clermont whence renowned mongrana trace
 their noble line the martial damsel knew
 blazoned through years and centuries by fame
 unrivalled both in arms of mighty name

 lxxvi
 when afterwards she from her brother knew
 agramant's uncle sire and grandsire fell
 in treacherous wise the first rogero slew
 and brought to cruel pass galacielle
 marphisa could not hear the story through
 to him she cries "with pardon what you tell
 brother convicts you of too foul a wrong
 in leaving thus our sire unvenged so long

 lxxvii
 "could'st thou not in almontes and troyane
 as dead whilere your thirsty faulchion plant
 by you those monarch's children might be slain
 are you alive and lives king agramant
 never will you efface the shameful stain
 that ye so often wronged not only grant
 life to that king but as your lord obey
 lodge in his court and serve him for his pay

 lxxviii
 "here heartily in face of heaven i vow
 that christ my father worshipped to adore
 and till i venge my parents on the foe
 to wear this armour and i will deplore
 your deed rogero and deplore even now
 that you should swell the squadrons of the moor
 or other follower of the moslem faith
 save sword in hand and to the paynim's scathe"

 lxxix
 ah how fair bradamant uplifts again
 her visage at that speech rejoiced in sprite
 rogero she exhorts in earnest vein
 to do as his marphisa counsels right
 and bids him seek the camp of charlemagne
 and have himself acknowledged in his sight
 who so reveres and lauds his father's worth
 he even deems him one unmatched on earth

 lxxx
 in the beginning so he should have done
 warily young rogero answer made
 but for the tale was not so fully known
 as since the deed had been too long delaid
 now seeing it was fierce troyano's son
 that had begirt him with the knightly blade
 he as a traitor well might be abhorred
 if he slew one accepted as his lord

 lxxxi
 but as to bradamant whilere he cries
 he will all measures and all means assay
 whereby some fair occasion may arise
 to leave the king and had there been delay
 and he whilere had done in otherwise
 she on the tartar king the fault must lay
 how sorely handled that redoubted foe
 had left him in their battle she must know

 lxxxii
 and she that every day had sought his bed
 must of this truth the fittest witness be
 much upon this was answered much was said
 between those damsels who at last agree
 and as their last resolve last counsel read
 he should rejoin the paynim's ensignry
 till he found fair occasion to resort
 from agramant's to charles's royal court

 lxxxiii
 to bradamant the bold marphisa cries
 "let him begone nor doubt am i before
 many days pass will manage in such wise
 that agramant shall be his lord no more"
 so says the martial damsel nor implies
 the secret purpose which she has in store
 making his congees to the friendly twain
 to join his king rogero turns the rein

 lxxxiv
 when a complaint is heard from valley near
 all now stand listening to the noise attent
 and to that plaintive voice incline their ear
 a woman's as 'twould seem that makes lament
 but i this strain would gladly finish here
 and that i finish it be ye content
 for better things i promise to report
 if ye to hear another strain resort


 canto 37

 argument
 lament and outcry loud of some that mourn
 attract rogero and the damsels two
 they find ulania with her mantle shorn
 by marganor amid her moaning crew
 upon that felon knight for his foul scorn
 a fierce revenge marphisa takes a new
 statute that maid does in the town obtain
 and marganor is by ulania slain


 i
 if as in seeking other gift to gain
 for nature without study yieldeth nought
 with mighty diligence and mickle pain
 illustrious women day and night have wrought
 and if with good success the female train
 to a fair end no homely task have brought
 so  did they for such other studies wake 
 as mortal attributes immortal make

 ii
 and if they of themselves sufficient were
 their praises to posterity to show
 nor borrowed authors' aid whose bosoms are
 with envy and with hate corroded so
 that oft they hide the good they might declare
 and tell in every place what ill they know
 to such a pitch would mount the female name
 as haply ne'er was reached by manly fame

 iii
 to furnish mutual aid is not enow
 for many who would lend each other light
 men do their best that womankind should show
 whatever faults they have in open sight
 would hinder them of rising from below
 and sink them to the bottom if they might
 i say the ancients as if glory won
 by woman dimmed their own as mist the sun

 iv
 but hands or tongue ne'er had nor has the skill
 does voice or lettered page the thought impart
 though each with all its power increase the ill
 diminishing the good with all its art
 so female fame to stifle but that still
 the honour of the sex survives in part
 yet reacheth not its pitch nor such its flight
 but that 'tis far below its natural height

 v
 not only thomyris and harpalice
 and who brought hector who brought turnus aid
 and who to build in lybia crost the sea
 by tyrian and sidonian band obeyed
 not only famed zenobia only she
 who persian indian and assyrian frayed
 not only these and some few others merit
 their glory that eternal fame inherit

 vi
 faithful chaste and bold the world hath seen
 in greece and rome not only but where'er
 the sun unfolds his flowing locks between
 the hesperides and indian hemisphere
 whose gifts and praise have so extinguished been
 we scarce of one amid a thousand hear
 and this because they in their days have had
 for chroniclers men envious false and bad

 vii
 but ye that prosper in the exercise
 of goodly labours aye your way pursue
 nor halt o women in your high emprise
 for fear of not receiving honour due
 for as nought good endures beneath the skies
 so ill endures no more if hitherto
 unfriendly by the poet's pen and page
 they now befriend you in our better age

 viii
 erewhile marullo and pontante for you
 declared and  sire and son  the strozzi twain
 capello bembo and that writer who
 has fashioned like himself the courtier train
 with lewis alamanni and those two
 beloved of mars and muses of their strain
 descended who the mighty city rule
 which mincius parts and moats with marshy pool

 ix
 one of this pair besides that of his will
 he honours you and does you courtesies
 and makes parnassus and high cynthus' hill
 resound your praise and lift it to the skies
 the love the faith and mind unconquered still
 mid threats of ruin which in stedfast wise
 to him his constant isabel hath shown
 render yet more your champion than his own

 x
 so that he never more will wearied be
 with quickening in his verse your high renown
 and if another censures you than he
 prompter to arm in your defence is none
 nor knight in this wide world more willingly
 life in the cause of virtue would lay down
 matter as well for other's pen he gives
 as in his own another's glory lives

 xi
 and well he merits that a dame so blest
 blest with all worth which in this earthly round
 is seen in them who don the female vest
 to him hath evermore been faithful found
 of a sure pillar of pure truth possest
 in her despising fortune's every wound
 worthy of one another are the twain
 nor better ere were paired in wedlock's chain

 xii
 new trophies he on oglio's bank has shown
 for he mid bark and car amid the gleam
 of fire and sword such goodly rhymes hath strown
 as may with envy swell the neighbouring stream
 by hercules bentivoglio next is blown
 the noble strain your honour's noble theme
 reynet trivulzio and guidetti mine
 and molza called of phoebus and the nine

 xiii
 there's hercules of the carnuti son
 of my own duke who spreads his every plume
 soaring and singing like harmonious swan
 and even to heaven uplifts your name with whom
 there is my lord of guasto not alone
 a theme for many an athens many a rome
 in his high strain he promises as well
 your praise to all posterity to tell

 xiv
 and beside these and others of our day
 who gave you once or give you now renown
 this for yourselves ye may yourselves purvey
 for many laying silk and sampler down
 with the melodious muses to allay
 their thirst at aganippe's well have gone
 and still are going who so fairly speed
 that we more theirs than they our labour need

 xv
 if i of these would separately tell
 and render good account and honour due
 more than one page i with their praise should swell
 nor ought beside would this day's canto shew
 and if on five or six alone i dwell
 i may offend and anger all the crew
 what then shall i resolve to pass all by
 or choose but one from such a company

 xvi
 one will i choose and such will choose that she
 all envy shall so well have overthrown
 no other woman can offend be
 if passing others her i praise alone
 nor joys this one but immortality
 through her sweet style and better know i none
 but who is honoured in her speech and page
 shall burst the tomb and live through every age

 xvii
 as phoebus to his silvery sister shows
 his visage more and lends her brighter fires
 than venus maja or to star that glows
 alone or circles with the heavenly quires
 so he with sweeter eloquence than flows
 from other lips that gentle dame inspires
 and gives her word such force a second sun
 seems in our days its glorious course to run

 xviii
 mid victories born victoria is her name
 well named and whom does she advance or stay
 triumphs and trophies evermore proclaim
 while victory heads or follows her array
 another artemisia is the dame
 renowned for love of her mausolus yea
 by so much greater as it is more brave
 to raise the dead than lay them in the grave

 xix
 if chaste laodamia portia true
 evadne argia arria and many more
 merited praise because that glorious crew
 coveted burial with their lords of yore
 how much more fame is to victoria due
 that from dull lethe and the river's shore
 which nine times hems the ghosts to upper light
 has dragged her lord in death and fate's despite

 xx
 if that loudvoiced maeonian trump whilere
 the macedonian grudged achilles how
 francis pescara o unconquered peer
 would he begrudge thee were he living now
 that wife so virtuous and to thee so dear
 thy wellearned glory through the world should blow
 and that thy name through her should so rebound
 thou needst not crave a clearer trumpet's sound

 xxi
 if all that is to tell and all i fain
 would of that lady tell i wished to unfold
 though long yet not so long would be the stain
 but that large portion would be left untold
 while at a stand the story would remain
 of fierce marphisa and her comrades bold
 to follow whom i promised erst if you
 would but return to hear my song anew

 xxii
 now being here to listen to my say
 because i would not break my promise i
 until my better leisure will delay
 her every praise at length to certify
 not that i think she needs my humble lay
 who with such treasure can herself supply
 but simply to appay my single end
 that gentle dame to honour and commend

 xxiii
 ladies in fine i say that every age
 worthy of story many a dame supplies
 but that through jealous authors' envious rage
 unchronicled by fame each matron dies
 but will no more since in the historic page
 your virtues ye yourselves immortalize
 had those two damsels in this art been read
 their every warlike deed had wider spread

 xxiv
 bradamant and marphisa would i say
 whose bold victorious deeds in battle done
 i strive to bring into the light of day
 but nine in ten remain to me unknown
 i what i know right willingly display
 as well that all fair actions should be shown
 as well that gentle ladies i am bent
 ye whom i love and honour to content

 xxv
 as said in act to go rogero stood
 and having taken leave the cavalier
 withdraws his trenchant faulchion from the wood
 which holds no more the weapon as whilere
 when sounding loud amid that solitude
 a cry not distant far arrests the peer
 then thitherward he with those damsels made
 prompt if 'twere needed to bestow his aid

 xxvi
 they rode anend and louder waxed the sound
 and plainer were the plaintive words they heard
 when in a valley they three women found
 making that plaint who in strange garb appeared
 for to the navel were those three ungowned
  their coats by some uncourteous varlet sheared 
 and knowing not how better to disguise
 their shame they sate on earth and dared not rise

 xxvii
 as vulcan's son that sprang as it is versed
 out of the dust without a mother made
 whom  so minerva bade  aglauros nursed
 with sovereign care too bold and curious maid
 seated in car by him constructed first
 to hide his hideous feet was erst conveyed
 so that which never is to sight revealed
 sitting those mournful damsels kept concealed

 xxviii
 at that dishonest sight and shameful glows
 each martial damsel's visage overspread
 with the rich dyes of paestum's crimson rose
 when vernal airs their gentle influence shed
 bradamant marked them and that one of those
 was ulany the damsel quickly read
 ulany that was sent with solemn train
 from the lost isle to royal charlemagne

 xxix
 and recognised the other two no less
 from them she saw when she saw ulany
 but now to her directed her address
 as the most honoured of those ladies three
 demanding who so full of wickedness
 so lawless was and so unmannerly
 that he those secrets to the sight revealed
 which nature as she could 'twould seem concealed

 xxx
 ulany that in bradamant descried
  known both by voice and ensignry  the maid
 who some few days before those knights of pride
 with her victorious lance on earth had laid
 how in a town not far remote  replied 
 an evil race by pity never swayed
 besides that they their raiment thus had shorn
 had beat them and had done them other scorn

 xxxi
 what of the shield became she cannot say
 nor knows she those three monarchs' destiny
 who guided her so long upon her way
 if killed or led into captivity
 and says that she herself has ta'en her way
 albeit to fare afoot sore irksome be
 to appeal to royal charlemagne assured
 by him such outrage will not be endured

 xxxii
 to hear yet more to see so foul a wrong
 disturbed the child and damsels' placid air
 and beauteous visage whose bold hearts and strong
 no less compassionate than valiant were
 they now all else forgetting ere the tongue
 of ulany prefers demand or prayer
 that they would venge them on their cruel foe
 in haste towards the felon's castle go

 xxxiii
 with one constant the maids and cavalier
 by their great goodness moved from plate and mail
 had stript their upper vests well fitting gear
 those miserable ladies' shame to veil
 bradamant suffers not that as whilere
 sad ulany shall tramp by hill and dale
 but seats her on her horse's croup so do
 her comrades by those other damsels two

 xxxiv
 to gentle bradamant ulania showed
 the nearest way to reach the castle height
 while comfort bradamant on her bestowed
 promising vengeance for that foul despite
 they leave the vale and by a crooked road
 and long ascend now wheeling left now right
 nor till the sun is hidden in the sea
 upon their weary way repose the three

 xxxv
 they to a hamlet on the summit wound
 scaling the mountain's steep and rugged side
 and such good shelter and good supper found
 as could by such rude quarters be supplied
 arriving there they turned their eyes around
 and full of women every place espied
 some old some young nor mid so large a clan
 appeared the visage of a single man

 xxxvi
 not more bold jason wondered and the train
 which sailed with him that argonautic crew
 seeing those dames that had their husbands slain
 fathers and sons and brethren  so that through
 all lemnos' pleasant isle by hill or plain
 of manly visage they beheld not two 
 than here rogero and the rest who go
 with good rogero wonder at this show

 xxxvii
 the martial damsels bid for ulany
 and those who came with her provide attire
 and gowns that eve are furnished for the three
 if meaner than their own at least entire
 to him a woman of that villagery
 valiant rogero summons to inquire
 where are the men in that he none descries
 and thus to him that village wife replies

 xxxviii
 "what haply is to you a wonderment
 this crowd of womankind where man is none
 to us is grave and grievous punishment
 who banished here live wofully alone
 and that such exile us may more torment
 from those so loved as brother father son
 a long divorce and cruel we sustain
 as our fell tyrant pleases to ordain

 xxxix
 "sent to these confines from his land which lies
 but two leagues distant thence where we were born
 us in this place the fell barbarian sties
 having first done us many a brutal scorn
 and has with death and all extremities
 threatened our kinsmen and ourselves forlorn
 if they come hither or he hears report
 we harbour them when hither they resort

 xl
 "he to our name is such a deadly foe
 he will not have us nearer than i shewed
 now have us of our kin approached as though
 infection from the female sex ensued
 already have the greenwood trees laid low
 their leafy honours twice and twice renewed
 since our lord's fury to such pitch arose
 now is there one his phrensy to oppose

 xli
 "for he has spread such passing fear among
 the people death can cause no worse affright
 in that beside his natural love of wrong
 he is endowed with more than human might
 he than a hundred other men more strong
 in body is of a gigantic height
 nor us his vassals he molests alone
 but worse by him to stranger dame is done

 xlii
 "if your own honour sir and of those three
 beneath your charge to you in aught is dear
 'twill safer usefuller and better be
 to leave this road and by another steer
 this leads you to his tower described by me
 to prove the savage use that cruel peer
 has there established to the shame and woe
 of dame or cavalier who thither go

 xliii
 "this castellain or tyrant marganor
 so name the felon knight than whom more fell
 nero was not nor other heretofore
 if other be whose actions fame doth swell
 thirsts for man's blood but thirsts for woman's more
 than wolf for blood of lambs and bids expel
 with shame all females that in evil hour
 their fortune has conducted to his tower"

 xliv
 how in that impious man such fury grew
 asked young rogero and those damsels twain
 and prayed she would in courtesy pursue
 yea rather from the first her tale explain
 "that castle's lord fierce and inhumane
 yet for a while his wicked heart concealed
 nor what he was so suddenly revealed

 xlv
 "for in the lifetime of his sons a pair
 that differed much from the paternal style
 since they the stranger loved and loathers were
 of cruelty and other actions vile
 flourished the courtesies and good customs there
 and there were gentle deeds performed this while
 for albeit avaricious was the sire
 he never crossed the youths in their desire

 xlvi
 "the cavaliers and dames who journeyed by
 that castle there so well were entertained
 that they departed by the courtesy
 of those two kindly brothers wholly gained
 in the holy orders of fair chivalry
 alike the youthful pair had been ordained
 cylander one tanacro hight the other
 bold and of royal mien each martial brother

 xlvii
 "and truly were and would have been alway
 worthy of every praise and fame withal
 had they not yielded up themselves a prey
 to that uncurbed desire which love we call
 by which they were seduced from the right way
 into foul error's crooked maze and all
 the good that by those brethren had been wrought
 waxed in a moment rank corrupt and naught

 xlviii
 "it chanced that in their father's fortilage
 a knight of the greek emperor's court did lie
 with him his lady was of manners sage
 nor fairer could be craved by wishful eye
 for her cylander felt such amorous rage
 he deemed save he enjoyed her he should die
 he deemed that when the lady should depart
 his soul as well would from his body part

 xlix
 "and for he knew 'twas useless to entreat
 devised to make her his by force of hand
 armed and in silence near his father's seat
 where must pass knight and lady took his stand
 through natural daring and through amorous heat
 he with too little thought the matter planned
 so that when he beheld the knight advance
 he issued to assail him lance to lance

 l
 "to overthrow him at first shock he thought
 and to win dame and palm in the career
 but that greek knight in warlike strife welltaught
 shivered like glass his breastplate with the spear
 the bitter tidings to the sire were brought
 who bade bear home the stripling on a bier
 he finding he was dead loud mourning made
 and him in earth beside his fathers layed

 li
 "yet harbourage and welcome as before
 had he who sought it neither more nor less
 because tanacro in his courteous lore
 equalled his brother as in gentleness
 thither that very year from foreign shore
 a baron and his wife their steps address
 a marvel he of valour and as fair
 as could be said is she and debonnair

 lii
 "no fairer was the dame than chaste and right
 and well deserving every praise the peer
 derived of generous stock and bold in fight
 as ever champion of whose fame we hear
 and 'tis well fitting that such valiant wight
 should joy a thing so excellent and dear
 olindro he the lord of lungavilla
 and she his lady wife yclept drusilla

 liii
 "no less for her the young tanacro glows
 than for that other burned cylander sore
 who brought erewhile to sad and bitter close
 the wicked love he to that lady bore
 the holy hospitable laws he chose
 to violate no less than he before
 he would endure that him with venomed sting
 his new desire to cruel death should bring

 liv
 "but he because he has before his eyes
 the example of his elder brother slain
 thinks to bear off the lady in such wise
 that bold olindro cannot venge the stain
 straight spent in him not simply weakened lies
 the virtue wont tancaro to sustain
 above that flood of vice in whose profound
 and miry waters marganor lay drowned

 lv
 "that night he in deep silence bade array
 a score of armed men and next conveyed
 into some caverns bordering on the way
 and distant from the tower his ambuscade
 the roads were broken and the following day
 olindro from all sides was overlaid
 and though he made a brave defence and long
 of wife and life was plundered by that throng

 lvi
 "olindro slain they led his lady fair
 a captive thence o'erwhelmed with sorrow so
 that she refused to live and made her prayer
 tanacro as a grace would death bestow
 resolved to die she leapt in her despair
 from a high bank into a vale below
 but death was to the wretched dame refused
 who lay with shattered head and sorely bruised

 lvii
 "she could not to the castle be conveyed
 in other guise than borne upon a bier
 her so tanacro bids prompt leeches aid
 because he will not lose a prey so dear
 and while to cure drusilla they essayed
 busied about their spousals was the peer
 in that so chaste a lady and so fair
 a wife's and not a leman's name should wear

 lviii
 "he had no other thought no other aim
 no other care nor spake beside of ought
 saw he had wronged her and took all the blame
 and as he could to amend his error wrought
 but all was vain the more he loved the dame
 the more be to appease her anger sought
 so much more was her hate so much more will
 so much more thirst had she that youth to kill

 lix
 "yet hatred blinded not her judgment so
 but what the dame could clearly comprehend
 that she if she would strike the purposed blow
 must feign and secret snares for him extend
 and her desire beneath another show
 which is but how tanacro to offend
 must mask and make him think that overblown
 is her first love and turned to him alone

 lx
 "her face speaks peace while vengeance inwardly
 her heart demands and but to this attends
 she many things revolves accepts puts by
 or as of doubtful issue some suspends
 deeming she can if she resolves to die
 compass her scheme with this resolve she ends
 and better how can she expend her breath
 than in avenging dear olindro's death

 lxi
 "she showed herself all joyful on her part
 and feigned that she desired those nuptials sore
 nor only showed an unreluctant heart
 but all delay and hindrance overbore
 painted and tired above the rest with art
 'twould seem she of her husband thinks no more
 but 'tis her will that in her country's wise
 tanacro shall their wedding solemnize

 lxii
 "the custom howsoever was not true
 which as her country's use she certified
 but because never thought within her grew
 which she could spend on any thing beside
 a falsehood she devised whence hope she drew
 of killing him by whom her husband died
 and told tanacro  and the manner said 
 how in her country's fashion she would wed

 lxiii
 " `the widow that a husband's bed ascends
 ere she approach the bridegroom said that fair
 the spirit of the dead whom she offends
 must soothe with solemn office mass and prayer
 in the holy temple making her amends
 where her first husband's bones entombed are
  that sacrifice performed  to bind their vows
 the nuptial ring the bridegroom gives the spouse

 lxiv
 " `but the holy priest while this shall be about
 upon wine thither for that purpose sped
 his orisons appropriate and devout
 blessing withal the liquor shall have said
 then from the flask into a cup pour out
 and give the blessed wine to them that wed
 but 'tis the spouse's part to take the cup
 and first that vessel's cordial beverage sup'

 lxv
 "the unsuspecting youth who takes no heed
 what nuptials ordered in her wise import
 at her own pleasure bids the dame proceed
 so that she cut his terms of waiting short
 nor does the miserable stripling read
 she would avenge olindro in that sort
 and on one object is so sore intent
 he sees but that on that alone is bent

 lxvi
 "an ancient woman seized with her whilere
 and left withal obeyed drusilla who
 that beldam called and whispered in her ear
 so as that none beside could hear the two 
 a poison of quick power for me prepare
 such as i know thou knowest how to brew
 and bottle it for i have found a way
 the traitorous son of marganor to slay

 lxvii
 " `and me and thee no less can save' she said
 `and this at better leisure will explain'
 the woman went her ways the potion made
 and to the palace bent her steps again
 a flask of candian sweet wine she purveyed
 wherewith drusilla sheathed that deadly bane
 and kept the beverage for the nuptial day
 for now had ceased all hindrance and delay

 lxviii
 "on the fixt day she seeks the temple dight
 with precious jewels and with goodly gear
 where her lord's tomb befitting such a knight
 built by her order two fair pillars rear
 the holy office there with solemn rite
 is sung which men and women troop to hear
 and  gay beyond his usage  with his heir
 begirt by friends sir marganor is there

 lxix
 "when the holy obsequies at last were o'er
 and by the priest was blest the poisoned draught
 he into a fair golden cup did pour
 the wine as by drusilla had been taught
 she drank what sorted with her sex nor more
 than would effect the purpose which she sought
 then to the bridegroom with a jocund eye
 handed the draught who drained the goblet dry

 lxx
 "the cup returned  tanacro blithe and gay
 opened his arms drusilla to embrace
 then altered was her sweet and winning way
 and to a tempest that long calm gave place
 she thrust him back she motioned him away
 she seemed to kindle in her eyes and face
 and to the youth with broken voice and dread
  `traitor stand off'  the furious lady said 

 lxxi
 " `shalt thou then joy and solace have from me
 i tears from thee and punishment and woe
 now these mine hands shall make an end of thee
 this if thou know'st it not for poison know
 much grieve i that thou should'st too honoured be
 by the executioner who deals the blow
 should'st die a death too easy since i wot
 for thee too shameful hand or pain is not

 lxxii
 " `in seeing this thy death it gives me pain
 my sacrifice should be completed ill
 for could i do by thee as i were fain
 nothing should lack that purpose to fulfill
 may my sweet consort not the work disdain
 and for the imperfect deed accept the will
 that without power to compass what i would
 i have been fain to slay thee as i could

 lxxiii
 " `and that deserved punishment which i
 cannot as i desire on thee bestow
 i hope thy soul shall have hope to be nigh
 to see thee suffer in the realms of woe'
 her turbid eyes then raising to the sky
 with joyous face all over in a glow
 she cried `olindro take this victim's life
 with the good will of thine avenging wife

 lxxiv
 " `and of our lord for me the grace obtain
 to be this day in paradise with thee
 if he reply none cometh to your reign
 without desert say such i bring with me
 who this fell impious monster in his fane
 offer as my firstfruits and what can be
 a greater merit than to have supprest
 such loathsome and abominable pest'

 lxxv
 "her life together with her speech was spent
 and even dead her face appeared to glow
 with joy at having dealt such punishment
 to him that laid her cherished husband low
 if fierce tanacro's spirit did prevent
 of follow hers i wiss not but i trow
 prevented for on him that venom rank
 yet faster wrought because he deeper drank

 lxxvi
 "marganor who beheld his only son
 fall and expire his outstretched arms between
 well nigh had with tanacro died o'erthrown
 by that so sudden grief and unforeseen
 two sons he had and now was left alone
 brought to that pass he by two wives had been
 this was the cause one spent his vital breath
 with her own hand that dealt the other death

 lxxvii
 "love pity sorrow anger and desire
 of death and vengeance all together rend
 and rack the childless and unhappy sire
 who groans like sea when wind and waves contend
 towards the dame with vengeful thoughts afire
 he goes but sees that life is at an end
 and goaded by his rage and hatred hot
 seeks to offend her corse that feels it not

 lxxviii
 "as serpent by the pointed spear pinned down
 fixes his teeth in it with fruitless spire
 or as the mastiff runs towards a stone
 which has been flung by some wayfaring wight
 and gnaws it in his rage nor will be gone
 until he venge himself 'tis so the knight
 than any mastiff any serpent worse
 offends drusilla's cold and lifeless corse

 lxxix
 "and for he venteth not nor slakes his mood
 by foul abuse upon the carcase done
 among the women a large multitude
 he springs and there shows mercy unto none
 mown are we with his impious sword as strewed
 is grass with scythe when dried by summer sun
 there is no 'scape for straightways of our train
 are full a hundred maimed and thirty slain

 lxxx
 "he of his vassals is so held in dread
 there is no man who dares to lift his eyes
 the women with the meaner sort are fled
 and whosoever can the temple flies
 his friends against the furious fit make head
 at last with kind constraint and suppliant cries
 and leaving every thing in tears below
 him in his castle on the rock bestow

 lxxxi
 "his wrath enduring still to send away
 the wretch determines all the female band
 in that his will us utterly to slay
 his people and his friends with prayer withstand
 and he bids punish on that very day
 an order for us all to leave his land
 placed such his pleasures on these confines woe
 to them that nearer to his castle go

 lxxxii
 "thus husbands from their wives divided are
 mothers from sons if hither to resort
 despite that order any one should dare
 let none know this who might the deed report
 for sorely mulcted for the transgression were
 many and many slain in cruel sort
 a statute for his town next made the peer
 of fouler law we neither read nor hear

 lxxxiii
 "it wills all women found within the vale
 for thither even yet will some descend
 his men with rods shall on the shoulders whale
 and into exile from those countries send
 but first their gowns shall clip and parts unveil
 that decency and natural shame offend
 and if with escort of an armed knight
 any wend thither they are slain outright

 lxxxiv
 "those that an armed warrior's escort have
 by this ill man to piety a foe
 are dragged as victims to his children's grave
 where his own hand inflicts the murderous blow
 stript ignominiously of armour glaive
 and steed their champions to his prisons go
 and this can he compel for night and day
 a thousand men the tyrant's hest obey

 lxxxv
 "and i will add moreover 'tis his will
 does he free any one he first shall swear
 upon the holy wafer that he still
 to woman while he lives will hatred bear
 if then these ladies and yourself to spill
 seem good to you to yonder walls repair
 and put to proof withal if prowess more
 or cruelty prevails in marganor"

 lxxxvi
 so saying in those maids of martial might
 first she such pity moved and then disdain
 that they had it been day instead of night
 would then have gone against that castellain
 there rest the troop and when aurora's light
 serves as a signal to the starry train
 that they should all before the sun recede
 they don the cuirass and remount the steed

 lxxxvii
 and now in act to go that company
 behind them hear the stony road resound
 with a long trample when those warlike three
 look down the vale and roll their eyes around
 and they from thence a stone'sthrow distant see
 a troop which through a narrow pathway wound
 a score they are perhaps in number who
 on horseback or on foot their way pursue

 lxxxviii
 they with them on a horse a woman haul
 whom stricken sore in years her visage shows
 in guise wherein some doleful criminal
 condemned to gallows fire or prison goes
 who notwithstanding that wide interval
 is by her features known as well as clothes
 they of the village mid the cavalcade
 know her for fair drusilla's chamber maid

 lxxxix
 the chamber wench made prisoner with his prize
 by the rapacious stripling as i shewed
 who being trusted with that ill emprize
 the poisoned draught of foul effect had brewed
 from the others she and those solemnites
 had kept away suspecting what ensued
 yea this while from that lordship had she fled
 where she in safety hoped to hide her head

 xc
 news being after to her foeman brought
 that she retired in ostericche lay
 he with intent to burn the woman sought
 to have her in his power by every way
 and finally unhappy avarice bought
 by costly presents and by proffered pay
 wrought on a lord assured upon whose lands
 the beldam lived to put her in his hands

 xci
 he on a sumpter horse the prisoner sent
 to constancetown like merchandise addrest
 fastened and bound in manner to prevent
 the use of speech and prisoned in a chest
 from whence that rabble his ill instrument
 who has all pity banished from his breast
 had hither brought her that his impious rage
 that cruel man might on the hag assuage

 xcii
 as the flood swoln with vesulo's thick snows
 the farther that it foams upon its way
 and with ticino and lambra seaward goes
 ada and other streams that tribute pay
 so much more haughty and impetuous flows
 rogero so the more he hears display
 marganor's guilt and so that gentle pair
 of damsels filled with fiercer choler are

 xciii
 them with such hatred them with such disdain
 against the wretch so many crimes incense
 that they will punish him despite the train
 or armed men arraid in his defence
 but speedy death appears too kind a pain
 and insufficient for such foul offence
 better they deem mid pangs prolonged and slow
 he all the bitterness of death should know

 xciv
 but first 'tis right that woman to unchain
 she whom the hangmancrew to death escort
 and the quick rowel and the loosened rein
 made the quick coursers make that labour short
 never had those assaulted to sustain
 encounter of so fell and fierce a sort
 who held it for a grace with loss of shield
 harness and captive dame to quit the field

 xcv
 even as the wolf who laden with his prey
 is homeward to his secret cavern bound
 and when he deems that safest is the way
 beholds it crost by hunter and by hound
 flings down his load and swiftly darts away
 where most o'ergrown with brushwood is the ground
 nor quicker are that band to void the vale
 than those bold three are quicker to assail

 xcvi
 not only they the dame and martial gear
 but many horses they as well forsook
 and as the surest refuge in their fear
 cast themselves down from bank and caverned nook
 which pleased the damsels and the youthful peer
 who three of those forsaken horses took
 to mount those three whom through the day before
 upon their croups the three good coursers bore

 xcvii
 thence lightened thus their way they thither bend
 where that despiteous shameful lordship lies
 resolved the beldam in their band shall wend
 to see drusilla venged in vain denies
 that woman who misdoubts the adventure's end
 and grieves and shrieks and weeps in piteous wise
 for flinging her upon frontino's croup
 rogero bears her off amid the troop

 xcviii
 they reached a summit and from thence espied
 a town with many houses large and rich
 with nought to stop the way on any side
 as neither compassed round by wall or ditch
 a rock was in the middle fortified
 with a tall tower upon its topmost pitch
 fearlessly thither pricked the warriors who
 marganor's mansion in that fortress knew

 xcix
 as soon as in the town that cavalcade
 arrived some footmen who kept watch and ward
 behind those warriors closed a barricade
 while that before they found already barred
 and lo sir marganor with men arraid
 some foot some horsemen armed was all the guard
 who to the strangers in few words but bold
 the wicked custom of his lordship told

 c
 marphisa who had planned the thing whilere
 with aymon's daughter and the youthful knight
 for answer spurred against the cavalier
 and valiant as she was and full of might
 not putting in the rest her puissant spear
 or baring that good sword so famed in fight
 so smote him with her fist upon the head
 that on his horse's neck he fell half dead

 ci
 the maid of france is with marphisa gone
 nor in the rear it seen rogero's crest
 who with those two his course so bravely run
 that though his lance he raised not from the rest
 six men he slew transfixed the paunch of one
 another's head of four the neck or breast
 i' the sixth he broke it whom in flight he speared
 it pierced his spine and at his paps appeared

 cii
 as many as are touched so many lie
 on earth by bradamant's gold lance o'erthrown
 she seems a bolt dismist form burning sky
 which in its fury shivers and beats down
 whatever it encounters far and nigh
 some fly to plain or castle from the town
 others to sheltering church and house repair
 and none save dead are seen in street or square

 ciii
 meanwhile the hands of marganor behind
 his back the fierce marphisa had made fast
 and to drusilla's maid the wretch consigned
 well pleased that such a care on her was cast
 to burn the town 'twas afterwards designed
 save it repented of its errors past
 repealed the statute marganor had made
 and a new law imposed by her obeyed

 civ
 such end to compass is no hard assay
 for besides fearing lest marphisa yearn
 to execute more vengeance  lest she say
  she one and all will slaughter and will burn 
 the townsmen all were advised to the sway
 and cruel statute of that tyrant stern
 but did as others mostly do that best
 obey the master whom they most detest

 cv
 since none dares trust another nor his will
  out of suspicion  to his comrades break
 they let him banish one another kill
 from this his substance that his honour take
 but the heart cries to heaven that here is still
 till god and saints at length to vengeance wake
 who albeit they due punishment suspend
 by mighty pain the long delay amend

 cvi
 the rabble full of rage and enmity
 now seeks the wretch with word and deed to grieve
 as it is said all strip the fallen tree
 which from its roots and wintry winds upheave
 let rulers in his sad example see
 ill doers in the end shall ill receive
 to view fell marganor's disastrous fall
 fit penance for his sins pleased great and small

 cvii
 many of whom the sister had been slain
 the mother or the daughter or the wife
 seeking no more their rebel wrath to rein
 hurry with their own hands to take his life
 and young rogero and the damsels twain
 can scarce defend the felon in that strife
 whom those illustrious three had doomed to die
 mid trouble fear and lengthened agony

 cviii
 to the hag who bore such hatred to that wight
 as woman to an enemy can bear
 they give their prisoner naked bound so tight
 he will not at one shake the cordage tear
 and she her pains and sorrow to requite
 crimsons the wretch's body here and there
 with a sharp goad which mid that village band
 a peasant churl had put into her hand

 cix
 nor she the courier maid nor they that ride
 with her aye mindful how they had been shent
 now let their hands hang idle by their side
 no less than that old crone on vengeance bent
 such was their fierce desire it nullified
 the power to harm but rage must have its vent
 him one with stones another with her nails
 this with her teeth with needles that assails

 cx
 as torrent one while foams in haughty tide
 when fed with mighty rain or melted snow
 and rending form the mountain's rugged side
 tree rock and crop and field the waters go
 then comes a season when its crested pride
 is vanished and its vigour wasted so
 a child a woman everywhere may tread
 and often dryshod cross its rugged bed

 cxi
 so marganor whilere each bound and bourn
 made tremble whereso'er his name was heard
 now one is come to bruise the tyrant's horn
 and now his prowess is so little feared
 that even the little children work him scorn
 some pluck his hair and others pluck his beard
 thence young rogero and the damsels twain
 towards his rockbuilt castle turn the rein

 cxii
 this without contest its possessors yield
 and the rich goods preserved in that repair
 these the friends partly spoiled and partly dealed
 to ulany and that attendant pair
 with them recovered was the golden shield
 and those three monarchs that were prisoned there
 who without arms afoot towards that hold
 had wended as meseems whilere was told

 cxiii
 for from the day that they were overthrown
 by bradamant afoot they evermore
 unarmed in company with her had gone
 that hither came from her so distant shore
 i know not i if it was better done
 or worse by her that they their arms forbore
 worse touching her defence but better far
 if they were losers in the doubtful war

 cxiv
 for she would have been dragged  like others whom
 armed men had thither brought beneath their guide
 unhappy women to the brothers' tomb 
 and by the sacrifice knife have died
 death sure is worse and more disastrous doom
 than showing that which modesty would hide
 and they who can to force ascribe the blame
 extinguish this and every other shame

 cxv
 before they hence depart the martial twain
 assemble the inhabitants to swear
 they to their wives the rule of that domain
 will leave as well as every other care
 and that they will chastise with heavy pain
 whoever to oppose this law shall dare
  in fine man's privileges whatsoe'er
 they swear shall be conferred on woman here

 cxvi
 then make them promise never to bestow
 harbourage on whosoever thither sped
 footman or cavalier nor even allow
 any beneath a roof to hide his head
 unless he swore by god and saints or vow
 yet stronger made  if stronger could be said 
 that he the sex's cause would aye defend
 foe to their foes and woman's faithful friend

 cxvii
 and if he then were wived or ever were
  sooner or later  linked in nuptial noose
 still to his wife he would allegiance bear
 nor e'er compliance with her will refuse
 marphisa says within the year she there
 will be and ere the trees their foliage lose
 and save she find her statute in effect
 that borough fire and ruin may expect

 cxviii
 nor hence they part ill from the filthy place
 wherein it lay drusilla's corse is borne
 her with her lord they in a tomb encase
 and with what means the town supplies adorn
 drusilla's ancient woman in this space
 marganor's body with her goad has torn
 who only grieves she has not wind enow
 no respite to his torture to allow

 cxix
 beside a church the martial damsels twain
 behold a pillar standing in the square
 whereon the wicked lord of the domain
 had graved that mad and cruel law the pair
 in imitation his helm plate and chain
 and shield in guise of trophy fasten there
 and afterwards upon the pillar trace
 that law they had enacted for the place

 cxx
 within the town the troop set up their rest
 until the law is graved of different frame
 from that before upon the stone imprest
 which every woman doom'd to death and shame
 with the intention to replace her vest
 here from that band divides the islandick dame
 who deems at court 'twere shameful to appear
 unless adorned and mantled as whilere

 cxxi
 here ulany remained and in her power
 remained the wicked tyrant marganor
 she lest he any how in evil hour
 should break his bonds and injure damsel more
 made him one day leap headlong from a tower
 who never took so still a leap before
 no more of her and hers i of the crew
 that journey toward arles the tale pursue

 cxxii
 throughout all that and the succeeding day
 till the forenoon proceed those banded friends
 and where the mainroad branches and one way
 towards the camp to arles the other tends
 again embrace the lovers and oft say
 a last farewell which evermore offends
 the damsels seek the camp to arles is gone
 rogero and my canto i have done


 canto 38

 argument
 to arles the child to charles marphisa wends
 to be baptized with bradamant for guide
 astolpho from the holy realm descends
 through whom with sight the nubian is supplied
 agramant's land he with his troop offends
 but he is of his africk realm so wide
 with charles he bargains that on either side
 two knights by strife their quarrel should decide


 i
 ye courteous ladies who unto my strain
 kind audience lend  i read it in your cheer 
 that good rogero should depart again
 so suddenly from her that held him dear
 displeases ye and scarce inflicts less pain
 than that which bradamant endured whilere
 i read you also argue to his shame
 that feebly burned in him the amorous flame

 ii
 if from her side for other cause had gone
 against that lady's will the youthful lord
 though in the hope more treasure to have won
 than swelled rich croesus' or rich crassus' hoard
 i too should deem the dart by cupid thrown
 had not the heartcore of rogero gored
 for such a sovereign joy a prize so high
 no silver and no gold could ever buy

 iii
 yet to preserve our honour not alone
 deserves excuse it also merits praise
 this to preserve i say when to have done
 in other wise might shame and scandal raise
 and had fair bradamant reluctance shown
 and obstinately interposed delays
 this as a certain sign had served to prove
 that lady's little wit or little love

 iv
 for if his life whom gentle woman loves
 as her own life she values or before
 i speak of one at whom young cupid roves
 with arrows which beneath the mantle gore
 his honour to his pleasure it behoves
 that woman to prefer by so much more
 as man beyond his life his honour treasures
 esteemed by him above all other pleasures

 v
 his duty good rogero satisfied
 following the royal lord with whom he came
 for having no fair cause to quit his side
 he could not leave the paynim without shame
 and if his sire had by almontes died
 in this king agramant was not to blame
 who for his parents' every past offence
 had made rogero mighty recompense

 vi
 he will perform his duty to repair
 to his liegelord so did that martial maid
 who had not with reiterated prayer
 as so she might have done rogero stayed
 the stripling may appay the warlike fair
 in other season if not now appaid
 but twice two hundred years will not atone
 the crying sin of honour once foregone

 vii
 to arlestown whither had his king conveyed
 his remnant of a host he pricked anew
 while they that since their kindred was displayed
 had a close friendship formed  the damsels two 
 thither together go where charles had made
 his mightiest effort with the christian crew
 hoping by siege or fight to break the foe
 and free his kingdom form so long a woe

 viii
 bradamant when she in the camp appeared
 was greeted with a welcome warm and kind
 on all sides was she hailed by all was cheered
 and she in this or that her head inclined
 rinaldo when he of her coming heard
 met her nor young richardo stayed behind
 nor richardet nor others of her race
 and all received the maid with joyful face

 ix
 when next 'tis known the second of the twain
 is that marphisa so in arms renowned
 who from catay unto the bounds of spain
 had journeyed with a thousand laurels crowned
 nor rich nor poor within their tents remain
 the curious crowd encompassing them round
 press harm and heave each other here and there
 in the sole wish to see so bright a pair

 x
 by them was charles saluted reverently
 and the first day was this has turpin shown
 marphisa had been seen to bend her knee
 for pepin's royal son to her alone
 deserving of such duty seemed to be
 mid emperors or kings that filled a throne
 baptized or infidel of all those named
 for mighty riches or for valour famed

 xi
 her kindly charlemagne received and wide
 of the pavilions met in open view
 and above king and prince and peer beside
 himself the monarch placed that damsel true
 who go not are dismist so none abide
 in little time except the good and few
 the paladins and lords remain without
 is left the unrespected rabblerout

 xii
 marphisa first began in grateful strain
 "unconquered caesar glorious and august
 who to alcides' strait from indian main
 mak'st scythian's pale and aethiop's race adust
 revere thy christian cross of snowy grain
  of earthly monarchs thou most sage and just 
 hither thy glory which no limits bound
 has brought me from the world's extremest ground

 xiii
 "and to avow the truth in jealous mood
 alone i came alone with thee to fight
 because i grudged that king so puissant shou'd
 exist on earth save he observed my rite
 hence reek they ravaged fields with christian blood
 and yet with greater rancour and despite
 like cruel foe i purposed to offend
 but that it chanced one changed me to a friend

 xiv
 "when to worst harm and scaith thy bands i doom
 i find as at my leisure i will show
 rogero of risa was my father whom
 an evil brother traitorously laid low
 me my sad mother carried in her womb
 beyond the sea and bore in want and woe
 till my seventh year by wizard nourished i
 was stolen from him by thieves of araby

 xv
 "they to a king in persia vended me
 that after died beneath my faulchion who
 would fain have taken my virginity
 when grown that king and all his court i slew
 chased his ill race and seized his royalty
 and  such my fortune  by a month or two
 i eithteen years had not o'erpast before
 i added to my realm six kingdoms more

 xvi
 "and moved by envy of thy glorious fame
 i in my heart resolved as thou hast heard
 to abate the grandeur of they mighty name
 i haply so had done i haply erred
 but now a chance has served that will to tame
 and clip my fury's wings the having heard
 since i arrived in christendom how we
 are bound by ties of consanguinity

 xvii
 "and for my father thee as kinsman served
 so thou a kin and servant hast in me
 and i that envy that fierce hate which nerved
 mine arm whilere now blot from memory
 nay these for evil agramant reserved
 and for his sire's and uncle's kin shall be
 they who were whilom guilty of the death
 of that unhappy pair who gave me breath"

 xviii
 she adds the christian faith she will receive
 and after having spent king agramant
 will home return with royal charles's leave
 her kingdom to baptize in the levant
 and war upon whatever nation cleave
 to cheating mahound or to termagant
 promising that whate'er her arms obtain
 shall be the christian faith's and empire's gain

 xix
 charles no less eloquent upon his side
 than bold in deed and prudent in design
 much that illustrious lady magnified
 and much her father much her noble line
 he courteously to every point replied
 and of his heart his open front was sign
 as his last words that he received the maid
 as kinswoman and child the monarch said

 xx
 then rose and locked her in a new embrace
 and kissed her like a daughter on the brow
 morgana and clermont's kin with joyful face
 all thither troop 'twere tedious to tell how
 rinaldo did the gentle damsel grace
 for he had oftentimes espied ere now
 her martial prowess tried by goodly test
 when they with girding siege albracca pressed

 xxi
 'twere long to tell how with those worthies met
 guido rejoiced to see marphisa there
 gryphon and aquilant and sansonet
 that with her in the cruel city were
 vivian and malagigi and richardet
 who when maganza's traitors made repair
 with those ill purchasers of spain to trade
 found such a faithful comrade in the maid

 xxii
 they deck the ground for the ensuing day
 and charlemagne takes care himself to see
 that they the place shall sumptuously array
 wherein marphisa's baptism is to be
 bishops are gathered learned clerks and they
 who ken the laws of christianity
 that taught in all its doctrine by their care
 and holy skill may be that martial fair

 xxiii
 in sacred stole pontifical arraid
 her the archbishop turpin did baptize
 charlemagne from the healthful font the maid
 uplifted with befitting ceremonies
 but it is time the witless head to aid
 with that which treasured in the phial lies
 wherewith astolpho from the lowest star
 descended in elias' fiery car

 xxiv
 the duke descended from the lucid round
 on this our earthly planet's loftiest height
 wither he with that blessed vase was bound
 which was the mighty champion's brain to right
 a herb of sovereign virtue on that ground
 the apostle shows and with it bids the knight
 the nubian's eyeballs touch when him anew
 he visits and restore that sovereign's view

 xxv
 that he for this and for his first desert
 may give him bands biserta to assail
 and shows him how that people inexpert
 he may to battle train in plate and mail
 and how to pass the deserts without hurt
 where men are dazzled by the sandy gale
 the order that throughout should be maintained
 from point to point the sainted sire explained

 xxvi
 then made him that plumed beast again bestride
 rogero's and atlantes' steed whilere
 by sainted john dismist his reverend guide
 those holy regions left the cavalier
 and coasting nile on one or the other side
 saw nubia's realm before him soon appear
 and there in its chief city to the ground
 descended and anew senapus found

 xxvii
 great was the joy and great was the delight
 wherewith that king received the english lord
 who well remembered how the gentle knight
 had from the loathsome harpies freed his board
 but when the humour that obscured his sight
 valiant astolpho scaled and now restored
 was the blind sovereign's eyesight as before
 he would that warrior as a god adore

 xxviii
 so that not only those whom he demands
 for the bisertine war he gives in aid
 but adds a hundred thousand from his bands
 and offer of his royal person made
 scarce on the open plain embattled stands
  all foot  the nubian host for war arraid
 for few the horses which that region bore
 of elephants and camels a large store

 xxix
 the night before the day when on its road
 the nubian force should march astolpho rose
 and his winged hippogryph again bestrode
 then hurrying ever south in fury goes
 to a high hill the southern wind's abode
 whence he towards the bears in fury blows
 there finds a cave through whose strait entrance breaks
 the fell and furious auster when he wakes

 xxx
 he as his master erst instruction gave
 with him an empty bladder had conveyed
 which at the vent of that dim alpine cave
 wherein reposed the wearied wind was laid
 quaintly and softly by the baron brave
 and so unlooked for was the ambuscade
 that issuing forth at morn to sweep the plains
 auster imprisoned in the skin remains

 xxxi
 to nubia he rejoicing in his prey
 returns and with that very light the peer
 with the black host sets out upon his way
 and lets the victual follow in his rear
 towards mount atlas with his whole array
 in safety goes the glorious cavalier
 through shifting plains of powdery sand he past
 nor dreaded danger from the sultry blast

 xxxii
 and having gained the mountain's hither side
 whence are discerned the plain and distant brine
 he chooses from the swarm he has to guide
 the noblest and most fit for discipline
 and makes them here and there in troops divide
 at a hill's foot wherewith the plains confine
 then leaves his host and climbs the hill's ascent
 like one that is on lofty thoughts intent

 xxxiii
 after he lowly kneeling in the dust
 his holy master had implored in true
 assurance he was heard he downward thrust
 a heap of stones o what things may he do
 that in the saviour wholly puts his trust
 the stones beyond the use of nature grew
 which rolling to the sandy plain below
 next neck and muzzle legs and belly show

 xxxiv
 they neighing shrill down narrow paths repair
 with lusty leaps and lighting on the plain
 uplift the croup like coursers as they are
 some bay some roan and some of dapple stain
 the crowds that waiting in the valleys were
 layed hands on them and seized them by the rein
 thus in a thought each soldier had his horse
 born ready reined and saddled for the course

 xxxv
 he fourscore thousand of his nubian power
 one hundred and two footmen in a day
 to horsemen changes who wide afric scour
 and upon every side sack burn and slay
 agramant had intrusted town and tower
 till his return to king branzardo's sway
 to fersa's king and him of the algaziers
 and these against astolpho lead their spears

 xxxvi
 erewhile a nimble bark with sail and oar
 they had dispatched which stirring feet and wings
 news of the nubian monarch's outrage bore
 to agramant from his vicegerent kings
 that rests not night nor day till to the shore
 of provence she her doleful tiding brings
 and finds her monarch half subdued in arles
 for camped within a mile was conquering charles

 xxxvii
 agramant hearing in what peril lies
 his realm through his attack on pepin's reign
 him in this pressing peril to advise
 calls kings and princes of the paynim train
 and when he once or twice has turned his eyes
 on sage sobrino and the king of spain
  eldest and wisest they those lords among 
 the monarch so bespeaks the assembled throng

 xxxviii
 "albeit if fits not captain as i know
 to say `on this i thought not' this i say
 because when from a quarter comes the blow
 from every human forethought far away
 'tis for such fault a fair excuse i trow
 and here all hinges i did ill to lay
 unfurnished africk open to attack
 if there was ground to fear the nubian sack

 xxxix
 "but who could think save only god on high
 prescient of all which is to be below
 that from land beneath such distant sky
 such mighty host would come to work us woe
 'twixt shifting sands which restless whirlwinds blow
 yet they their camp have round biserta placed
 and laid the better part of africk waste

 xl
 "i now on this o peers your counsel crave
 if bootless homeward i should wend my way
 or should not such a fair adventure wave
 till charles with me a prisoner i convey
 or how i may as well our africk save
 and ruin this redoubted empire say
 who can advise is prayed his lore to shew
 that we may learn the best and that pursue"

 xli
 he said and on marsilius seated nigh
 next turned his eyes who in the signal read
 that it belonged to him to make reply
 to what the king of africa had said
 the spaniard rose and bending reverently
 to agramant the knee as well as head
 again his honoured seat in council prest
 and in these words the moorish king addrest

 xlii
 "my liege does rumour good or ill report
 it still increases them hence shall i ne'er
 under despondence lack for due support
 nor bolder course than is befitting steer
 for what may chance of good or evil sort
 weighing in even balance hope and fear
 o'errated still and which we should not mete
 by what i hear so many tongues repeat

 xliii
 "which should so much more doubtfully be viewed
 as it seems less with likelihood to stand
 now it is seen if there be likelihood
 that king who reigns in so remote a land
 followed by such a mighty multitude
 should set his foot on warlike africk's strand
 traversing sands to which in evil hour
 cambyses trusted his illomened power

 xliv
 "i well believe that from some neighbouring hill
 the arabs have poured down to waste the plain
 who for the country was defended ill
 have taken burnt destroyed and sacked and slain
 and that branzardo who your place doth fill
 as viceroy and lieutenant of the reign
 has set down thousands where he tens should write
 the better to excuse him in your sight

 xlv
 "the nubian squadrons i will even yield
 have been rained down on africk from the skies
 or haply they have come in clouds concealed
 in that their march was hidden from all eyes
 think you because unaided in the field
 your africk from such host in peril lies
 your garrisons were sure of coward vein
 if they were scared by such a craven train

 xlvi
 "but will you send some frigates albeit few
 provided that unfurled your standards be
 no sooner shall they loose from hence that crew
 of spoilers shall within their confines flee
  nubians are they or idle arabs  who
 knowing that you are severed by the sea
 from your own realm and warring with our band
 have taken courage to assail your land

 xlvii
 "now take your time for vengeance when the son
 of pepin is without his nephew's aid
 since bold orlando is away by none
 of the hostile sect resistance can be made
 if through neglect or blindness be foregone
 the glorious fortune which for you has stayed
 she her bald front as now her hair will show
 to our long infamy and mighty woe"

 xlviii
 thus warily the spanish king replied
 proving by this and other argument
 the moorish squadrons should in france abide
 till charlemagne was into exile sent
 but king sobrino he that plainly spied
 the scope whereon marsilius was intent
 to public good preferring private gain
 so spake in answer to the king of spain

 xlix
 "my liege when i to peace exhorted you
 would that my prophecy had proved less just
 of if i was to prove a prophet true
 ye in sobrino had reposed more trust
 than in king rodomont and in that crew
 alzirdo martasine and marbalust
 whom i would here see gladly front to front
 but see most gladly boastful rodomont

 l
 "to twit that warrior with his threat to do
 by france what by the brittle glass is done
 and throughout heaven and hell your course pursue
 yea as the monarch said your course outrun
 yet lapt in foul and loathsome ease while you
 so need his help lies ulien's lazy son
 and i that as a coward was decried
 for my true prophecy am at your side

 li
 "and ever will be while this life i bear
 which albeit 'tis with yours sore laden still
 daily for you is risked with them that are
 the best of france and  be he who he will 
 there is not mortal living who will dare
 to say sobrino's deeds were ever ill
 yea many who vaunt more amid your host
 have not so much nay lighter cause for boast

 lii
 "i speak these words to show that what whilere
 i said and say again has neither sprung
 from evil heart nor is the fruit of fear
 but that true love and duty move my tongue
 you homeward with what haste you may to steer
 i counsel your assembled bands among
 for little is the wisdom of that wight
 who risks his own to gain another's right

 liii
 "if there be gain ye know late thirtytwo
 your vassal kings with you our sails we spread
 now if we pause to sum the account anew
 hardly a third survives the rest are dead
 may it please heaven no further loss ensue
 but if you will pursue your quest i dread
 lest not a fourth nor fifth will soon remain
 and wholly spent will be your wretched train

 liv
 "orlando's absence so far aids that where
 our troops are few there haply none would be
 but not through this removed our perils are
 though it prolongs our evil destiny
 behold rinaldo whom his deeds declare
 no less than bold orlando of his tree
 there are the shoots with paladin and peer
 our baffled saracens' eternal fear

 lv
 "and the other mars albeit against my heart
 it goes to waste my praise upon a foe
 i speak of the redoubted brandimart
 whose feats no less than fierce orlando's show
 whose mighty prowess i have proved in part
 in part at others' cost i see and know
 then many days orlando has been gone
 yet we have lost more fields than we have won

 lvi
 "i fear if heretofore our band has lost
 a heavier forfeit will henceforth be paid
 blotted is mandricardo from our host
 martial gradasso hath withdrawn his aid
 marphisa at our worst has left her post
 so argier's lord of whom it may be said
 where he as true as strong we should not need
 gradasso and the tartar king to speed

 lvii
 "while aids like these are lost to our array
 while on our side such slaughtered thousands lie
 those lookedfor are arrived nor on her way
 is any vessel fraught with new supply 
 charles has been joined by four that as they say
 might with orlando or rinaldo vie
 with reasons for from hence to bactrian shore
 ill would you hope to find such other four

 lviii
 "i know not if you know who guido are
 sansonet and the sons of olivier
 for these i more respect more fear i bear
 than any warlike duke or cavalier
 of almayn's or of other lineage fair
 who for the roman empire rests the spear
 though i misrate not those of newer stamp
 that to our scathe are gathered in their camp

 lix
 "as often as ye issue on the plain
 worsted so oft or broken shall you be
 if oft united africa and spain
 were losers when sixteen to eight were we
 what will ensue when banded with almayn
 are england scotland france and italy
 when with our six twice six their weapons cross
 what else can we expect but shame and loss

 lx
 "you lose your people here and there your reign
 if you in this emprize are obstinate
  returning  us the remnant of your train
 you save together with your royal state
 it were ill done to leave the king of spain
 since all for this would hold you sore ingrate
 yet there's a remedy in peace which so
 it pleases but yourself will please the foe

 lxi
 "but if as first defeated on your part
 it seems a shame to offer peace and ye
 have war and wasteful battle more at heart
 waged hitherto with what success you see
 at least to gain the victory use art
 which may be yours if you are ruled by me
 lay all our quarrel's trial on one peer
 and let rogero be that cavalier

 lxii
 "such our rogero is ye know and i
 that  pitted one to one in listed fight 
 not roland not rinaldo stands more high
 nor whatsoever other christian knight
 but would ye kindle warfare far and nigh
 though superhuman be that champion's might
 the warrior is but one mid many spears
 matched singly with a host of martial peers

 lxiii
 "meseemeth if to you it seemeth good
 ye should propose to charles the war to end
 and that to spare the constant waste of blood
 which his and countless of your warriors spend
 he  by a knight of yours to be withstood 
 a champion chosen from his best should send
 and those two all the warfare wage alone
 till one prevails and one is overthrown

 lxiv
 "on pact the king whose champion in the just
 is loser tribute to that other pay
 nor will this pact displease king charles i trust
 though his was the advantage in the fray
 then of his arms rogero so robust
 i deem that he will surely win the day
 who would prevail so certain is our right
 though mars himself should be his opposite"

 lxv
 with these and other sayings yet more sound
 so wrought sobrino he his end obtained
 and on that day interpreters were found
 and they that day to charles their charge explained
 charles whom such matchless cavaliers surround
 believes the battle is already gained
 and chooses good rinaldo for the just
 next to orlando in his sovereign's trust

 lxvi
 in this accord like cause for pleasure find
 as well the christian as the paynim foe
 for harassed sore in body and in mind
 those warriors all were weary all were woe
 each in repose and quietude designed
 to pass what time remained to him below
 each cursed the senseless anger and the hate
 which stirred their hearts to discord and debate

 lxvii
 rinaldo felt himself much magnified
 that charles for what in him so strong weighed
 more trusted him than all his court beside
 and glad the honoured enterprise assayed
 rogero he esteemed not in his pride
 and thought he ill could keep him from his blade
 nor deemed the child could equal him in fight
 albeit he slew in strife the tartar knight

 lxviii
 rogero though much honoured on his part
 that him his king has chosen from the rest
 to whom a trust so weighty to impart
 as of his many martial lords the best
 yet shows a troubled face not that the heart
 of that good knight unworthy fears molest
 not only none rinaldo would have bred
 him with orlando leagued he would not dread 

 lxix
 but because sister of the christian knight
 he knows is she his consort true and dear
 that to the stripling evermore did write
 as one sore injured by that cavalier
 now if to ancient sins he should unite
 a mortal combat with montalban's peer
 her although loving will he anger so
 not lightly she her hatred will forego

 lxx
 if silently rogero made lament
 that he in his despite must battle do
 in sobs his consort dear to hers gave vent
 when shortly to her ears the tidings flew
 she beat her breast her golden tresses rent
 fast scalding tears her innocent cheeks bedew
 she taxes young rogero as ingrate
 and aye cries out upon her cruel fate

 lxxi
 nought can result to bradamant but pain
 whatever is the doubtful combat's end
 she will not think rogero can be slain
 for this 'twould seem her very heart would rend
 and should our lord the fall of france ordain
 that kingdom for more sins than one to amend
 the gentle maid beside a brother's loss
 would have to weep a worse and bitterer cross

 lxxii
 for without shame and scorn she never may
 not without hatred of her kin combined
 to her loved lord return in such a way
 as that it may be known of all mankind
 as thinking upon this by night and day
 she oftentimes had purposed in her mind
 and so by promise both were tied withal
 room for repentance and retreat was small

 lxxiii
 but she that ever when things adverse were
 with faithful succour bradamant had stayed
 i say the weird melissa could not bear
 to hear the wailings of the woeful maid
 she hurried to console her in her care
 and proffered succour in due time and said
 she would disturb that duel 'twixt the twain
 the occasion of such grief and cruel pain

 lxxiv
 meanwhile their weapons for the future fray
 rogero and duke aymon's son prepared
 the choice whereof with that good warrior lay
 the roman empire's knight by charles declared
 and he like one that ever from the day
 he lost his goodly steed afoot had fared
 made choice afoot and fenced with plate and mail
 his foe with axe and dagger to assail

 lxxv
 whether chance moved mountalban's martial lord
 or malagigi provident and sage
 that knew how young rogero's charmed sword
 cleft helm and hauberk in its greedy rage
 one and the other warrior made accord
 as said without their faulchions to engage
 the place of combat chosen by that twain
 was near old arles upon a spacious plain

 lxxvi
 watchful aurora hardly from the bower
 of old tithonus hath put forth her head
 to give beginning to the day and hour
 prefixed and ordered for that duel dread
 when deputies from either hostile power
 on this side and on that forth issuing spread
 tents at each entrance of the lists and near
 the two pavillions both an altar rear

 lxxvii
 after short pause was seen upon the plain
 the paynim host in different squadrons dight
 rich in barbarick pomp amid that train
 rode africk's monarch ready armed for fight
 bay was the steed he backed with sable mane
 two of his legs were pied his forehead white
 fast beside agramant rogero came
 and him to serve marsilius thought no shame

 lxxviii
 the casque that he from mandricardo wrung
 in single combat with such travel sore
 the casque that as in loftier strain is sung
 cased hector's head a thousand years before
 marsilius carried by his side among
 princes and lords that severally bore
 the other harness of rogero bold
 enriched with precious pearls and rough with gold

 lxxix
 on the other part without his camp appears
 charles with his men at arms in squadrons dight
 who in such order led his cavaliers
 as they would keep if marshalled for the fight
 fenced is the monarch with his famous peers
 and with him wends all armed montalban's knight
 armed save his helmet erst mambrino's casque
 to carry which is danish ogier's task

 lxxx
 and of two axes hath duke namus one
 king salamon the other charlemagne
 is to this side with all his following gone
 to that wend those of africk and of spain
 in the mid space between the hosts is none
 empty remains large portion of the plain
 for he is doomed to death who thither goes
 by joint proclaim except the chosen foes

 lxxxi
 after the second choice of arms was made
 by him the champion of the paynim clan
 thither two priests of either sect conveyed
 two books that carried by one holy man
  him of our law  christ's perfect life displayed
 those others' volume was their alcoran
 the emperor in his hands the gospel took
 the king of africa that other book

 lxxxii
 charlemagne at his altar to the sky
 lifted his hands "o god that for our sake"
 exclaimed the monarch "wast content to die
 thyself a ransom for our sins to make
  o thou that found such favour in his eye
 that god from thee the flesh of man did take
 borne for nine months within thy holy womb
 while aye thy virgin flower preserved its bloom

 lxxxiii
 "hear and be witnesses of what i say
 for me and those that after me shall reign
 to agramant and those that heir his sway
 i twenty loads of gold of perfect grain
 will every year deliver if today
 my champion vanquished in the lists remain
 and vow i will straightway from warfare cease
 and from henceforth maintain perpetual peace

 lxxxiv
 "and may your joint and fearful wrath descend
 on me forthwith if i my word forego
 and may it me and mine alone offend
 and none beside amid this numerous show
 that all in briefest time may comprehend
 my breach of promise has brought down the woe"
 so saying in his hand the holy book
 charles held and fixed on heaven his earnest look

 lxxxv
 this done they seek that altar sumptuously
 decked for the purpose by the pagan train
 where their king swears that he will pass the sea
 with all his army to his moorish reign
 and to king charles will tributary be
 if vanquished young rogero shall remain
 and will observe the truce for evermore
 upon the pact declared by charles before

 lxxxvi
 and like him nor in under tone he swears
 calling on mahound to attest his oath
 and on the volume which his pontiff bears
 to observe what he has promised plights his troth
 then to his side each hastily repairs
 and mid their several powers are harboured both
 next these to swear arrive the champions twain
 and this the promise which their oaths contain

 lxxxvii
 rogero pledges first his knightly word
 should his king mar or send to mar the fray
 he him no more as leader or as lord
 will serve but wholly charlemagne obey
  rinaldo  if in breach of their accord
 him from the field king charles would bear away
 till one or the other is subdued in fight
 that he will be the moorish monarch's knight

 lxxxviii
 when ended are the ceremonies here
 and there to seek their camps the two divide
 nor long therein delayed when trumpets clear
 the time for their encounter signified
 now to the charge advanced each cavalier
 measuring with cautious care his every stride
 lo the assault begins now low now high
 that pair the sounding steel in circles ply

 lxxxix
 now with the axe's blade now with its heel
 their strokes they at the head or foot address
 and these so skilfully and nimbly deal
 as needs must shock all credence to express
 the child that at her brother aims the steel
 who doth his miserable soul possess
 evermore with such caution strikes his blow
 that he is deemed less vigorous than his foe

 xc
 rather to parry then to smite intent
 he know not what to wish that low should lie
 rinaldo would rogero ill content
 nor willingly the child by him would die
 but here i am at my full line's extent
 where i must needs defer my history
 in other canto shall the rest appear
 if you that other canto please to hear


 canto 39

 argument
 agramant breaks the pact is overthrown
 and forced fair france for afric to forego
 meanwhile astolpho in biserta's town
 having with numerous host besieged the foe
 by hazard there arrives bold milo's son
 to whom the duke instructed how to do
 restores his wits at sea does dudon meet
 king agramant and sore annoys his fleet


 i
 than that fell woe which on rogero weighs
 harder and bitterer pain forsooth is none
 which upon flesh and more on spirit preys
 for of two deaths there is no scaping one
 him if in strife o'erlaid rinaldo slays
 bradamant if rinaldo is outdone
 for if he killed her brother well he knew
 her hate than death more hateful would ensue

 ii
 rinaldo unimpeded by such thought
 strove in all ways rogero to o'erthrow
 fierce and despiteous whirled his axe and sought
 now in the arms now head to wound the foe
 rogero circled here and there and caught
 upon his weapon's shaft the coming blow
 and if ever smote aye strove to smite
 where he should injure least montalban's knight

 iii
 to most of them that led the paynim bands
 but too unequal seemed the fierce assay
 too slowly young rogero plied his hands
 too well rinaldo kept the child at bay
 with troubled face the king of afric stands
 he sighed and breathless gazed upon the fray
 and all the blame of that ill counsel flung
 on king sobrino's head from whom it sprung

 iv
 meanwhile the weird melissa she  the font
 of all that wizards or enchanters know 
 had by her art transformed her female front
 and taken argier's mighty shape in show
 and gesture she appeared as rodomont
 and seemed like him in dragon's hide to go
 such was her belied sword and such her shield
 nor aught was wanting which he wore afield

 v
 she towards troyano's mournful son did guide
 in form of courser a familiar sprite
 and with a troubled visage loudly cried
 "my liege this is too foul an oversight
 a stripling boy in peril yet untried
 against a gaul so stout and famed in fight
 your champion in so fierce a strife to make
 where afric's realm and honour are at stake

 vi
 "let not this battle be pursued my lord
 in that 'twould cost our moorish cause too dear
 let sin of broken faith and forfeit word
 fall upon rodomont take thou no fear
 let each now show the metal of his sword
 each for a hundred stands when i am here"
 so upon agramant this counsel wrought
 that king pressed forward without further thought

 vii
 he thinking that the monarch of algiers
 is with him of the pact has little care
 and would not rate a thousand cavaliers
 so high if handed in his aid they were
 hence steeds reinedin and spurred hence levelled spears
 are seen in one short instant here and there
 melissa when the hosts are mixed in fight
 by her false phantoms vanishes from sight

 viii
 the champions two that against all accord
 against all faith disturbed their duel see
 no longer strive in fight but pledge their word
  yea put aside all hostile injury 
 that they on neither part will draw the sword
 until they better certified shall be
 who broke the pact established by that twain
 young agramant or aged charlemagne

 ix
 they sweat anew the king who had o'erthrown
 that truce and broken faith as foe to treat
 the field of combat is turned upside down
 some hurry to the charge and some retreat
 who most deserved disgrace who most renown
 was seen on both hands in the selfsame feat
 all ran alike but 'mid that wild affray
 these ran to meet the foe those ran away

 x
 as greyhound in the slip that the fleet hare
 scowering about and circling him discerns
 nor with the other dogs a part can bear
 for him the hunter holds with anger burns
 torments himself and mourns in his despair
 and whines and strives against the leash by turns
 such till that moment had the fury been
 of aymon's daughter and the martial queen

 xi
 they till that hour upon the spacious plain
 had watched so rich a prize throughout the day
 and as obliged by treaty to refrain
 from laying hands upon the costly prey
 had sore lamented and had grieved in vain
 gazing with longing eyes on that array
 now seeing truce and treaty broke among
 the moorish squadrons they rejoicing sprung

 xii
 marphisa piercing her first victim's breast
 two yards beyond his back the lance did pass
 in briefer time than 'tis by me exprest
 broke with her sword four helms which flew like glass
 no less did bradamant upon the rest
 but them her spear reduced to other pass
 all touched by that gold lance she overthrew
 doubling marphisa's score yet none she slew

 xiii
 they witness to each others' exploits are
 those maids to one another are so near
 then whither fury drives the martial pair
 dividing through the moorish ranks career
 who could each several warrior's name declare
 stretched on the champaign by that golden spear
 or reckon every head marphisa left
 divided by her horrid sword or cleft

 xiv
 as when benigner winds more swiftly blow
 and apennine his shaggy back lays bare
 two turbid torrents with like fury flow
 which in their fall two separate channels wear
 uproot hard rocks and mighty trees which grow
 on their steep banks and field and harvest bear
 into the vale and seem as if they vied
 which should do mightiest damage on its side

 xv
 so those highminded virgin warriors two
 scowering the field in separate courses made
 huge havock of the moors whom they pursue
 one with couched lance and one with lifted blade
 hardly king agramant his africk crew
 from flight beneath his royal banners stayed
 in search of rodomont he vainly turned
 nor tidings of the missing warrior learned

 xvi
 he at his exhortation so he trowed
 had broke the treaty made in solemn wise
 to witness which the gods were called aloud
 who then so quick vanished from his eyes
 nor sees he king sobrino disavowed
 by king sobrino is the deed who flies
 to arles and deems that day some vengeance dread
 will fall on agramant's devoted head

 xvii
 marsilius too is fled into the town
 so has that monarch holy faith at heart
 'tis hence that feebly king troyano's son
 resists the crew that war on charles's part
 italians english germans of renown
 are all and scattered upon every part
 are mixed the paladins those barons bold
 glittering like jewels on a cloth of gold

 xviii
 and with those peers is more than one confest
 as perfect as is earthly cavalier
 guide the savage that intrepid breast
 and those two famous sons of olivier
 i will not now repeat what i exprest
 of that fierce daring female twain whilere
 who on the field so many moors extend
 no number is there to the slain or end

 xix
 but putting this affray some while aside
 without a pinnace will i pass the sea
 to them of france so fast i am not tied
 but that astolpho should remembered be
 of the grace given him by his holy guide
 i told erewhile and told it seems to me
 branzardo and the king of algaziers
 against the duke had mustered all their spears

 xx
 such as the monarchs could in haste engage
 raked from all africa that host contained
 whether of fitting or of feeble age
 scarce from impressing women they refrained
 resolved his thirst of vengeance to assuage
 agramant twice his africa had drained
 few people in the land were left and they
 a feeble and dispirited array

 xxi
 so proved they for the foe was scarce in view
 before that levy broke in panic dread
 like sheep their quailing bands astolpho slew
 charging at his more martial squadrons' head
 and with the slain filled all that champaign few
 into biserta from the carnage fled
 a prisoner valiant bucifar remained
 the town in safety king branzardo gained

 xxii
 more grieved as bucifaro's loss alone
 than had he lost the rest in arms arrayed
 wide and in want of ramparts is the town
 and these could ill be raised without his aid
 while fain to ransom him he thinks upon
 the means and stands afflicted and dismayed
 he recollects him how the paladin
 dudon has many a month his prisoner been

 xxiii
 him under monaco upon the shore
 in his first passage sarza's monarch took
 thenceforth had been a prisoner evermore
 dudon who was derived of danish stock
 the paladin against the royal moor
 branzardo thought in this distress to truck
 and knowing through sure spy astolpho led
 the nubians to that chief the offer sped

 xxiv
 a paladin himself astolpho knows
 he gladly ought a paladin to free
 and when that case the moorish envoy shows
 to king branzardo's offer does agree
 dudon from prison loosed his thanks bestows
 and whatsoe'er pertains to land or sea
 bestirs him to accomplish in accord
 with his illustrious chief the english lord

 xxv
 astolpho leading such a countless band
 as might have well seven africas opprest
 and recollecting 'twas the saint's command
 who upon him whilere imposed the quest
 that fair provence and aquamorta's strand
 he from the reaving saracen should wrest
 made through his numerous host a second draught
 of such as least inapt for sea he thought

 xxvi
 and filling next as full as they could be
 his hands with many different sorts of leaves
 plucked from palm olive bay and cedar tree
 approached the shore and cast them on the waves
 oh blessed souls oh great felicity
 o grace which rarely man from god receives
 o strange and wondrous miracle which sprung
 out of those leaves upon the waters flung

 xxvii
 they wax in number beyond all esteem
 becoming crooked and heavy long and wide
 into hard timber turn and solid beam
 the slender veins that branch on either side
 taper the masts and moored in the salt stream
 all in a thought transformed to vessels ride
 and of as diverse qualities appear
 as are the plants whereon they grew whilere

 xxviii
 it was a miracle to see them grown
 to galliot galley frigate ship and boat
 wondrous that they with tackling of their own
 are found as well as any barks afloat
 nor lack there men to govern them when blown
 by blustering winds  from islands not remote 
 sardinia or corsica of every rate
 pilot and patron mariner and mate

 xxix
 twentysix thousand were the troop that manned
 those ready barks of every sort and kind
 to dudon's government by sea or land
 a leader sage the navy was consigned
 which yet lay anchored off the moorish strand
 expecting a more favourable wind
 to put to sea when freighted with a load
 of prisoners lo a vessel made the road

 xxx
 she carried those whom at the bridge of dread
  on that so narrow place of battle met 
 rodomont took as often has been said
 the valiant olivier was of the set
 orlando's kin and with them prisoners led
 were faithful brandimart and sansonet
 with more to tell whereof there is no need
 of german gascon or italian seed

 xxxi
 the patron yet unweeting he should find
 foes in the port here entered to unload
 having left argier many miles behind
 where he was minded to have made abode
 because a boisterous overblowing wind
 had driven his bark beyond her destined road
 deeming himself as safe and welcome guest
 as progne when she seeks her noisy nest

 xxxii
 but when arrived the imperial eagle spread
 and pards and golden lilies he descries
 with countenance as sicklied o'er by dread
 he stands as one that in unwary guise
 has chanced on fell and poisonous snake to tread
 which in the grass opprest with slumber lies
 and pale and startled hastens to retire
 from that ill reptile swoln with bane and ire

 xxxiii
 but no retreat from peril is there here
 nor can the patron keep his prisoners down
 him thither brandimart and olivier
 sansonet and those others drag where known
 and greeted are the friends with joyful cheer
 by england's duke and danish ogier's son
 who read that he who brought them to that shore
 should for his pains be sentenced to the oar

 xxxiv
 king otho's son kind welcome did afford
 unto those christian cavaliers as said
 who  honoured at his hospitable board 
 with arms and all things needful were purveyed
 his going for their sake the danish lord
 deferred who deemed his voyage well delayed
 to parley with those peers though at the cost
 of one or two good days in harbour lost

 xxxv
 of charles and in what state what order are
 the affairs of france they gave advices true
 told where he best could disembark and where
 to most advantage of the christian crew
 while so the cavaliers their news declare
 a noise is heard which ever louder grew
 followed by such a fierce alarm withal
 as to more fears than one gave rise in all

 xxxvi
 the duke astolpho and the goodly throng
 that in discourse with him were occupied
 armed in a moment on their coursers sprung
 and hurried where the nubians loudest cried
 and seeking wherefore that wide larum rung
 now here now there  those warlike lords espied
 a savage man and one so strong of hand
 naked and sole he troubled all that band

 xxxvii
 the naked savage whirled a sapling round
 so hard so heavy and so strong of grain
 that every time the weapon went to ground
 some warrior more than maimed opprest the plain
 above a hundred dead are strewed around
 nor more defence the routed hands maintain
 save that a war of distant parts they try
 for there is none will wait the champion nigh

 xxxviii
 astolpho brandimart the danish knight
 hastening towards that noise with olivier
 remain astounded at the wondrous might
 and courage which in that wild man appear
 when posting thither on a palfry light
 is seen a damsel clad in sable gear
 to brandimart in haste that lady goes
 and both her arms about the warrior throws

 xxxix
 this was fair flordelice whose bosom so
 burned with the love of monodantes' son
 she when she left him prisoner to his foe
 at that streight bridge had nigh distracted gone
 from france had she past hither  given to know 
 by that proud paynim who the deed had done
 how brandimart with many cavaliers
 was prisoner in the city of algiers

 xl
 when now she for that harbour would have weighed
 an eastern vessel in marseilles she found
 which thither had an ancient knight conveyed
 of monodantes' household a long round
 to seek his brandimart that lord had made
 by sea and upon many a distant ground
 for he upon his way had heard it told
 how he in france should find the warrior bold

 xli
 she knowing old bardino in that wight
 bardino who from monodantes' court
 with little brandimart had taken flight
 and reared his nursling in the sylvan fort
 then hearing what had thither brought the knight
 with her had made him loosen from the port
 relating to that elder by what chance
 brandimart had to africk passed from france

 xlii
 as soon as landed that biserta lies
 besieged by good astolpho's band they hear
 that brandimart is with him in the emprize
 they learn but learn not as a matter clear
 now in such haste to him the damsel flies
 when she beholds her faithful cavalier
 as plainly shows her joy which woes o'erblown
 had made the mightiest she had ever known

 xliii
 the gentle baron no less gladly eyed
 his faithful and beloved consort's face
 her whom he prized above all things beside
 and clipt and welcomed her with loving grace
 nor his warm wishes would have satisfied
 a first a second or a third embrace
 but that he spied bardino he that came
 from france together with that faithful dame

 xliv
 he stretched his arms and would embrace the knight
 and  wherefore he was come  would bid him say
 but was prevented by the sudden flight
 of the sacred host which fled in disarray
 before the club of that mad naked wight
 who with the brandished sapling cleared his way
 flordelice viewed the furious man in front
 and cried to brandimart "behold the count"

 xlv
 at the same time withal astolpho bold
 that this was good orlando plainly knew
 by signs whereof those ancient saints had told
 in the earthly paradise as tokens true
 none of those others who the knight behold
 the courteous baron in the madman view
 that from long selfneglect while wild he ran
 had in his visage more of beast than man

 xlvi
 with breast and heart transfixed with pity cried
 valiant astolpho  bathed with many a tear 
 turning to danish dudon at this side
 and afterwards to valiant olivier
 "behold orlando" him awhile they eyed
 straining their eyes and lids then knew the peer
 and seeing him in such a piteous plight
 were filled with grief and wonder at the sight

 xlvii
 so grieve and so lament the greater part
 of those good warriors that their eyes o'erflow
 " `tis time" astolpho cried "to find some art
 to heal him not indulge in useless woe"
 and from his courser sprang bold brandimart
 olivier sansonet and dudon so
 all leap to ground and all together make
 at roland whom the warriors fain would take

 xlviii
 seeing the circle round about him grow
 levels his club that furious paladin
 and makes fierce dudon feel who  couched below
 his buckler  on the madman would break in
 how grievous is that staff's descending blow
 and but that olivier orlando's kin
 broke in some sort its force that stake accurst
 had shield and helmet head and body burst

 xlix
 it only burst the shield and in such thunder
 broke on the casque that dudon prest the shore
 with that sir sansonet cut clean asunder
 the sapling shorn of two clothyards and more
 so vigorous was that warrior's stroke while under
 his bosom brandimart girt roland sore
 with sinewy arms about his body flung
 and to the champion's legs astolpho clung

 l
 orlando shook himself and england's knight
 ten paces off reversed upon the ground
 yet loosed not brandimart who with more might
 and better hold had clasped the madman round
 to olivier too forward in that fight
 he dealt so furious and so fell a wound
 with his clenched fist that pale the marquis fell
 and purple streams from eyes and nostrils well

 li
 and save his morion had been more than good
 bold olivier had breathed his last who lies
 so battered with his fall it seemed he wou'd
 bequeath his parting soul to paradise
 astolpho and dudon that again upstood
 albeit swoln were dudon's face and eyes
 and sansonet who plied so well his sword
 all made together at anglantes' lord

 lii
 dudon orlando from behind embraced
 and with his foot the furious peer would throw
 astolpho and others seize his arms but waste
 their strength in all attempts to hold the foe
 he who has seen a bull by mastiffs chased
 that gore his bleeding ears in fury lowe
 dragging the dogs that bait him there and here
 yet from their tusks unable to get clear

 liii
 let him imagine so orlando drew
 astolpho and those banded knights along
 meanwhile upstarted oliviero who
 by that fell fistycuff on earth was flung
 and seeing they could ill by roland do
 that sought by good astolpho and his throng
 he meditates and compasses a way
 the frantic paladin on earth to lay

 liv
 he many a hawser made them thither bring
 and running knots in them he quickly tied
 which on the count's waist arms and legs they fling
 and then among themselves the ends divide
 conveyed to this or that amid the ring
 compassing roland upon every side
 the warriors thus orlando flung parforce
 as farrier throws the struggling ox or horse

 lv
 as soon as down they all upon him are
 and hands and feet more tightly they constrain
 he shakes himself and plunges here and there
 but all his efforts for relief are vain
 astolpho bade them hence the prisoner bear
 for he would heal he said the warrior's brain
 shouldered by sturdy dudon is the load
 and on the beach's furthest brink bestowed

 lvi
 seven times astolpho makes them wash the knight
 and seven times plunged beneath the brine he goes
 so that they cleanse away the scurf and blight
 which to his stupid limbs and visage grows
 this done with herbs for that occasion dight
 they stop his mouth wherewith he puffs and blows
 for save his nostrils would astolpho leave
 no passage whence the count might air receive

 lvii
 valiant astolpho had prepared the vase
 wherein orlando's senses were contained
 and to his nostrils in such mode conveys
 that drawingin his breath the county drained
 the mystic cup withal oh wondrous case
 the unsettled mind its ancient seat regained
 and in its glorious reasonings yet more clear
 and lucid waxed his wisdom than whilere

 lviii
 as one that seems in troubled sleep to see
 abominable shapes a horrid crew
 monsters which are not and which cannot be
 or seems some strange unlawful thing to do
 yet marvels at himself from slumber free
 when his recovered senses play him true
 so good orlando when he is made sound
 remains yet full of wonder and astound

 lix
 aldabelle's brother monodantes' son
 and him that on his brain such cure had wrought
 he wondering marked but word he spake to none
 and when and how he was brought thither thought
 he turned his restless eyes now up now down
 nor where he was withal imagined aught
 marvelling why he there was naked cast
 and wherefore tethered neck and heels so fast

 lx
 then said as erst silenus said  when seen
 and taken sleeping the cave of yore 
 solvite me with visage so serene
 with look so much less wayward than before
 that him they from his bonds delivered clean
 and raiment to the naked warrior bore
 all comforting their friend with grief opprest
 for that delusion which had him possest

 lxi
 when to his former self he was recovered
 of wiser and of manlier mind than e'er
 from love as well was freed the enamoured lord
 and she so gentle deemed so fair whilere
 and by renowned orlando so adored
 did but to him a worthless thing appear
 what he through love had lost to reacquire
 was his whole study was his whole desire

 lxii
 meanwhile bardino told to brandimart
 how monodantes his good sire was dead
 and on his brother gigliantes' part
 to call him to his kingdom had he sped
 as well as from those isles which most apart
 from other lands in eastern seas are spread
 that prince's fair inheritance than which
 was none more pleasant populous or rich

 lxiii
 he said mid many reasons which he prest
 that home was sweet and  were the warrior fain
 to taste that sweet  he ever would detest
 a wandering life and brandimart again
 replies through all that war he will not rest
 from serving roland and king charlemagne
 and after if he lives to see its end
 to his own matters better will attend

 lxiv
 upon the following day for provence steer
 the shipping under danish dudon's care
 when with the duke retired anglantes' peer
 and heard that lord the warfare's state declare
 then prest with siege biserta far and near
 but let good england's knight the honour wear
 of every vantage while astolpho still
 in all was guided by orlando's will

 lxv
 the order taken to attack the town
 of huge biserta when and on what side
 how at the first assault the walls are won
 and with orlando who the palm divide
 lament not that i now shall leave unshown
 since for short time i lay my tale aside
 in the meanwhile how fierce an overthrow
 the moors received in france be pleased to know

 lxvi
 well nigh abandoned was their royal lord
 in his worst peril for to arles again
 had gone with many of the paynim horde
 the sage sobrino and the king of spain
 who for the deemed the land unsafe aboard
 their barks sought refuge with a numerous train
 barons and cavaliers that served the moor
 who moved by their example put from shore

 lxvii
 yet royal agramant the fight maintains
 but when he can no longer make a stand
 turns from the combat and directly strains
 for arles not far remote upon the strand
 him rabican pursues with flowing reins
 whom aymon's daughter drives with heel and hand
 him would she slay through whom so often crost
 that martial maid had her rogero lost

 lxviii
 marphisa by the same desire was stirred
 who had her thoughts on tardy vengeance placed
 for her dead sire and as she fiercely spurred
 made her hot courser feel his rider's haste
 but neither martial maid amid that herd
 of flying moors so well the monarch chased
 as to o'ertake him in his swift retreat
 first into arles and then aboard his fleet

 lxix
 as two fair generous pards that from some crag
 together dart and stretch across the plain
 when they perceive that vigorous goat or stag
 their nimble quarry is pursued in vain
 as if ashamed they in that chase did lag
 return repentant and in high disdain
 so with a sigh return those damsels two
 when they the paynim king in safety view

 lxx
 yet therefore halt not but in fury go
 amid that crowd which flies possest with dread
 feeling now here now there at every blow
 many that never more uprear their head
 to evil pass was brought the broken foe
 for safety was not even for them that fled
 since agramant a sure retreat to gain
 bade shut the citygate which faced the plain

 lxxi
 and bade on rhone break all the bridges down
 unhappy people ever held as cheap
  weighed with the tyrant's want who wears a crown 
 as worthless herd of goats or silly sheep
 these in the sea those in the river drown
 and those with blood the thirsty fallows steep
 the franks few prisoners made and many slew
 for ransom in that battle was for few

 lxxii
 of the great multitude of either train
 christened or paynim killed in that last fight
 though in unequal parts for of the slain
 by far more saracens were killed in flight
 by hands of those redoubted damsels twain
 signs even to this day remain in sight
 for hard by arles where sleeps the lazy rhone
 the plain with rising sepulchres is strown

 lxxiii
 meanwhile his heavy ships of deepest draught
 king agramant had made put forth to sea
 leaving some barks in port  his lightest craft 
 for them that would aboard his navy flee
 he stays two days while they the stragglers waft
 and for the winds are wild and contrary
 on the third day to sail he give command
 in trust to make return to africk's land

 lxxiv
 royal marsilius in that fatal hour
 fearing the costs will fall upon his spain
 and that the clouds which big with tempest lower
 in the end will burst upon his fields and grain
 makes for valentia where he town and tower
 begins to fortify with mickle pain
 and for that war prepares which after ends
 in the destruction of himself and friends

 lxxv
 king agramant his sails for africk bent
 his barks illarmed and almost empty go
 empty of men but full of discontent
 in that threefourths had perished by the foe
 as cruel some as weak and proud some shent
 their king and as still happens in like woe
 all hate him privily but for they fear
 his fury in his presence mute appear

 lxxvi
 yet sometimes two or three their lips unclose
  some knot of friends where each on each relies 
 and their pent choler and their rage expose
 yet agramant beneath the illusion lies
 that each will love and pity overflows
 and this befalls because he still espies
 false faces hears but voices that applaud
 and nought but adulation lies and fraud

 lxxvii
 not in biserta's port his host to land
 was the sage king of africa's intent
 who had sure news that shore by nubia's band
 was held but he so far above it meant
 to steer his moorish squadron that the strand
 should not be steep or rugged for descent
 there would he disembark and thence would aid
 forthwith his people broken and dismaid

 lxxviii
 but favoured not by his foul destiny
 was that intention provident and wise
 which willed the fleet from leaves of greenwood tree
 produced upon the beach in wondrous guise
 that bound for france now ploughed the foaming sea
 should meet the king at night that from surprise
 in that dark dismal hour amid his crew
 worse panic and disorder might ensue

 lxxix
 not yet to him have tidings been conveyed
 that squadrons of such force the billows plow
 nor would he have believed in him who said
 a hundred barks had sprung from one small bough
 and hence for africa the king had weighed
 not fearing to encounter hostile prow
 nor has he watchmen in his tops to spy
 and make report of what they hence descry

 lxxx
 `twas so those ships by england's peer supplied
 to dudon manned with good and armed crew
 which see that moorish fleet at eventide
 and that strange armament forthwith pursue
 assailed them unawares and far and wide
 among those barks their grapplingirons threw
 and linked by chains to their opponents clung
 when known for moors and foemen by their tongue

 lxxxi
 in bearing down impelled by winds that blow
 propitious to the danish chief's intent
 those weighty ships so shocked the paynim foe
 that many vessels to the bottom went
 then taxing wits and hands to work them woe
 them with fire sword and stones the christians shent
 which on their ships in such wide ruin pour
 like tempest never vext the sea before

 lxxxii
 bold dudon's men to whom unwonted might
 and daring was imparted from on high
 since the hour was come the paynims to requite
 for more than one ill deed from far and nigh
 the moors so pestilently gall and smite
 agramant finds no shelter from the sky
 above thick clouds of whistling arrows strike
 around gleam hook and hatchet sword and pike

 lxxxiii
 the king hears huge and heavy stones descend
 from charged machine or thundering engine sent
 which falling poop and prow and broadside rend
 opening to ravening seas a mighty vent
 and more than all the furious fires offend
 fires that are quickly kindled slowly spent
 the wretched crews would fain that danger shun
 and ever into direr peril run

 lxxxiv
 one headlong plunged pursued by fire and sword
 and perished mid the waters one who wrought
 faster with arms and feet his passage oared
 to other barque already overfraught
 but she repulsed the wretch that fain would board
 whose hand which too importunately sought
 to clamber grasped the side while his lopt arm
 and body stained the wave with lifeblood warm

 lxxxv
 him that to save his life i' the waters thought
 or at the worst to perish with less pain
 since swimming profited the caitiff nought
 and he perceived his strength and courage drain
 to the hungry fires from which the refuge sought
 the fear of drowning hurries back again
 he grasps a burning plank and in the dread
 of dying either death by both is sped

 lxxxvi
 this vainly to the sea resorts whom spear
 or hatchet brandished close at hand dismay
 for stone or arrow following in his rear
 permit the craven to make little way
 but haply while it yet delights your ear
 'twere well and wisely done to end my lay
 rather than harp upon the theme so long
 as to annoy you with a tedious song


 canto 40

 argument
 to fly the royal agramant is fain
 and sees biserta burning far away
 but landing finds the royal sericane
 who of his faith gives goodly warrant they
 defy orlando backed by champions twain
 whom bold gradasso firmly trusts to slay
 for seven kings' sake fast prisoners to their foes
 rogero and the dane exchange rude blows


 i
 the diverse chances of that seafight dread
 here to rehearse would take a weary while
 and to discourse to you upon this head
 great son of hercules were to samos' isle
 to carry earthen vessels as 'tis said
 to athens owls and crocodiles the nile
 in that my lord by what is vouched to me
 such things you saw such things made others see

 ii
 your faithful people gazed on a long show
 that night and day wherein they crowded stood
 as in a theatre and hemmed on po
 twixt fire and sword the hostile navies viewed
 what outcries may be heard what sounds of woe
 how rivers may run red with human blood
 in suchlike combat in how many a mode
 men die you saw and you to many showed

 iii
 i saw not i who was compelled to course
 evermore changing nags six days before
 to rome in heat and haste some helpful force
 of him our mighty pastor to implore
 but after need was none of foot or horse
 for so the lion's beak and claws you tore
 from that day unto this i hear not said
 that he more trouble in your land has bread

 iv
 but trotto present at this victory
 afranio moro albert hannibal
 zerbinat bagno the ariostos three
 assured me of the mighty feat withal
 certified after by that ensignry
 suspended from the holy temple's wall
 and fifteen galleys at our riverside
 which with a thousand captive barks i spied

 v
 he that those wrecks and blazing fires discerned
 and such sore slaughter under different shows
 which  venging us for hall and palace burned 
 while bark remained raged wide among the foes
 might also deem how africk's people mourned
 with agramant mid diverse deaths and woes
 on that dark night when the redouted dane
 assaulted in mid sea the moorish train

 vi
 'twas night nor gleam was anywhere descried
 when first the fleets in furious strife were blended
 but when lit sulphur pitch and tar from side
 and poop and prow into the sky ascended
 and the destructive wildfire scattered wide
 fed upon ship and shallop ill defended
 the things about them all descried so clear
 that night was changed to day as 'twould appear

 vii
 hence agramant that by the dark deceived
 had rated not so high the foes' array
 nor to encounter such a force believed
 but would if 'twere opposed at last give way
 when that wide darkness cleared and he perceived
 what least he weened upon the first affray
 that twice as many were the ships he fought
 as his own moorish barks took other thought

 viii
 into a boat he with some few descends
 brigliador and some precious things to flee
 and so twixt ship and ship in silence wends
 until he finds himself in safer sea
 far from his own whom fiery dudon shends
 reduced to sad and sore extremity
 them steel destroys fires burn and waters drown
 while he that mighty slaughter's cause is flown

 ix
 agramant flies and with him old sobrine
 agramant grieving he had not believed
 what time that sage foresaw with eye divine
 and told the woe wherewith he is aggrieved
 but turn me to the valiant paladine
 who before other aid can be received
 counsels the duke biserta to destroy
 that it no more may christian france annoy

 x
 and hence in public order was it said
 the camp should to its arms the third day stand
 for this it was with many barks bested
 for all were placed not at the dane's command
 that fleet the worthy sansonetto led
 as good a warrior he by sea as land
 which a mile off the port and overight
 biserta now was anchored by the knight

 xi
 orlando and the duke like christians true
 which dare no danger without god for guide
 that fast and prayer be made their army through
 ordain by proclamation to be cried
 and that upon the third day when they view
 the signal all shall bown them far and wide
 biserta's royal city to attack
 which they when taken doom to fire and sack

 xii
 and so when now devoutly have been done
 vigil and vow and holy prayer and fast
 kin friends and those to one another known
 together feast who when with glad repast
 their wasted bodies were refreshed begun
 to embrace and weep and acts and speeches past
 upon the banquet's close amid those crews
 such as best friends about to sever use

 xiii
 the holy priests within biserta's wall
 pray with their grieving people and in tears
 aye beat their bosoms and for succour call
 upon their mahomet who nothing hears
 what vigils offerings and what gifts withal
 were promised silently amid their fears
 what temples statues images were vowed
 in memory of their bitter woes aloud

 xiv
 and when the cadi hath his blessing said
 the people arms and to the rampart hies
 as yet reposing in her tithon's bed
 aurora was and dusky were the skies
 when to their posts their several troops to head
 here sansonetto there astolpho flies
 and when they hear orlando's signal blown
 assault with furious force biserta's town

 xv
 washed by the sea upon two quarters were
 the city walls two stood on the dry shore
 of a construction excellent and rare
 wherein was seen the work of days of yore
 of other bulwarks was the town nigh bare
 for since branzardo there the sceptre bore
 few masons at command and little space
 that monarch had to fortify the place

 xvi
 the nubian king is charged by england's peer
 with sling and arrow so the moors to gall
 that none upon the works shall dare appear
 and that protected by the ceaseless fall
 of stone and dart in safety cavalier
 and footman may approach the very wall
 who loaded some with plank with rockstone some
 and some with beam or weightier burden come

 xvii
 this and that other thing the nubians bore
 and by degrees filledup that channel wide
 whose waters were cut off the day before
 so that in many parts the ooze was spied
 filled is the ditch in haste from shore to shore
 and forms a level to the further side
 cheering the footmen on the works to mount
 stand olivier astolpho and the count

 xviii
 the nubian upon hope of gain intent
 impatient of delay nor heeding how
 with pressing perils they were compassed went
 protected by the sheltering boar and sow
 with battering ram and other instrument
 to break the gate and make the turret bow
 speedily to the city wall they post
 nor unprovided find the paynim host

 xix
 for steel and fire and roof and turret there
 in guise of tempest on the nubians fell
 which plank and beam from those dread engines tear
 made for annoyance of the infidel
 in the ill beginning and while dim the air
 much injury the christened host befell
 but when the sun from his rich mansion breaks
 fortune the faction of the moor forsakes

 the assault is reinforced on every side
 by count orlando both by sea and land
 the fleet with sansonetto for its guide
 entered the harbour and approached the strand
 and sorely they with various engines plied
 with arrows and with slings the paynim band
 and sent the assailants scalingladder spear
 and naval stores and every needful gear

 xxi
 orlando oliviero brandimart
 and he in air so daring heretofore
 do fierce and furious battle on that part
 which lies the furthest inland from the shore
 each leads a portion of those aethiops swart
 ordered in equal bands beneath the four
 who at the walls the gateways or elsewhere
 all give of prowess shining proofs and rare

 xxii
 so better could be seen each warrior's claim
 that in confused in combat there and here
 who of reward is worthy who of shame
 to a thousand and to watchful eyes is clear
 dragged upon wheels are towers of wooden frame
 and others welltrained elephants uprear
 which so o'ertop the turrets of the foe
 those bulwarks stand a mighty space below

 xxiii
 brandimart to the walls a ladder brought
 climbed and to climb withal to others cried
 many succeed with bold assurance fraught
 for none can fear beneath so good a guide
 nor was there one who marked nor one who thought
 of marking if such weight it would abide
 brandimart only on the foes intent
 clambered and fought and grasped a battlement

 xxiv
 here clang with hand and foot the daring knight
 sprang on the embattled wall and whirled his sword
 and showing mickle tokens of his might
 the paynims charged o'erthrew hewed down and gored
 but all at once o'erburthened with that weight
 the ladder breaks beneath the assailing horde
 and saving brandimart the christians all
 into the ditch with headlong ruin fall

 xxv
 not therefore blenched the valiant cavalier
 nor thought he of retreat albeit was none
 of his own band that followed in his rear
 although he was a mark for all the town
 of many prayed the warrior would not hear
 the prayer to turn but mid the foes leapt down
 i say into the city took a leap
 where the townwall was thirty cubits deep

 xxvi
 he without any harm on the hard ground
 as if on feathers or on straw did light
 and like cloth shred and shorn the paynims round
 in fury shreds and shears the valiant knight
 now springs on these now those with vigorous bound
 and these and those betake themselves to flight
 they that without have seen the leap he made
 too late to save him deem all human aid

 xxvii
 throughout the squadrons a deep rumour flew
 a murmur and a whisper there and here
 from mouth to mouth the fame by motion grew
 and told and magnified the tale of fear
 for upon many quarters stormed that crew
 where good orlando was where olivier
 where otho's son she flew on pinions light
 nor ever paused upon her nimble flight

 xxviii
 those warriors and orlando most of all
 who love and prize the gentle brandimart
 hearing should they defy upon that call
 they would from so renowned a comrade part
 their scalingladders plant and mount the wall
 with rivalry which shows the kingly heart
 who carry all such terror in their look
 that at the very sight their foemen shook

 xxix
 as on loud ocean lashed by boisterous gale
 the billows the rash bark assault and still 
 now threatening poop now threatening prow  assail
 and in their rage and fury fain would fill
 the pilot sighs and groans dismaid and pale
  he that should aid and has not heart or skill 
 at length a surge the pinnace sweeps and swallows
 and wave on wave in long succession follows

 xxx
 thus when those win the wall they leave a space
 so wide that who beneath their conduct go
 safely may follow them for at its base
 a thousand ladders have been reared below
 meanwhile the battering rams in many a place
 have breached that wall and with such mighty blow
 the bold assailant can from many a part
 bear succour to the gallant brandimart

 xxxi
 even with that rage wherewith the stream that reigns
 the king of rivers  when he breaks his mound
 and makes himself a way through mantuan plains 
 the greasy furrows and glad harvests round
 and with the sheepcotes flock and dogs and swains
 bears off in his o'erwhelming waters drowned
 over the elm's high top the fishes glide
 where fowls erewhile their nimble pinions plied

 xxxii
 even with that rage rushed in the impetuous band
 where many breaches in the wall were wrought
 to slay with burning torch and trenchant brand
 that people which to evil pass were brought
 murder and rapine there and violent hand
 dipt deep in blood and plunder in a thought
 destroy that sumptuous and triumphant town
 which of all africk wore the royal crown

 xxxiii
 filled with dead bodies of the paynim horde
 blood issued from so many a gaping wound
 a fouler fosse was formed and worse to ford
 than girdles the infernal city round
 from house to house the fire in fury poured
 mosque portico and palace went to ground
 and spoiled and empty mansions with the clang
 of beaten breast and groan and outcry rang

 xxxiv
 the victors laden with their mighty prey
 from that unhappy city's gates are gone
 one with fair vase and one with rich array
 or silver plate from ancient altar won
 the mother this that bore the child away
 rapes and a thousand evil things were done
 of much and what they cannot hinder hear
 renowned orlando and fair england's peer

 xxxv
 by olivier amid that slaughter wide
 fell bucifaro of the paynim band
 and  every hope and comfort cast aside 
 branzardo slew himself with his own brand
 pierced with three wounds whereof he shortly died
 folvo was taken by astolpho's hand
 the monarchs three intrusted to whose care
 agramant's african dominions were

 xxxvi
 agramant who had left without a guide
 his fleet this while and with sobrino fled
 wept over his biserta when he spied
 those fires that on the royal city fed
 when nearer now the king was certified
 how in that cruel strife his town had sped
 he thought of dying and himself had slain
 but that sobrino's words his arm restrain

 xxxvii
 "what victory my lord" sobrino cries
 "could better than thy death the christian cheer
 whence he might hope to joy in quiet wise
 fair africa from all annoyance clear
 thy being yet alive this hope denies
 hence shall he evermore have cause for fear
 for well the foeman knows save thou art gone
 he for short time will fill thine africk throne

 xxxviii
 "thy subjects by thy death deprived will be
 of hope the only good they have in store
 thou if thou liv'st i trust shalt set us free
 redeem from trouble and to joy restore
 captives for ever if thou diest are we
 africk is tributary evermore
 although not for thyself yet not to give
 my liege annoyance to thy followers live

 xxxix
 "the soldan he thy neighbour will be won
 surely with men and money thee to aid
 by him with evil eye king pepin's son
 so strong in africa will be surveyed
 all efforts to restore thee to thy throne
 by norandine thy kinsman will be made
 turk persian and armenian arab mede
 if prayed will all assist thee in thy need"

 xl
 in such and such like words with wary art
 with hope of quickly winning back his reign
 sobrino soothed the king while in his heart
 he other thought perchance did entertain
 well knows he to what pass what evil mart
 that lord is brought how often sighs in vain
 whoe'er foregoes the sceptre which he swayed
 and to barbarians hath recourse for aid

 xli
 jugurtha martial hannibal and more
 in ancient times good proof of this afford
 in our own era lewis hight the moor
 delivered into other lewis' ward
 your brother duke alphonso wiser lore
 learned from their fate  i speak to you my lord 
 wont them as very madmen to decry
 that more on others than themselves rely

 xlii
 and therefore aye throughout that warfare drear
 waged by the pontiff in his fierce disdain
 albeit upon his feeble powers the peer
 could ill depend though from italian plain
 was driven the friend that aided him whilere
 and by the foe possessed was naples' reign
 he against menace against promise steeled
 ne'er to another would his dukedom yield

 xliii
 eastward king agramant had turned his prow
 and seaward steered his bark of africk wide
 when from the land a wicked wind 'gan blow
 and took the reeling vessel on one side
 the master seated at the helm his brow
 raised towards heaven and to the monarch cried
 "i see so fell and fierce a tempest form
 our pinnace cannot face the pelting storm

 xliv
 "if you my lords will listen to my lore
 an isle is on our lefthand and to me
 it seems that it were well to make that shore
 till overblown the tempest's fury be"
 to his advice assents the royal moor
 and makes the larboard land from peril free
 which for the sailor's weal when tempests rise
 'twixt vulcan's lofty forge and africk lies

 xlv
 with juniper and myrtle overgrown
 of habitations is that islet bare
 a pleasing solitude and where alone
 harbour wild stag and roebuck deer and hare
 and save to fishermen is little known
 that oftentimes on the shorn brambles there
 hang their moist nets meanwhile untroubled sleep
 the scaly fishes in their quiet deep

 xlvi
 here other vessel sheltered from the main
 they found by tempest tost upon that land
 which had conveyed the king of sericane
 erewhile from arles on one and the other hand
 in reverent wise and worthy of the twain
 those valiant kings embraced upon the strand
 for friends the monarchs were and late before
 the walls of paris arms together bore

 xlvii
 with much displeasure sericana's knight
 heard by king agramant his griefs displaid
 then him consoled and in his cause to fight
 like courteous king the kindly offer made
 but brooked nat that to egypt's people light
 and lacking faith he should resort for aid
 "that thither it is perilous to wend
 exiles he said are warned by pompey's end

 xlviii
 "and for senapus' aethiopian crew
 have come beneath astolpho as ye show
 to wrest your fruitful africa from you
 and burnt and laid her chiefest city low
 and with their squadrons is orlando who
 was wandering void of wit short while ago
 the fittest cure for all whereby to scape
 out of this trouble i meseems can shape

 xlix
 "i for your love will undertake the quest
 the count in single combat to appear
 he vainly would i wot with me contest
 if wholly made of copper or of steel
 i rate the christian church were he at rest
 as wolf rates lambs when hungering for his meal
 next have i thought how of the nubian band
  a brief and easy task  to free your land

 l
 "i will make other nubians they that hold
 another faith divided by nile's course
 and arabs and macrobians rich in gold
 and men are these and those in herds of horse
 chaldaean perse and many more controlled
 by my good sceptre in such mighty force
 will make them war upon the nubians' reign
 those reavers shall not in your land remain"

 li
 gradasso's second offer seemed to be
 most opportune to king troyano's son
 and much he blest the chances of the sea
 which him upon that desert isle had thrown
 yet would not upon any pact agree
  nay not to repossess biserta's town 
 gradasso should for him in fight contend
 deeming too sore his honour 'twoud offend

 lii
 "if roland is to be defied more due
 the battle is to me that king replies
 i am prepared for it and let god do
 his will by me in good or evil wise"
 "  follow my mode another mode and new
 which comes into my mind" gradasso cries
 "let both of us together wage this fight
 against orlando and another knight"

 liii
 "so not left out i care not if i be
 the first or last said agramant i know
 in arms no better can i find than thee
 though i should seek a comrade high or low
 and what sobrino cried becomes of me
 i should be more expert if old in show
 and evermore in peril it is good
 force should have counsel in his neighbourhood"

 liv
 stricken in years yet vigorous was the sage
 and well had proved himself with sword and spear
 and said he found himself in gray old age
 such as in green and supple youth whilere
 they own his claim and for an embassage
 forthwith a courier find then bid him steer
 for africa where camped the christians lie
 and count orlando on their part defy

 lv
 with equal number of armed knights to be
 matching his foes on lampedosa's shore
 where on all quarters that circumfluent sea
 by which they are inisled is heard to roar
 the paynim messenger unceasingly
 like one in needful haste used sail and oar
 till he found roland in biserta where
 the host beneath his eye their plunder share

 lvi
 from those three monarchs to the cavalier
 the invitation was in public told
 so pleasing to anglante's valiant peer
 to the herald he was liberal of his gold
 from his companions had he heard whilere
 that durindane was in gradasso's hold
 hence to retrieve that faulchion from the foe
 to india had the count resolved to go

 lvii
 deeming he should not find that king elsewhere
 who so he heard had sailed from the french shore
 a nearer place is offered now and there
 he hopes gradasso shall his prize restore
 moved also by almontes' bugle rare
 to accept the challenge which the herald bore
 nor less by brigliadoro since he knew
 in agramant's possession were the two

 lviii
 he chose for his companions in the fight
 the faithful brandimart and olivier
 well has he proved the one and the other's might
 knows he alike to both is passing dear
 good horses and good armour seeks the knight
 and goodly swords and lances far and near
 for him and his meseems to you is known
 how none of those three warriors had his own

 lix
 orlando as i oft have certified
 in fury his had scattered wide and far
 rodomont took the others' which beside
 the river locked in that high turret are
 few throughout africa could they provide
 as well because to france in that long war
 king agramant had born away the best
 as because africa but few possest

 lx
 what could be had of armour rusted o'er
 and brown with age orlando bids unite
 meanwhile with his companions on the shore
 he walks discoursing on the future fight
 so wandering from their camp three miles and more
 it chanced that turning towards the sea their sight
 under full sail approaching they descried
 a helmless barque with nought her course to guide

 lxi
 she without pilot without crew alone
 as wind and fortune ordered it was bound
 the vessel neared the shore with sails fullblown
 furrowing the waves until she took the ground
 but ere of these three warriors more be shown
 the love wherewith i to the child am bound
 to his story brings me back and bids record
 what past 'twixt him and clermont's warlike lord

 lxii
 i spake of that good pair of warriors who
 had both retreated from the martial fray
 beholding pact and treaty broken through
 and every troop and band in disarray
 which leader to his oath was first untrue
 and was occasion of such evil they
 study to learn of all the passing train
 king agramant or the emperor charlemagne

 lxiii
 meanwhile a servant of the child's at hand
  faithful expert and wary was the wight
 nor in the shock of either furious band
 had ever of his warlike lord lost sight 
 to bold rogero bore his horse and brand
 that he might aid his comrades now in flight
 rogero backed the steed and grasped the sword
 but not in battle mixed that martial lord

 lxiv
 thence he departed but he first renewed
 his compact with montalban's knight  that so
 his agramant convinced of perjury stood 
 him and his evil sect he would forego
 that day no further feats of hardihood
 rogero will perform against the foe
 he but demands of all that make for arles
 who first broke faith king agramant or charles

 lxv
 from all he hears repeated far and near
 that agramant had broke the promise plight
 he loves that king and from his side to veer
 for this believes would be no error light
 the moors were broke and scattered this whilere
 has been rehearsed and from the giddy height
 of her revolving wheel were downward hurled
 who at her pleasure rolls this nether world

 lxvi
 rogero ponders if he should remain
 or rather should his sovereign lord attend
 love for his lady fits him with a rein
 and bit which lets him not to africk wend
 wheels him and to a counter course again
 spurs him and threats his restive mood to shend
 save he maintains the treaty and the troth
 pledged to the paladin with solemn oath

 lxvii
 a wakeful stinging care on the other side
 scourges and goads no less the cavalier
 lest if he now from agramant divide
 he should be taxed with baseness or with fear
 if many deem it well he should abide
 to many and many it would ill appear
 many would say that oaths unbinding are
 which 'tis unlawful and unjust to swear

 lxviii
 he all that day and the ensuing night
 remains alone and so the following day
 forever sifting in his doubtful sprite
 if it be better to depart or stay
 lastly for agramant decides the knight
 to him in africk will he wend his way
 moved by his love for his liegelady sore
 but moved by honour and by duty more

 lxix
 he made for arles where yet he hoped would ride
 the fleet which him to africa might bear
 nor in the port nor offing ships espied
 nor saracens save dead beheld he there
 for agramant had swept the roadstead wide
 and burnt what vessels in the haven were
 rogero takes the road when his hope fails
 along the seabeat shore toward marseilles

 lxx
 upon some boat he hoped to lay his hand
 which him for love or force should thence convey
 already ogier's son had made the land
 with the barbarians' fleet his captive prey
 you could not there have cast a grain of sand
 between those vessels moored closely lay
 the mighty squadrons to that harbour brought
 with conquerors these and those with prisoners fraught

 lxxi
 the vessels of the moor that were not made
 the food of fire and water on that night
 saving some few that fled were all conveyed
 safe to marseilles by the victorious knight
 seven of those kings that moorish sceptres swayed
 who having seen their squadron put to flight
 with their seven ships had yielded to the foe
 stood mute and weeping overwhelmed with woe

 lxxii
 dudon had issued forth upon dry land
 bent to find charlemagne that very day
 and of the moorish spoil and captive band
 made in triumphal pomp a long display
 the prisoners all were ranged upon the strand
 and round them stood their nubian victors gay
 who shouting in his praise with loud acclaim
 made all that region ring with dudon's name

 lxxiii
 rogero when from far the ships he spied
 believed they were the fleet of agramant
 and to know further pricked his courser's side
 then nearer mid those knights of mickle vaunt
 nasamon's king a prisoner he desired
 agricalt bambirago farurant
 balastro manilardo and rimedont
 who stood with weeping eyes and drooping front

 lxxiv
 in their unhappy state to leave that crew
 the child who loved those monarchs cannot bear
 that useless is the empty hand he knew
 that where force is not little profits prayer
 he couched his lance their keeper overthrew
 then proved his wonted might with faulchion bare
 and in a moment stretched upon the strand
 above a hundred of the nubian band

 lxxv
 the noise sir dudon hears the slaughter spies
 but knows not who the stranger cavalier
 he marks how put to rout his people flies
 with anguish with lament and mighty fear
 quickly for courser shield and helmet cries
 bosom and arms and thighs were mailed whilere
 leaps on his horse nor  having seized his lance 
 forgets he is a paladin of france

 lxxvi
 he called on every one to stand aside
 and with the galling spur his courser prest
 meanwhile a hundred other foes have died
 and filled with hope was every prisoner's breast
 and as rogero holy dudon spied
 approach on horseback footmen were the rest
 esteeming him their head he charged the knight
 impelled by huge desire to prove his might

 lxxvii
 already on his part had moved the dane
 but when he saw the child without a spear
 he flang is own far from him in disdain
 to take such vantage of the cavalier
 admiring at sir dudon's courteous vein
 "belie himself he cannot" said the peer
 "and of those perfect warriors must be one
 that as the paladins of france are known

 lxxviii
 "if i my will can compass he shall shew
 his name to me ere further deed be done"
 he made demand and in the stranger knew
 dudon the danish ogier's valiant son
 he from rogero claimed an equal due
 and from the child as courteous answer won
  their names on either side announced  the foes
 a bold defiance speak and come to blows

 lxxix
 bold dudon had with him that iron mace
 which won him deathless fame in many a fight
 wherewith he proved him fully of the race
 of that good danish warrior famed for might
 that best of faulchions which through iron case
 of cuirass or of casque was wont to bite
 youthful rogero from the scabbard snatched
 and with the martial dane his valour matched

 lxxx
 but for the gentle youth was ever willed
 to offend his ladylove the least he could
 and knew he should offend her if he spilled
 in that disastrous battle dudon's blood
 well in the lineage of french houses skilled
 he wist of beatrice's sisterhood
  bradamant's mother she  with armelline
 the mother of the danish paladine

 lxxxi
 he therefore never thrust in that affray
 and rarely smote an edge on plate and chain
 now warding off the mace now giving way
 before the fall of that descending bane
 turpin believes it in rogero lay
 sir dudon in few swordstrokes to have slain
 yet never when the dane his guard foregoes
 save on the faulchion's flat descend the blows

 lxxxii
 the flat as featly as the edge he plies
 of that good faulchion forged of stubborn grain
 and at strange blindman's bluff in weary wise
 hammers on dudon with such might and main
 he often dazzles so the warrior's eyes
 that hardly he his saddle can maintain
 but to win better audience for my rhyme
 my canto i defer to other time


 canto 41

 argument
 his prisoners to the child the danish peer
 consigns who homeward bound are wrecked at sea
 by swimming he escapes and a sincere
 and faithful servant now of christ is he
 meanwhile bold brandimart and olivier
 and roland fiercely charge the hostile three
 sobrino is left wounded in the strife
 gradasso and agramant deprived of life


 i
 the odour which wellfashioned bear or hair
 of that which find and dainty raiment steeps
 of gentle stripling or of damsel fair
  who often love awakens as she weeps 
 if it ooze forth and scent the ambient air
 and which for many a day its virtue keeps
 well shows by manifest effects and sure
 how perfect was its first perfume and pure

 ii
 the drink that to his cost good icarus drew
 of yore his sunburned sicklemen to cheer
 and which 'tis said lured celts and boi through
 our alpine hills untouched by toil whilere
 well shows that cordial was the draught when new
 since it preserves its virtue through the year
 the tree to which its wintry foliage cleaves
 well shows that verdant were its spring tide leaves

 iii
 the famous lineage for so many years
 of courtesy the great and lasting light
 which ever brightening as it burns appears
 to shine and flame more clearly to the sight
 well proves the sire of este's noble peers
 must amid mortals have shone forth as bright
 in all fair gifts which raise men to the sky
 as the glad sun mid glittering orbs on high

 iv
 as in his every other feat exprest
 rogero's valiant mind and courteous lore
 were showed by tokens clear and manifest
 and his high mindedness shone more and more
  so toward the dane those virtues stood confest
 with whom as i rehearsed to you before
 he had belied his mighty strength and breath
 for pity loth to put that lord to death

 v
 the danish warrior was well certified
 no wish to slay him had the youthful knight
 who spared him now when open was his side
 now when so wearied he no more could smite
 when finally he knew and plain descried
 rogero scrupled to put forth his might
 if with less vigour and less prowess steeled
 at least in courtesy he would not yield

 vi
 "pardi sir make we peace" he said "success
 in this contention cannot fall to me 
 cannot be mine for i myself confess
 conquered and captive to thy courtesy"
 to him rogero answered "and no less
 i covet peace than 'tis desired by thee
 but this upon condition that those seven
 are freed from bondage and to me are given"

 vii
 with that he showed those seven whereof i spake
 bound and with drooping heads a sad array
 adding he must to him no hindrance make
 who would those kings to africa convey
 and dudon thus allowed the child to take
 those seven and him allowed to bear away
 a bark as well what likes him best he chooses
 amid those vessels and for africk looses

 viii
 he looses bark and sail and in bold wise
 trusting the fickle wind to seaward stood
 at first on her due course the vessel flies
 and fills the pilot full of hardihood
 the beach retreats and from the sailors' eyes
 so fades the sea appears a shoreless flood
 upon the darkening of the day the wind
 displays its fickle and perfidious kind

 ix
 it shifts from poop to beam from beam to prow
 and even there short season doth remain
 the reeling ship confounds the pilot now
 struck fore now aft now on her beam again
 threatening the billows rise with haughty brow
 and neptune's white herd lows above the main
 as many deaths appear to daunt that rout
 as waves which beat their troubled bark about

 x
 now blows the wind in front and now in rear
 and drives this wave anend that other back
 others the reeling vessel's side o'erpeer
 and every billow threatens equal wrack
 the pilot sighs confused and pale with fear
 vainly he calls aloud to shift the tack
 to strike or jibe the yard and with his hand
 signs to the crew the thing he would command

 xi
 but sound or signal little boots the eye
 sees not amid the dim and rainy night
 the voice unheard ascends into the sky 
 the sky which with a louder larum smite
 the troubled sailors' universal cry
 and roar of waters which together fight
 unheard is every hest above below
 starboard or larboard upon poop or prow

 xii
 in the strained tackle sounds a hollow roar
 wherein the struggling wind its fury breaks
 the forked lightning flashes evermore
 with fearful thunder heaven's wide concave shakes
 one to the rudder runs one grasps an oar
 each to his several office him betakes
 one will make fast another will let go
 water into the water others throw

 xiii
 lo howling horribly the sounding blast
 which boreas in his sudden fury blows
 scourges with tattered sail the reeling mast
 almost as high as heaven the water flows
 the oars are broken and so fell and fast
 that tempest pelts the prow to leeward goes
 and the ungoverned vessel's battered side
 is undefended from the foaming tide

 xiv
 fallen on her starboard side on her beam ends
 about to turn keel uppermost she lies
 meanwhile his soul to heaven each recommends
 surer than sure to sink with piteous cries
 scathe upon scathe malicious fortune sends
 and when one woe is weathered others rise
 o'erstrained the vessel splits and through her seams
 in many a part the hostile water streams

 xv
 a fierce assault and cruel coil doth keep
 upon all sides that wintry tempest fell
 now to their sight so high the billows leap
 it seems that these to heaven above would swell
 now plunging with the wave they sink so deep
 that they appear to spy the gulfs of hell
 small hope there is or none with faultering breath
 they gaze upon inevitable death

 xvi
 on a despiteous sea that livelong night
 they drifted as the wind in fury blew
 the furious wind that with the dawning light
 should have abated gathered force anew
 lo a bare rock ahead appears in sight
 which vainly would the wretched band eschew
 whom towards that cliff in their despite impel
 the raging tempest and the roaring swell

 xvii
 three times and four the palefaced pilot wrought
 the tiller with a vigorous push to sway
 and for the bark a surer passage sought
 but the waves snapt and bore the helm away
 to lower or ease the bellying canvas aught
 the sailors had no power nor time had they
 to mend that ill or counsel what was best
 for them too hard the mortal peril prest

 xviii
 perceiving now that nothing can defend
 their bark from wreck on that rude rock and bare
 all to their private aims alone attend
 and only to preserve their life have care
 who quickest can into the skiff descend
 but in a thought so overcrowded are
 through those so many who invade the boat
 that gunwaledeep she scarce remains afloat

 xix
 rogero on beholding master mate
 and men abandoning the ship with speed
 in doublet as he is sans mail and plate
 hopes in the skiff a refuge in that need
 but finds her overcharged with such a weight
 and afterwards so many more succeed
 that the o'erwhelming wave the pinnace drown
 and she with all her wretched freight goes down

 xx
 goes down and foundering drags with her whoe'er
 leaving the larger bark on her relies
 then doleful shrieks are heard 'mid sob and tear
 calling for succour on unpitying skies
 but for short space that shrilling cry they rear
 for swoln with rage and scorn the waters rise
 and in a moment wholly stop the vent
 whence issues that sad clamour and lament

 xxi
 one sinks outright no more to reappear
 some rise and bounding with the billows go
 their course with head uplifted others steer
 an arm an unshod leg those others show
 rogero who the tempest will not fear
 springs upward to the surface from below
 and little distant sees that rock in vain
 eschewed by him and his attendant train

 xxii
 himself with hands and feet the warrior rows
 hoping by force thereof to win the shore
 breast boldly the importunate flood and blows
 with his unwearied breath the foam before
 waxing meanwhile the troubled water rose
 and from the rock the abandoned vessel bore
 quitted of those unhappy men who die
 so curst their lot the death from which they fly

 xxiii
 alas for man's deceitful thoughts and blind
 the ship escaped from wreck where hope was none
 when master and when men their charge resigned
 and let the vessel without guidance run
 it would appear the wind has changed its mind
 on seeing all that sailed in her are gone
 and blows the vessel from those shallows free
 through better course into a safer sea

 xxiv
 she having drifted wildly with her guide
 without him made directly africk's strand
 two or three miles of waste biserta wide
 upon the quarter facing egypt's land
 and as the sea went down and the wind died
 stood bedded in that weary waste of sand
 now thither roland roved who paced the shore
 as i in other strain rehearsed before

 xxv
 and willing to discover if alone
 laden or light the stranded vessel were
 he olivier and monodantes' son
 aboard her in a shallow bark repair
 beneath the hatchways they descend but none
 of human kind they see and only there
 find good frontino with the trenchant sword
 and gallant armour of his youthful lord

 xxvi
 who was so hurried in his hasty flight
 he had not even time to take his sword
 to orlando known which balisardo hight
 was his erewhile the tale's upon record
 and ye have read it all as well i wite
 how falerina lost it to that lord
 when waste as well her beauteous bowers he laid
 and how from him brunello stole the blade

 xxvii
 and how beneath carena on the plain
 brunello on rogero this bestowed
 how matchless was that faulchion's edge and grain
 to him experience had already showed
 i say orlando who was therefore fain
 and to heaven's king with grateful thanks o'erflowed
 and deemed and often afterwards so said
 heaven for such pressing need had sent the blade

 xxviii
 such pressing need in that he had to fight
 with the redoubted king of sericane
 and knew that he besides his fearful might
 was lord of bayard and of durindane
 not knowing them anglantes' valiant knight
 so highly rated not the plate and chain
 as he that these had proved they valour were
 but valued less as good than rich and fair

 xxix
 and for of harness he had little need
 charmed and against all weapons fortified
 to olivier he left the warlike weed
 not so the sword which to his waist he tied
 to brandimart orlando gave the steed
 thus equally that spoil would he divide
 with his companions twain in equal share
 who partners in that rich discovery were

 xxx
 against the day of fight in goodly gear
 and new those warriors seek their limbs to deck
 blazoned upon orlando's shield appear
 the burning bold and lofty babel's wreck
 a lymedog argent bears sir olivier
 couchant and with the leash upon his neck
 the motto till he comes in gilded vest
 and worthy of himself he will be drest

 xxxi
 bold brandimart designed upon the day
 of battle for his royal father's sake
 and his own honour no device more gay
 than a dim surcoat to the field to take
 by gentle flordelice for that dark array
 was wrought the fairest facing she could make
 with costly jewels was the border sown
 sable the vest and of one piece alone

 xxxii
 with her own hand the lady wrought that vest
 becoming well the finest plate and chain
 wherein the valiant warrior should be drest
 and cloak his courser's croup and chest and mane
 but from that day when she herself addrest
 unto this task till ended was her pain
 she showed no sign of gladness nor this while
 nor after was she ever seen to smile

 xxxiii
 the heartfelt fear the torment evermore
 of losing brandimart the dame pursued
 she him whilere a hundred times and more
 engaged in fierce and fearful fight had viewed
 nor ever suchlike terror heretofore
 had blanched her cheek and froze her youthful blood
 and this new sense of fear increased her trouble
 and made the trembling lady's heart beat double

 xxxiv
 the warriors to the wind their canvas rear
 when point device the three accoutred are
 bold sansonet is left with england's peer
 intrusted with the faithful army's care
 flordelice pricked at heart with cruel fear
 filling the heavens with vow lament and prayer
 as far as they by sight can followed be
 follows their sails upon the foaming sea

 xxxv
 scarce with much labour the two captains led
 her gazing on the waters from the shore
 and to the palace drew where on her bed
 they left the lady grieved and trembling sore
 meanwhile upon their quest those others sped
 whom mercy wind and weather seaward bore
 their vessel made that island on the right
 the field appointed for so fell a fight

 xxxvi
 orlando disembarks with his array
 his kinsman olivier and brandimart
 who on the side which fronts the eastern ray
 encamp them and not haply without art
 king agramant arrives that very day
 and tents him on the contrary part
 but for the sun is sinking fast forborne
 is their encounter till the following morn

 xxxvii
 until the skies the dawning light receive
 armed servants keep their watch both there and here
 the valiant brandimart resorts that eve
 thitherward where their tents the paynims rear
 and parleys by this noble leader's leave
 with agramant for they were friends whilere
 and underneath the banner of the moor
 he into france had passed from africk's shore

 xxxviii
 after salutes and joining hand with hand
 fair reasons as a friend the faithful knight
 pressed on the leader of the paynim band
 why he should not the appointed battle fight
 and every town  restored to his command 
 laying 'twixt nile and calpe's rocky height
 vowed he with roland's license should receive
 if upon mary's son he would believe

 xxxix
 he said "for loved you were and are by me
 this counsel give i that i deem it sane
 since i pursue it you assured must be
 mahound i hold but as an idol vain
 in jesus christ the living god i see
 and to conduct you in my way were fain
 i' the way of safety fain would have you move
 with me and all those others that i love

 xl
 "in this consists your welfare counsel none
 save this in your disaster can avail
 and of all counsels least good milo's son
 to meet in combat clad in plate and mail
 in that the profit if the field be won
 weighs not against the loss in equal scale
 if you be conqueror little gain ensues
 yet little loss results not if you lose

 xli
 "were good orlando and we others slain
 banded with him to conquer or to die
 wherefore through this ye should your lost domain
 acquire anew forsooth i see not i
 nor is there reason hope to entertain
 that if we lifeless on the champaigne lie
 men should be wanting in king charles's host
 to guard in africa his paltriest post"

 xlii
 thus brandimart to afick's cavalier
 and much would have subjoined but on his side
 that knight with angry voice and haughty cheer
 the pagan interrupted and replied
 " `tis sure temerity and madness sheer
 moves you and whatsoever wight beside
 that counsels matter be it good or ill
 uncalled a counsellor's duty to fulfil

 xliii
 "and how to think from love those counsels flow
 which once you bore and bear me as you say
 to speak the very truth i do not know
 who with orlando see you here this day
 i ween that knowing you are doomed to woe
 and marked for the devouring dragon's prey
 ye all mankind would drag to nether hell
 in your eternity of pains to dwell

 xliv
 "if i shall win or lose remount my throne
 or pass my future days in exile drear
 god only knows whose purpose is unknown
 to me in turn or to anglantes' peer
 befall what may by me shall nought be done
 unworthy of a king through shameful fear
 if death must be my certain portion i
 rather than wrong my princely blood will die

 xlv
 "ye may depart who save ye better play
 the warrior in tomorrow's listed fight
 then ye have plaid the embassador today
 in arms will second ill anglantes' knight"
 agramant ended so his furious say
  his angry bosom boiling with despite
 so said  the warriors parted to repose
 till from the neighbouring sea the day arose

 xlvi
 when the first whitening of the dawn was seen
 armed in a moment leapt on horseback all
 short parley past the puissant foes between
 there was no stop there was no interval
 for they have laid in rest their lances keen
 but i into too foul a fault should fall
 meseems my lord if while their deeds i tell
 i let rogero perish in the swell

 xlvii
 cleaving the flood with nimble hands and feet
 he swims amid the horrid surges' roar
 on him the threatening wind and tempest beat
 but him his harassed conscience vexes more
 christ's wrath he fears and since in waters sweet
 when time and fair occasion served of yore
 he in his folly baptism little prized
 fears in these bitter waves to be baptized

 xlviii
 those many promises remembered are
 whereby he to his ladylove was tied
 those oaths which sworn to good rinaldo were
 and were in nought fulfilled upon his side
 to god in hope that he would hear and spare
 that he repented oftentimes he cried
 and should he land and scape that mortal scaith
 to be a christian vowed in heart and faith

 xlix
 and ne'er in succour of the moorish train
 with sword or lance the faithful to offend
 and into france where he to charlemagne
 would render honour due forthwith to wend
 nor bradamant with idle words again
 to cheat but bring his love to honest end
 a miracle it is that as he vows
 he swims more lightly and his vigour grows

 l
 his vigour grows unwearied is his mind
 and still his arms from him the billow throw
 this billow followed fast by that behind
 whereof one lifts him high one sinks him low
 rising and falling vext by wave and wind
 so gains the child that shore with labour slow
 and where the rocky hill slopes seaward most
 all drenched and dropping climbs the rugged coast

 li
 all the others that had plunged into the flood
 in the end o'erwhelmed by those wild waters died
 rogero as to providence seemed good
 mounted the solitary islet's side
 when safe upon the barren rock he stood
 a new alarm the stripling terrified
 to be within those narrow bounds confined
 and die with hardship and with hunger pined

 lii
 yet he with an unconquered heart intent
 to suffer what the heavens for him ordained
 o'er those hard stones against that steep ascent
 towards the top with feet intrepid strained
 and not a hundred yards had gone when bent
 with years and with long fast and vigil stained
 he worthy of much worship one espied
 in hermit's weed descend the mountain's side

 liii
 who cries on his approaching him "saul saul
 why persecutest thou my faithful seed"
 as whilom said the saviour to saint paul
 when blessed stroke he smote him from his steed
 "thou thought'st to pass the sea nor pay withal
 thought'st to defraud the pilot of his meed
 thou seest that god has arms to reach and smite
 when farthest off thou deem'st that god of might"

 liv
 and he that holiest anchoret pursued
 to whom the night foregoing god did send
 a vision as he slumbered and foreshewed
 how thither by his aid the child should wend
 wherein his past and future life reviewed
 were seen as well as his unhappy end
 and sons and grandsons and his every heir
 fully revealed to that good hermit were

 lv
 that anchoret pursues and does upbraid
 rogero first and comforts finally
 upbraideth him because he had delaid
 beneath that easy yoke to bend the knee
 and what he should have done when whilom prayed
 and called of christ  then uncompelled and free 
 had done with little grace nor turned to god
 until he saw him threatening with the rod

 lvi
 then comforts him  that christ aye heaven allows
 to them that late or early heaven desire
 and all those labourers of the gospel shows
 paid by the vineyard's lord with equal hire
 with charity and warm devotion glows
 and him instructs the venerable sire
 as toward the rocky cell where he resides
 he with weak steps and slow rogero guides

 lvii
 above that hallowed cell on the hill's brow
 a little church receives the rising day
 commodious is the fane and fair enow
 thence to the beach descends a thicket gray
 where fertile and fruitbearing palmtrees blow
 myrtle and lowly juniper and bay
 evermore threaded by a limpid fountain
 which falls with ceaseless murmur from the mountain

 lviii
 'twas well nigh forty years since on that stone
 the goodly friar had fixed his quiet seat
 which there to live a holy life alone
 for him the saviour chose as harbourage meet
 pure water was his drink and plucked from one
 or the other plant wild berries were his meat
 and hearty and robust of ailments clear
 the holy man had reached his eightieth year

 lix
 that hermit lit a fire and heaped the board
 with different fruits within his small repair
 wherewith the child somedeal his strength restored
 when he had dried his clothes and dripping hair
 after at better ease to him god's word
 and mysteries of our faith expounded were
 and the day following in his fountain clear
 that anchoret baptized the cavalier

 lx
 there dwells the young rogero well content
 with what the rugged sojourn does allow
 in that the friar showed shortly his intent
 to send him where he fain would turn his prow
 meanwhile with him he many an argument
 handles and often of god's kingdom now
 now of things appertaining to his case
 now to rogero's blood a future race

 lxi
 the lord that every thing doth see and hear
 had to that holiest anchoret bewrayed
 how he should not exceed the seventh year
 dating from when he was a christian made
 who for the death of pinabel whilere
 his lady's deed but on rogero laid
 as well as bertolagi's should be slain
 by false maganza's ill and impious train

 lxii
 and how that treason should be smothered so
 no sign thereof should outwardly appear
 for where that evil people dealt the blow
 they should entomb the youthful cavalier
 for this should vengeance follow albeit slow
 dealt by his consort and his sister dear
 and how he by his wife should long be sought
 with weary womb with heavy burden fraught

 lxiii
 'twixt brenta and athesis beneath those hills
 which erst the good antenor so contented
 with their sulphureous veins and liquid rills
 and mead and field with furrows glad indented
 that he for these left pools which xanthus fills
 and ida and ascanius long lamented
 till she a child should in the forests bear
 which little distant from ateste are

 lxiv
 and how the child in might and beauty grown
 that like his sire rogero shall be hight
 those trojans as of trojan lineage known
 shall for their lord elect with solemn rite
 who next by charles in succour of whose crown
 against the lombards shall the stripling fight
 of that fair land dominion shall obtain
 and the honoured title of a marquis gain

 lxv
 and because charles shall say in latin `este'
 that is  be lords of the dominion round
 entitled in a future season este
 shall with good omen be that beauteous ground
 and thus its ancient title of ateste
 shall of its two first letters lose the sound
 god also to his servant had foresaid
 the vengeance taken for rogero's dead

 lxvi
 who shall in vision to his consort true
 appear somedeal before the dawn of day
 and shall relate how him the traitor slew
 and where his body lies to her shall say
 she and marphisa hence those valiant two
 with fire and sword on earth shall poictiers lay
 nor shall his son when of befitting age
 less harm maganza in his mighty rage

 lxvii
 on azos alberts obysons did dwell
 that hermit hoar and on their offspring bright
 or borso nicholas and leonel
 alphonso hercules and hippolyte
 and last of those the gentle isabel
 then curbs his tongue and will no more recite
 he to rogero what is fit reveals
 and what is fitting to conceal conceals

 lxviii
 meanwhile orlando and bold brandimart
 with that good knight the marquis olivier
 against the paynim mars together start
 name well befitting sericana's peer
 and the other two  that from the adverse part
 at more than a footpace their coursers steer
 i say king agramant and king sobrine
 the pebbly beach resounds and rolling brine

 lxix
 when they encounter in mid field pellmell
 and to the sky flew every shivered lance
 at that loud noise the sea was seen to swell
 at that loud noise which echoed even to france
 gradasso and roland met as it befel
 and fairly balanced might appear the chance
 but for the vantage of rinaldo's horse
 which made gradasso seem of greater force

 lxx
 baiardo shocked the steed of lesser might
 backed by orlando with such might and main
 he made that courser stagger left and right
 and measure next his length upon the plain
 vainly to raise him strove anglantes' knight
 thrice nay four times with rowels and with rein
 balked of his end he lights upon the field
 draws balisarda and uplifts his shield

 lxxi
 with agramant encounters olivier
 who fitly matched their foaming coursers gall
 bold brandimart unhorsed in the career
 sobrino but it was not plain withal
 if 'twas the fault of horse or cavalier
 for seldom good sobrino used to fall
 was it his courser's or his own misdeed
 sobrino found himself without a steed

 lxxii
 now brandimart that upon earth descried
 the king sobrine assailed no more his man
 but at gradasso who anglantes' pride
 had equally unhorsed in fury ran
 on agramant and oliviero's side
 meanwhile the warfare stood as it began
 when broken on their bucklers were the spears
 with swords encountered the returning peers

 lxxiii
 roland who saw gradasso in such guise
 as showed that to return he little cared
  nor can return so brandimart aye plies
 and presses sericana's monarch hard
 turns round and like himself afoot descries
 sobrino in the doubtful strife unpaired
 at him he sprang and at his haughty look
 heaven as the warrior trod in terror shook

 lxxiv
 foreseeing the assault with wary eye
 prepared and at close ward behold the moor
 as pilot against whom now cresting nigh
 the threatening billow comes with hollow roar
 towards it turns his prow and when so high
 he views the sea would gladly be ashore
 sobrino rears his buckler to withstand
 the furious fall of falerina's brand

 lxxv
 of such fine steel was balisarda's blade
 that arms against it little shelter were
 and by a person of such puissance swayed
 by roland singe in the world or rare
 it splits the shield and is in nowise stayed
 though bound about with steel the edges are
 it splits the shield and to the bottom rends
 and on the shoulder underneath descends

 lxxvi
 upon the shoulder nor though twisted chain
 and double plates encase the paynim foe
 these hinder much that sword of stubborn grain
 from opening wide the parted flesh below
 sobrino at orlando smites but vain
 against the valiant count is every blow
 to whom for special grace the king of heaven
 a body charmed against all arms had given

 lxxvii
 the valorous count redoubling still his blows
 thought from the trunk the monarch's head to smite
 sobrino who the strength of clermont knows
 and how the shield ill boots retired from fight
 yet not so far but that upon his brows
 fell the dread faulchion of anglantes' knight
 'twas on its flat but such his might and main
 it crushed the helm and stupefied the brain

 lxxviii
 stunned by that furious stroke he pressed the shore
 and it was long ere he again did rise
 the paladin believes the warfare o'er
 and that deprived of life sobrino lies
 and lest gradasso to ill pass and sore
 should bring sir brandimart at him he flies
 for him the paynim overmatched in horse
 in arms and faulchion and perhaps in force

 lxxix
 bold brandimart who guides frontino's rein
 the goodly courser erst rogero's steed
 so well contends with him of sericane
 the king yet little seems his foe to exceed
 who if he had as tempered plate and chain
 as that bold paynim lord would better speed
 but for he felt himself illarmed the knight
 often gave ground and traversed left and right

 lxxx
 better than good frontino horse is none
 to obey upon a sign the cavalier
 'twould seem that courser had the sense to shun
 sharp durindana's fall now there now here
 meanwhile elsewhere is horrid battle done
 by royal agramant and olivier
 who may be deemed well matched in warlike sleight
 nor champions differing much in martial might

 lxxxi
 orlando had left sobrino as i said
 on earth and against sericana's pride
 desirous valiant brandimart to aid
 even as he was afoot in fury hied
 when prompt to assail gradasso with the blade
 he loose and walking in mid field espied
 the goodly horse which had sobrino thrown
 and bowned him straight to make the steed his own

 lxxxii
 he seized the horse for none the deed gainsaid
 and took a leap and vaulted on his prize
 this hand the bridle grasped and that the blade
 orlando's motions good gradasso spies
 nor at his coming is the king dismaid
 who by his name the paladin defies
 with him and both his partners in the fight
 he hopes to make it dark before 'tis night

 lxxxiii
 leaving his foe he facing brava's lord
 thrust at the collar of his shirt of mail
 all else beside the flesh the faulchion bored
 to pierce through which would every labour fail
 at the same time descends orlando's sword
 where balisarda bites no spells avail
 shears helmet cuirass shield and all below
 and cleaves whate'er it rakes with headlong blow

 lxxxiv
 and in face bosom and in thigh it seamed
 beneath his mail the king of sericane
 from whom his blood till how had never streamed
 since he that armour wore new rage and pain
 thereat the warrior felt and strange it seemed
 sword cut so now nor yet was durindane
 had roland struck more home or nearer been
 from head to belly he had cleft him clean

 lxxxv
 no more in arms can trust the cavalier
 as heretofore for proved those arms have been
 he with more care more caution than whilere
 prepares to parry with the faulchion keen
 when entered brandimart sees brava's peer
 who snatched that battle from him he between
 those other conflicts placed himself that where
 it most was needed he might succour bear

 lxxxvi
 while so the fight is balanced 'mid those foes
 sobrino that on earth long time had lain
 when to himself he was returned uprose
 in face and shoulder suffering grievous pain
 he lifts his face his eyes about him throws
 and thither where more distant on the plain
 he sees his leader with long paces steers
 so stealthily that none his coming hears

 lxxxvii
 he on the marquis came who had but eyes
 for agramant and in the warrior's rear
 wounded upon the hocks in such fierce wise
 the courser of unheeding olivier
 that he falls headlong and beneath him lies
 his valiant master nor his foot can clear
 his left foot which in that unthought for woe
 was in the stirrup jammed his steed below

 lxxxviii
 sorbine pursued and with backhanded blow
 thought he his head should from his neck have shorn
 but this forbids that armour bright of show
 by vulcan hammered and by hector worn
 brandimart sees his risque and at the foe
 is by his steed with flowing bridle borne
 sobrino on the head he smote and flung
 but straight from earth that fierce old man upsprung

 lxxxix
 and turned anew to olivier to speed
 the warrior's soul more promptly on its way
 or at the least that baron to impede
 and him beneath his courser keep at bay
 bold olivier whose better arm was freed
 and with his sword could fend him as he lay
 meanwhile so smites and longes there and here
 that at sword's length he holds the ancient peer

 xc
 he hopes if him but little he withstood
 he shall be straight delivered from that pain
 he sees him wholly strained and wet with blood
 and that he spills so much from open vein
 'twould seem he speedily must be subdued
 so weak he hardly can himself sustain
 often and oft to rise the marquis strove
 yet could not from beneath his courser move

 xci
 brandimart has found out the royal moor
 and storms about that paynim cavalier
 upon frontino like a lathe before
 beside or whirling in the warrior's rear
 a goodly horse the christian champion bore
 nor worse the southern king's in the career
 that brigliador rogero's gift he crost
 erewhile by haughty mandricardo lost

 xcii
 great vantage has he on another part
 of proof and perfect is his iron weed
 his at a venture took sir brandimart
 as he could have in haste in suchlike need
 but hopes his anger puts him so in heart
 to change it for a better coat with speech
 albeit the moorish king with bitter blow
 has made the blood from his right should flow

 xciii
 him in the flank gradasso too had gored
 nor this was laughing matter so had scanned
 his vantage that redoubted paynim lord
 he found a place wherein to plant his brand
 he broke the warrior's shield his left arm bored
 and touched him slightly in the better hand
 but this was play was pastime might be said
 with roland's and gradasso's battle weighed

 xciv
 gradasso has orlando half disarmed
 atop and on both sides his helm has broke
 fallen is his shield his cuirass split but harmed
 the warrior is not by the furious stroke
 which opened plate and mail for he is charmed
 and worser vengeance on the king has wroke
 in face throat breast has gored that cavalier
 beside the wounds whereof i spake whilere

 xcv
 gradasso desperate when he descried
 himself all wet and smeared with sanguine dye
 and roland all from head to foot espied
 after such mighty strokes unstained and dry
 thinking head breast and belly to divide
 with both his hands upheaved his sword on high
 and even as he devised upon the front
 smote with mid blade anglantes' haughty count

 xcvi
 and would by any other so have done
  would to the saddletree have cleft him clean
 but the good sword as if it fell upon
 its flat rebounds again unstained and sheen
 the furious stroke astounded milo's son
 by whom some scattered stars on earth were seen
 he drops the bridle and would drop the brand
 but that a chain secures it to his hand

 xcvii
 so by the noise was scared the horse that bore
 upon his back anglantes' cavalier
 the courser scowered about the powdery shore
 showing how good his speed in the career
 the county by that stroke astounded sore
 has not the power the frightened horse to steer
 gradasso follows and will reach him so
 that he but little more pursues the foe

 xcviii
 but turning round beholds the royal moor
 to the utmost peril in that battle brought
 for by the shining helmet which he wore
 with the left hand him brandimart had caught
 already had unlaced the casque before
 and with his dagger would new ill have wrought
 nor much defence could make the moorish lord
 for brandimart as well had reft his sword

 xcix
 gradasso turned nor more orlando sought
 but hastened where he agramant espied
 the incautious brandimart suspecting nought
 orlando would have let him turn aside
 had not gradasso in his eyes or thought
 and to the paynim's throat his knife applied
 gradasso came and at his helmet layed
 wielding with either hand his trenchant blade

 c
 father of heaven 'mid spirits chosen by thee
 to him thy martyr true a place accord
 who having traversed his tempestuous sea
 now furls his sails in port ah ruthless sword
 so cruel durindana can'st thou be
 to good orlando to thine ancient lord
 that thou can'st slaughter in the warrior's view
 of all his friends the dearest and most true

 ci
 an iron ring that girt his helmet round
 two inches thick was broke by that fell blow
 and cleft and with the solid iron bound
 was parted the good cap of steel below
 bold brandimart reversed upon the ground
 with haggard face beside his horse lies low
 and issuing widely from the warrior's head
 a stream of lifeblood dyes the shingle red

 cii
 come to himself the county turns his eye
 and sees his brandimart upon the plain
 and in such act gradasso standing by
 as clearly shows by whom the knight was slain
 if he most raged or grieved i know not i
 but such short time is left him to complain
 his hasty wrath breaks forth his grief gives way
 but now 'tis time that i suspend my lay


 canto 42

 argument
 the victory with count orlando lies
 but good rinaldo and bradamant at heart
 one for angelica the other sighs
 for young rogero suffer cruel smart
 him that in chase of the indian damsel hies
 disdain preserves from thence does he depart
 towards italy and is with courteous cheer
 and welcome guested by a cavalier


 i
 what bit what iron curb is to be found
 or could it be what adamantine rein
 that can make wrath keep order and due bound
 and within lawful limits him contain
 when one to whom the constant heart is bound
 and linked by love with solid bolt and chain
 we see through violence or through foul deceit
 with mortal damage or dishonour meet

 ii
 and is the mind sometimes if so possest
 to ill and savage action led astray
 it may deserve excuse in that the breast
 no more is under reason's sovereign sway
 achilles when beneath his borrowed crest
 he saw patroclus crimsoning the way
 was with his murderer's slaughter ill content
 till he his mangled corse had dragged and shent

 iii
 unconquered duke alphonso anger so
 inflamed thy host the day that weighty stone
 wounded thy forehead with such grievous blow
 that all believed it to its rest was gone
  inflamed them with such fury for the foe
 in rampart fosse or wall defence was none
 who one and all within their works lay dead
 nor wight was left the woeful news to spread

 iv
 seeing thy fall caused thine such mighty pain
 they were to fury moved hadst thou my lord
 maintained thy footing haply might thy train
 have with less licence plied the murderous sword
 enough for thee thy bastia to regain
 in fewer hours replaced beneath thy ward
 then cordova's and fierce granada's band
 took days erewhile to wrest it from thy hand

 v
 haply heaven's vengeance ordered what befel
 and in that case thy wound so hindered thee
 to the end the cruel outrage foul and fell
 done by that band before should punished be
 for after the unhappy vestidel
 wearied and hurt had sought their clemency
 among them mostly an unchristened train
 he mid a hundred swords unarmed was slain

 vi
 to end i say that other rage is none
 which can be weighed with that in equal wise
 which kindles when an injury is done
 to kinsman friend or lord before our eyes
 then justly in orlando's heart for one
 so dear to him might sudden fury rise
 when him he saw extended on the sand
 slain by the stroke of fierce gradasso's brand

 vii
 as nomade swain who darting on its way
 in slippery line the horrid snake has seen
 that his young son amid the sands at play
 has killed with venomed tooth enflamed with spleen
 grasps his batoon the poisonous worm to slay
 his sword than every other sword more keen
 so in his fury grasped anglantes' knight
 and wreaked on agramant his first despite

 viii
 scaped bleeding with helm loosened form his head
 with half a shield and swordless through his mail
 sore wounded in more places than is said
 as from the dull or envious falcon's nail
 escapes the unhappy sparrowhawk half dead
 with ruffled plumage and with loss of tail
 on him orlando came and smote him just
 where with the helmed head confined the bust

 ix
 loosed was the helm the neck without its band
 so like a rush was severed by the sword
 downfell and shook its last upon the sand
 the heavy trunk of libya's mighty lord
 his spirit which flitted to the stygian strand
 charon with crooked boathook dragged aboard
 on him orlando wastes no further pain
 but sword in hand seeks him of sericane

 x
 as the headless trunk of africk's cavalier
 extended on the shore gradasso's viewed
 what never had befallen him whilere
 he shook at heart a troubled visage shewed
 and at the coming of anglantes' peer
 presageful of his fate appears subdued
 nor seeks he means of fence against his foe
 when fierce orlando deals the fatal blow

 xi
 orlando levels at his better side
 beneath the lowest rib his faulchion bright
 and crimsoned to the hilt a hand's breadth wide
 of the other flank the sword appears in sight
 and well his mighty puissance testified
 and spoke him as the strongest living knight
 that stroke by which a warrior was undone
 better than whom in paynimry was none

 xii
 little his victory good orlando cheers
 himself he quickly from his saddle throws
 and with a face disturbed and wet with tears
 to his brandimart in haste the warrior goes
 the field about him red with blood appears
 his helmet cleft as by a hatchet's blows
 and had it been than spungy rind more frail
 would have defended him no worse than mail

 xiii
 orlando lifts the helmet and descries
 brandimart's head by that destructive brand
 cleft even to his nose between the eyes
 yet so the wounded knight his spirits manned
 that pardon of the king of paradise
 he before death was able to demand
 and to exhort to patience brava's peer
 whose manly cheeks were wet with many a tear

 xiv
 and  "roland in thy helping orisons i
 beseech thee to remember me" he cried
 "nor recommend to thee less warmly my "
  flordelice would but could not say  and died
 and sounds and songs of angels in the sky
 as the soul parts are heard on every side
 which from its prison freed mid hymns of love
 ascends into the blissful realms above

 xv
 orlando albeit he should joy in heart
 at death so holy and is certified
 that called to bliss above is brandimart
 for he heaven opened to the knight described
 through human wilfulness  which aye takes part
 with our weak senses  hardly can abide
 the loss of one above a brother dear
 nor can refrain from many a scalding tear

 xvi
 warlike sobrino of much blood bereaved
 which from his flank and wounded visage rained
 long since had fallen reversed and sore aggrieved
 and had by now his vessels well nigh drained
 olivier too lies stretched nor has retrieved
 nor can retrieve his crippled foot save sprained
 and almost crushed so long between the plain
 and his stout courser jammed the limb has lain

 xvii
 and but orlando helped so woe begone
 was weeping olivier and brought so low
 he could not have released his limb alone
 and when released endures such pain such woe
 the helpless warrior cannot stand upon
 or shift withal his wounded foot and so
 benumbed and crippled is the leg above
 that he without assistance cannot move

 xviii
 the victory brought orlando small delight
 on whom too heavily and hardly weighed
 of slaughtered brandimart the piteous sight
 nor sure of oliviero's life he made
 sobrino yet survived but little light
 the wounded monarch had amid much shade
 for almost spend his ebbing life remained
 so fast from him the crimson blood had drained

 xix
 the county has him taken bleeding sore
 thither where he is saved with sovereign care
 and he as if a kinsman of the moor
 benignly comforts him and speaks him fair
 for in orlando when the strife was o'er
 was nothing evil ever prompt to spare
 he from the dead their arms and coursers reft
 the rest he to their knives' disposal left

 xx
 here as my story stood not on good ground
 frederick fulgoso doubtful does appear
 who searching barbary's every shore and sound
 erewhile on board a squadron landed here
 and the isle so rugged and so rocky found
 in all its parts so mountainous and drear
 there is not through the land a level space
 he says whereon a single boot to place

 xxi
 nor deems he likely that six cavaliers
 the wide world's flower on alpine rock should vye
 in that equestrian fight with levelled spears
 to whose objection thus i make reply
 erewhile a place well fit for such careers
 stretched at the bottom of the hills did lie
 but afterwards o'erthrown by earthquake's shock
 a cliff o'erspread the plain with broken rock

 xxii
 so of fulgoso's race thou shining ray
 clear lasting light if questioning my word
 thou on this point hast ever said me nay
 and haply too before the unconquered lord
 through whom thy land reposing casts away
 all haste and wholly leans to kind accord
 prythee delay not to declare that i
 in this my story haply tell no lie

 xxiii
 meanwhile his eyes the good orlando reared
 and saw on turning them to seaward where
 under full sail a nimble bark appeared
 as if she to that island would repair
 i will not now rehearse who thither steered
 for more than one awaiteth me elsewhere
 wend me to france and see if they be glad
 at having chased the saracens or sad

 xxiv
 see what she does withal the lady true
 that sees her knight content to wend so wide
 of the afflicted bradamant i shew
 after she saw the oath was nullified
 made in the hearing of those armies two
 upon the christian and the paynim side
 since he again had failed her there was nought
 wherein she could confide the damsel thought

 xxv
 and now her too accustomed plaint and wail
 repeating of rogero's cruelty
 fair bradamant renewed the wonted tale
 she cursed her hard and evil destiny
 then loosening to tempestuous grief the sail
 heaven that consented to such perjury
  and did not yet by some plain token speak 
 she in her passion called unjust and weak

 xxvi
 the sage melissa she accused and cursed
 the oracle of the cavern through whose lie
 she in that sea of love herself immersed
 upon whose waters she embarked to die
 she to marphisa afterwards rehearsed
 her woes and told her brother's perfidy
 she chides pours forth her sorrows and demands
 with tears and outcries succour at her hands

 xxvii
 marphisa shrugs her shoulders what alone
 she can she offers  comfort to the fair
 nor thinks rogero her has so foregone
 but what to her he shortly will repair
 and should he not such outrage to be done
 the damsel plights her promise not to bear
 twixt her and him shall deadly war be waged
 or he shall keep the word which he engaged

 xxviii
 she makes her somewhat thus her grief restrain
 which having vent in some sort spend its gall
 now we have seen the damsel in her pain
 rogero impious proud and perjured call
 see we if in a happier state remain
 the brother of that gentle maid withal
 whose flesh bones nerves and sinews are a prey
 to burning love rinaldo i would say

 xxix
 i say rinaldo that as known to you
 angelica the beauteous loved so well
 nor him into the amorous fillets drew
 so much her beauty as the magic spell
 in peace reposed those other barons true
 for wholly broken was the infidel
 alone amid the victors he of all
 the paladins remained love's captive thrall

 xxx
 to seek her he a hundred couriers sent
 and sought as well himself the missing maid
 he in the end to malagigi went
 who in his need had often given him aid
 to him he told his love with eyelids bent
 on earth and visage crimsoned o'er and prayed
 that sage magicians to instruct him where
 he in the world might find the longsought fair

 xxxi
 a case so strange and wondrous marvel sore
 in friendly malagigi's bosom bred
 the wizard knew a hundred times and more
 he might have had the damsel in his bed
 and he himself to move the knight or yore
 in her behalf enough had done and said
 had him by prayer and menace sought to bend
 yet ne'er was able to obtain his end

 xxxii
 and so much more that out of prison ward
 he then would malagigi so have brought
 now will he seek her of his own accord
 on less occasion when it profits nought
 next that magician montalbano's lord
 to mark how sorely do had erred besought
 since little lacked but through the boon denied
 erewhile he had in gloomy dungeon died

 xxxiii
 but how much more rinaldo's strange demand
 sounded importunately in his ear
 so by sure index malagigi scanned
 that so much was angelica more dear
 rinaldo prayer unable to withstand
 in ocean sunk the wizard cavalier
 all memory of old injury assaid
 and bowned himself to give the warrior aid

 xxxiv
 for his reply he craved some small delay
 and with fair hope consoled mount alban's knight
 he should be able of the road to say
 by which angelica had sped her flight
 in france or wheresoe'er then wends his way
 thither where he is wont his imps to cite
 a grot impervious and with mountains walled
 his book he opened and the spirits called

 xxxv
 then one he chooses in lovecases read
 whom malagigi to declare requires
 how good rinaldo's heart before so died
 was now so quickly moved by soft desires
 and of those fountains twain the demon said
 whereof one lights one quenches amorous fires
 and how nought cures the mischief caused by one
 but that whose streams in counter current run

 xxxvi
 and says rinaldo having drunk whilere
 from the lovechasing fountain's mossy urn
 to angelica that long had wooed the peer
 had shown himself so obstinate and stern
 and he whom after his ill star did steer
 to drink of that which makes the bosom burn
 her whom but just before he loathed above
 all reason by that draught was forced to love

 xxxvii
 him his ill star and cruel fate conveyed
 to swallow fire and flame i' the frozen lake
 for nigh at the same time the indian maid
 in the other bitter stream her thirst did slake
 which in her bosom so all love allayed
 henceforth she loathed him more than noisome snake
 he loved her and such love was his as late
 rinaldo bore her enmity and hate

 xxxviii
 of this strange story fully certified
 was malagigi by the demon's lore
 who news as well of angelique supplied
 how yielding up herself to a young moor
 with him embarking on the unstable tide
 she had abandoned europe's every shore
 and hoisting her bold canvas to the wind
 in catalonian galley loosed for ind

 xxxix
 rinaldo seeking out the sage anew
 for his reply  he would dissuade the knight
 from loving more that indian lady who
 now waited on a vile barbarian wight
 and was so distant he could ill pursue
 if he would chase the damsel on her flight
 who must have measured than half her way
 homeward with young medoro to catay

 xl
 in that bold lover no displeasure deep
 the journey of angelica would move
 nor yet would mar or break the warrior's sleep
 to think that he again must eastward rove
 but that a stripling saracen should reap
 the first fruits of that faithless lady's love
 in him such passion bred such heartache sore
 he never in his life so grieved before

 xli
 no power hath he to make one sole reply
 his heart his lip is quivering with disdain
 his tongue no word is able to untie
 his mouth is bitter and 'twould seem with bane
 he flung from the magician suddenly
 and as by fury stirred and jealous pain
 he after mighty plaint and mighty woe
 resolved anew to eastern realms to go

 xlii
 licence he asks of pepin's royal son
 upon the ground since with his courser dear
 to sericane is king gradasso gone
 against the use of gallant cavalier
 him honour moves the selfsame course to run
 in the end he may prevent the paynim peer
 from ever vaunting that with sword or lance
 he took him from a paladin of france

 xliii
 charles gives him leave to go though far and nigh
 with him all france laments he thence should wend
 but he in fine that prayer can ill deny
 so honest seems the worthy warrior's end
 him dudon guido would accompany
 but he refuses either valiant friend
 from paris he departs and wends alone
 plunged in his grief and heaving many a groan

 xliv
 ever in memory dwells the restless thought
 he might a thousand times have had the fair
 and  mad and obstinate  had when besought
 a thousand times refused such beauty rare
 and such sweet joy was whilom set at nought
 such bright such blessed moments wasted were
 and now he life would gladly give away
 to have that damsel but for one short day

 xlv
 the thought will never from his mind depart
 how for a sorry footpage she could slight
  flinging their merit and their love apart 
 the service of each former loving wight
 vext by such thought which racked and rent his heart
 rinaldo wends towards the rising light
 he the straight road to rhine and basle pursued
 till he arrived in arden's mighty wood

 xlvi
 when within that adventurous wood has hied
 for many a mile montalban's cavalier
 of lonely farm or lordly castle wide
 where the rude place was roughest and most drear
 the sky disturbed he suddenly descried
 he saw the sun's dimmed visage disappear
 and spied forth issuing from a cavern hoar
 a monster which a woman's likeness wore

 xlvii
 a thousand lidless eyes are in her head
 she cannot close them nor i think doth sleep
 she listens with as many ears and spread
 like hair about her forehead serpents creep
 forth issued into day that figure dread
 from devilish darkness and the caverned deep
 for tail a fierce and bigger serpent wound
 about her breast and girt the monster round

 xlviii
 what in a thousand thousand quests had ne'er
 befal'n rinaldo here befel the knight
 who when he sees the horrid form appear
 coming to seek him and prepared for fight
 feels in his inmost veins such freezing fear
 as haply never fell on other wight
 yet wonted daring counterfeits and feigns
 and with a trembling hand the faulchion strains

 xlix
 the monster so the fierce assault did make
 therein her master was well descried
 it might be said she shook a poisonous snake
 and now on this now on the other side
 leapt at the knight at her rinaldo strake
 ever meanwhile with random blows and wide
 with forestroke backstroke he assails the foe
 he often smites but never plants a blow

 l
 the monster threw a serpent at his breast
 that froze his heart beneath its iron case
 now through the vizor flung the poisonous pest
 which crept about his collar and his face
 dismaid rinaldo fled the field and prest
 with all his spurs his courser through the chase
 but not behind the hellish monster halts
 who in a thought upon the crupper vaults

 li
 wend where the warrior will anend or wide
 ever with him is that accursed pest
 nor knows he how from her to be untied
 albeit his courser plunges without rest
 like a leaf quakes his heart within his side
 not that the snakes in other mode molest
 but they such horror and such loathing bred
 he shrieks he groans and gladly would be dead

 lii
 by gloomiest track and blindest path he still
 threaded the tangled forest here and there
 by thorniest valley and by roughest hill
 and wheresoever darkest was the air
 thus hoping to have rid him of that ill
 hideous abominable poisonous care
 beneath whose gripe he foully might have fared
 but that one quickly to his aid repaired

 liii
 but aid and in good time a horseman bore
 equipt with arms of beauteous steel and clear
 for crest a broken yoke the stranger wore
 red flames upon his yellow shield appear
 so was the courser's housing broidered o'er
 as the proud surcoat of the cavalier
 his lance he grasped his sword was in its place
 and at his saddle hung a burning mace

 liv
 that warrior's mace a fire eternal fills
 whose lasting fuel ever blazes bright
 and goodly buckler tempered corslet thrills
 and solid helm then needs the approaching knight
 must make him way wherever 'tis his will
 to turn his inextinguishable light
 nor of less help in need rinaldo stands
 to save him from the cruel monster's hands

 lv
 the stranger horseman like a warrior bold
 where he that hubbub hears doth thither swoop
 until he sees the beast whose snakes enfold
 rinaldo linked in many a loathsome loop
 who sweats at once with heat and quakes with cold
 nor can he thrust the monster from his croup
 arrived the stranger smote her in the flank
 who on the near side of the courser sank

 lvi
 but scarcely was on earth extended ere
 she rose and shook her snakes in volumed spire
 the knight no more assails her with the spear
 but is resolved to plague the foe with fire
 he gripes the mace and thunders in her rear
 with frequent blows like tempest in its ire
 nor leaves a moment to that monster fell
 to strike one stroke in answer ill or well

 lvii
 and while he chases her or holds at bay
 smites her and venges many a foul affront
 counsels the paladin without delay
 to take the road which scales the neighbouring mount
 he took that proffered counsel and that way
 and without stop or turning back his front
 pricked furiously till he was out of sight
 though hard to clamber was the rugged height

 lviii
 the stranger when he to her dark retreat
 had driven from upper light that beast of hell
 where she herself doth ever gnaw and eat
 while from her thousand eyes tears ceaseless well
 followed the knight to guide his wandering feet
 and overtook him on the highest swell
 then placed himself beside the cavalier
 him from those dark and gloomy parts to steer

 lix
 when him returned beheld montalban's knight
 that countless thanks were due to him he said
 and that at all times as a debt of right
 his life should be for his advantage paid
 of him he next demands how he is hight
 that he may know and tell who brought him aid
 and among worthy warriors and before
 king charles exalt his prowess evermore

 lx
 the stranger answered "let it irk not thee
 that i not now my name to thee display
 ere longer by a yard the shadows be
 this will i signify a short delay"
 wending together they a river see
 whose murmurs woo the traveller from his way
 and shepherdswain by whiles to their green brink
 there an oblivion of their love to drink

 lxi
 my lord that fountain's chilling stream and clear
 extinguished love angelica of yore
 drinking thereof for good montalban's peer
 conceived that hate she nourished evermore
 and if she once displeased the cavalier
 and he to her such passing hatred bore
 for this no other cause occasion gave
 my lord save drinking of this chilly wave

 lxii
 arriving at that limpid river's side
 the cavalier that with rinaldo goes
 reinedin his courser how with toil and cried
 "here 'twere not ill meseemeth to repose"
  "it cannot but be well" the peer replied
 "because beside that midday fiercely glows
 i have so suffered from that hideous pest
 as sweet and needful shall i welcome rest"

 lxiii
 upon the green sward lit the martial two
 while their loose horses through the forest fed
 and from their brows the burnished helmets threw
 on that flowered herbage yellow green and red
 rinaldo to the liquid crystal flew
 by heat and thirst unto the river sped
 and with one draught of that cold liquid drove
 out of his burning bosom thirst and love

 lxiv
 whenas rinaldo sated with the draught
 raising his head the stranger knight espied
 and saw that he repentant every thought
 of that so frantic love had put aside
 he reared himself and said with semblance haught
 that which he would not say before and cried
 "rinaldo know that i am hight disdain
 bound hither but to break thy worthless chain"

 lxv
 so saying suddenly he passed from sight
 with him his horse this in rinaldo bred
 much wonderment and the astonished knight
 "where is he" gazing round about him said
 he cannot guess if 'twere a magic sprite
 a fiend by malagigi thither sped
 from those his ministers to break the chain
 fettered whereby he lived so long in pain

 lxvi
 of if an angel from the heavenly sphere
 in his ineffable goodness by the lord
 dispatched as to tobias's aid whilere
 a medicine for his blindness to afford
 but good or evil angel  whatsoe'er
 he was that him to liberty restored 
 him thanked and praised rinaldo for a heart
 healed only by his help of amorous smart

 lxvii
 old hate revived upon rinaldo's side
 nor he alone unworthy to be wooed
 the damsel deemed by pilgrimage so wide
 her half a league he would not have pursued
 nathless anew baiardo to bestride
 to sericane would go that warrior good
 as well because his honour him compelled
 as for the talk which he with charles had held

 lxviii
 he pricked to basle upon the following day
 whither the tidings had arrived before
 that count orlando was in martial fray
 to meet gradasso and the royal moor
 nor through orlando was divulged that say
 but one who crost from the sicilian shore
 and thither had in haste the journey made
 as certain news the tidings had conveyed

 lxix
 rinaldo had gladly been at roland's side
 and from that battle far himself doth see
 every ten miles he changes horse and guide
 and whips and spurs and makes his courser flee
 he crost the rhine at constance forward hied
 he traversed alp arrived in italy
 he left verona mantua in his rear
 and reached and past the po with swift career

 lxx
 much towards eve already sloped the sun
 and the first star was glimmering in the sky
 when doubting on the bank if he shall run
 another course or in some hostel lie
 until the shades of night and vapours dun
 before aurora's beauteous visage fly
 a cavalier approaching him he viewed
 who courtesy in face and semblance shewed

 lxxi
 he after greeting him if he were tied
 in wedlock made in gentle wise demand
 rinaldo wondering what the quest implied
 made answer "i am bound in nuptial band"
  "i joy thereat" the cavalier replied
 then that he might this saying understand
 added "i pray that you sir knight within
 my mansion will this eve be pleased to inn

 lxxii
 "for i will make you see what must please
 a wight" pursued the stranger "that is wed"
 rinaldo as well that he would take his ease
  but this with so long posting sore bested 
 as that to see and hear strange novelties
 by natural desire he still was led
 his offer takes and enters a new road
 following that cavalier to his abode

 lxxiii
 a bowshot from the way diverged the two
 and a great palace fronting them descried
 whence squires with blazing lights a numerous crew
 issued and chased the darkness far and wide
 entering his eyes around rinaldo threw
 and saw a place whose like is seldom spied
 of beauteous fabric and well ordered plan
 nor such huge cost befitted private man

 lxxiv
 of serpentine and of hard porphyry are
 the stones which form the gateway's arch above
 of bronze the portal leaves which figures bear
 whose lively features seem to breathe and move
 beneath the vaulted entry colours rare
 cheating the eye in mixt mosaic strove
 the quadrangle within was galleried
 and of a hundred yards on every side

 lxxv
 a gateway is there to each galleried row
 and twixt it and that gate an arch is bent
 of equal breadth but different in their show
 for the architect had spared not ornament
 each arch an entrance was up which might go
 a laden horse so easy the ascent
 to arch above leads every stair withal
 and every arch is entrance to a hall

 lxxvi
 above project the arches in such sort
 they for the spacious portals form a shade
 and each two pillars has for its support
 of bronze are some and some of marble made
 the ornamented chambers of the court
 too many are to be at length displayed
 with easements which beside what is in sight
 the skilful master underground had dight

 lxxvii
 tall columns with their capitals of gold
 which gemmed entablatures support in air
 exotic marbles engraved with figures fair
 picture and cast and works so manifold
 albeit by night they mostly hidden were
 showed that two kings' united treasure ne'er
 would have sufficed such gorgeous pile to rear

 lxxviii
 above the beauteous ornaments and rich
 that mingled in that gay quadrangle meet
 there is a fresh and plenteous fountain which
 scatters in many threads its watery sheet
 'tis here that youths at equal distance pitch
 i' the middle tables for the festive treat
 whence they four gates of that rich mansion see
 and seen from those four gates as well may be

 lxxix
 by cunning master diligent and wise
 with much and subtle toil the fount was made
 in open gallery or pavilion's guise
 which from eight separate fronts projects a shade
 a gilded roof which with enamelled dyes
 was stained below the building overlayed
 eight marble statues snowy was the grain
 with the left arm that gilded roof sustain

 lxxx
 fair amalthaea's horn in the right hand
 had quaintly sculptured the ingenious master
 whence water trickling forth with murmur bland
 descends into a vase of alabaster
 and he in likeness of a lady grand
 with sovereign art had fashioned each pilaster
 various they were in visage and in vest
 but all of equal charms and grace possest

 lxxxi
 upon two beauteous images below
 each of these female statues fix their feet
 the lower seem with open mouth to show
 that song and harmony to them are sweet
 and by their attitude 'twould seem as though
 their every work and every study meet
 in praising them they on their shoulders bear
 as they would those whose likenesses they wear

 lxxxii
 the images below them in their hand
 long scrolls and of an ample size contain
 which of the worthiest figures of that band
 the several names with mickle praise explain
 as well their own at little distance stand
 inscribed upon that scroll in letters plain
 rinaldo by the help of blazing lights
 marked one by one the ladies and their knights

 lxxxiii
 the first inscription there which meets the eye
 recites at length lucretia borgia's fame
 whom rome should place for charms and chastity
 above that wife who whilom bore her name
 strozza and tebaldeo  anthony
 and hercules  support the honoured dame
 so says the scroll for tuneful strain the pair
 a very linus and an orpheus are

 lxxxiv
 a statue no less jocund no less bright
 succeeds and on the writing is impressed
 lo hercules' daughter isabella hight
 in whom ferrara deems her city blest
 much more because she first shall see the light
 within its circuit than for all the rest
 which kind and favouring fortune in the flow
 of rolling years shall on that town bestow

 lxxxv
 the pair that such desirous ardour shew
 that aye her praises should be widely blown
 john james alike are named of those fair two
 one is calandra one is bardelon
 in the third place and fourth where trickling through
 small rills the water quits that octagon
 two ladies are there equal in their birth
 equal in country honour charms and worth

 lxxxvi
 one was elizabeth one eleanor
 and if we credit what that marble said
 manto's so glorious city which such store
 sets my melodious maro whom she bred
 more vaunts not him nor reverences more
 than these fair dames her poet's honoured head
 the first of these her hallowed feet had set
 on peter bembo and james sadolet

 lxxxvii
 arelio and castiglion a polished pair
 that other lady in mid air sustain
 their names were carved upon the marble fair
 then both unknown and now so fames a twain
 next was a lady that from heaven shall heir
 as mighty virtue as on earth doth reign
 or ever yet hath reigned in any age
 well proved by fortune in her love or rage

 lxxxviii
 inscribed in characters of gold is here
 lucretia bentivoglia and among
 her praises 'tis declared ferrara's peer
 joys that such daughter doth to him belong
 her shall camillus voice and far and near
 reno and felsina shall hear his song
 wrapt in as mighty wonder at the strain
 as that wherewith amphrysus heard his swain

 lxxxix
 and one through whom that city's name where sweet
 isaurus salts his wave in larger vase
 fame shall from africa to ind repeat
 from southern tracts to hyperborean ways
 more than because rome's gold in that famed seat
 was weighed whereof perpetual record says
 guy posthumus  about whose honoured brow
 phoebus and pallas bind a double bough

 xc
 dian is next in order of that train
 "regard not said the marble is she wear
 a haughty port for in her heart humane
 the matron is as in her visage fair
 learned celio calcagnine in lofty strain
 her glories and fair name abroad shall bear
 and juba's and moneses' kingdom hear
 and spain and farthest ind his trumpet clear

 xci
 and a cavallo shall make such a font
 of poetry in famed ancona run
 as that winged courser on parnassus' mount
 or was it on the hill of helicon
 'tis beatrice who next uprears her front
 whereof so speaks the writing on the stone
 "her consort beatrice while she has breath
 blesses and leaves unhappy at her death

 xcii
 "yea italy that with her triumphs bright
 without that lady fair shall captive be"
 a lofty song appears of her to indite
 a lord of the correggio's noble tree
 and benedeo's pride timotheus hight
 between his banks descending to the sea
 by their joint music shall the stream be stopt
 whose trees erewhile the liquid amber dropt

 xciii
 between this and that lofty column's place
 into fair borgia fashioned as was said
 of aspect so distinguished of such grace
 a lady was of alabaster made
 that hiding in a simple veil her face
 in sable without gems or gold arraid
 she 'mid the brightest flung her light as far
 as amid lesser fires the cyprian star

 xciv
 none knows observing her with steadfast view
 if she of charms or grace have fuller store
 whether her visage most majestic shew
 or beam with genius or with beauty more
 "he that would speak  would speak her praises true 
 declares in fine the sculptured marble's lore
 the fairest of emprizes would intend
 but never bring his noble task to end"

 xcv
 albeit such grace and passing sweetness shewed
 her fair and well wrought image she disdain
 appeared to nurse that one of wit so rude
 should dare to sing her praise in humble strain
 as he that only without comrade stood
 i know not why her statue to sustain
 the marble all those other names revealed
 that pair's alone the artist had concealed

 xcvi
 the statues in the middle form a round
 the floor whereof dry stalks of coral pave
 most pleasant cool and grateful is that ground
 so rendered by the pure and crystal wave
 which vent without in other channel found
 and issued forth in many a stream to lave
 a mead of azure white and yellow hue
 gladdening the plants that on their margins grew

 xcvii
 conversing with his courteous host the peer
 sate at the board and oft and often prayed
 that without more delay the cavalier
 would keep the promise he whilere had made
 and marking ever and anon his cheer
 observes his heart with some deep woe downweighed
 for not a moment 'mid their converse slips
 but what a burning sigh is on his lips

 xcviii
 oft with desire was good rinaldo stung
 to ask that sorrow's cause and the request
 was almost on the gentle warrior's tongue
 and there by courteous modesty represt
 now at their banquet's close a youth among
 the menial crew on whom that charge did rest
 placed a gold cup before the paladin
 filled full of gems without of wine within

 xcix
 the host then somedeal smiling from the board
 looked up at aymon's son but who this while
 well marked him as he eyed montalban's lord
 had deemed him more disposed to weep than smile
 "so oft reminded to maintain my word
 'tis time meseems said he that owned the pile
 to shew the touchstone for a woman's love
 which needs to wedded man must welcome prove

 c
 "ne'er in my judgment should the married dame
 be from espial by her lord released
 thus shall he know if honour or if blame
 his portion is if he is man or beast
 the weight of horns though coupled with such shame
 is of all burdens upon the earth the least
 while wellnigh all behold his antlers spread
 he feels them not who has them on his head

 ci
 "if certain of thy wife's fidelity
 thou hast more ground to prize and hold her dear
 than one whose wife is evil known to be
 or husband that is still in doubt and fear
 full many husbands live in jealousy
 and groundlessly of women chaste and clear
 on many women many men rely
 meanwhile who bear their branching antlers high

 cii
 "if thou would'st be assured thy wife is true
 as sure methinks thou thinkest and must think
 for it is hard that notion to undo
 unless thy trust before sure tokens sink
  no hearsay matter this  thyself shalt view
 the truth if thou in this fair vessel drink
 placed solely on the supperboard that thou
 may'st see the marvel promised thee but now

 ciii
 "drink and a mighty marvel shall be seen
 for if thou wearest cornwall's lofty crest
 no drop of wine shall pass thy lips between
 and all the draught be spilt upon thy breast
 if faithful is thy wife thou shalt drink clean
 and now  to try thy fortune  to the test"
 he said and with fixt eyes the sign explored
 if on his breast the wine rinaldo poured

 civ
 rinaldo was nigh moved the cup to raise
 and seek what he would haply wish unsought
 forward he reached his hand and took the vase
 about to prove his fortune in the draught
 then of the passing peril of the case
 before it touched his lips the warrior thought
 but let me sir repose myself and i
 will then relate the paladin's reply


 canto 43

 argument
 rinaldo from his courteous landlord hears
 what folly had destroyed his every good
 next learns another story as he steers
 toward ravenna with the falling flood
 then last arrives where conqueror o'er his foes
 orlando was but in no joyful mood
 he that the child a christian made whilere
 christens sobrino and heals olivier


 i
 o execrable avarice o vile thirst
 of sordid gold it doth not me astound
 so easily thou seizest soul immersed
 in baseness or with other taint unsound
 but that thy chain should bind amid the worst
 and that thy talon should strike down and wound
 one that for loftiness of mind would be
 worthy all praise if he avoided thee

 ii
 some earth and sea and heaven above us square
 know nature's causes works and properties
 what her beginnings what her endings are
 and soar till heaven is open to their eyes
 yet have no steadier aim no better care
 stung by thy venom than in sordid wise
 to gather treasure such their single scope
 their every comfort and their every hope

 iii
 armies by him are broken in his pride
 and gates of warlike towns in triumph past
 the foremost he to breast the furious tide
 of fearful battle to retire the last
 yet cannot save himself from being stied
 till death in thy dark dungeon prisoned fast
 of others that would shine thou dimm'st the praise
 whom other studies other arts would raise

 iv
 what shall of high and beauteous dames be said
 who from their lovers' worth and charms secure
 against long service i behold more staid
 more motionless than marble shafts endure
 then avarice comes who so her spells hath laid
 i see them stoop directly to her lure
  who could believe  unloving in a day
 they fall some elder's fall some monster's prey

 v
 not without reason here i raise this cry
  read me who can i read myself  nor so
 i from the beaten pathway tread awry
 nor thus the matter of my song forego
 not more to what is shown do i apply
 my saying than to what i have to show
 but now return we to the paladine
 who was about to taste the enchanted wine

 vi
 fain would he think awhile of whom i speak
 as said ere to his lips the vase he bore
 he thought then thus "when finding what we seek
 displeases this 'tis folly to explore
 my wife's a woman every woman's weak
 then let me hold the faith i held before
 faith still has brought and yet contentment brings
 from proof itself what better profit springs

 vii
 "from this small good much evil i foresee
 for tempting god moves sometimes his disdain
 i know not if it wise or foolish be
 but to know more than needs i am not fain
 now put away the enchanted cup from me
 i neither will nor would the goblet drain
 which is with heaven's command as much at strife
 as adam's deed who robbed the tree of life

 viii
 "for as our sire who tasted of that tree
 and god's own word by eating disobeyed
 fell into sorrow from felicity
 and was by misery evermore o'erlaid
 the husband so that all would know and see
 whatever by his wife is done and said
 passes from happiness to grief and pain
 nor ever can uplift his head again"

 ix
 meanwhile the good rinaldo saying so
 and pushing from himself the cup abhorred
 beheld of tears a plenteous fountain flow
 from the full eyes of that fair mansion's lord
 who cried now having somewhat calmed his woe
 "accursed be he persuaded by whose word
 alas i of the fortune made assay
 whereby my cherished wife was reft away

 x
 "wherefore ten years ago wast thou not known
 so that i counselled might have been of thee
 before the sorrows and the grief begun
 that have nigh quenched my eyes but raised shall be
 the curtain from the scene that thou upon
 my pain mayst look and mayst lament with me
 and i to thee of mine unheardof woe
 the argument and very head will show

 xi
 "above was left a neighbouring city pent
 within a limpid stream that forms a lake
 which widens and wherein po finds a vent
 their way the waters from benacus take
 built was the city when to ruin went
 walls founded by the agenorean snake
 here me of gentle line my mother bore
 but of small means in humble home and poor

 xii
 "if fortune's care i was not who denied
 to me upon my birth a wealthy boon
 nature that went with graceful form supplied
 so that in beauty rival had i none
 enamoured of me in youth's early tide
 erewhile was dame and damsel more than one
 for i with beauty coupled winning ways
 though it becomes not man himself to praise

 xiii
 "a sage within our city dwelled a wight
 beyond belief in every science great
 who when he closed his eyes on phoebus' light
 numbered one hundred years one score and eight
 a savage life he led and out of sight
 until impelled by love the senior late
 by dint of gifts obtained a matron fair
 who secretly to him a daughter bare

 xiv
 "and to prevent the child from being won
 as was erewhile the mother that for gain
 bartered her chastity whose worth alone
 excels what gold earth's ample veins contain
 with her he from the ways of man is gone
 and where he spies the loneliest place his train
 of demons forces in enchantment skilled
 this dome so spacious fair and rich to build

 xv
 "by ancient and chaste dames he there made rear
 this daughter that in sovereign beauty grew
 nor suffered her to see or even hear
 a man beside himself and for her view
  lest lights should lack whereby her course to steer 
 the senior every modest lady who
 e'er on unlawful love the barrier shut
 made limn in picture or in sculpture cut

 xvi
 "nor he alone those virtuous dames who sage
 and chaste had so adorned antiquity
 whose fame preserved by the historic page
 is never doomed its dying day to see
 but those as well that will in future age
 everywhere beautify fair italy
 made fashion in their wellknown form and mien
 as eight that round this fount by thee are seen

 xvii
 "what time the damsel ripe for husband shows
 so that the fruit may now be gathered i
 did chance or my misfortune so dispose
 am worthiest found and those broad lands that lie
 without the walls which that fair town enclose
  the fishy flat no less than upland dry 
 extending twenty miles about that water
 he gives me for a dowry with his daughter

 xviii
 "she was so mannered was so fair of hue
 none could desire she other gifts should bring
 so well to broider was she taught and sew
 minerva knew not better did she sing
 or play or walk to those that hear and view
 she seems a heavenly and no mortal thing
 and in the liberal arts was skilled as well
 as her own sire or scarce behind him fell

 xix
 "with genius high and beauty no less bright
 which might have served the very stones to move
 such love such sweetness did the maid unite
 thinking thereof meseems my heart is clove
 she had no greater pleasure or delight
 than being with me did i rest or rove
 twas long ere we had any strife in fine
 we quarrelled and the fault alas was mine

 xx
 "five years my consort's father had been dead
 since to that yoke i stooped and pledged my vow
 when in short time the manner shall be said
 began the sorrows that i feel even now
 while me with all his pinions overspread
 love of the dame whose praises thus i blow
 a noble townswoman with love of me
 was smit more sorely smitten none could be

 xxi
 "she in all magic versed was of such skill
 as never was enchantress by her say
 moved solid earth and made the sun stand still
 illumined gloomy night and darkened day
 yet never could she work upon my will
 with salve i could not give except with scathe
 of her to whom erewhile i pledged my faith

 xxii
 "not because she right gentle was and bright
 nor because i believed her love so true
 nor for large gift nor promise often plight
 nor yet because she never ceased to sue
 could she from me obtain one spark of light
 from that first flame my gentle consort blew
 so mates and masters every will in me
 the knowledge of my wife's fidelity

 xxiii
 "i in the hope belief and certitude
 my wife to me was faithful evermore
 should with contempt the beauty have eschewed
 of that famed daughter which fair leda bore
 and all the wit and wealth wherewith was wooed
 the illustrious shepherd upon ida hoar
 but no repulse withal with her avails
 who me for ever at my side assails

 xxiv
 "one day that me beyond my palace sees
 that weird enchantress who melissa hight
 and where she can discourse with me at ease
 she finds a way whereby my peace to blight
 and goading me with evil jealousies
 the faith i nursed at heart she puts to flight
 she 'gan commending my intent to be
 faithful to her who faithful was to me

 xxv
 " `but that she faithful is ye cannot say
 save of her faith ye have assurance true
 if she fails not withal where fail she may
 she faithful modest may be deemed by you
 but is she never from your side away
 is not permitted other man to view
 how does this boldness come that you would be
 the warrant of her untried modesty

 xxvi
 " `go forth awhile go forth come from home alone
 and be the bruit in town and village spread
 that she remains behind and you are gone
 let lovers and let couriers have their head
 if unpersuaded still by prayer and boon
 she does no outrage to the marriage bed
 though doing so she deem herself unseen
 then faithful you the dame may justly ween'

 xxvii
 "i with such words and suchlike words was plied
 till so on me the shrewd enchantress wrought
 i wished to see my consort's virtue tried
 by certain proof and to the touchstone brought
  `now grant we i to that witchlady cried
 she prove what cannot by myself be thought
 how by some certain token can i read
 if she will merit punishment or meed'

 xxviii
 " `a drinkingcup will i for that assay
 give you she said of virtue strange and rare
 such was for arthur made by morgue the fay
 to make him of genevra's fault aware
 the chaste wife's lord thereof may drink but they
 drink not whose wedded partners wanton are
 for when they would the cordial beverage sup
 into their bosom overflows the cup

 xxix
 " `below departing you the test shall try
 and to my thinking now shall you drink clean
 for clean as yet i think your consort i
 the event however shall by you be seen
 yet will i warrant not your bosom dry
 should you repeat the proof for if between
 the cup and lip the liquor be not shed
 you are the happiest wight that ever wed'

 xxx
 "the offer i accept the vase to me
 is given and trial made with full success
 for hitherto as hoped confirmed i see
 my gentle consort's worth and faithfulness
 'leave her awhile melissa said and be
 a month or twain a truant more or less
 then homeward wend again the goblet fill
 and prove if you the beverage drink or spill'

 xxxi
 "i thought it hard to leave my consort's side
 not as so much about her truth in pain
 as that i could nor for two days abide
 nay not an hour without her could remain
 ` you in another way melissa cried
 guided by me the truth shall ascertain
 voice vesture shall you change and to her sight
 present yourself disguised like other wight'

 xxxii
 "sir a fair city nigh at hand defends
 twixt fierce and threatening horns the foaming po
 whose jurisdiction to the shore extends
 where the sea's briny waters come and go
 this yields in ancientry but well contends
 with neighbouring towns in rich and gorgeous show
 a trojan remnant its foundations placed
 which scaped from attila's destructive waste

 xxxiii
 "a rich a youthful and a handsome knight
 bridles this city with his sovereign sway
 who following a lost falcon in its flight
 entering by chance my dwelling on a day
 beheld my wife who pleased him so at sight
 he bore her impress in his heart away
 nor ceased to practise on her with intent
 to incline the matron to his evil bent

 xxxiv
 "so often she repels the cavalier
 that finally his courtship is foregone
 but her fair image graved by love will ne'er
 be razed from memory me melissa won
 so well she soothed and flattered of that peer
 the face and figure to the sight to don
 and changed me  nor well how can i declare 
 in voice and visage and in eyes and hair

 xxxv
 "i having to my lady made a show
 as eastward bound and gone  like him that wooed
 her rich and youthful lover altered so
 his semblance attended by melissa go
 into a page upon her side transmewed
 who the most costly jewels with her bore
 e'er brought form ind or erithraean shore

 xxxvi
 "i enter safely that my palace knew
 and with me wends melissa and there i
 so wholly at her ease madonna view
 no woman or attendant squire is by
 to her with suppliant prayer forthwith i sue
 and next those goads to evil deed apply
 show emerald ruby diamond that might serve
 to make the firmest heart from honour swerve

 xxxvii
 "and i declare to her the gift is small
 to that which she may hope to make her own
 then of the vantage speak that from his hall
 her husband at the present time is gone
 and i how long it was to her recall
 since as she knew to her my love was shown
 and that my loving with such faith in the end
 might worthily to some reward pretend

 xxxviii
 "at first she was somedeal disturbed became
 like scarlet nor would listen to my say
 but seeing those bright jewels flash like flame
 her stubborn heart was softened and gave way
 and in brief speech and feeble said the dame
 what to remember takes my life away
 she with my wishes said she would comply
 if sure to be unseen of watchful eye

 xxxix
 "me my wife's words like poisoned weapon thrill
 and pierce my suffering spirit through and through
 through bones and veins there went a deadly chill
 my tongue clave to my throat the witch withdrew
 with that the magic mantle and at will
 transformed me to mine ancient shape anew
  bethink thee of what hue my wife became
 taken by me in such notorious shame

 xl
 "of deadly hue we both of us remain
 we both stand silent both with downcast eye
 so feeble is my tongue that i with pain
 so faint my voice that i with pain can cry
 'thou wouldst betray me then o wife for gain
 if there was one that would my honour buy'
 she nought replies nor save by tears she speaks
 which furrow as they fall her woeful cheeks

 xli
 "shame stings her sore but yet in sorer wise
 wrath at the outrage i to her had done
 and so without restraint it multiplies
 and into rage and cruel hate is run
 to fly from me forthwith does she devise
 and what time from his car dismounts the sun
 runs to the shore aboard her pinnace wends
 and all that night the stream in haste descends

 xlii
 "and she at morn presents herself before
 him that had loved her once the cavalier
 whose semblance and whose borrowed face i wore
 when to my shame i tempted her whilere
 to him that loved and loves her evermore
 her coming it may be believed is dear
 from thence she bade me never entertain
 the hope she'd love me or be mine again

 xliii
 "alas with him she swells in mickle glee
 even from that day and makes of me a jest
 and of that evil which i brought on me
 i languish yet and find no place of rest
 justly this growing ill my death will be
 of little remnant now of life possest
 i well believe i in a year had died
 but that a single comfort aid supplied

 xliv
 "that comfort was of all which harboured were
 here for ten years for still to every guest
 beneath my roof i bade the vessel bear
 was none but with the wine had bathed his breast
 to have so many comrades in my care
 some little soothes the griefs that so molest
 thou only of so many hast been wise
 who wouldst forbear the perilous emprize

 xlv
 "my wish o'erpassing every fitting bound
 to know what husband of his wife should know
 is cause by me no quiet will be found
 whether my death be speedy of be slow
 thereat at first melissa joys but drowned
 forthwith is her light mirth for of my woe
 esteeming her the cause that dame so sore
 i hated i would not behold her more

 xlvi
 "impatient to be treated with disdain
 by me  of her more loved than life she said 
 where she forthwith as mistress to remain
 had hoped when thence the other was conveyed
  not to behold such present cause of pain
 her own departure little she delayed
 and went so far away no further word
 by me was ever of that woman heard"

 xlvii
 his tale the mournful cavalier so taught
 and when he now had closed his history
 with pity touched somewhile immersed in thought
 rinaldo mused and after made reply
 "right ill advice to thee melissa brought
 who moved three thus to anger wasps and i
 perceive in thee small wisdom that wouldst sound
 a thing which thou wouldst gladly not have found

 xlviii
 "if she thy wife by avarice was inclined
 to break her faith and be to thee untrue
 muse not nor first nor last of womankind
 she worsted from such cruel war withdrew
 and by a meaner bribe yet firmer mind
 is even tempted fouler deed to do
 of men of how many we hear that sold
 their patrons and their friends for sordid gold

 xlix
 "with such fierce arms thou ill didst her assail
 if to behold a brave defence thou sought
 knowst thou not against gold of no avail
 is stone or steel to hardest temper wrought
 meseems that thou in tempting her didst fail
 more than herself that was so quickly caught
 i know not had she tempted thee as much
 if thou thyself hadst better stood the touch"

 l
 here ends rinaldo and  the parley done 
 rises and to his rest desires to go
 awhile will he repose and then be gone
 an hour or two before the daylight show
 but little time has aymon's warlike son
 nor idly will that little time bestow
 to him the mansion's master made reply
 he in his house might at his pleasure lie

 li
 for bed and bower within were ready dight
 but  would he take his counsel for his guide 
 in comfort might he sleep throughout the night
 and yet advance some miles "for thou" he cried
 "shalt have a pinnace that with rapid flight
 and without risque shall with the current glide
 therein shalt thou all night pursue thy way
 and on thy journey gain withal a day"

 lii
 good seemed that proffer in rinaldo's eyes
 and to the courteous host large thanks he paid
 then for the pinnace which that lord supplies
 that waits him with her crew the warrior made
 here at full ease reclined rinaldo lies
 while with the stream his frigate is conveyed
 which by six oars impelled flies fast and fair
 and cleaves the water as a bird the air

 liii
 as soon as he reclines his weary head
 asleep is mount albano's cavalier
 having erewhile that they shall wake him said
 as soon as they ferrara's city near
 melara lies left of that river's bed
 sermide to the right they in their rear
 next leave stellata and figarolo
 where his two horns are lowered by angry po

 liv
 of those two horns that which t'ward venice goes
 rinaldo's pilot left and took the right
 then the bodeno past already shows
 faintly the eastern blue and fades from sight
 for now aurora from her basket throws
 all her rich flowers and paints it red and white
 when viewing the two castles of tealdo
 again his head uplifts the good rinaldo

 lv
 "o happy town whereof" the warrior cried
 "spake malagigi having far and near
 the fixt and wandering fires of heaven espied
 and forced some subject spirit to appear
 to me foretelling that in future tide
  what time with him i took his way whilere 
 even to such pitch thy glorious fame should rise
 thou from all italy wouldst bear the prize"

 lvi
 so saying in his barge he all this while
 hurries as if the bark with pinions flew
 scowering the king of rivers to that isle
 nearest the town and though it not to view
 deserted and neglected then doth smile
 this yet rejoices to behold anew
 nor makes small mirth thereat because aware
 hereafter how adorned 'twill be and fair

 lvii
 before when he with him that way had gone
 from malagigi his cousin did he hear
 that when seven hundred times his course had run
 circling the heaven in aries the fourth sphere
 of islands this should be the fairest one
 in sea or pool or river far and near
 so that who this beheld would brook no more
 to hear that praised which fair nausicaa bore

 lviii
 he heard it in fair mansions would outdo
 that island which tiberius held so dear
 and trees that in hesperian gardens grew
 would yield to what this beauteous place should bear
  so rare its race of beasts  no fairer shew
 herded or housed erewhile by circe were
 venus with loves and graces there should sport
 nor more in gnide and cyprus keep her court

 lix
 and so would flourish through his study and care
 who will with knowledge and with power should blend
 and who so safely should that bright repair
 with circling wall and sheltering dyke defend
 the united world's assault it well might dare
 nor call on foreign power its aid to lend
 and that duke hercules' sire and hercules' son
 was he by whom this marvel should be done

 lx
 so wends the warrior summing in his mind
 what erst to him had told his cousin wise
 what time the sage of future things divined
 whereof with him he often wont devize
 and aye contemplating that city blind
 "how can it ever be" rinaldo cries
 "that in all liberal and all worthy arts
 shall flourish so these waste and watery parts

 lxi
 "and that to city of such amplitude
 and beauty such a petty burgh should grow
 and where but marsh and miry pool is viewed
 henceforth should full and fruitful harvests glow
 even now i rise to hail the gentle blood
 the love the courtesy thy lords shall show
 o thou fair city in succeeding years
 thy burghers' honours and thy cavaliers'

 lxii
 "the grace ineffable of powers above
 thy princes' wisdom and their love of right
 shall with perpetual peace perpetual love
 preserve thee in abundance and delight
 and a defence from all the fury prove
 of such as hate thee and unmask their spite
 be thy content thy neighbours' wide annoy
 rather than thou shouldst envy other's joy"

 lxiii
 while thus rinaldo speaks so swiftly borne
 by the quick current flies that nimble yawl
 not to the lure more swiftly makes return
 the falcon hurrying at his lord's recall
 thenceforth the righthand branch of the right horn
 rinaldo takes and hid are roof and wall
 st george recedes recede from that swift boat
 the turrets of gaibana and of the moat

 lxiv
 montalban's martial lord as it befell
 that thought moved thought which others moved again
 in memory chances on the knight to dwell
 that him at supper late did entertain
 that through this city's cause the truth to tell
 hath reason evermore to be in pain
 and of the magic vessel him bethinks
 which shows his consort's guilt to him that drinks

 lxv
 and him bethinks therewith of what the knight
 related how of all that he had tried
 who of his goblet drank there was no wight
 but split the wine he to his lips would guide
 now he repents him now "'tis my delight"
 mutters "that i the proof would not abide
 succeeding i should prove but what i thought
 and not succeeding to what pass am brought

 lxvi
 "this my belief i deem a certainty
 and faith could have but small increase in me
 so if i this should by the touchstone try
 my present good would little bettered be
 but small the evil would not prove if i
 saw of my clarice what i would not see
 this were a thousand against one to stake
 to hazard much where i could nothing take"

 lxvii
 the knight of clermont buried in this mood
 who lifted not his visage from the floor
 a mariner with much attention viewed
 that overright was seated at his oar
 and for he deemed he fully understood
 the thought that prest the cavalier so sore
 made him wellspoken was the man and bold
 wake from his muse some talk with him to hold

 lxviii
 the substance of the talk between the two
 was that the husband little wit possest
 who wishing to assay if she was true
 had tried his wife by too severe a test
 for woman proof to gold and silver who
 armed but with modesty defends her breast
 this from a thousand faulchions will defend
 more surely and through burning fires will wend

 lxix
 the mariner subjoined "thou saidest well
 with gifts so rich he should not her have prest
 for these assaults these charges to repel
 not good alike is every human breast
 i know not if of wife thou has heard tell
 for haply not with us the tale may rest
 that in the very sin her husband spied
 for which she by his sentence should have died

 lxx
 "my lord should have remembered gold and meed
 have upon every hardest matter wrought
 but he forgot this truth in time of need
 and so upon his head this ruin brought
 ah would that he in proof like me a deed
 done in this neighbouring city had been taught
 his country and mine own which lake and fen
 brimming with mincius' prisoned waters pen

 lxxi
 "i of adonio speak that in a hound
 a treasure on the judge's wife conferred"
 "thereof" replied the paladin "the sound
 hath not o'erpast the alps for never word
 of this neighbouring france nor in my round
 through far and foreign countries have i heard
 so tell if telling irks not" said the peer
 "what willingly i bown myself to hear

 lxxii
 the boatman then "erewhile was of this town
 one anselm that of worthy lineage came
 a wight that spent his youth in flowing gown
 studying his ulpian he of honest fame
 beauty and state assorting with his own
 a consort sought and one of noble name
 nor vainly in a neighbouring city crowned
 with superhuman beauty one he found

 lxxiii
 "she such fair manners and so graceful shows
 she seems all love and beauty and much more
 perchance than maketh for her lord's repose
 then well befits the reverend charge he bore
 he wedded strait in jealousy outgoes
 all jealous men that ever were before
 yet she affords not other cause for care
 but that she is too witty and too fair

 lxxiv
 "in the same city dwelt a cavalier
 numbered that old and honoured race among
 sprung from the haughty lineage which whilere
 out of the jawbone of a serpent sprung
 whence manto doomed my native walls to rear
 descended and with her a kindred throng
 the cavalier adonio was he named
 was with the beauties of the dame inflamed

 lxxv
 "and for the furtherance of his amorous quest
 to grace himself began his wealth to spend
 without restraint in banquet and in vest
 and what might most a cavalier commend
 if he tiberius' treasure had possest
 he of his riches would have made an end
 i well believe two winters were not done
 ere his paternal fortune was outrun

 lxxvi
 "the house erewhile frequented by a horde
  morning and evening  of so many friends
 is solitary since no more his board
 beneath the partridge quail and pheasant bends
 of that once noble troop upon the lord
 save beggars hardly any one attends
 ruined at length he thinks he will begone
 to other country where he is unknown

 lxxvii
 "he leaves his native land with this intent
 nor letteth any his departure know
 and coasts in tears and making sad lament
 the marshes that about his city go
 he his heart's queen amid his discontent
 meanwhile forgets not for this second woe
 lo him another accident that falls
 from sovereign woe to sovereign bliss recalls

 lxxviii
 "he saw a peasant who with heavy stake
 smote mid some sapling trunks on every side
 adonio stopt and wherefore so he strake
 asked of the rustic that in answer cried
 within that clump a passing ancient snake
 amid the tangled stems he had espied
 a longer serpent and more thick to view
 he never saw nor thought to see anew

 lxxix
 "and that from thence he would not wend his way
 until the reptile he had found and slain
 when so adonio heard the peasant say
 he scarce his speech with patience could sustain
 aye reverence to the serpent wont to pay
 the honoured ensign of his ancient strain
 in memory that their primal race had grown
 erewhile from serpent's teeth by cadmus sown

 lxxx
 "and by the churl the offended knight so said
 and did withal he made him quit the emprize
 leaving the hunted serpent neither dead
 nor injured nor pursued in further wise
 thither where he believes would least have spread
 the story of his woe adonio hies
 and in discomfort and in sorrow wears
 far from his native land seven weary years

 lxxxi
 "neither for distance nor for straitened cheer
 which will not let thought run its restless round
 ceased love so wont to rein the cavalier
 aye to inflame his heart aye vex his wound
 at length those beauties to his eyes so dear
 parforce must he revisit homeward bound
 unshorn afflicted he in poor array
 thither returns from whence he went his way

 lxxxii
 "my city at the time whereof i tell
 to rome was fain to send an embassy
 that sometime near his holiness should dwell
 and for how long a time could none foresee
 upon our judge the lot of envoy fell
 o day that ever wept by him will be
 to be excused anselmo promised prayed
 and bribed but at the last parforce obeyed

 lxxxiii
 "as no less cruel and less hard to abide
 he deemed a woe which caused such piteous smart
 than had he seen a hostile hand his side
 lay bare and from his bosom pluck his heart
 deadwhite with jealous fear his cheek is dyed
 through doubt of his fair consort while apart
 and in the mode he deems may best avail
 he supplicates her not in faith to fail

 lxxxiv
 "nor beauty to his wife the husband cries
 nor noble blood nor fortune are enow
 to make a woman to true honour rise
 save chaste in name and deed subjoining how
 the virtue that mankind most highly prize
 is that which triumphs after strife and now
 through his long absense a fair field and wide
 is opened where that virtue may be tried

 lxxxv
 "with such persuasions and with many more
 anselm exhorts the lady to be true
 his going doth his woful wife deplore
 o heaven what tears what loud complaints ensue
 immersed in her despair that lady swore
 sooner the sun bedimmed the world should view
 than she would break her faith she would expire
 sooner than she would cherish such desire

 lxxxvi
 "though to the lady's promise and protest
 he lent belief and somewhat calmed his fears
 until he further hear he will not rest
 and till he can find matter for his tears
 a soothsayer he among his friends possest
 prized for his knowledge as the first of seers
 who of all witchery and of magic art
 had read the whole or read the greater part

 lxxxvii
 "to him before departing does he pray
 to take the charge upon himself to see
 if true would be argia while away
 so name his consort or the contrary
 won by his prayers he takes the time o' the day
 figures the heavens as they appear to be
 anselmo left him at his work and came
 his answer on the following day to claim

 lxxxviii
 "the astrologer is silent loath to expose
 a matter that will work the doctor woe
 and would excuse himself with many a gloze
 but when he sees he would the evil know
 argia will break faith with him he shows
 as soon as he shall from his threshold go
 nor prayer shall soften her nor beauty fire
 corrupted will she be by gain and hire

 lxxxix
 "when to anselmo's early doubt and fear
 are joined the threatnings of the signs above
 how stands his heart may well to thee appear
 if thou hast known the accidents of love
 and worse than every woe wherewith whilere
 the afflicted spirits of that husband strove
 is that it by the prophet is foretold
 argais' honour will be bought and sold

 xc
 "now to support his wife as best he may
 from falling into such an evil deed
 for man alas will sometimes disarray
 the altar when he finds himself in need
 what gold and gems the judge had put away
 a plenteous store he leaves and field and mead
 rents fruits and all possessions whatsoe'er
 leaves to his consort all his worldly gear

 xci
 " `with power' he said `not only without measure
 these as thou needest to enjoy and spend
 but do with them according to thy pleasure
 consume and fling away and give and vend
 other account i ask not of my treasure
 if such as now i find thee in the end
 but such as now remain  at thy command
 even shouldst thou squander both are house and land'

 xcii
 "unless she heard he thither made repair
 he prayed that she would dwell not in the town
 but would a farm of his inhabit where
 she might with all convenience live alone
 and this besought he of his consort fair
 as thinking that the rustics which on down
 pasture their flocks or fruitful fallows till
 could ne'er contaminate her honest will

 xciii
 "her fearful husband still embracing close
 her arms about his neck argia threw
 a burst of tears her visage overflows
 for from her eyes two streams their way pursue
 she grieves he guilty should his wife suppose
 as if she hath already been untrue
 for his suspicion to its source she traced
 that in her faith no faith anselmo placed

 xciv
 "citing their long farewell i should exceed
 ` to thee at length' he so the dame addrest
 `i recommend my honour'  and indeed
 took leave and on his road in earnest prest
 and truly felt on wheeling round his steed
 as if his heart was issuing from his breast
 she follows him as long as she can follow
 with eyes whose tears her furrowed visage hollow

 xcv
 "poor pale unshorn and wretched as whilere
 to you in former strain by me was said
 homeward meanwhile the wandering cavalier
 hoping he there should be unknown had made
 beside the lake that pilgrim journeyed near
 the city where he gave the serpent aid
 in that thick brake besieged by village swain
 who with his staff the reptile would have slain

 xcvi
 "arriving here upon the dawn of light
 for yet some stars were glimmering in the skies
 approaching him in foreign vesture dight
 along the shore a damsel he espies
 though neither squire nor waiting wench in sight
 appears yet noble is the lady's guise
 with pleasing visage she adonio boards
 and then breaks silence in the following words

 xcvii
 "albeit thou know'st me not o cavalier
 i am thy kin and greatly bound to thee
 i am thy kin for of the lineage clear
 derived of haughty cadmus' seed are we
 i am the fairy manto that whilere
 laid the first stone of this rude villagery
 and as thou haply mayst have heard it famed
 mantua from me the rising town was named

 xcviii
 " `o' the fairies am i one with that to show
 our fatal state and what it doth import
 we to all other kinds of ill below
 are subject by our natal influence short
 of death but with immortal being such woe
 is coupled death is not of direr sort
 for every seventh day we all must take
 by certain law the form of spotted snake

 xcix
 " `so sad it is that loathsome coil to fill
 and prone at length upon the ground to crawl
 equal to this here is no worldly ill
 so that immortal life is cursed by all
 and thou the debt i owe thee for my will
 is to inform thee of its cause withal
 shalt know as well how on that fatal day
 of change we are to countless ills a prey

 c
 " `so hated as the serpent beast is none
 and we that wear its evil form alarm
 outrage and war endure from every one
 for all that see us hunt and do us harm
 unless we can to ground for shelter run
 we feel how heavy falls man's furious arm
 happier it were to die than languish  broke
 battered and crippled by the cruel stroke

 ci
 " `my mighty obligation due to thee
 is that when once thou didst this greenwood thread
 thou from a rustic's fury rescuedst me
 by whose ill handling was i sore bested
 but for thine aid i should not have got free
 without a broken spine or battered head
 with body crooked and crushed i should have lain
 albeit i could not by his arm be slain

 cii
 " `because thou hast to know upon the day
 we sprang from earth with scales of dragon dight
  subject to us at other times  to obey
 the heavens refuse and we are void of might
 at other seasons at our simple say
 the circling sun stands still and dims its light
 fixt earth is moved and in a circle wheels
 ice at our word takes fire and fire congeals

 ciii
 " `now here prepared to render thee the meed
 of benefit then done to me i stand
 for now dismantled of my dragon weed
 vainly no grace of me wilt thou demand
 even now thrice richer art thou by my deed
 than when thou heirdst erewhile thy father's land
 now will i that henceforth thou shalt be poor
 but wealth the more 'tis spent augment the more

 civ
 " `and because with that ancient knot thou still
 i know art tangled which by love was tied
 the mode and order how thou mayst fulfil
 thy wishes shall by me be signified
 now that her lord is absent 'tis my will
 my scheme without delay by thee be tried
 go forth the lady at her farm to find
 without the town nor will i say behind'

 cv
 "she her discourse continuing 'gan advise
 what form he to that lady's eyes should take
 i say what vesture wear and in what wise
 should speak how tempt her what entreaties make
 and said how she her figure would disguise
 for save the day wherein she was a snake
 upon all others went the fairy drest
 in whatsoever figure pleased her best

 cvi
 "she in a pilgrim's habit clothed the knight
 such as from door to door our alms entreat
 into a dog she changed herself to sight
 the smallest ever seen of aspect sweet
 long hair than ermine's fur more snowy white
 and skilled withal in many a wondrous feat
 towards agria's villa so transmewed
 the fairy and the knight their way pursued

 cvii
 "and at the labourer's cabins in his round
 the stripling halts before he stops elsewhere
 and certain rustic reeds begins to sound
 his dog is up and dances to the air
 the dame that hears the voice and cry rebound
 is by the rumour moved to see the pair
 into her court she has the pilgrim brought
 as anselm's evil destiny had wrought

 cviii
 "and here adonio gives the dog command
 and here by that obedient dog is shown
 dance of our country and of foreign land
 with paces graces fashions of his own
 and finally he does amid that band
 with winning ways what else is to be done
 with such attention of the admiring crew
 none winked their eyes their breath they scarcely drew

 cix
 "great marvel in the dame then longing bred
 that gentle dog she one that her had nursed
 with no mean offer to his master sped
  `if all the riches for which women thirst'
 to her embassadress in answer said
 the wary pilgrim `in my bags were pursued
 there is not in that treasure what would boot
 to purchase of my dog one single foot'

 cx
 "and he the truth of his discourse to show
 into a corner took the beldam old
 and bade the dog in courtesy bestow
 upon that messanger a mark of gold
 the dog obeyed and shook himself and lo
 the treasure which he bade her have and hold
 thereto he added `thinkest thou by ought
 a dog so fair and useful can be bought

 cxi
 " `for whatsoever i of him demand
 i emptyhanded never go away
 now pearl now ring will he shake from him and
 now gift me with some rich and fair array
 yet tell madonna he is at her command
 but not for gold for him no gold can pay
 but if i for one night her arms may fill
 him may she take and do with him her will'

 cxii
 "so said a gem newdropt on her he prest
 and bade her to the lady bear the boon
 that in the costly produce she possest
 ten twenty ducats' value deemed the crone
 she bore the message to the dame addressed
 and after wrought on her till she was won
 to buy the beauteous dog who might be bought
 by payment of a prize which costeth nought

 cxiii
 "argia somewhat coy at first appears
 partly that she her faith will not forego
 partly that she believes not all she hears
 that beldam of the dog and pilgrim show
 the nurse insists and dins into her ears
 that seldom such a chance occurs below
 and makes her fix another day to see
 that dog when fewer eyes on her shall be

 cxiv
 "the next appearance which adonio made
 was ruin to the doctor for the hound
 doubloons by dozens and by dozens braid
 of pearl and costly jewels scattered round
 so that argia's pride of heart was laid
 and so much less the dame maintained her ground
 when she in him who made the proffer viewed
 the mantuan cavalier that whilom wooed

 cxv
 "the harlot nurse's evil oratory
 the prayer and presence of the suitor lord
 the occasion to acquire that mighty fee
 which wretched anselm's absence would afford
 the hope that none would her accuser be
 so vanquish her chaste thoughts she makes the accord 
 accepts the wondrous dog and as his pay
 to her leman yields herself a willing prey

 cxvi
 the fruits of love long culled that cavalier
 with his lady fair unto whom the fay
 took such affection whom she held so dear
 that she obliged herself with her to stay
 through all the signs the sun had travelled ere
 the judge had leave to wend his homeward way
 he finally returned but sore afraid
 through what the astrologer erewhile had said

 cxvii
 "arrived his first employment is to run
 to that astrologer's abode and crave
 if shame and evil to his wife be done
 of if she yet her faith and honor save
 the heavens he figured and to every one
 of the seven planets its due station gave
 then to the judge replied that it had been
 even as he feared and as it was foreseen

 cxviii
 "by richest presents tempted to forego
 her faith a prey was she to other wight
 this to the doctor's heart was such a blow
 nor lance nor spear i deem so sorely smite
 to be more certified he wends although
 he is too well assured the seer is right
 to that old nurse and drawing her apart
 to learn the truth employs his every art

 cxix
 "he in wide circles doth about her wind
 hoping now here now there to spy some trace
 but nought in the beginning can he find
 with whatsoever care he sifts the case
 for she as not unpractised in that kind
 denies and fronts him with untroubled face
 and as well taught above a month stands out
 holding the judge 'twixt certainty and doubt

 cxx
 "how blest would doubt appear had he that wound
 foreseen which would be given by certainty
 when out of that false nurse at last he found
 he could not fish the truth by prayer or fee
 touching no chord but yielded a false sound
 he shrewdly waits his time till there should be
 discord between the beldam and his wife
 for whereso women are is stir and strife

 cxxi
 "and even that anselmo waited so
 befell since angered by the first despite
 unsought of him to him that nurse did go
 to tell the whole and nothing hid from sight
 how sank his heart beneath that cruel blow
 'twere long to say how prostrate lay his sprite
 so was the wretched judge with grief opprest
 he of his wits wellnigh was dispossest

 cxxii
 "and finally resolved to die so burned
 his rage but first would kill the faithless dame
 and he with one destructive faulchion yearned
 to free himself from woe and her from shame
 stung by such blind and furious thoughts returned
 anselmo to the city in a flame
 and to the farm despatched a follower true
 charged with the bidding he was bound to do

 cxxiii
 "he bids the servant to the villa go
 and to argia in his name pretend
 he by a fever is reduced so low
 she hardly can arrive before his end
 hence without waiting escort  would she show
 her love  she with his man must backward wend
 wend with him will she surely nor delay
 and bids him cut her throat upon the way

 cxxiv
 "the serving man to call his lady went
 prepared his lord's command on her to do
 having her little dog at starting hent
 she mounted and began her journey through
 the dog advised of anselm's ill intent
 but bid no less her purpose to pursue
 for he had taken thought for her and aid
 should in the time of peril be purveyed

 cxxv
 "the servant from his pathway turns aside
 and through byeroads and solitary goes
 purposely lighting on a stream whose tide
 from apennine into our river flows
 where both of farm and busy city wide
 a holt and dark and dismal greenwood grows
 silent appeared the gloomy place and one
 fitting the cruel deed which should be done

 cxxvi
 "he drew his sword on her and signified
 the mandate by her angry husband given
 that so she might entreat before she died
 forgiveness of her every sin from heaven
 i know not how she vanished from his side
 when through her flank the blade he would have driven
 vainly long time he seeks her then remains
 foiled and outscorned for guerdon of his pains

 cxxvii
 "he all astound and with bewildered face
 and full of shame to seek his lord returns
 who from the servant that unwonted case
 unweeting how the thing had happened learns
 nor knows the fairy manto fills a place
 about argia prompt to serve her turns
 because the nurse that all the rest revealed
 i know not wherefore i had this concealed

 cxxviii
 "he knows not what to do the outrage sore
 avenged he has not nor his pain allaid
 what was a mote is now a beam so sore
 it prest him on his heart so heavy weighed
 so plain is what was little known before
 he fears that it will shortly be displaid
 at first he haply might have hid his woe
 which rumour now throughout the world will blow

 cxxix
 "full well he wots that since his evil vein
 he to his wife unhappy wretch hath shown
 not to be subject to his yoke again
 she to some strong protector will have flown
 who to his ignominy will maintain
 and utter scorn the lady as his own
 and haply may she to some losel flee
 who will her paramour and pander be

 cxxx
 "for remedy he sends in haste a band
 of messengers with letters far and nigh
 some of argia here some there demand
 nor town unsearched is left in lombardy
 next he in person goes nor any land
 leaves unexamined by himself or spy
 yet cannot he discover means or way
 for learning where concealed his consort lay

 cxxxi
 "the servant last he called on whom was laid
 the ill hest but who had served not his despite
 and thither by his guidance was conveyed
 where as 'twas said she vanished from his sight
 who haply lurked by day in greenwoodshade
 and to some friendly roof retired at night
 he thither guided where but foresttrees
 he thinks to find a sumptuous palace sees

 cxxxii
 "this while for bright argia in that part
 the fay had made with speedy toil prepare
 an alabaster palace by her art
 gilded within without and everywhere
 so wonderful no tongue could tell no heart
 conceive how rich within without how fair
 that which thou deemed so fair my master's home
 is but a cottage to that costly dome

 cxxxiii
 "curtain and cloth of arras deck the wall
 sumptuously woven and in different wise
 in vaulted cellar and in littered stall
 not only spread in latticed galleries
 not only spread in lordly bower and hall
 vase gold and silver gems of many dyes
 carved into cup and charger blue red green
 and countless cloths of silk and gold are seen

 cxxxiv
 "he chanced upon the costly dome as i
 to you was in my story making known
 when he expected not a hut to spy
 and but a weary waste of woodland lone
 as he beheld the dome with wondering eye
 anselmo thought his intellects were gone
 that he was drunk or dreamed that wondrous sight
 he weened of that his wits had taken flight

 cxxxv
 "an aethiop woman posted at the door
 with blubber lip and nostril he descries
 nor will he see again nor e'er before
 had seen a visage of such loathsome guise
 illfavoured  such was aesop feigned of yore
 if there she would have saddened paradise
 greasy and foul and beggarly her vest
 nor half her hideousness have i exprest

 cxxxvi
 "anselm who saw no other wight beside
 to tell who was that mansion's lord drew nigh
 to the aethiopian and to her applied
 and she `the owner of this house am i'
 the judge was well assured the negress lied
 and made that answer but in mockery
 but with repeated oaths the negress swears
 'tis hers and none with her the mansions shares

 cxxxvii
 "and would he see the palace him invites
 to view it at his ease and recommends
 if there be ought within which him delights
 to take it for himself or for his friends
 anselmo hears and from his horse alights
 gives it his man and o'er the threshold wends
 and by the hag conducted mounts from hall
 below to bower above admiring all

 cxxxviii
 "form site and sumptuous work doth he behold
 and royal ornament and fair device
 and oft repeats not all this wide world's gold
 to buy the egregious mansion wound suffice
 to him in answer said that negress old
 'and yet this dome like others hath its prize
 if not in gold and silver price less high
 than gold and silver will the palace buy'

 cxxxix
 "and she to him prefers the same request
 which erst adonio to argia made
 a fool he deemed the woman and possest
 who for a boon so foul and filthy prayed
 yet ceased she not though more than thrice represt
 and strove so well anselmo to persuade
 proffering for his reward the palace still
 she wrought on him to do her evil will

 cxl
 "the wife argia that is hid fast by
 when in such sin her husband she descries
 of doctor that was deemed so passing wise
 springs forth and saith `ah worthy deed which i
 found in such foul and filthy work espy'
 bethink thee if his kindling blushes rise
 if he stands mute why opens not thy hollow
 and central womb o earth the wretch to swallow

 cxli
 "to clear herself and shame him doth she stun
 anselmo never ceasing to upbraid
 `what pain should by thyself be undergone
 for this so filthy deed argia said
 if thou would'st take my life for having done
 what nature prompted and a lover prayed
 one that was fair and gentle and who brought
 a gift compared wherewith this dome is nought

 cxlii
 " `if worthy of one death thou deemest me
 worthy art thou a hundred deaths to die
 and though my pleasure might i do on thee
 so passing puissant in this place am i
 no other or worse vengeance done shall be
 upon my side on thy delinquency
 the give against the take o husband place
 and as 'twas granted thee so grant me grace

 cxliii
 " `and be there peace between us and accord
 that all be to forgetfulness consigned
 nor thee i of thy fault by deed or word
 nor me of mine henceforward thou remind'
 this seemed a goodly bargain to her lord
 nor to such pardon was he disinclined
 thus peace and concord they at home restore
 and love each other dearly evermore"

 cxliv
 so said the mariner and some brief fit
 of laughter in montalban's master stirred
 and made his visage burn as if 'twas lit
 with fire when of anselmo's shame he heard
 rinaldo greatly praised argia's wit
 who by such quaint device had trapped that bird
 who fell into the net wherein the dame
 herself erewhile had fallen but with less shame

 cxlv
 when the sun climbed a steeper road the knight
 ordered the board with food to be supplied
 which the good mantuan landlord overnight
 took care with largest plenty to provide
 while the fair town upon the left from sight
 retired and on the right that marish wide
 argenta is come and gone with circling walls
 and stream into whose bed santerno falls

 cxlvi
 then was not fair bastia built deem i
 which little cause of boast affords to spain
 that there her banner has been raised on high
 and causes deeper sorrow to romagne
 thence in strait line their bark that seems to fly
 to the right shore the boatmen drive amain
 next through a stagnant channel make that near
 ravenna brings by noon the cavalier

 cxlvii
 though oft of money he had small supply
 then was the knight so well bested he made
 the weary rowers in his courtesy
 a parting present ere farewell was said
 here changing horse and guide to rimini
 rinaldo rode that very eye nor stayed
 in montefiore till the night was done
 and well nigh reached urbino with the sun

 cxlviii
 then frederick was not there of gentle lore
 nor was elizabeth nor guido good
 francis maria nor sage leonore
 who would in courteous not in haughty mood
 have forced so famed a paladin for more
 than one short eye with them to make abode
 as they long did and do unto this day
 by dames and cavaliers who pass that way

 cxlix
 since here none takes his rein rinaldo bends
 his course anend to cagli o'er the height
 rifted by gaurus and metaurus wends
 past apennine no longer on his right
 umbri and tuscans and at rome descends
 from rome to ostia goes montalban's knight
 thence to the city sails wherein a grave
 his pious son to old anchises gave

 cl
 there changes back and thence in haste he goes
 bound towards lampedosa's islandshore
 that place of combat chosen by the foes
 and where they had encountered frank and moor
 rinaldo grants his boatmen no repose
 that do what can be done by sail and oar
 but with ill wind and strong the warrior strives
 and though by little there too late arrives

 cli
 thither he came what time anglante's peer
 the useful and the glorious deed had done
 had slain those paynim kings in the career
 but had a hard and bloody conquest won
 dead was sir brandimart and olivier
 dangerously hurt and sore sate woebegone
 somedeal apart upon the sandy ground
 martyred and crippled by his cruel wound

 clii
 from tears could not the mournful count refrain
 when brave rinaldo he embraced and said
 how in the battle brandimart was slain
 such love such faith endeared the warrior dead
 nor less rinaldo's tears his visage stain
 when he so cleft beholds their comrade's head
 thence to embrace bold oliviero where
 he sits with wounded foot he makes repair

 cliii
 all comfort that he could he gave though none
 could good rinaldo to himself afford
 because he came but when the feast was done
 yea after the removal of the board
 the servants wend to the demolished town
 there hide the bones of either paynim lord
 beneath biserta's ruined domes and nigh
 and far the fearful tidings certify

 cliv
 at the fair conquest won by roland's blade
 sansonet and astolpho make great cheer
 yet other mirth those warriors would have made
 had brandimart not perished when they hear
 that he is dead their joy is so allayed
 they can no more the troubled visage clear
 which of them now the tidings of such woe
 to the unhappy flordelice shall show

 clv
 the night preceding that illomened day
 flordelice dreamed the vest of sable grain
 that she had made her husband to array
 and woven with her hand and worked with pain
 before her eyes all sprinkledover lay
 with ruddy drops in guise of pattering rain
 that she had worked it so the lady thought
 and then was grieved at seeing what was wrought

 clvi
 and seemed to say "yet from my lord have i
 command to make it all of sable hue
 now wherefore it is stained with other dye
 against his will in mode so strange to view"
 she from that dream draws evil augury
 and thither on that eve the tidings flew
 but these concealed astolpho from the dame
 till he to her with sansonetto came

 clvii
 when they are entered and she sees no show
 of joyful triumphs she without a word
 without a hint to indicate that woe
 knows that no longer living is her lord
 with that her gentle heart was riven so
 and so her harassed eyes the light abhorred
 and so was every other sense astound
 that like one dead she sank upon the ground

 clviii
 she in her hair when life returns again
 fastens her hand and on her lovely cheeks
 repeating the beloved name in vain
 with all her force her scorn and fury wreaks
 uproots and tears her locks and in her pain
 like woman smit by evil demon shrieks
 or as bacchante at the horn's rude sound
 erewhile was seen to run her restless round

 clix
 now to the one to the other now her prayer
 she made for knife wherewith her heart to smite
 now she aboard the pinnace would repair
 that brought the corse of either paynim knight
 and would on either lifeless as they were
 do cruel scathe and vent her fierce despite
 now would she seek her lord till at his side
 she rested from her weary search and died

 clx
 "ah wherefore brandimart did i let thee
 without me wend on such a dire emprize
 she ne'er before did thy departure see
 but flordelice aye followed thee" she cries
 "well aided mightest thou have been by me
 for i on thee should still have kept my eyes
 and when gradasso came behind thee i
 thee might have succoured with a single cry

 clxi
 "and haply i so nimbly might have made
 between you that the stroke i might have caught
 and with my head as with a buckler stayed
 for little ill my dying would have wrought
 anyhow i shall die and  that debt paid 
 my melancholy death will profit nought
 when had i died defending thee in strife
 i could not better have bestowed my life

 clxii
 "even is averse had been hard destiny
 and all heaven's host when thee i sought to aid
 at least my tears had bathed thy visage i
 should the last kiss thereon at least have laid
 and ere amid the blessed hierarchy
 thy spirit mixt `depart'  i should have said 
 `in peace and wait me in thy rest for there
 where'er thou art i swiftly shall repair'

 clxiii
 "is this o brandimart is this the reign
 whose honoured sceptre thou wast now to take
 with thee to dommogire thy fair domain
 thus went i me thus welcome dost thou make
 alas what hope today thou renderest vain
 ah what designs fell fortune dost thou break
 ah wherefore fear i since a lot so blest
 is lost to lose as well the worthless rest"

 clxiv
 repeating this and other plaint so spite
 and fury waxed that she in her despair
 made new assault upon her tresses bright
 as if the fault was wholly in her hair
 wildly her hands together doth she smite
 and gnaw with nails her lip and bosom tear
 but i return to roland and his peers
 while she bemoans herself and melts in tears

 clxv
 roland with olivier who much requires
 such leech's care his anguish to allay
 and who himself some worthy place desires
 as much wherein sir brandimart to lay
 steers for the lofty mountain that with fires
 brightens the night with smoke obscures the day
 the wind blows fair and on the starboard hand
 not widely distant from them lies that land

 clxvi
 with a fresh wind that in their favour blows
 they loose their hawser at the close of day
 in heaven above the silent goddess shows
 her shining horn to guide them on their way
 and on the following morn before them rose
 the pleasant shores that round girgenti lay
 here roland orders for the ensuing night
 all that is needful for the funeral rite

 clxvii
 he when he saw his order duly done
 and now the westering sun's fair light was spent
 with many nobles who from neighbouring town
 at his invital to girgenti went
  the shore with torches blazing up and down
 and sounding wide with cries and loud lament 
 thither returned where late of life bereft
 his friends beloved in life and death was left

 clxviii
 there stands bardino weeping o'er the bier
 who under age's heavy burden bows
 who in the tears on shipboard shed whilere
 might well have wept away his eyes and brows
 upbraiding skies and stars the cavalier
 like lion in whose veins a fever glows
 roars as he wreathes his wayward hands within
 his hoary hair and rends his wrinkled skin

 clxix
 upon the paladin's return the cry
 redoubled and the mourning louder grew
 orlando to the corse approached more nigh
 and speechless stood awhile his friends to view
 pale as at eve is the acanthus' dye
 or lily's which were plucked at morn he drew
 a heavy sigh and on the warrior dead
 fixing his stedfast eyes the county said

 clxx
 "o comrade bold and true there here liest slain
 and who dost live in heaven above i know
 rewarded with a life thy glorious gain
 which neither heat nor cold can take my woe
 forgive if thou beholdest me complain
 because i sorrow to remain below
 and not to share in such delights with thee
 not that thou art not left behind with me

 clxxi
 "alone without thee there is nought i may
 ever possess without thee that can please
 if still with thee in tempest and affray
 ah wherefore not with thee in calm and ease
 right sore must be my trespass since this clay
 will not to follow thee my soul release
 if in thy troubles still i bore a burden
 why am i not a partner of thy guerdon

 clxxii
 "thine is the guerdon mine the loss thy gain
 is single but not single is my woe
 partners with me in sorrow are almayne
 and grieving france and italy and oh
 how will my lord and uncle charlemagne
 how will his paladins lament the blow
 how will the christian church and empire moan
 whose best defence in thee is overthrown

 clxxiii
 "oh how thy foes will by the death of thee
 be freed henceforward from alarm and fear
 alas how strengthened paynimry will be
 what hardiment will now be theirs what cheer
 what of thy consort will become i see
 even here her mourning and her outcries hear
 me she accuses haply hates i know
 in that through me her every hope lies low

 clxxiv
 "yet by one comfort flordelice is followed
 his loss for us that reft of him remain
 his death with such surpassing glory hallowed
 to die all living warriors should be fain
 those decii curtius in rome's forum swallowed
 cordus so vaunted by the grecian train
 not with more honour to themselves with more
 profit to others went to death of yore"

 clxxv
 these sad laments and more orlando made
 and all this while white friars and black and gray
 with other clerks by two and two arrayed
 behind in long procession took their way
 and they to god for the departed prayed
 that he would to his rest his soul convey
 before and all about were torches reared
 and changed to day the sable night appeared

 clxxvi
 they raise the warrior's bier and ranged to bear
 by turns that honoured weight were earl and knight
 the pall was purple silk with broidery rare
 of gold and pearls in costly circles dight
 thereon of lordly work and no less fair
 cushions were laid with jewels shining bright
 on which was stretched the lifeless knight in view
 arrayed in vest of like device and hue

 clxxvii
 a hundred men had past before the rest
 all taken from the poorest of the town
 and in one fashion equally were drest
 those beadsmen all in black and trailing gown
 a hundred pages followed them who prest
 a hundred puissant steeds for warfare bown
 and by those pages backed the portly steeds
 went sweeping wide the ground with sable weeds

 clxxviii
 banners in front and banners borne in rear
 whose fields with diverse ensignry is stained
 unfurled accompany the funeral bier
 which from a thousand vanquished bands were gained
 for caesar and for peter's church whilere
 by that rare force which now extinct remained
 bucklers by other followers carried are
 won from good warriors whose device they bear

 clxxix
 by hundreds and by hundreds followed more
 ordained for different tasks the steps of those
 who burning torches like those others bore
 mantled say rather closely muffled goes
 roland in sables next and evermore
 his eyes suffused and red with weeping shows
 nor wears a gladder face montalban's peer
 at home his wound detains sir olivier

 clxxx
 the ceremonies would be long to say
 in verse wherewith sir brandimart was mourned
 the mantles black or purple given away
 the many torches which that eve were burned
 wending to the cathedral where the array
 past on its road were no dry eyes discerned
 all sexes ages ranks in pitying mood
 gazed upon him so youthful fair and good

 clxxxi
 he in the church was placed and when with vain
 lament the women had bemoaned the dead
 and kyrie eleison by the priestly train
 and other holy orisons were said
 in a fair ark upraised on columns twain
 was reared with sumptuous cloth of gold o'erspread
 so willed orlando till he could be laid
 in sepulchre of costlier matter made

 clxxxii
 nor out of sicily the count departs
 till porphyries he procures and alabasters
 and fair designs and in their several arts
 has with large hire engaged the primest masters
 next flordelice arriving in those parts
 raises the quarried slabs and rich pilasters
 who good orlando being gone before
 is hither wafted from the africk shore

 clxxxiii
 she seeing that her tears unceasing flow
 and that of long lament she never tires
 nor she for mass or service said her woe
 can ease or satisfy her sad desires
 vows in her heart she thence will never go
 till from the wearied corse her soul expires
 and builds in that fair sepulchre a cell
 there shuts herself therein for life will dwell

 clxxxiv
 thither in person having courier sent
 and letter roland goes her thence to take
 her would she wend to france with goodly rent
 would gift and galerana's inmate make
 as far as lizza convoy her if bent
 on journeying to her father for her sake
 if wholly she to serve her god was willed
 a monastery would the warrior build

 clxxxv
 still in that sepulchre she dwelt and worn
 by weary penance praying night and day
 it was not long ere by the parcae shorn
 was her life's thread already on their way
 were the three christian warriors homeward borne
 sorrowing and afflicted sore in mind
 for their fourth comrade who remained behind

 clxxxvi
 they would not go without a leech whose skill
 might ease the wound of warlike olivier
 which as in the beginning it could ill
 be salved is hard to heal meanwhile they hear
 the champion so complain his outcries fill
 orlando and all that company with fear
 while they discoursed thereon the skipper moved
 by a new notion said what all approved

 clxxxvii
 a hermit not far distance hence he said
 a lonely rock inhabits in this sea
 whose isle none seeking succour vainly tread
 whether for counsel or for aid it be
 who hath done superhuman deeds the dead
 restores to life and makes the blind to see
 hushes the winds and with a sign o' the cross
 lulls the loud billows when they highest toss

 clxxxviii
 and adds they need not doubt if they will go
 to seek that holy man to god so dear
 but he on olivier will health bestow
 having his virtue proved by signs more clear
 this counsel pleases good orlando so
 that for the holy place he bids him steer
 who never swerving from his course espies
 the lonely rock upon aurora's rise

 clxxxix
 worked by good mariners the bark was laid
 safely beside the rugged rock and fell
 the marquis there with crew and servants' aid
 they lowered into their boat and through the swell
 and foaming waters in that shallop made
 for the rude isle thence sought the holy cell
 the holy cell of that same hermit hoar
 by whom rogero was baptized before

 cxc
 the servant of the lord of paradise
 receives orlando and the rest on land
 blesses the company in cheerful wise
 and after of their errand makes demand
 though he already had received advice
 from angels of the coming of that band
 that they were thither bound in search of aid
 for oliviero's hurt orlando said

 cxci
 who warring for the christian faith in fight
 to perilous pass was brought by evil wound
 all dismal fear relieved that eremite
 and promised he would make him wholly sound
 in that no unguents hath the holy wight
 nor is in other human medicine found
 his church he seeks his knee to jesus bows
 and issues from the fane with cheerful brows

 cxcii
 and in the name of those eternal three
 the father and the son and holy ghost
 on oliviero bade his blessing be
 oh grace vouchsafed to faith his sainted host
 from every pain the paladin did free
 and to his foot restored its vigour lost
 he moved more nimble than before and sure
 and present was sobrino at the cure

 cxciii
 sobrino so diseased that he described
 how worse with each succeeding day he grew
 as soon as he that holy monk espied
 the manifest and mighty marvel do
 disposed himself to cast mahound aside
 and own in christ a living god and true
 he full of faith with contrite heart demands
 our holy rite of baptism at his hands

 cxciv
 so him baptized the hermit and as well
 that monarch made as vigorous as whilere
 at this conversion no less gladness fell
 on roland and each christian cavalier
 than when restored from deadly wound and well
 the friendly troop beheld sir olivier
 rogero more rejoiced than all that crew
 and still in faith and grace the warrior grew

 cxcv
 rogero from the day he swam ashore
 upon that islet there had ever been
 that band is counselled by the hermit hoar
 who stands benign those warlike knights between
 eschewing in their passage mire and moor
 to wade withal through that dead water clean
 which men call life wherein so fools delight
 and evermore on heaven to fix their sight

 cxcvi
 roland on shipboard sends one from his throng
 who fetches hence good wine hams cheese and bread
 and makes the sage who had forgotten long
 all taste of partridge since on fruits he fed
 even do for love what others did among
 those social guests for whom the board was spread
 they when their strength by food was reinforced
 of many things amid themselves discoursed

 cxcvii
 and as in talk it often doth befall
 that one thing from another takes its rise
 roland and olivier rogero call
 to mind for that rogero in such wise
 renowned in arms whose valour is of all
 lauded and echoed with accordant cries
 not even had rinaldo known the knight
 for him whose prowess he had proved in fight

 cxcviii
 him well sobrino recognized whilere
 as soon as with that aged man espied
 but he at first kept silence for in fear
 of some mistake the monarch's tongue was tied
 but when those others knew the cavalier
 for that rogero famous far and wide
 whose courtesy whose might and daring through
 the universal world loud rumor blew

 cxcix
 all for they know he is a christian stand
 about him with serene and joyful face
 all press upon the knight one grasps his hand
 another locks him fast in his embrace
 yet more than all the others of that band
 him would montalban's lord caress and grace
 why more than all the others will appear
 in other strain if you that strain will hear


 canto 44

 argument
 rinaldo his sister to the child hath plight
 and to marseilles is with the warrior gone
 and having crimsoned wide the field in fight
 therein arrives king otho's valiant son
 to paris thence where to that squadron bright
 is mighty grace and wonderous honour done
 the child departs resolved on leo's slaughter
 to whom duke aymon had betrothed his daughter


 i
 in poor abode mid paltry walls and bare
 amid discomforts and calamities
 often in friendship heart united are
 better than under roof of lordly guise
 or in some royal court beset with snare
 mid envious wealth and ease and luxuries
 where charity is spent on every side
 nor friendship unless counterfeit is spied

 ii
 hence it ensues that peace and pact between
 princes and peers are of such shortlived wear
 today king pope and emperor leagued are seen
 and on the marrow deadly foemen are
 because such is not as their outward mien
 the heart the spirit that those sovereigns bear
 since wholly careless as to right or wrong
 but to their profit look the faithless throng

 iii
 though little prone to friendship is that sort
 because with those she loveth not to dwell
 who be their talk in earnest or in sport
 speak not except some cozening tale to tell
 yet if together in some poor resort
 they prisoned are by fortune false and fell
 what friendship is they speedily discern
 though years had past and this was yet to learn

 iv
 in his retreat that ancient eremite
 could bind his inmates with a faster noose
 and in true love more firmly them unite
 than other could in domes where courtiers use
 and so enduring was the knot and tight
 that nothing short of death the tie could loose
 benignant all the hermit found that crew
 whiter at heart than swans in outward hue

 v
 all kind he found them and of courteous lore
 untainted with iniquity in wise
 of them i painted and who nevermore
 go forth unless concealed in some disguise
 of injuries among them done before
 all memory by those comrades buried lies
 nor could they better love if from one womb
 and from one seed that warlike band had come

 vi
 rinaldo more than all that lordly train
 rogero graced and lovingly caressed
 as well because be on the listed plain
 had proved the peer so strong in martial gest
 as that he was more courteous and humane
 than any knight that e'er laid lance in rest
 but much more that to him on many a ground
 by mighty obligation was he bound

 vii
 the fearful risk by richardetto run
 he knew and how rogero him bested
 what time the spanish monarch's hest was done
 and with his daughter he was seized in bed
 and how he had delivered either son
 of good duke buovo as erewhile was said
 from bertolagi of maganza's hand
 his evil followers and the paynim band

 viii
 to honour and to hold rogero dear
 him sir rinaldo thought this debt constrained
 and that he could not so have done whilere
 the warlike lord was sorely grieved and pained
 when one for africk's monarch couched the spear
 and one the cause of royal charles maintained
 now he rogero for a christian knew
 what could not then be done he now would do

 ix
 welcome with endless proffers on his side
 and honour he to good rogero paid
 the prudent sire that in such kindness spied
 an opening made for more the pass assayed
 "and nothing else remains" that hermit cried
 "nor will i trust my counsel be gainsaid
 but that conjoined by friendship you shall be
 yet faster coupled by affinity

 x
 "that from the two bright progenies which none
 will equal in illustrious blood below
 a race may spring that brighter than the sun
 will shine wherever that bright sun may glow
 and which when years and ages will have run
 their course will yet endure and fairer show
 while in their orbits burn the heavenly fires
 so me for your instruction god inspires"

 xi
 and his discourse pursuing still the seer
 so spake he moves rinaldo by his rede
 to give his sister to the cavalier
 albeit with either small entreaties need
 together with orlando olivier
 the counsel lauds and would that union speed
 king charles and aymon will he hopes approve
 and france will welcome wide their wedded love

 xii
 so spake together peer and paladine
 nor knew that aymon with king charles' consent
 unto the grecian emperor constantine
 to give his gentle daughter had intent
 who for young leo of his lofty line
 the heir and hope to crave the maid had sent
 such warmth the praises of her worth inspired
 with love of her unseen was leo fired

 xiii
 to him hath aymon answered he alone
 cannot conclude thereon in other sort
 until he first hath spoken with his son
 rinaldo absent then from charles's court
 who with winged haste he deems will thither run
 and joy in kinsman of such high report
 but from the high regard he bears his heir
 can nought resolve till thither he repair

 xiv
 now good rinaldo of his father wide
 and of the imperial practice knowing nought
 promised his beauteous sister as a bride
 upon his own as well as roland's thought
 and the others harboured in that cell beside
 but most of all on him the hermit wrought
 and by such marriage 'twas the peer's belief
 he could not choose but pleasure clermont's chief

 xv
 that day and night and of the following day
 great part with that sage monk the warriors spent
 scarce mindful that the crew their coming stay
 albeit the wind blew fair for their intent
 but these impatient at their long delay
 more than one message to the warriors sent
 and to return those barons urged so sore
 parforce they parted from the hermit hoar

 xvi
 the child who so long banished had not stayed
 from the lone rock whereon the waters roared
 his farewell to that holy master made
 who taught him the true faith anew with sword
 orlando girt his side and with the blade
 frontino and martial hector's arms restored
 as knowing horse and arms were his whilere
 as well as out of kindness to the peer

 xvii
 and though the enchanted sword with better right
 would have been worn by good anglantes' chief
 who from the fearful garden by his might
 had won the blade with mickle toil and grief
 than by rogero who that faulchion bright
 received with good frontino from the thief
 he willingly thereof as with the rest
 as soon as asked the warrior repossest

 xviii
 the hermit blessings on the band implores
 they to their bark in fine return their sails
 give to the winds and to the waves their oars
 and such clear skies they have and gentle gales
 nor vow nor prayer the patron makes and moors
 his pinnace in the haven of marseilles
 there safely harboured let the chiefs remain
 till i conduct astolpho to that train

 xix
 when of that bloody dearbrought victory
 the scarcely joyful tale astolpho knew
 he seeing evermore fair france would be
 secure from mischief from the moorish crew
 homeward to send the king of aethiopy
 devised together with his army through
 the sandy desert by the selfsame track
 through which he led them to biserta's sack

 xx
 erewhile restored in afric waters ride
 sir dudon's ships which did the paynims rout
 whose prows new miracle and poop and side
 as soon as all their sable crews are out
 are changed anew to leaves which far and wide
 raised by a sudden breeze are blown about
 and scattered in midair like such light gear
 go eddying with the wind and disappear

 xxi
 home horse and foot the nubian host arraid
 by squadrons all from wasted africk go
 but to their king first thanks astolpho paid
 and said he an eternal debt should owe
 in that he had in person given him aid
 with all his might and main against the foe
 the skins astolpho gave them which confined
 the turbid and tempestuous southern wind

 xxii
 i say enclosed in skins that wind he gave
 which in such fury blows at noon on high
 i moves the shifting plain in many a wave
 and fills the eddying sand the troubled sky
 to carry with them and from scathe to save
 their squadrons lest the dusty whirlwind fly
 and bids them when arrived at home unnoose
 the bladder's vent and let their prisoners loose

 xxiii
 when they have lofty atlas passes won
 the horses that the nubian riders bear
 turpin relates are changed at once to stone
 so that the steeds return to what they were
 but it is time the duke to france was gone
 who having thus provided in his care
 for the main places in the moorish land
 made the hippogryph anew his wings expand

 xxiv
 he reached sardinia at one flight and shear
 corsica from sardinia and then o'er
 the foaming sea his venturous course did steer
 inclining somewhat left the griffin's soar
 in the seamarshes last his light career
 he stopt on rich provence's pleasant shore
 where to the hyppogryph by him is done
 what was erewhile enjoined by sainted john

 xxv
 to him the charge did sainted john commit
 when to provence by that winged courser borne
 him nevermore with saddle or with bit
 to gall but let him to his lair return
 already had the planet whither flit
 things lost on earth of sound deprived his horn
 for this not only hoarse but mute remained
 as soon as the holy place astolpho gained

 xxvi
 thence to marseilles he came and came the day
 orlando and rinaldo and olivier
 arrived therein upon their homeward way
 with good sobrino and the better peer
 rogero not so triumphs that array
 touched by the death of him their comrade dear
 as they for such a glorious victory won
  but for that sad disaster  would have done

 xxvii
 of the kings slain upon the paynim part
 the news from sicily to charles were blown
 sobrino's fate and death of brandimart
 nor less of good rogero had been shown
 charles stood with jocund fate and gladsome heart
 rejoicing he had from his shoulders thrown
 the intolerable load whereof the weight
 will for long time prevent his standing straight

 xxviii
 to honour those fair pillars that sustain
 the state  the holy empire's cornerstone 
 the nobles of his kingdom charlemagne
 dispatched to meet the knights as far as saone
 and from his city with his worthiest train
 king duke and her the partner of his throne
 issued amid a fair and gorgeous band
 of noble damsels upon either hand

 xxix
 the emperor charles with bright and cheerful brow
 lords paladins and people kinsmen friends
 fair love to roland and the others show
 mongrana and clermont's cry the welkin rends
 no sooner mid that kind and festal show
 the interchange of fond embracements ends
 than roland and his friends rogero bring
 and mid those lords present him to the king

 xxx
 and him rogero of risa's son declare
 and vouch in valour as his father's peer
 "witnesses of his worth our squadrons are
 they best can tell his prowess with the spear"
 meanwhile the noble and the lovely pair
 marphisa and gentle bradamant appear
 this runs to fold rogero to her heart
 more coy that other stands somedeal apart

 xxxi
 the emperor bids rogero mount again
 who from his horse had lit in reverence due
 and side by side with him his courser rein
 nor aught omits that monarch which may do
 the warrior honour mid his martial train
 how the true faith he had embraced he knew
 of all instructed by that band before
 when first those paladins set foot ashore

 xxxii
 with pomp triumphal and with festive cheer
 the troop returns within the citywalls
 with leaves and garlands green the streets appear
 and tapestried all about with gorgeous palls
 of herbs and flowers a mingled rain where'er
 they wend upon the conquering squadron falls
 which with full hands from stand and window throw
 damsel and dame upon the knights below

 xxxiii
 at every turn in various places are
 of sudden structure arch and trophy high
 whereon biserta's sack is painted fair
 ruin and fire and feat of chivalry
 scaffolds upraised for different sports elsewhere
 and merrimake and stageplay meet the eye
 and writ with truth above below between
 to the empire's saviours everywhere is seen

 xxxiv
 with sound of shrilling pipe and trumpet proud
 and other festive music laughter light
 applause and favour of the following crowd
 which scarce found room begirt with dames and knight
 the mighty emperor mid those greetings loud
 before the royal palace did alight
 where many days he feasted high in hall
 his lords mid tourney mummery mask and ball

 xxxv
 his son to aymon on a day made known
 his sister he would make rogero's bride
 and before olivier and milo's son
 her to the child by promise had affied
 who think with him that kindred is there none
 wherewith to league themselves on any side
 for valour or nobility of blood
 better than his nay none so passing good

 xxxvi
 duke aymon heard his heir with some disdain
 that without concert with him and alone
 he dared to plight his daughter whom he fain
 would marry to the grecian emperor's son
 and not to him that has no kingly reign
 nay has not ought that he can call his own
 and should not know how little nobleness
 is valued without wealth how virtue less

 xxxvii
 but beatrice his wife with more despite
 arraigns her son and calls him arrogant
 and moves each open way and hidden sleight
 to break rogero's match with bradamant
 resolved to tax her every means and might
 to make her empress of the wide levant
 firm in his purpose is montalban's lord
 nor will in ought forego his plighted word

 xxxviii
 beatrice who believes the highminded fair
 is at her hest exhorts her to reply
 rather than she will be constrained to pair
 with a poor knight she is resolved to die
 nor if this wrong she from rinaldo bear
 will she regard her with a mother's eye
 let her refuse and keep her stedfast course
 for her free will rinaldo cannot force

 xxxix
 silent stands mournful bradamant nor dares
 meanwhile her ladymother's speech gainsay
 to whom such reverence and respect she bears
 she thinks no choice is left but to obey
 yet a foul fault it in her eyes appears
 if what she will not do she falsely say
 she will not for she cannot since above
 all guidance great or small is mighty love

 xl
 deny she dared not nor yet seem content
 so sighed and spake not but  when uncontrolled
 she could  she gave her secret sorrow vent
 while from her eyes the tears like billows rolled
 a portion of the pains that her torment
 inflicting on her breast and locks of gold
 for this she beat and those uptore and brake
 and thus she made lament and thus she spake

 xli
 "ah shall i will what she wills not by right
 more sovereign mistress of my will than i
 hers shall i hold so cheaply so to slight
 a mother's will my own to satisfy
 alas what blemish is so foul to sight
 in damsel what so ill as to affy
 myself to husband reckless of her will
 which 'tis my duty ever to fulfil

 xlii
 "wo worth the while and shall i then to thee
 by filial love be forced to be untrue
 o my rogero and surrender me
 to a new hope a new love and a new
 desire or rather from those ties break free
 from all good children to good parents due
 observance reverence cast aside and measure
 my duty by my happiness my pleasure

 xliii
 "i know alas what i should do i know
 that which a duteous daughter doth behove
 i know but what avails it if not so
 my reason moves me as my senses move
 if she retires before a stronger foe
 nor can i of myself dispose for love
 nor think how to dispose so strict his sway
 nor saving as he dictates do and say

 xliv
 "aymon and beatrice's child the slave
 of love am i ah miserable me
 i from my parents am in hope to have
 pardon and pity if in fault i be
 but if i anger love whose prayer shall save
 me from his fury till one only plea
 of mine the godhead shall vouchsafe to hear
 nor doom me dead as soon as i appear

 xlv
 "alas with long and obstinate pursuit
 to our faith to draw rogero have i wrought
 and finally have drawn but with what boot
 if my fair deed for other's good be wrought
 so yearly by the bee whose labour's fruit
 is lost for her is hive with honey fraught
 but i will die ere i the child forsake
 and other husband than rogero take

 xlvi
 "if i shall not obey my father's hest
 nor mothers i my brother's shall obey
 of greater wisdom far than them possest
 nor time hath made that warrior's wit his prey
 and what he wills by roland is profest
 and one and the other on my side are they
 a pair more feared and honoured far and wide
 than all the members of my house beside

 xlvii
 "if them the flower of clermont's noble tree
 the glory and the splendor all account
 if all believe our other chivalry
 they more than head o'ertops the foot surmount
 why would i aymon should dispose of me
 rather than good rinaldo and the count
 i should not so much less as not affied
 to leo and rogero's promised bride"

 xlviii
 if cruel thoughts the afflicted maid torment
 rogero's mind enjoys not more repose
 for albeit those sad tidings have not vent
 yet in the city he the secret knows
 he o'er his humble fortunes makes lament
 which his enjoying such a good oppose
 as unendowed with riches or with reign
 dispensed so widely to a worthless train

 xlix
 of other goods which nature's hand supplies
 or which acquired by man's own study are
 he such a portion in himself espies
 such and so large was never other's share
 in that no beauty with his beauty vies
 in that resistance to his might is rare
 the palm by none from him can challenged be
 in regal splendour magnanimity

 l
 but they at whose disposal honours lie
 who give at will and take away renown
 the vulgar herd and from the vulgar i
 except the prudent man distinguished none
 nor emperor pope nor king is raised more high
 than these by sceptre mitre or by crown
 nor save by prudence save by judgement given
 but to the favoured few by partial heaven

 li
 this vulgar to say out what i would say
 which only honours wealth therewith more smit
 than any worldly thing beside nor they
 aught heed or aught esteem ungraced with it
 be beauty or be daring what it may
 dexterity or prowess worth or wit
 or goodness  yet more vulgar stands confest
 in that whereof i speak than in the rest

 lii
 rogero said "if aymon is disposed
 an empress in his bradamant to see
 let not his treaty be so quickly closed
 with leo let a year be granted me
 in that meanwhile i hope by me deposed
 shall leo with his royal father be
 and i encircled with their forfeit crown
 shall be for aymon no unworthy son

 liii
 "but if he give without delay as said
 his daughter to the son of constantine
 if to that promise no regard be paid
 which good rinaldo and the paladine
 his cousin erst before the hermit made
 the marquis olivier and king sobrine
 what shall i do such grievous wrong shall i
 endure or rather than endure it die

 liv
 "what shall i do her father then pursue
 on whom for vengeance this grave outrage cries
 i heed not that the deed is hard to do
 or if the attempt in me is weak or wise 
 but presuppose that with his kindred crew
 slain by my hand that unjust elder dies
 this will in nothing further my content
 nay it will wholly frustrate my intent

 lv
 " `twas ever my intent and still 'tis so
 to have the love not hatred of that fair
 but should i aymon slay or bring some woe
 by plot or practice on his house or heir
 will she not justly hold me as her foe
 and me that foeman as her lord forswear
 what shall i do endure such injury
 ah no by heaven far rather i will die

 lvi
 "nay die i will not but with better right
 shall leo die who so disturbs my joy
 he and his unjust sire less dear his flight
 with helen paid her paramour of troy
 nor yet in older time that foul despite
 done to proserpina cost such annoy
 to bold pirithous as for her i've lost
 my grief of heart shall son and father cost

 lvii
 "can it be true my life that to forsake
 thy champion for this greek should grieve not thee
 and could thy father force thee him to take
 though joined thy brethren with thy sire should be
 but 'tis my fear that thou would'st rather make
 accord withal with aymon than with me
 and that it seemeth better in thy sight
 to wed with caesar than with simple wight

 lviii
 "can it be true that royal name should blind
 imperial title pomp and majesty
 and taint my bradamant's egregious mind
 her mighty valour and her virtue high
 so that as cheaper she should cast behind
 her plighted faith and from her promise fly
 nor sooner she a foe to love be made
 than she no longer say what once she said"

 lix
 these things rogero said and more beside
 discoursing with himself and in such strain
 oftentimes the afflicted warrior cried
 that standerby o'erheard the knight complain
 and more than once his grief was signified
 to her that was the occasion of his pain
 who no less for his cruel woe when known
 lamented than for sorrows of her own

 lx
 but most of all the sorrows that were said
 to vex rogero most it works her woe
 to hear that he afflicts himself in dread
 lest for the grecian prince she him forego
 hence this belief this error from his head
 to drive comfort on the knight bestow
 the trustiest of her bowerwomen one day
 she to rogero bade these words convey

 lxi
 "rogero i what i was till death will be
 and be more faithful if i can be more
 deals love in kindness or in scorn with me
 hath doubtful fortune good or ill in store
 i am a very rock of faith by sea
 and winds unmoved which round about it roar
 nor i have changed for calm or storm nor i
 will ever change to all eternity

 lxii
 "sooner shall file or chisel made of lead
 to the rough diamond various forms impart
 than any stroke by fickle fortune sped
 or love's keen anger break my constant heart
 sooner return to alp their fountainhead
 the troubled streams that from its summit part
 than e'er for change or chances good or nought
 shall wander from its way my stedfast thought

 lxiii
 "all power o'er me have i bestowed on you
 rogero and more than others may divine
 i know that to a prince whose throne is new
 was never fealty sworn more true than mine
 nor ever surer state this wide world through
 by king or keysar was possest than thine
 thou need'st not dig a ditch nor build a tower
 in fear lest any rob thee of that power

 lxiv
 "for if thou hire no aids assault is none
 but what thereon shall aye be made in vain
 nor shall it be by any riches won
 so vile a price no gentle heart can gain
 nor by nobility nor kingly crown
 that dazzle so the silly vulgar train
 nor beauty puissant with the weak and light
 shall ever make me thee for other slight

 lxv
 "thou hast no cause amid thy griefs to fear
 my heart should ever bear new impress more
 so deeply is thine image graven here
 it cannot be removed that my heart's core
 is not of wax is proved for love whilere
 smote it a hundred times not once before
 he by his blows a single scale displaced
 what time therein his hand thine image traced

 lxvi
 "ivory gem and every hardgrained stone
 that best resists the griding tool may break
 but save the form it once hath taken none
 will ever from the graver's iron take
 my heart like marble is or thing least prone
 beneath the chisel's trenchant edge to flake
 love this may wholly splinter ere he may
 another's beauty in its core enlay"

 lxvii
 other and many words with comfort rife
 and full of love and faith she said beside
 which might a thousand times have given him life
 albeit a thousand times the knight had died
 but when most clear of the tempestuous strife
 in friendly port these hopes appeared to ride
 these hopes a foul and furious wind anew
 far from the sheltering land to seaward blew

 lxviii
 in that the gentle bradamant who fain
 would do far more than she hath signified
 with wonted daring armed her heart again
 and boldly casting all respect aside
 one day stood up before king charlemagne
 and "sire if ever yet" the damsel cried
 "i have found favour in your eyes for deed
 done heretofore deny me not its meed

 lxix
 "and i entreat before i claim my fee
 that you to me your royal promise plight
 to grant my prayer and fain would have you see
 that what i shall demand is just and right"
 "thy valour damsel dear deserves from me
 the boon wherewith thy worth i should requite"
 charles answered "and i to content thee swear
 though of my kingdom thou should'st claim a share"

 lxx
 "the boon for which i to your highness sue
 is not to let my parents me accord
 pursued the martial damsel save he shew
 more prowess than myself to any lord
 let him contend with me in tourney who
 would have me or assay me with the sword
 me as his wife let him that wins me wear
 let him that loses me with other pair"

 lxxi
 with cheerful face the emperor made reply
 the entreaty was well worthy of the maid
 and that with tranquil mind she might rely
 he would accord the boon for which she prayed
 this audience was not given so secretly
 but that the news to others were conveyed
 which on that very day withal were told
 in the ears of beatrice and aymon old

 lxxii
 who against bradamant with fury flame
 and both alike with sudden anger fraught
 for plainly they perceive that in her claim
 she for rogero more than leo wrought
 and active to prevent the damsel's aim
 from being to a safe conclusion brought
 privily take her from king charles's court
 and thence to rocca forte's tower transport

 lxxiii
 a castle this which royal charlemagne
 had given to aymon some few days before
 built between carcasson and perpignan
 on a commanding point upon the shore
 resolved to send her eastward there the twain
 as in a prison kept her evermore
 willing or nilling so must she forsake
 rogero and for lord must leo take

 lxxiv
 the martial maid of no less modest vein
 than bold and full of fire before the foe
 albeit no guard on her the castellain
 hath set and she is free to come or go
 observant of her sire obeys the rein
 yet prison death and every pain and woe
 to suffer is resolved that constant maid
 before by her rogero be betrayed

 lxxv
 rinaldo who thus ravished from his hand
 by ancient aymon's craft his sister spied
 and saw he could no more in wedlock's band
 dispose of her by him in vain affied
 of his old sire complains and him doth brand
 laying his filial love and fear aside
 but little him rinaldo's words molest
 who by the maid will do as likes him best

 lxxvi
 rogero bearing this and sore afraid
 that he shall lose his bride and leo take
 if left alive by force or love the maid
 resolved within himself but nothing spake
 constantine's heir should perish by his blade
 and of augustus him a god would make
 he save his hope deceived him and was vain
 would sire and son deprive of life and reign

 lxxvii
 his limbs in arms which trojan hector's were
 and afterwards the tartar king's he steeled
 bade rein frontino and his wonted wear
 exchanged crest surcoat and emblazoned shield
 on that emprize it pleased him not to bear
 his argent eagle on its azure field
 white as a lily was a unicorn
 by him upon a field of crimson worn

 lxxviii
 he chose from his attendant squires the best
 and willed none else should him accompany
 and gave him charge that ne'er by him exprest
 rogero's name in any place should be
 crost meuse and rhine and pricked upon his quest
 through the austrian countries into hungary
 along the right bank of the danube made
 and rode anend until he reached belgrade

 lxxix
 where save into dark danube makes descent
 and to the sea increased by him doth flow
 he saw the imperial ensigns spread and tent
 and white pavilion thronged with troops below
 for constantine to have that town was bent
 anew late won by the bulgarian foe
 in person with his son is constantine
 with all the empire's force his host to line

 lxxx
 within belgrade and through the neighbouring peak
 even to its bottom which the waters lave
 the bulgar fronts him and both armies seek
 a wateringplace in the intermediate save
 a bridge across that rapid stream the greek
 would fling the bulgar would defend the wave
 when thither came rogero and engaged
 beheld the hosts in fight which hotly raged

 lxxxi
 the greeks in that affray were four to one
 and with pontoons to bridge the stream supplied
 and a bold semblance through their host put on
 of crossing to the river's further side
 leo meanwhile was from the river gone
 with covert guile he took a circuit wide
 then thither made return his bridges placed
 from bank to bank and past the stream in haste

 lxxxii
 with many horse and foot in battle dight
 who nothing under twenty thousand rank
 along the river rode the grecian knight
 and fiercely charged his enemies in flank
 the emperor when his son appeared in sight
 leading his squadrons on the farther bank
 uniting bridge and bark together crost
 upon his part the stream with all his host

 lxxxiii
 king vatran chief of the bulgarian band
 wise bold withal a warrior here and there
 laboured in vain such onset to withstand
 and the disorder of his host repair
 when leo prest him sore and with strong hand
 the king to earth beneath his courser bare
 whom at the prince's hest for all to fierce
 is he to yield a thousand faulchions pierce

 lxxxiv
 the bulgar host hath hitherto made head
 but when they see their sovereign is laid low
 and everywhere that tempest wax and spread
 they turn their backs where erst they faced the foe
 the child who mid the greeks from whom they fled
 was borne along beheld that overthrow
 and bowned himself their battle to restore
 as hating constantine and leo more

 lxxxv
 he spurs frontino that in his career
 is like the wind and passes every steed
 he overtakes the troop that in their fear
 fly to the mountain and desert the mead
 many he stops and turns then rests his spear
 and as he puts his courser to his speed
 so fearful is his look even mars and jove
 are frighted in their azure realms above

 lxxxvi
 advanced before the others he descried
 a cavalier in crimson vest whereon
 with all its stalk in silk and gold was spied
 a pod like millet in embroidery done
 constantine's nephew by the sister's side
 he was but was no less beloved than son
 he split like glass his shield and scaly rind
 and the long lance appeared a palm behind

 lxxxvii
 he left the dead and drew his shining blade
 upon a squadron whom he saw most nigh
 and now at once and now at other made
 cleft bodies and made hearts from shoulders fly
 at throat at breast and flank the warrior laid
 smote hand and arm and shoulder bust and thigh
 and through that champaign ran the reeking blood
 as to the valley foams the mountainflood

 lxxxviii
 none that behold those strokes maintain their place
 so are they all bewildered by their fear
 thus suddenly the battle changed its face
 for catching courage from the cavalier
 the bulgar squadrons rally turn and chase
 the grecian troops that fled from them whilere
 lost was all order in a thought and they
 with all their banners fled in disarray

 lxxxix
 leo augustus on a swelling height
 seeing his followers fly hath taken post
 where woeful and bewildered for to sight
 nothing in all the country round is lost
 he from his lofty station eyes the knight
 who with his single arm destroys that host
 and cannot choose though so his prowess harms
 but praise that peer and own his worth in arms

 xc
 he knew full well by ensignry displaid
 by surcoat and by gilded panoply
 that albeit to the foe he furnished aid
 that champion was not of his chivalry
 wondering his superhuman deeds surveyed
 and now an angel seemed in him to see
 to scourge the greeks from quires above descended
 whose sins so oft and oft had heaven offended

 xci
 and as a man of great and noble heart
 where many others would have hatred sworn
 enamoured of such valour on his part
 would not desire to see him suffer scorn
 for one that died six grecians' death less smart
 would cause that prince and better had he borne
 to lose as well a portion of his reign
 than to behold so good a warrior slain

 xcii
 as baby albeit its fond mother beat
 and drive it forth in anger in its fear
 neither to sire nor sister makes retreat
 but to her arms returns with fondling cheer
 so leo though rogero in his heat
 slaughters his routed van and threats his rear
 cannot that champion hate because above
 his anger is the admiring prince's love

 xciii
 but if young leo loved him and admired
 meseems that he an ill exchange hath made
 for him rogero loathed nor aught desired
 more than to lay him lifeless with his blade
 him with his eyes he sought for him inquired
 but leo's fortune his desire gainsayed
 which with the prudence of the practised greek
 made him in vain his hated rival seek

 xciv
 leo for fear his bands be wholly spent
 bids sound the assembly his greek squadrons through
 he to his father a quick courier sent
 to pray that he would pass the stream anew
 who if the way was open well content
 might with his bargain he and with a few
 whom he collects the grecian cavalier
 recrost the bridge by which he past whilere

 xcv
 into the power o' the bulgars many fall
 stalin from the hilltop to the riverside
 and they into their hands had fallen all
 but for the river's intervening tide
 from the bridge many drop and drown withal
 and many that ne'er turned their heads aside
 thence to a distant ford for safety made
 and many were dragged prisoners to belgrade

 xcvi
 when done was that day's fight wherein since borne
 to ground the bulgar king his life did yield
 his squadrons would have suffered scathe and scorn
 had not for them the warrior won the field
 the warrior that the snowy unicorn
 wore for his blazon on a crimson shield
 to him all flock in him with joy and glee
 the winner of that glorious battle see

 xcvii
 some bow and some salute him of the rest
 some kist the warrior's feet and some his hand
 round him as closely as they could they prest
 and happy those are deemed that nearest stand
 more those that touch him for to touch a blest
 and supernatural thing believes the band
 on him with shouts that rent the heavens they cried
 to be their king their captain and their guide

 xcviii
 as king or captain them will he command
 as liked them best he said but will not lay
 on sceptre or on leadingstaff his hand
 nor yet belgrade will enter on that day
 for first ere farther flies young leo's band
 and they across the river make their way
 him will he follow nor forego until
 that grecian leader he o'ertake and kill

 xcix
 a thousand miles and more for this alone
 he thither measured and for nought beside
 he saith and from the multitude is gone
 and by a road that's shown to him doth ride
 for towards the bridge is royal leo flown
 haply lest him from this the foe divide
 behind him pricks rogero with such fire
 the warrior calls not nor awaits his squire

 c
 such vantage leo has in flight to flee
 he rather may be said than to retreat
 the passage open hath he found and free
 and then destroys the bridge and burns his fleet
 rogero arrived not till beneath the sea
 the sun was hid nor lodging found his beat
 he still pursued and now shone forth the moon
 but town or village found the warrior none

 ci
 because he wots not where to lodge he goes
 all night nor from his load frontino frees
 when the new sun his early radiance shows
 a city to the left rogero sees
 and there all day determines to repose
 as where he may his wearied courser ease
 whom he so far that livelong night had pressed
 nor had he drawn his bit nor given him rest

 cii
 ungiardo had that city in his guard
 constantine's liegeman and to him right dear
 who since upon the bulgars he had warred
 much horse and foot had sent that emperor here
 now entered for the entrance was not barred
 rogero and found such hospitable cheer
 he to fare further had no need in trace
 of better or of more abundant place

 ciii
 in the same hostelry with him a guest
 was lodged that evening a romanian knight
 present what time the child with lance in rest
 succoured the bulgars in that cruel fight
 who hardly had escaped his hand sore prest
 and scared as never yet was living wight
 so that he trembled still disturbed in mind
 and deemed the knight of the unicorn behind

 civ
 he by the buckler knew as soon as spied
 the cavalier whose arms that blazon bear
 for him that routed the byzantine side
 by hand of whom so many slaughtered were
 he hurried to the palace and applied
 for audience weighty tidings to declare
 and to ungiardo led forthwith rehearsed
 what shall by men in other strain be versed


 canto 45

 argument
 young leo doth from death rogero free
 for him rogero bradamant hath won
 making that maid appear less strong to be
 disguised in fight like leo and that done
 straight in despite would slay himself so he
 by sorrow so by anguish is foredone
 to hinder leo of his destined wife
 marphisa works and kindles mighty strife


 i
 by how much higher we see poor mortal go
 on fortune's wheel which runs a restless round
 we so much sooner see his head below
 his heels and he is prostrate on the ground
 the lydian syracusan samian show
 this truth and more whose names i shall not sound
 all into deepest dolour in one day
 hurled headlong from the height of sovereign sway

 ii
 by how much more deprest on the other side
 by how much more the wretch is downwards hurled
 he so much sooner mounts where he shall ride
 if the revolving wheel again be twirled
 some on the murderous block have wellnigh died
 that on the following day have ruled the world
 ventidius servius marius this have shown
 in ancient days king lewis in our own

 iii
 king lewis stepfather of my duke's son
 who when his host at santalbino fled
 left in his clutch by whom that field was won
 was nigh remaining shorter by the head
 nor long before the great corvinus run
 a yet more fearful peril worse bested
 both throned when overblown was their mischance
 one king of hungary one king of france

 iv
 'tis plain to sight through instances that fill
 the page of ancient and of modern story
 that ill succeeds to good and good to ill
 that glory ends in shame and shame in glory
 and that man should not trust deluded still
 in riches realm or field of battle gory
 with hostile blood nor yet despair for spurns
 of fortune since her wheel for ever turns

 v
 through that fair victory when overthrown
 were leo and his royal sire the knight
 who won that battle to such trust is grown
 in his good fortune and his peerless might
 he without following without aid alone
 so is he prompted by his daring sprite
 thinks mid a thousand squadrons in array
  footmen and horsemen  sire and son to slay

 vi
 but she that wills no trust shall e'er be placed
 in her by man to him doth shortly show
 how wight by her is raised and how abased
 how soon she is a friend how soon a foe
 she makes him know rogero that in haste
 is gone to work that warrior shame and woe
 the cavalier which in that battle dread
 with much ado had from his faulchion fled

 vii
 he to ungiardo hastens to declare
 the child who put the imperial host to flight
 whose carnage many years will not repair
 here past the day and was to pass the night
 and saith that fortune taken by the hair
 without more trouble and without more fight
 will if he prisons him the bulgars bring
 beneath the yoke and lordship of his king

 viii
 ungiardo from the crowd which had pursued
 thither their flight from the ensanguined plain
 for troop by troop a countless multitude
 arrived because not all the bridge could gain
 knew what a cruel slaughter had ensued
 for there the moiety of the greeks was slain
 and knew that by a cavalier alone
 one host was saved and one was overthrown

 ix
 and that undriven he should have made his way
 into the net and of his own accord
 wondered and showed his pleasure at the say
 in visage gesture and in joyful word
 he waited till rogero sleeping lay
 then softly sent his guard to take that lord
 and made the valiant child who had no dread
 of such a danger prisoner in his bed

 x
 by his own shield accused that witness true
 the child is captive in novogorood
 to ungiardo worst among the cruel who
 marvellous mirth to have that prisoner shewed
 and what since he was naked could he do
 bound while his eyes were yet by slumber glued
 a courier who the news should quickly bear
 ungiardo bids to constantine repair

 xi
 constantine on that night with all his host
 raising his camp from save's green shore had gone
 with this in beleticche he takes post
 androphilus' his sister's husband's town
 father of him whose arms in their first joust
 as if of wax had been his habergeon
 had pierced and carved the puissant cavalier
 now by ungiardo pent in dungeon drear

 xii
 here from attack the emperor makes assure
 the city walls and gates on every side
 lest from the bulgar squadrons ill secure
 having so good a warrior for their guide
 his broken grecians worse than fear endure
 deeming the rest would by his hand have died
 now he is taken these breed no alarms
 nor would he fear the banded world in arms

 xiii
 the emperor swimming in a summer sea
 knows not for very pleasure what to do
 "truly the bulgars may be said to be
 vanquished" he cries with bold and cheerful brow
 as he would feel assured of victory
 that had of either arm deprived his foe
 so the emperor was assured and so rejoiced
 when good rogero's fate the warrior voiced

 xiv
 no less occasion has the emperor's son
 for joying for besides that he anew
 trusts to acquire belgrade and tower and town
 throughout the bulgars' country to subdue
 he would by favours make the knight his own
 and hopes to rank him in his warlike crew
 nor need he envy guarded by his blade
 king charles' orlando's or rinaldo's aid

 xv
 theodora was by other thoughts possest
 whose son was killed by young rogero's spear
 which through his shoulders entering at his breast
 issued a palm's breadth in the stripling's rear
 constantine's sister she by grief opprest
 fell down before him and with many a tear
 that dropt into her bosom while she sued
 his heart with pity softened and subdued

 xvi
 "i still before these feet will bow my knee
 save on this felon good my lord" she cried
 "who killed my son to venge me thou agree
 now that we have him in our hold beside
 that he thy nephew was thou seest how thee
 he loved thou seest what feats upon thy side
 that warrior wrought thou seest if thou wilt blot
 thine own good name if thou avenge him not

 xvii
 "thou seest how righteous heaven by pity stirred
 from the wide champaign red with grecian gore
 bears that fell man and like a reckless bird
 into the fowler's net hath made him soar
 that for short season for revenge deferred
 my son may mourn upon the stygian shore
 give me my lord i pray this cruel foe
 that by his torment i may soothe my woe"

 xviii
 so well she mourns and in such moving wise
 and efficacious doth she make lament
 nor from before the emperor will arise
 though he three times and four the dame has hent
 and to uplift by word and action tries
 that he is forced her wishes to content
 and thus according to her prayer commands
 the child to be delivered to her hands

 xix
 and not therein his orders to delay
 they take the warrior of the unicorn
 to cruel theodora but one day
 of respite has the knight to have him torn
 in quarters yet alive to rend and slay
 her prisoners publicly with shame and scorn
 seems a poor pain and he must undergo
 other unwonted and unmeasured woe

 xx
 at the commandment of that woman dread
 chains on his neck and hands and feet they don
 and put him in a dungeoncell where thread
 of light was never by apollo thrown
 he has a scanty mess of mouldy bread
 and sometimes is he left two days with none
 and one that doth the place of jailer fill
 is prompter than herself to work him ill

 xxi
 oh if duke aymon's daughter brave and fair
 of if marphisa of exalted mind
 had heard rogero's sad estate declare
 and how he in this guise in prison pined
 to his rescue either would have made repair
 and would have flung the fear of death behind
 nor had bold bradamant intent to aid
 respect to beatrice or aymon paid

 xxii
 meanwhile king charlemagne upon his side
 heeding his promise made in solemn sort
 that none should have the damsel for his bride
 that of her prowess in the field fell short
 not only had his sovereign pleasure cried
 with sound of trumpet in his royal court
 but in each city subject to his crown
 hence quickly through the world the bruit was blown

 xxiii
 such the condition which he bids proclaim
 he that would with duke aymon's daughter wed
 must with the sword contend against that dame
 from the suns rise until he seeks his bed
 and if he for that time maintains the game
 and is not overcome without more said
 the lady is adjudged to have lost the stake
 nor him for husband can refuse to take

 xxiv
 the choice of arms must be by her foregone
 no matter who may claim it in the course
 and by the damsel this may well be done
 good at all arms alike on foot or horse
 aymon who cannot strive against the crown
  cannot and will not  yields at length parforce
 he much the matter sifts and in the end
 resolves to court with bradamant to wend

 xxv
 though for the daughter choler and disdain
 the mother nursed yet that she honour due
 might have she garments dyed in different grain
 had wrought for her of various form and hue
 bradamant for the court of charlemagne
 departs and finding not her love to her view
 his noble court appears like that no more
 which had appeared to her so fair before

 xxvi
 as he that hath beheld a garden bright
 with flowers and leaves in april or in may
 and next beholds it when the sun his light
 hath sloped toward the north and shortened day
 finds it a desert horrid to the sight
 so now that her rogero is away
 to bradamant who thither made resort
 no longer what it was appeared that court

 xxvii
 what is become of him she doth not dare
 demand lest more suspicion thence be bred
 but listens still and searches here and there
 that this by some unquestioned may be said
 knows he is gone but has no notion where
 the warrior when he went his steps had sped
 because departing thence he spake no word
 save to the squire who journeyed with his lord

 xxviii
 oh how she sighs how fears the gentle maid
 hearing rogero as it were was flown
 oh how above all other terrors weighed
 the fear that to forget her he was gone
 that seeing aymon still his wish gainsayed
 and that to wed the damsel hope was none
 he fled perchance so hoping to be loosed
 from toils wherein he by her love was noosed

 xxix
 and that with further end the youthful lord
 her from his heart more speedily to chase
 will rove from realm to realm till one afford
 some dame that may his former love efface
 even as the proverb says that in a board
 one nail drives out another from its place
 a second thought succeeds and paints the youth
 arraigned of fickleness as full of truth

 xxx
 and her reproves for having lent an ear
 to a suspicion so unjust and blind
 and so this thought absolves the cavalier
 and that accuses and both audience find
 and now this way now that she seemed to veer
 nor this nor that  irresolute of mind 
 preferred yet still to what gave most delight
 most promptly leaned and loathed its opposite

 xxxi
 and thinking ever and anon anew
 on that so oft repeated by the knight
 as for grave sin remorse and sorrow grew
 that she had nursed suspicion and affright
 and she as her rogero were in view
 would blame herself and would her bosom smite
 and say "i see 'twas ill such thoughts to nurse
 but he the cause is even cause of worse

 xxxii
 "love is the cause that in my heart inlaid
 thy form so graceful and so fair to see
 and so thy darling and thy wit pourtrayed
 and worth of all so bruited that to me
 it seems impossible that wife or maid
 blest with thy sight should not be fired by thee
 and that she should not all her art apply
 to unbind and fasten thee with other tie

 xxxiii
 "ah wellaway if in my thought love so
 thy thought as thy fair visage had designed
 this  am i well assured  in open show
 as i unseen believe it should i find
 and be so quit of jealousy that foe
 would not still harass my suspicious mind
 and where she is by me repulsed with pain
 not quelled and routed would she be but slain

 xxxiv
 "i am like miser so intent on gear
 and who hath this so buried in his heart
 that he for hoarded treasure still in fear
 cannot live gladly from his wealth apart
 since i rogero neither see nor hear
 more puissant far than hope o fear thou art
 to thee though false and idle i give way
 and cannot choose but yield myself thy prey

 xxxv
 "but i rogero shall no sooner spy
 the light of thy glad countenance appear
 against mine every credence from mine eye
 concealed and woe is me i know not where 
 oh how true hope false fear shall from on high
 depose withal and to the bottom bear
 ah turn to me rogero turn again
 and comfort hope whom fear hath almost slain

 xxxvi
 "as when the sun withdraws his glittering head
 the shadows lengthen causing vain affright
 and as the shadows when he leaves his bed
 vanish and reassure the timid wight
 without rogero so i suffer dread
 dread lasts not if rogero is in sight
 return to me return rogero lest
 my hope by fear should wholly be opprest

 xxxvii
 "as every spark is in the night alive
 and suddenly extinguished when 'tis morn
 when me my sun doth of his rays deprive
 against me felon fear uplifts his horn
 but they the shades of night no sooner drive
 than fears are past and gone and hopes return
 return alas return o radiance dear
 and drive from me that foul consuming fear

 xxxviii
 "if the sun turn from us and shorten day
 earth all its beauties from the sight doth hide
 the wild winds howl and snows and ice convey
 bird sings not nor is leaf or flower espied
 so whensoever thou thy gladsome ray
 o my fair sun from me dost turn aside
 a thousand and all evil dreads make drear
 winter within me many times a year

 xxxix
 "return my sun return and springtide sweet
 which evermore i long to see bring back
 dislodge the snows and ice with genial hear
 and clear my mind so clouded o'er and black"
 as philomel or progne with the meat
 returning which her famished younglings lack
 mourns o'er an empty nest or as the dove
 laments himself at having lost is love

 xl
 the unhappy bradamant laments her so
 fearing the child is reft from her and gone
 while often tears her visage overflow
 but she as best she can conceals her moan
 oh how  oh how much worse would be her woe
 if what she knew not to the maid were known
 that prisoned and with pain and pine consumed
 her consort to a cruel death was doomed

 xli
 the cruelty which by that beldam ill
 was practised on the prisoned cavalier
 and who prepared the wretched child to kill
 by torture new and pains unused whilere
 while so rogero pined the gracious will
 of heaven conveyed to gentle leo's ear
 and put into his heart the means to aid
 and not to let such worth be overlaid

 xlii
 the courteous leo that rogero loved
 not that the grecian knew howe'er that he
 rogero was but by that valour moved
 which sole and superhuman seemed to be
 thought much and mused and planned how it behoved
  and found at last a way  to set him free
 so that his cruel aunt should have no right
 to grieve or say he did her a despite

 xliii
 in secret leo with the man that bore
 the prisonkeys a parley had and said
 he wished to see that cavalier before
 upon the wretch was done a doom so dread
 when it was night one faithful found of yore
 bold strong and good in brawl he thither led
 and  by the silent warder taught that none
 must know 'twas leo  was the door undone

 xliv
 leo escorted by none else beside
 was led by the compliant castellain
 with his companion to the tower where stied
 was he reserved for nature's latest pain
 there round the neck of their unwary guide
 who turns his back the wicket to unchain
 a slipknot leo and his follower cast
 and throttled by the noose he breathes his last

 xlv
  the trap upraised by rope from thence suspended
 for such a need  the grecian cavalier
 with lighted flambeau in his hand descended
 where straitly bound and without sun to cheer
 rogero lay upon a grate extended
 less than a palm's breadth of the water clear
 to kill him in a month or briefer space
 nothing was needed but that deadly place

 xlvi
 lovingly leo clipt the child and "me
 o cavalier thy matchless valour" cried
 "hath in indissoluble bands to thee
 in willing and eternal service tried
 and wills thy good to mine preferred should be
 and i for thine my safety set aside
 and weigh thy friendship more than sire and all
 whom i throughout the world my kindred call

 xlvii
 "i leo am that thou what fits mayst know
 come to thy succour the greek emperor's son
 if ever constantine my father trow
 that i have aided thee i danger run
 to be exiled or aye with troubled brow
 regarded for the deed that i have done
 for thee he hates because of those thy blade
 put to the rout and slaughtered near belgrade"

 xlviii
 he his discourse with more beside pursues
 that might from death to life the child recall
 and all this while rogero's hands doth loose
 "infinite thanks i owe you" cries the thrall
 "and i the life you gave me for your use
 will ever render back upon your call
 and still at all your need i for your sake
 and at all times that life will promptly stake"

 xlix
 rogero is rescued and the gaoler slain
 is left in that dark dungeon in his place
 nor is rogero known nor are the twain
 leo the warrior free from bondage base
 brings home and there in safety to remain
 persuades in secret four or six days' space
 meanwhile for him will he retrieve the gear
 and courser by ungiardo reft whilere

 l
 open the gaol is found at dawn of light
 the gaoler strangled and rogero gone
 some think that these or those had helped his flight
 all talk and yet the truth is guessed by none
 well may they think by any other wight
 rather than leo had the deed been done
 for many deemed he had cause to have repaid
 the child with scathe and none to give him aid

 li
 so wildered by such kindness so immersed
 in wonder is the rescued cavalier
 so from those thoughts is he estranged that erst
 so many weary miles had made him steer
 his second thoughts confronting with his first
 nor these like those nor those like these appear
 he first with hatred rage and venom burned
 with pity and with love then wholly yearned

 lii
 much muses he by night and much by day
  nor cares for ought nor ought desires beside 
 by equal or more courtesy to pay
 the mighty debt that him to leo tied
 be his life long or short or what it may
 albeit to leo's service all applied
 dies he a thousand deaths he can do nought
 but more will be deserved rogero thought

 liii
 thither meanwhile had tidings been conveyed
 of charles' decree that who in nuptial tye
 would yoke with bradamant with trenchant blade
 or lance must with the maid his prowess try
 these news the grecian prince so ill appaid
 his cheek was seen to blanch with sickly dye
 because as one that measured well his might
 he knew he was no match for her in fight

 liv
 communing with himself he can supply
 he sees the valour wanting with his wit
 and the strange knight with his own ensignry
 whose name is yet unknown to him will fit
 him he against frank champion far and nigh
 believes he may for force and daring pit
 and if the knight to that emprize agree
 vanquished and taken bradamant will be

 lv
 but two things must he do must first dispose
 that cavalier to undertake the emprize
 then send afield the champion whom he chose
 in mode that none suspect the youth's disguise
 to him the matter leo doth disclose
 and after prays in efficacious wise
 that he the combat with the maid will claim
 under false colours and in other's name

 lvi
 much weighs the grecian's eloquence but more
 than eloquence with good rogero weighed
 the mighty obligation which he bore
 that debt which cannot ever be repaid
 so albeit it appeared a hardship sore
 and thing wellnigh impossible he said
 with blither face than heart that leo's will
 in all that he commands he would fulfil

 lvii
 albeit no sooner he the intent exprest
 than with sore grief rogero's heart was shent
 which night and day and ever doth molest
 ever afflict him evermore torment
 and though he sees his death is manifest
 never will he confess he doth repent
 rather than not with leo's prayer comply
 a thousand deaths not one the child will die

 lviii
 right sure he is to die if he forego
 the lady he foregoes his life no less
 his heart will break through his distress and woe
 or breaking not with woe and with distress
 he will himself the bands of life undo
 and of its clay the spirit dispossess
 for all things can he better bear than one
 than see that gentle damsel not his own

 lix
 to die is he disposed but how to die
 cannot as yet the sorrowing lord decide
 sometimes he thinks his prowess to belie
 and offer to her sword his naked side
 for never death can come more happily
 than if her hand the fatal faulchion guide
 then sees except he wins the martial maid
 for that greek prince the debt remains unpaid

 lx
 for he with bradamant as with a foe
 promised to do not feign a fight in mail
 and not to make of arms a seeming show
 so that his sword should leo ill avail
 then by his word will he abide and though
 his breast now these now other thoughts assail
 all from his bosom chased the generous youth
 save that which moved him to maintain his truth

 lxi
 with the emperor's licence armour to prepare
 and steeds meanwhile had wrought his youthful son
 who with such goodly following as might square
 with his degree upon his way was gone
 with him rogero rides through leo's care
 equipt with horse and arms that were his own
 day after day the squadron pricks nor tarries
 until arrived in france arrived at paris

 lxii
 leo will enter not the town but nigh
 pitches his broad pavilions on the plain
 and his arrival by an embassy
 makes known that day to royal charlemagne
 well pleased is he and visits testify
 and many gifts the monarch's courteous vein
 his journey's cause the grecian prince displayed
 and to dispatch his suit the sovereign prayed

 lxiii
 to send afield the damsel who denied
 ever to take in wedlock any lord
 weaker than her for she should be his bride
 or he would perish by the lady's sword
 charles undertook for this and on her side
 the following day upon the listed sward
 before the walls in haste enclosed that night
 appeared the martial maid equipt for fight

 lxiv
 rogero past the night before the day
 wherein by him the battle should be done
 like that which felon spends condemning to pay
 life's forfeit with the next succeeding sun
 he made his choice to combat in the fray
 all armed because he would discovery shun
 nor barded steed he backed nor lance he shook
 nor other weapon than his faulchion took

 lxv
 no lance he took yet was it not through fear
 of that which argalia whilom swayed
 astolpho's next then hers that in career
 her foemen ever upon earth had laid
 because none weened such force was in the spear
 nor that it was by necromancy made
 excepting royal galaphron alone
 who had it forged and gave it to his son

 lxvi
 nay bold astolpho and the lady who
 afterwards bore it deemed that not to spell
 but simply to their proper force was due
 the praise that they in knightly joust excel
 and with whatever spear they fought those two
 believed that they should have performed as well
 what only makes that knight the joust forego
 is that he would not his frontino show

 lxvii
 for easily that steed of generous kind
 she might have known if him she had espied
 whom in montalban long to her consigned
 the gentle damsel had been wont to ride
 rogero that but schemes but hath in mind
 how he from brandamant himself shall hide
 neither frontino nor yet other thing
 whereby he may be known afield will bring

 lxviii
 with a new sword will he the maid await
 for well he knew against the enchanted blade
 as soft as paste would prove all mail and plate
 for never any steel its fury stayed
 and heavily with hammer to rebate
 its edge as well he on this faulchion layed
 so armed rogero in the lists appeared
 when the first dawn of day the horizon cheered

 lxix
 to look like leo o'er his breast is spread
 the surcoat that the prince is wont to wear
 and the gold eagle with its double head
 he blazoned on the crimson shield doth bear
 and what the child's disguisement well may stead
 of equal size and stature are the pair
 in the other's form presents himself the one
 that other lets himself be seen of none

 lxx
 dordona's martial maid is of a vein
 right different from the gentle youth's who sore
 hammers and blunts the faulchion's tempered grain
 lest it his opposite should cleave or bore
 she whets her steel and into it would fain
 enter that stripling to the quick to gore
 yea would such fury to her strokes impart
 that each should go directly to his heart

 lxxi
 as on the start the generous barb in spied
 when he the signal full of fire attends
 and paws now here now there and opens wide
 his nostrils and his pointed ears extends
 so the bold damsel to the lists defied
 who knows not with rogero she contends
 seemed to have fire within her veins nor found
 restingplace waiting for the trumpet's sound

 lxxii
 as sometimes after thunder sudden wind
 turns the sea upside down and far and nigh
 dim clouds of dust the cheerful daylight blind
 raised in a thought from earth and whirled heavenhigh
 scud beasts and herd together with the hind
 and into hail and rain dissolves the sky
 so she upon the signal bared her brand
 and fell on her rogero sword in hand

 lxxiii
 but wellbuilt wall strong tower or aged oak
 no more are moved by blasts that round them rave
 no more by furious sea is moved the rock
 smote day and night by the tempestuous wave
 than in those arms secure from hostile stroke
 which erst to trojan hector vulcan gave
 moved was he by that ire and hatred rank
 which stormed about his head and breast and flank

 lxxiv
 now aims that martial maid a trenchant blow
 and now gives point and wholly is intent
 'twixt plate and plate to reach her hated foe
 so that her stifled fury she may vent
 now on this side now that now high now low
 she strikes and circles him on mischief bent
 and evermore she rages and repines
 as balked of every purpose she designs

 lxxv
 as he that layeth siege to wellwalled town
 and flanked about with solid bulwarks still
 renews the assault now fain would batter down
 gateway or tower now gaping fosse would fill
 yet vainly toils for entrance is there none
 and wastes his host aye frustrate of his will
 so sorely toils and strives without avail
 the damsel nor can open plate or mail

 lxxvi
 sparks now his shield now helm now cuirass scatter
 while straight and back strokes aimed now low now high
 which good rogero's head and bosom batter
 and arms by thousands and by thousands fly
 faster than on the sounding farmroof patter
 hailstones descending from a troubled sky
 rogero at his ward with dexterous care
 defends himself and ne'er offends the fair

 lxxvii
 now stopt now circled now retired the knight
 and oft his hand his foot accompanied
 and lifted shield and shifted sword in fight
 where shifting he the hostile hand espied
 either he smote her not or  die he smite 
 smote where he deemed least evil would betide
 the lady ere the westering sun descend
 desires to bring that duel to an end

 lxxviii
 of the edict she remembered her and knew
 her peril save the foe was quickly sped
 for if she took not in one day nor slew
 her claimant she was taken and his head
 phoebus was now about to hide from view
 nigh hercules' pillars in his watery bed
 when first she 'gan misdoubt her power to cope
 with the strong foe and to abandon hope

 lxxix
 by how much more hope fails the damsel so
 much more her anger waxes she her blows
 redoubling yet the harness of her foe
 will break which through that day unbroken shows
 as he that at his daily drudgery slow
 sees night on his unfinished labour close
 hurries and toils and moils without avail
 till wearied strength and light together fail

 lxxx
 didst thou o miserable damsel trow
 whom thou wouldst kill if in that cavalier
 matched against thee thou didst rogero know
 on whom depend thy very lifethreads ere
 thou killed him thou wouldst kill thyself for thou
 i know dost hold him than thyself more dear
 and when he for rogero shall be known
 i know these very strokes thou wilt bemoan

 lxxxi
 king charles and peers him sheathed in plate and shell
 deem not rogero but the emperor's son
 and viewing in that combat fierce and fell
 such force and quickness by the stripling shown
 and without e'er offending her how well
 that knight defends himself now change their tone
 esteem both well assorted and declare
 the champions worthy of each other are

 lxxxii
 when phoebus wholly under water goes
 charlemagne bids the warring pair divide
 and bradamant nor boots it to oppose
 allots to youthful leo as a bride
 not there rogero tarried to repose
 nor loosed his armour nor his helm untied
 on a small hackney hurrying sore he went
 where leo him awaited in his tent

 lxxxiii
 twice in fraternal guise and oftener threw
 leo his arms about the cavalier
 and next his helmet from his head withdrew
 and kiss'd him on both cheeks with loving cheer
 "i would" he cried "that thou wouldst ever do
 by me what pleaseth thee for thou wilt ne'er
 weary my love at any call i lend
 to thee myself and state these friendly spend

 lxxxiv
 "nor see i recompense which can repay
 the mighty obligation that i owe
 though of the garland i should disarray
 my brows and upon thee that gift bestow"
 rogero on whom his sorrows press and prey
 who loathes his life immersed in that deep woe
 little replies the ensigns he had worn
 returns and takes again his unicorn

 lxxxv
 and showing himself spiritless and spent
 from thence as quickly as he could withdrew
 and from young leo's to his lodgings went
 when it was midnight armed himself anew
 saddled his horse and sallied from his tent
 he takes no leave and none his going view
 and his frontino to that road addrest
 which seemed to please the goodly courser best

 lxxxvi
 now by straight way and now by crooked wound
 frontino now by wood and wide champaign
 and all night with his rider paced that round
 who never ceased a moment to complain
 he called on death and therein comfort found
 since broke by him alone is stubborn pain
 nor saw save death what other power could close
 the account of his insufferable woes

 lxxxvii
 "whereof should i complain" he said "wo is me
 so of my every good at once forlorn
 ah if i will not bear this injury
 without revenge against whom shall i turn
 for i besides myself none other see
 that hath inflicted on me scathe and scorn
 then i to take revenge for all the harm
 done to myself against myself must arm

 lxxxviii
 "yet was but to myself this injury done
 myself to spare because this touched but me
 i haply could yet hardly could be won
 nay i will say outright i could not be
 less can i be since not to me alone
 but bradamant is done this injury
 even if i could consent myself to spare
 it fits me not unvenged to leave that fair

 lxxxix
 "then i the damsel will avenge and die
 nor this disturbs me whatsoe'er betide
 for bating death i know not aught whereby
 defence against my grief can be supplied
 but i lament myself alone that i
 before offending her should not have died
 o happier fortune had i breathed my last
 in theodora's dungeon prisoned fast

 xc
 "though she had slain had tortured me before
 she slew as prompted by her cruelty
 at least the hope would have remained in store
 that i by bradamant should pitied be
 but when she knows that i loved leo more
 than her that of my own accord and free
 myself of her i for his good deprive
 dead will she rightly hate me or alive"

 xci
 these words he said and many more with sigh
 and heavy sob withal accompanied
 and when another sun illumed the sky
 mid strange and gloomy woods himself espied
 and for he desperate was and bent to die
 and he as best he could his death would hide
 this place to him seemed far removed from view
 and fitted for the deed that he would do

 xcii
 he entered into that dark woodland where
 he thickest trees and most entangled spied
 but first frontino was the warrior's care
 whom he unharnessed wholly and untied
 "o my frontino if thy merits rare
 i could reward thou little cause" he cried
 "shouldst have to envy him so highly graced
 who soared to heaven and mid the stars was placed

 xciii
 "nor cillarus nor arion was whilere
 worthier than thee nor merited more praise
 nor any other steed whose name we hear
 sounded in grecian or in latin lays
 was any such in other points thy peer
 none of them well i know the vaunt can raise
 that such high honour and such courtesy
 were upon him bestowed as were on thee

 xciv
 "since to the gentlest maid of fairest dye
 and boldest that hath been or evermore
 will be thou wast so dear she used to tie
 thy trappings and to thee thy forage bore
 dear wast thou to my ladylove ah why
 call i her mine since she is mine no more
 if i have given her to another lord
 why turn i not upon myself this sword"

 xcv
 if him these thoughts so harass and torment
 that bird and beast are softened by his cries
 for saving these none hears the sad lament
 nor sees the flood that trickles form his eyes
 you are not to believe that more content
 the lady bradamant in paris lies
 who can no longer her delay excuse
 nor leo for her wedded lord refuse

 xcvi
 ere she herself to any consort tie
 beside her own rogero she will fain
 do what so can be done her word belie
 anger friends kindred court and charlemagne
 and if she nothing else can do will die
 by poison or her own good faulchion slain
 for not to live appears far lesser woe
 than living her rogero to forego

 xcvii
 "rogero mine ah wonder gone" she cried
 "art thou and canst thou so far distant be
 thou heardest not this royal edict cried
 a thing concealed from none expecting thee
 faster than thee would none have hither hied
 i wot hadst thou known this ah wretched me
 how can i e'er in future think of aught
 saving the worst that can by me be thought

 xcviii
 "how can it be rogero thou alone
 hast read not what by all the world is read
 if thou hast read it not nor hither flown
 how canst thou but a prisoner be or dead
 but well i wot that if the truth were known
 this leo will for thee some snare have spread
 the traitor will have barred thy way intent
 thou shouldst not him by better speed prevent

 xcix
 "from charles i gained the promise that to none
 less puissant than myself should i be given
 in the reliance thou wouldst be that one
 with whom i should in arms have vainly striven
 none i esteemed excepting thee alone
 but well my rashness is rebuked by heaven
 since i by one am taken in this wise
 unfamed through life for any fair emprize

 c
 "if i am held as taken since the knight
 i had not force to take nor yet to slay
 a thing that is not in my judgment right
 nor i to charles's sentence will give way
 i know that i shall be esteemed as light
 if what i lately said i now unsay
 but of those many ladies that have past
 for light i am not i the first or last

 ci
 "enough i to my lover faith maintain
 and firmer than a rock am still found true
 and far herein surpass the female train
 that were in olden days or are in new
 nor if they me as fickle shall arraign
 care i so good from fickleness ensue
 though i am lighter than a leaf be said
 so i be forced not with that greek no wed"

 cii
 these things and more beside the damsel bright
 'twixt which oft sobs and tears were interposed
 ceased not to utter through the livelong night
 which upon that unhappy day had closed
 but when within cimmeria's caverned height
 nocturnus with his troops of shades reposed
 heaven which eternally had willed the maid
 should be rogero's consort brought him aid

 ciii
 this moves the haught marphisa when 'tis morn
 to appear before the king to whom that maid
 saith to the child her brother mighty scorn
 was done nor should he be so ill appaid
 that from him should his plighted wife be torn
 and nought thereof unto the warrior said
 and on whoever lists she will in strife
 prove bradamant to be rogero's wife

 civ
 and this before all others will prove true
 on her if to deny it she will dare
 for she had to rogero in her view
 spoken those words which they that marry swear
 and with all ceremony wont and due
 so was the contract sealed between the pair
 they were no longer free nor could forsake
 the one the other other spouse to take

 cv
 whether marphisa true or falsely spake
 i well believe that rather with intent
 young leo's purpose right or wrong to break
 than tell the truth she speaks and with consent
 of bradamant doth that avowal make
 for to exclude the hated leo bent
 and of rogero to be repossest
 this she believes her shortest way and best

 cvi
 sorely by this disturbed king charlemagne
 bade bradamant be called and to her told
 that which the proud marphisa would maintain
 and aymon present in the press behold
  bradamant drops her head nor treats as vain
 nor vouches what avows that virgin bold
 in such confusion they may well believe
 that fierce marphisa speaks not to deceive

 cvii
 joy good orlando and joy rinaldo show
 who view in valorous marphisa's plea
 a cause the alliance shall no further go
 which sealed already leo deemed to be
 and yet in spite of stubborn aymon's no
 bradamant shall rogero's consort be
 and they may without strife without despite
 done to duke aymon's give her to the knight

 cviii
 for if such words have pass'd between the twain
 fast is the knot and cannot be untied
 they what they vowed more fairly will obtain
 and without further strife are these affied
 "this is a plot a plot devised in vain
 and ye deceive yourselves duke aymon cried
 for were the story true which ye have feigned
 believe not therefore that your cause is gained

 cix
 "for granting what i will not yet allow
 and what i to believe as yet demur
 that weakly to rogero so her vow
 was plighted as rogero's was to her
 where was the contract made and when and how
 more clearly this to me must ye aver
 either it was not so i am advised
 or was before rogero was baptized

 cx
 "but if it were before the youthful knight
 a christian was i will not heed it i
 for 'twixt a faithful and a paynim wight
 i deem that nought avails the marriagetie
 for this not vainly in the doubtful fight
 should constantine's fair son have risked to die
 nor charlemagne for this our sovereign lord
 will forfeit i believe his plighted word

 cxi
 "what now you say you should before have said
 while yet the matter was unbroke and ere
 charles at my daughter's prayer that edict made
 which has drawn leo to the combat here"
 orlando and rinaldo were gainsayed
 so before royal charles by clermont's peer
 and equal charlemagne heard either side
 but neither would for this nor that decide

 cxii
 as in the southern or the northern breeze
 the greenwood murmurs and as on the shore
 when aeolus with the god that rules the seas
 is wroth the hoarse and hollow breakers roar
 so a loud rumour of this strife that flees
 through france and spreads and circles evermore
 affords such matter to rehearse and hear
 that nought beside is bruised far or near

 cxiii
 these with rogero those with leo side
 but the most numerous are rogero's friends
 who against aymon ten to one divide
 good charlemagne to neither party bends
 but wills that cause shall be by justice tried
 and to his parliament the matter sends
 marphisa now the bridal was deferred
 appeared anew and other question stirred

 cxiv
 and said "in that anther cannot have
 bradamant while my brother is alive
 let leo if the gentle maid he crave
 his foe in listed fight of life deprive
 and he that sends the other to his grave
 freed from his rival with the lady wive"
 forthwith this challenge as erewhile the rest
 to leo was declared at charles' behest

 cxv
 leo who if he had the cavalier
 of the unicorn believed he from his foe
 was safe and thought no peril would appear
 too hard a feat for him and knew not how
 thence into solitary woods and drear
 that warrior had been hurried by his woe
 him gone for little time and for disport
 believed and took his line in evil sort

 cxvi
 this shortly leo was condemned to rue
 for he on whom too fondly he relied
 nor on that day nor on the following two
 appeared nor news of him were signified
 and combat with rogero was he knew
 unsafe unless that knight was on his side
 so sent to eschew the threatened scathe and scorn
 to seek the warrior of the unicorn

 cxvii
 through city and through hamlet and through town
 he sends to seek rogero far and near
 and not content with this himself is gone
 in person on his steed to find the peer
 but of the missing warrior tidings none
 nor he nor any of the court would hear
 but for melissa i for other verse
 reserve myself her doings to rehearse


 canto 46

 argument
 after long search for good rogero made
 him leon finds and yields to him his prize
 informed of all  already with that maid
 he wives already in her bosom lies
 when thither he that sarza's sceptre swayed
 to infect such bliss with impious venom hies
 but falls in combat and blaspheming loud
 to acheron descends his spirit proud


 i
 i if my chart deceives me not shall now
 in little time behold the neighbouring shore
 so hope withal to pay my promised vow
 to one so long my guide through that wide roar
 of waters where i feared with troubled brow
 to scathe my bark or wander evermore
 but now methinks  yea now i see the land
 i see the friendly port its arms expand

 ii
 a burst of joy like thunder to my ear
 rumbles along the sea and rends the sky
 i chiming bells i shrilling trumpets hear
 confounded with the people's cheerful cry
 and now their forms that swarm on either pier
 of the thickcrowded harbour i descry
 all seem rejoiced my task is smoothly done
 and i so long a course have safely run

 iii
 what beauteous dames and sage here welcome me
 with them what cavaliers the shore adorn
 what friends to whom i owe eternity
 of thanks for their delight at my return
 mamma ginevra with the rest i see
 correggio's seed on the harbour's furthest horn
 veronica de gambara is here
 to phoebus and the aonian choir so dear

 iv
 with julia a new ginevra is in sight
 another offset from the selfsame tree
 hippolita sforza and trivultia bright
 bred in the sacred cavern i with thee

 blanche and diana with their sister train

 v
 beauteous but wiser and more chaste than fair
 i barbara turca linked with laura know
 nor beams the sun upon a better pair
 'twixt ind and where the moorish waters flow
 behold ginevra that rich gem and rare
 which gilds the house of malatesta so
 that never worthier or more honoured thing
 adorned the dome of keysar or of king

 vi
 if she had dwelt in rimini of yore
 what time from conquered gaul returning home
 julius stood fearing on the rivershore
 to ford the stream and make a foe of rome
 he every banner would have bowed before
 that dame discharged his trophies and such doom
 such pact would have received as liked her best
 and haply ne'er had freedom been opprest

 vii
 the consort of my lord of bozzolo
 behold the mother sisters cousinhood
 them of torello bentivoglio
 pallavigini's and visconti's brood
 lo she to whom all living dames forego
 the palm and all of grecian latin blood
 or barbarous all that ever were whose name
 for grace and beauty most is noised by fame

 viii
 julia gonzaga she that wheresoe'er
 she moves where'er she turns her lucid eyes
 not only is in charms without a peer
 but seems a goddess lighted from the skies
 with her is paired her brother's wife who ne'er
 swerved from her plighted faith  aye good and wise 
 because ill fortune bore her long despite
 lo arragonian anna vasto's light

 ix
 anne gentle courteous and as sage as fair
 temple of love and truth and chastity
 with her her sister dims all beauty where
 her radiance shines lo one that hath set free
 her conquering lord from orcus' dark repair
 and him in spite of death and destiny
 beyond all modern instance raised on high
 to shine with endless glory in the sky

 x
 my ladies of ferrara those of gay
 urbino's court are here and i descry
 mantua's dames and all that fair array
 which lombardy and tuscan town supply
 the cavalier amid that band whom they
 so honour unless dazzled is mine eye
 by those fair faces is the shining light
 of his arezzo and accolti hight

 xi
 adorned with scarlet hat and scarlet pall
 his nephew benedict lo there i see
 with him campeggio and mantua's cardinal
 glory and light of the consistory
 and if i dote not mark how one and all
 in face and gesture show such mighty glee
 at my return no easy task 'twould seem
 so vast an obligation to redeem

 xii
 with them lactantius is claude ptolemy

 my boat near land shows pleasure and surprise

 xviii

 be blown from calpe's rock to furthest ind

 xix
 joys victor fausto tancred joys to view
 my sail and with them joy a hundred more
 women and men i see a mingled crew
 at my return rejoicing crowd the shore
 then since the wind blows fair nor much to do
 remains let me my course delay no more
 and turning to melissa in what way
 she rescued good rogero let me say

 xx
 much bent was this melissa as i know
 i many times have said to you whilere
 that bradamant in wedlock should bestow
 her hand upon the youthful cavalier
 and so at heart had either's weal and woe
 that she from hour to hour of them would hear
 hence ever on that quest she spirits sent
 one still returning as the other went

 xxi
 a prey to deep and stubborn grief reclined
 mid gloomy shades rogero they descried
 firm not to swallow food of any kind
 nor from that purpose to be turned aside
 and so to die of hunger he designed
 but weird melissa speedy aid supplied
 who took a road from home forth issuing where
 she met the grecian emperor's youthful heir

 xxii
 leo that one by one dispatched his train
 of followers far and wide through every bourn
 and afterwards in person went in vain
 to find the warrior of the unicorn
 the wise enchantress that will sell and rein
 had on that day equipt a demon borne
 by him in likeness of a hackney horse
 constantine's son encountered in her course

 xxiii
 "if such as your ingenuous mien" she cried
 to leo "is your soul's nobility
 and corresponding with your fair outside
 your inward goodness and your courtesy
 some help some comfort sir for one provide
 in whom the best of living knights we see
 who save ye help and comfort quickly lend
 is little distant from his latter end

 xxiv
 "the best of knights will die of all who don
 or e'er donned sword and buckler the most fair
 and gentle of all warriors that are gone
 or who throughout the world yet living are
 and simply for a courteous deed if none
 shall comfort to the youthful sufferer bear
 then come sir for the love of heaven and try
 if any counsel succour may supply"

 xxv
 it suddenly came into leo's mind
 the knight of whom she parlayed was that same
 whom throughout all the land he sought to find
 and seeking whom he now in person came
 so that obeying her that would persuade
 such pious work he spurred behind the dame
 who thither led nor tedious was the way
 where nigh reduced to death the stripling lay

 xxvi
 they found rogero fasting from all food
 for three long days so broken down with pain
 the knight could but upon his feet have stood
 to fall albeit unpushed to ground again
 with helm on head and with his faulchion good
 begirt he lay reclined in plate and chain
 a pillow of his buckler had he made
 where the white unicorn was seen pourtraid

 xxvii
 there thinking what an injury he had done
 to his lady love  how ingrate how untrue
 to her had been  not simple grief alone
 o'erwhelmed him to such height his fury grew
 he bit his hands and lips while pouring down
 his cheeks the tears unceasing ran and through
 the passion that so wrapt his troubled sprite
 nor leo nor melissa heard the knight

 xxviii
 nor therefore interrupts he his lament
 nor checks his sighs nor checks his trickling tears
 young leo halts to hear his speech intent
 lights from his courser and towards him steers
 he knows that of the sorrows which torment
 love is the cause but yet from nought appears
 who is the person that such grief hath bred
 for by rogero this remains unsaid

 xxix
 approaching nearer and yet nearer now
 he fronts the weeping warrior face to face
 greets with a brother's love and stooping low
 his neck encircles with a fast embrace
 by the lamenting child i know not how
 is liked his sudden presence in that place
 who fears annoy or trouble at his hand
 and lest he should his wish for death withstand

 xxx
 him with the sweetest words young leo plied
 and with the warmest love that he could show
 "let it not irk thee" to the child he cried
 "to tell the cause from whence thy sorrows flow
 for few such desperate evils man betide
 but that there is deliverance from his woe
 so that the cause be known nor he bereft
 of hope should ever be so life be left

 xxxi
 "much grieve i thou wouldst hide thyself from me
 that known me for thy faithful friend and true
 not only now i am so bound to thee
 that i the knot can never more undo
 but even from the beginning when to be
 thy deadly foeman i had reason due
 hope then that i will succour thee with pelf
 with friends with following and with life itself

 xxxii
 "nor shun to me thy sorrow to explain
 and i beseech thee leave to me to try
 if wealth avail to free thee from thy pain
 art cunning open force or flattery
 if my assistance is employed in vain
 the last relief remains to thee to die
 but be content awhile this deed to shun
 till all that thou canst do shall first be done"

 xxxiii
 he said and with such forceful prayer appealed
 so gently and benignly soothed his moan
 that good rogero could not choose but yield
 whose heart was not of iron or of stone
 who deemed unless he now his lips unsealed
 he should a foul discourteous deed have done
 he fain would have replied but made assay
 yet twice or thrice ere words could find their way

 xxxiv
 "my lord when known for what i am and me
 now shalt thou know" he made at last reply
 "i wot thou like myself content wilt be
 and haply more content that i should die
 know me for him so hated once by thee
 rogero who repaid that hate am i
 and now 'tis many days since with intent
 of putting thee to death from court i went

 xxxv
 "because i would not see my promised bride
 borne off by thee in that duke aymon's love
 and favour was engaged upon thy side
 but for man purposes and god above
 disposes thy great courtesy well tried
 in a sore need my fixt resolve did move
 nor only i renounced the hate i bore
 but purposed to be thine for evermore

 xxxvi
 "what time i as rogero was unknown
 thou madest suit i would obtain for thee
 the lady bradamant which was all one
 as to demand my heart and soul from me
 whether thy wish i rather than mine own
 sought to content thou hast been made to see
 thine is the lady her in peace possess
 far more than mine i prize thy happiness

 xxxvii
 "content thee that deprived of her as well
 i should myself of worthless life deprive
 for better i without a soul could dwell
 than without bradamant remain alive
 and never while these veins with lifeblood swell
 canst thou with her legitimately wive
 for vows erewhile have been between us said
 nor she at once can with two husbands wed"

 xxxviii
 so filled is gentle leo with amaze
 when he the stranger for rogero knows
 with lips and brow unmoved with stedfast gaze
 and rooted feet he like a statue shows
 like statue more than man which votaries raise
 in churches for acquittance of their vows
 he deems that courtesy of so high a strain
 was never done nor will be done again

 xxxix
 and that he him doth for rogero know
 not only that goodwill he bore whilere
 abates not but augments his kindness so
 that no less grieves the grecian cavalier
 than good rogero for rogero's woe
 for this as well as that he will appear
 deservedly an emperor's son  although
 in other things outdone  he will not be
 defeated in the race of courtesy

 xl
 and says "that day my host was overthrown
 rogero by thy wond'rous valour though
 i had thee at despite if i had known
 thou was rogero as i know it now
 so me thy virtue would have made thine own
 as then it made me knowing not my foe
 so hatred from my bosom would have chased
 and with my present love have straight replaced

 xli
 "that i rogero hated ere i knew
 thou was rogero will i not deny
 but think not that i further would pursue
 the hatred that i bore thee and had i
 when thee i from thy darksome dungeon drew
 descried the truth as this i now descry
 such treatment shouldst thou then have had as thou
 shalt have from me to thine advantage now

 xlii
 "and if i willingly had done so then
 when not as i am now obliged to thee
 how much more gladly should i now and when
 not doing so i should with reason be
 deemed most ungrateful amid ingrate men
 since thou foregoest thine every good for me
 but i to thee restore thy gift and more
 glady than i received it this restore

 xliii
 "the damsel more to thee than me is due
 and though for her deserts i hold her dear
 if that fair prize some happier mortal drew
 i think not i my vital thread should shear
 nor would i by thy death be free to woo
 that from the hallowed bands of wedlock clear
 wherein the lady hath to thee been tied
 i might possess her as my lawful bride

 xliv
 "not only bradamant would i forego
 but whatsoe'er i in the world possess
 and rather forfeit life than ever know
 that grief through me should such a knight oppress
 to me is thy distrust great cause of woe
 that since thou couldst dispose of me no less
 than of thyself thou  rather than apply
 to me for succour  wouldst of sorrow die"

 xlv
 these words he spake and more to that intent
 too tedious in these verses to recite
 refuting evermore such argument
 as might be used in answer by the knight
 who said at last "i yield and am content
 to live but how can i ever requite
 the obligation which by me is owed
 to thee that twice hast life on me bestowed"

 xlvi
 melissa generous wine and goodly cheer
 thither bade carry in a thought obeyed
 and comforted the mourning cavalier
 who would have sunk without her friendly aid
 meanwhile the sound of steeds frontino's ear
 had reached and thither had he quickly made
 him leo's squires at his commandment caught
 and saddled and to good rogero brought

 xlvii
 who though by leo helped with much ado
 and labour sore the gentle courser scaled
 so wasted was the vigour which some few
 short days before in fighting field availed
 to overthrow a banded host and do
 the deeds he did in cheating armour mailed
 departing thence ere they had measured more
 than half a league they reached an abbey hoar

 xlviii
 wherein what of that day was yet unworn
 they past the morrow and succeeding day
 until the warrior of the unicorn
 his vigour had recruited by the stay
 he leo and melissa then return
 to charles's royal residence where lay
 an embassy arrived the eve before
 which from the bulgars' land a message bore

 xlix
 since they that had for king proclaimed the knight
 besought rogero thither to repair
 through these their envoys deeming they would light
 on him in charles's court where they should swear
 fidelity and yield to him his right
 and he from them the crown receive and wear
 rogero's squire who served this band to steer
 has published tidings of the cavalier

 l
 he of the fight has told which at belgrade
 erewhile rogero for the bulgars won
 how leo and his sire were overlaid
 and all their army slaughtered and undone
 wherefore the bulgars him their king had made
 their royal line excluding from the throne
 then how ungiardo took the warrior brave
 and him to cruel theodora gave

 li
 he speaks with that of certain news which say
 how good rogero's jailer was found dead
 the prison broke and prisoner away
 of what became of him was nothing said
  towards the city by a secret way
 nor was his visage seen rogero sped
 he on the following morning and his friend
 leo to charles's court together wend

 lii
 to charles' court he wends the bird he bore
 of gold with its two heads  of crimson hue
 its field  and that same vest and ensigns wore
 as was erewhile devised between the two
 and such as in the listed fight before
 his bruised and battered armour was in shew
 so that they quickly knew the cavalier
 from him that strove with bradamant whilere

 liii
 in royal ornaments and costly gown
 unarmed beside him doth young leo fare
 a worthy following and of high renown
 before behind him and about him are
 he bowed to charlemagne who from his throne
 had risen to do honour to the pair
 then holding still rogero by the hand
 so spake while all that warrior closely scanned

 liv
 "behold the champion good that did maintain
 from dawn till fall of day the furious fight
 and since by bradamant nor taken slain
 nor forced beyond the barriers was the knight
 he is assured his victory is plain
 dread sir if he your edict reads aright
 and he hath won the lady for his wife
 so comes to claim the guerdon of the strife

 lv
 "besides that by your edict's tenor none
 but him can to the damsel lift his eyes
  is she deserved by deeds of valour done
 what other is so worthy of the prize
  should she by him that loves her best be won
 none passes him nor with the warrior vies
 and he is here to fight against all foes
 that would in arms his right in her oppose"

 lvi
 king charlemagne and all his peerage stand
 amazed who well believed the grecian peer
 with bradamant had striven with lifted brand
 in fight and not that unknown cavalier
 marphisa thither borne amid the band
 that crowded round the royal chair to hear
 hardly till leo made an ending staid
 then prest before the listening troop and said

 lvii
 "since here rogero is not to contest
 the bride's possession with the stranger knight
 lest he as undefended be opprest
 and forfeit so without dispute his right
 on his behalf i undertake this quest
  his sister i  against whatever wight
 shall here assert a claim to bradamant
 or more desert than good rogero vaunt"

 lviii
 she spake this with such anger and disdain
 many surmised amid the assistant crew
 that without waiting leave from charlemagne
 what she had threatened she forthwith would do
 no longer leo deemed it time to feign
 and from rogero's head the helm withdrew
 and to marphisa "for himself to speak
 behold him here and ready" cried the greek

 lix
 as looked old aegeus at the accursed board
 seeing it was his son to whom  so willed
 his wicked consort  that athenian lord
 had given the juice from deadly drugs distilled
 whom he if he had recognized his sword
 though but a little later would have killed
 so looked marphisa when disclosed to view
 she in the stranger knight rogero knew

 lx
 and ran forthwith to clip the cavalier
 nor could unclasp her arms with loving show
 charlemagne roland and rinaldo here
 and there fix friendly kisses on his brow
 nor him sir dudon nor sir olivier
 nor king sobrino can caress enow
 nor paladin nor peer amid the crew
 wearies of welcoming that warrior true

 lxi
 leo who well can play the spokesman now
 that warlike band hath ceased to clip the knight
 tells before charles and all that audience how
 rogero's daring how rogero's might
  albeit to his good squadron's scathe and woe 
 which at belgrade he witnessed in that fight
 so moved him that they overweighed all harms
 inflicted on him by the warrior's arms

 lxii
 so that to her rogero being brought
 who would all havoc of the youth have made
 he setting all his family at nought
 had out of durance vile the knight conveyed
 and how rogero that the rescue wrought
 by leo might be worthily repaid
 did that high courtesy which can by none
 that ever were or e'er will be outdone

 lxiii
 and he from point to point continuing said
 that which rogero had for him achieved
 and after how by sorrow sore bested
 in that to leave his cherished wife he grieved
 he had resolved to die and almost dead
 was only by his timely aid relieved
 and this he told so movingly no eye
 remained amid those martial many dry

 lxiv
 so efficaciously he after prayed
 to the obstinate duke aymon not alone
 the stubborn sire of bradamant he swayed
 and to forego his settled purpose won
 but that proud lord in person did persuade
 to beg rogero's pardon and his son
 and soninlaw to be beseech the knight
 and thus to him his bradamant was plight

 lxv
 to her where of her feeble life in doubt
 she in a secret chamber made lament
 through many a messenger with joyful shout
 and mickle haste the happy tidings went
 hence the warm blood that stagnated about
 her heart by her first sorrow thither sent
 ebbed at this notice in so full a tide
 well nigh for sudden joy the damsel died

 lxvi
 of all her vigour is she so foregone
 she cannot on her feeble feet rely
 yet what her force must needs to you be known
 and what the damsel's magnanimity
 none doomed to prison wheel or halter none
 condemned some other evil death to die
 about whose brows the sable band is tied
 rejoices more to hear his pardon cried

 lxvii
 joys clermont's joys mongrana's noble house
 those kindred branches that fresh know to view
 with equal grief count anselm overflows
 gan falcon gini and ginami's crew
 yet they meanwhile beneath contented brows
 conceal the dark and envious thoughts they brew
 as the fox waits the motions of the hare
 they wait their time for vengeance and forbear

 lxviii
 besides that oftentimes before the rage
 of roland and rinaldo on them fell
 though they were calmed by charles's counsel sage
 and common danger from the infidel
 they had new cause for grief in bertolage
 slain by their foemen and sir pinnabel
 but they concealed their hatred and endured
 those griefs as of the matter ill assured

 lxix
 those envoys of the bulgars that had made
 for charles's court as hath erewhile been shown
 hoping to find the knight whose shield pourtrayed
 the unicorn elected to their throne
 bless the good fortune which their hope repayed
 seeing that valiant warrior and fall down
 before his feet and him in humble speech
 again to seek their bulgary beseech

 lxx
 where kept for him in adrianople are
 the sceptre and the crown his royal due
 but let him succour to his kingdom bear
 for  to their further scathe  advices shew
 constantine doth a mighty host prepare
 and thitherward in person moves anew
 and they  of their elected king possest 
 hope the greek empire from his hands to wrest

 lxxi
 he accepts the realm by their entreaties won
 and to afford them aid against their foes
 will went to bulgary when three months are done
 save fortune otherwise of him dispose
 when this is heard by that greek emperor's son
 he bids rogero on his faith repose
 for since by him the bulgar's realm is swayed
 peace between them and constantine is made

 lxxii
 nor needeth he depart in haste to guide
 his bulgar bands against the grecian foe
 for all that he had conquered far and wide
 he will persuade his father to forego
 none of the virtues in rogero spied
 moved bradamant's ambitious mother so
 or so to endear her soninlaw availed
 as hearing now that son a sovereign hailed

 lxxiii
 the rich and royal nuptials they prepare
 as well befits him by whose care 'tis done
 'tis done by charles and with such cost and care
 as if 'twere for a daughter of his own
 for such the merits of the damsel are
 and such had all her martial kindred shown
 charles would not think he should exceed due measure
 if spent for her was half his kingdom's treasure

 lxxiv
 he a free court bids cry whither his way
 securely every one that wills may wend
 and offers open lists till the ninth day
 to whosoever would in arms contend
 and bids build bowers afield and interlay
 green boughs therein and flowers and foliage blend
 and make those bowers so gay with silk and gold
 no fairer place this ample world doth hold

 lxxv
 guested within fair paris cannot be
 the countless foreign bands that thither fare
 who rich and poor of high and low degree
 and greeks and latins and barbarians are
 there is no end of lord and embassy
 that thither from all ends of earth repair
 all lodged conveniently to their content
 beneath pavilion booth and bower and tent

 lxxvi
 the weird melissa against the coming night
 with singular and matchless ornament
 had for that pair the nuptial chamber dight
 whereon long time before she had been bent
 long time before desirous of the rite
 had been that dame presageful of the event
 presageful of futurity she knew
 what goodly fruit should from their stems ensue

 lxxvii
 she had prepared the genial fruitful bed
 under a broad pavilion one more rich
 adorned and jocund never overhead
 did this for peace or war its master pitch
 was in the world before or after spread
 and this from thracian strand had borne the witch
 the costly prize from constantine she bore
 who for disport was tented on that shore

 lxxviii
 she with young leo's leave or rather so
 the grecian's admiration to obtain
 and a rare token of that art to show
 which on hell's mighty dragon puts the rein
 and at her pleasure rules that impious foe
 of heaven together with his evil train
 bade demons the pavilion through mid air
 to paris from constantinople bear

 lxxix
 from constantine that lay therein who swayed
 the grecian empire's sceptre at midday
 this with its cordage shaft whereby 'twas stayed
 and all within and out she bore away
 and of the costly tent through air conveyed
 for young rogero made a lodging gay
 the bridal ended this her demon crew
 thither from whence 'twas brought conveyed anew

 lxxx
 two thousand tedious years were nigh complete
 since this fair work was fashioned by the lore
 of trojan maid warmed with prophetic heat
 who 'mid long labour and 'mid vigil sore
 with her own fingers all the storied sheet
 of the pavilion had embroidered o'er
 cassandra hight that maid to hector brave
 her brother he this costly present gave

 lxxxi
 the curtiest cavalier the kindliest shoot
 that ever from her brother's stock should grow
 albeit she knew far distant from its root
 with many a branch between should be that bough
 in silk and gold upon the gorgeous suit
 of hangings had she wrought in goodly show
 much prized that gift while living priam's son
 for its rare work and her by whom 'twas done

 lxxxii
 but when by treachery perished priam's heir
 and greeks the trojans scathed in cruel sort
 when her gates opened by false sinon were
 and direr ill was done than tales report
 this plunder fell to menelaus' share
 wherewith to egypt's land he made resort
 there left it to king proteus egypt's lord
 in ransom for his prisoned wife restored

 lxxxiii
 she helen hight her menelaus to free
 to proteus the pavilion gave away
 which passing through the line of ptolemy
 to cleopatra fell from her in fray
 agrippa's band on the leucadian sea
 bore off the treasure amid other prey
 augustus and tiberius heired the loom
 kept till the time of constantine in rome

 lxxxiv
 that constantine whom thou shall ever rue
 fair italy while the heavens above are rolled
 constantine to byzantium when he grew
 weary of tyber bore the tent of old
 melissa from his namesake this withdrew
 its pole of ivory and its cord of gold
 and all its cloth with beauteous figures fraught
 fairer apelles' pencil never wrought

 lxxxv
 here the three graces in gay vesture gowned
 assisted the delivery of a queen
 not in four ages in this earthly round
 was ever born a boy so fair of mien
 jove venus mars and mercury renowned
 for fluent speech about the child are seen
 him have they strewed and stew with heaven's perfume
 ambrosial odours and aetherial bloom

 lxxxvi
 hippolytus a little label said
 inscribed upon the baby's swaddling clothes
 by the hand him fortune leads in age more staid
 and valour as a guide before him goes
 an unknown band in sweeping vest arraid
 with long descending locks the tapestry shows
 deputed by corvinus to desire
 the tender infant from his princely sire

 lxxxvii
 he reverently parts from hercules' side
 from her his lady mother eleanor
 and to the danube wends where far and wide
 they meet the boy and as a god adore
 the prudent king of hungary is descried
 who does due honour to his ripened lore
 in yet unripe yea raw and tender years
 and ranks the stripling above all his peers

 lxxxviii
 one is there that in his green age and new
 places strigonia's crozier in his hand
 him ever at corvinus' side we view
 whether he doth in court or camp command
 whether against the turk or german crew
 the puissant monarch leads his martial band
 watchful hippolytus is at his side
 and gathers virtue from his generous guide

 lxxxix
 there is it seen how he his blooming age
 divides mid arts and wholesome discipline
 the secret spirit of the ancient page
 there fuscus well instructs him to divine
 "this must thou shun that follow"  seems the sage
 to say  "if thou immortally wouldst shine"
 fashioned withal with so much skill and care
 by her who wrought that work their gestures were

 xc
 a cardinal he next is seen though young
 in years at council in the vatican
 where for deep wisdom graced by eloquent tongue
 with wonder him the assembled conclave scan
 "what will he be"  they seem to say among
 themselves  "when he is ripened into man
 oh if on him st peter's mantle fall
 what a blest aera what a happy call"

 xci
 that brave youth's liberal pastimes are designed
 in other place on alpine mountain hoar
 here he affronts the bear of rugged kind
 and there in rushy bottom bays the boar
 now on his jennet he outgoes the wind
 and drives some goat or gallant hind before
 which falls o'ertaken on the dusty plain
 by his descending faulchion cleft in twain

 xcii
 he is descried amid a fair array
 of poets and philosophers elsewhere
 this pricks for him the wandering planets' way
 these earth these heaven for his instruction square
 some chant sad elegies some verses gay
 lays lyric or heroic singers there
 he with rich music hears nor moves a pace
 but what in every step is sovereign grace

 xciii
 the first part of the storied walls pourtraied
 that noble prince's gentle infancy
 cassandra all beside had overlaid
 with fears of justice prudence modesty
 valour and that fifty virtue which hath made
 with those fair sisters closest amity
 i speak of her that gives and that bestows
 with all these virtues gilt the stripling glows

 xciv
 in this part is the princely youth espied
 with that unhappy duke the insubri's head
 in peace they sit in council at his side
 together armed the serpentbanner spread
 the youth by one unchanging faith is tied
 to him for ever well or ill bested
 his followers still in flight before the foe
 his guide in peril his support in woe

 xcv
 him in another quarter you descry
 for his ferrara and her duke in fear
 who by strange proofs doth sift and certify
 to his just brother vouched by tokens clear
 the close device of that ill treachery
 hatched by those kinsmen whom he held most dear
 hence justly he becomes that title's heir
 which rome yet free bade righteous tully bear

 xcvi
 elsewhere in martial panoply he shone
 hasting to help the church with lifted blade
 with scanty and tumultuous levy gone
 against wellordered host in arms arraid
 and lo the coming of that chief alone
 affords the priestly band such present aid
 extinguished are the fires before they spread
 he came he saw he conquered may be said

 xcvii
 elsewhere he stands upon his native strand
 fighting against the mightiest armament
 that whensoever against argive land
 or turkish from venetian harbour went
 scatters and overthrows the hostile band
 and  spoil and prisoners to his brother sent 
 nothing reserves save that unfading bay
 the only prize he cannot give away

 xcviii
 upon those figures gazed the courtly crew
 but read no meaning in the storied wall
 because there was not any one to shew
 that these were things hereafter to befall
 those fair and quaintly fashioned forms they view
 with pleasure and peruse the scrolls withal
 but bradamant to whom the whole was known
 by wise melissa taught rejoiced alone

 xcix
 though not instructed in that history
 like gentle bradamant the affianced knight
 remembers how amid his progeny
 atlantes often praised this hippolyte
  who faithfully could verse such courtesy
 as charlemagne vouchsafed to every wight
 with various games that solemn feast was cheered
 and charged with viands aye the board appeared

 c
 who is a valiant knight is here descried
 for daily broke a thousand lances lay
 singly to combat or in troops they ride
 on horseback or afoot they mix in fray
 worthiest of all rogero is espied
 who always conquers jousting night and day
 and so in wrestling dance and every deed
 still from its rivals bears away the meed

 ci
 on the last day when at their festive cheer
 was seated solemnly the assembled band
 where at charles' left was placed the wedded peer
 and bradamant upon his better hand
 across the fields an armed cavalier
 of semblance haughty and of stature grand
 was seen to ride towards the royal table
 himself and courser wholly clothed in sable

 cii
 the king of argier he that for the scorn
 received from her when on the bridge he fell
 never to clothe himself in arms had sworn
 nor draw the faulchion nor bestride the sell
 till he had like an anchoret outworn
 a year and month and day in lowly cell
 so to chastise themselves for such like crimes
 were cavaliers accustomed in those times

 ciii
 albeit of charles and agramant the moor
 had heard the several fortunes while away
 not to foreswear himself he armed no more
 than if in nought concerned in that affray
 but when the year and month were wholly o'er
 and wholly past was the succeeding day
 with other courser harness sword and lance
 the king betook him to the court of france

 civ
 he neither lighted from his horse nor bowed
 his head and without sign of reverence due
 his scorn for charlemagne by gestures showed
 and the high presence of so fair a crew
 astound and full of wonder stood the crowd
 such license in that haughty man to view
 all leave their meat all leave their talk to hear
 the purpose of the stranger cavalier

 cv
 to charles and to rogero opposite
 with a loud voice and in proud accent "i
 am rodomont of sarza" said the knight
 "who thee rogero to the field defy
 and here before the sun withdraws his light
 will prove on thee thine infidelity
 and that thou as a traitor to thy lord
 deserv'st not any honour at this board

 cvi
 "albeit thy felony be plain and clear
 which thou as christened canst not disavow
 nathless to make it yet more plain appear
 this will i prove upon thee and if thou
 canst find a knight to combat for thee here
 him will accept  if one be not enow 
 will four nay six accept and will maintain
 my words against them all in listed plain"

 cvii
 rogero with the leave of pepin's son
 uprose at that appeal and thus replied
 that he  nor he alone  but every one
 who thus impeached him as a traitor lied
 that so he by his king had ever done
 him none could justly blame and on his side
 he was prepared in listed field to shew
 he evermore by him had done his due

 cviii
 he can defend himself nor need he crave
 another warrior's help that course to run
 and 'tis his hope to show him he would have
 enough perhaps would have too much of one
 thither orlando and rinaldo brave
 olivier and his white and sable son
 thither good dudon and marphisa wend
 who fain with that fierce paynim will contend

 cix
 they tell rogero that as newly wed
 the combat he in person should refuse
 "take ye no further pains" the warrior said
 "for such would be for me a foul excuse"
 the tartar's arms were brought which cut the thread
 of more delay and of all further truce
 with spurs orlando deck'd the youthful lord
 king charlemagne begirt him with the sword

 cx
 marphisa and bradamant in corslet case
 his breast and clothe him in his other gear
 astolpho led his horse of noble race
 sir dudon held his stirrup far and near
 rinaldo and namus made the mob give place
 assisted by the marquis olivier
 all from the crowded lists they drive with speed
 evermore kept in order for such need

 cxi
 the palefaced dames and damsels troop in guise
 of pigeons round the lists a timid show
 when homeward bound from fruitful field they rise
 scared by widesweeping winds which loudly blow
 mid flash and clap and when the sable skies
 threat hail and rain the harvest's waste and woe
 a timid troop they for rogero fear
 ill matched they deem with that fierce cavalier

 cxii
 so him deemed all the rabble and so most
 of those bold cavalier and barons thought
 in that they had not yet the memory lost
 of what that paynim had in paris wrought
 when singly fire and sword the warrior tost
 and much of that fair town to ruin brought
 whose signs remained and yet will long remain
 nor ever greater havoc plagued that reign

 cxiii
 bradamant's heart above those others' beat
 not that she deemed the saracen in might
 or valour which in the heartcore hath its seat
 was of more prowess than the youthful knight
 nor what oft gives success in martial feat
 that with the paynim was the better right
 yet cannot she her some ill misgivings quell
 but upon those that love such fear sits well

 cxiv
 oh in her fear for him how willingly
 she battle for rogero would have done
 if lifeless on the listed field to lie
 surer than sure  in fight with ulien's son
 more than one death would she consent to die
 if she withal could suffer more than one
 rather than she in that unhappy strife
 would see her cherished consort risk his life

 cxv
 but prayer availed not on the damsel's part
 to make rogero leave to her the quest
 she then with mournful face and beating heart
 stood by to view that pair to fight addrest
 from right and left the peer and paynim start
 and at each other run with lance in rest
 the spears seem ice as they in shivers fly
 the fragments birds that mount through middle sky

 cxvi
 rodomont's lance which smote in the career
 upon midshield yet harmed it little so
 perfect was famous hector's iron gear
 hardened by vulcan's hand and safe from blow
 as well against the shield his levelled spear
 rogero guides and that good buckler  though
 well steeled within and out with bone between
 and nigh a palm in thickness  pierces clean

 cxvii
 and  but his lance resists not that fierce shock
 and at the first assault its splinters fly
 and bits and fragments of the shivered stock
 seem fledged with feathers they ascend so high
 were his arms hewn from adamantine rock
 the spear would pierce the paynim's panoply
 and end that battle but it breaks withal
 and on their croups both staggering coursers fall

 cxviii
 with bridle and with spur the martial pair
 raise their proud horses nimbly from the ground
 and having broke their spears with faulchions bare
 return to bandy fierce and cruel wound
 wheeling with wondrous mastery here and there
 the bold and ready coursers in a round
 the warriors with their biting swords begin
 to try where either's armour is most thin

 cxix
 rodomont had not that hard dragonhide
 which heretofore had cased the warrior's breast
 nor nimrod's trenchant sword was at his side
 nor the accustomed helm his temples prest
 for on that bridge which spanned the narrow tide
 a loser to dordona's lady vest
 and arms suspended from the votive stone
 he left as i meseems erewhile have shown

 cxx
 clad was the king in other goodly mail
 yet not like that first panoply secure
 but neither this nor that nor harder scale
 could balisarda's deadly dint endure
 against which neither workmanship avail
 enchantment temper nor prime steel and pure
 so here so there rogero plied his sword
 he more than once the paynim's armour bored

 cxxi
 when rodomont beholds in that fierce close
 his widely crimsoned arms nor can restrain
 the greater portion of those griding blows
 from biting to the quick through plate and chain
 he with more fury with more rage o'erflows
 than in mid winter the tempestrous main
 flings down his shield and with both hands outright
 lays at rogero's helm with all his might

 cxxii
 with that excessive force wherewith the gin
 erected in two barges upon po
 and raised by men and wheels with deafening din
 descends upon the sharpened piles below
 with all his might he smote the paladin
 with either hand was never direr blow
 him the charmed helmet helped or  such its force 
 the stroke would have divided man and horse

 cxxiii
 as if about to fall the youthful lord
 twice nodded opening legs and arms anew
 rodomont smote in that he would afford
 his foe no time his spirits to renew
 then threatened other stroke but that fine sword
 bore not such hammering and in shivers flew
 and the bold saracen bereft of brand
 was in the combat left with unarmed hand

 cxxiv
 but not for this doth rodomont refrain
 he swoops upon the child unheeding aught
 so sore astounded is rogero's brain
 so wholly overclouded is his thought
 but him the paynim well awakes again
 whom by the neck he with strong arm has caught
 and gripes and grapples with such mighty force
 he falls on earth pulled headlong from his horse

 cxxv
 yet leaps from earth as nimbly moved by spleen
 far less than shame for on his gentle bride
 he turned his eyes and that fair face serene
 now troubled the disdainful warrior spied
 she in sore doubt her champion's fall had seen
 and well nigh at that sight the lady died
 rogero quickly to revenge the affront
 clutches his sword and faces rodomont

 cxxvi
 he at rogero rode who that rude shock
 shunned warily retiring from his ground
 and as he past the paynim's bridle took
 with his left had and turned his courser round
 while with his right he at his rider struck
 whom he in belly flank and breast would wound
 and twice sore anguish felt the monarch gored
 in flank and thigh by good rogero's sword

 cxxvii
 rodomont grasping still in that close fight
 the hilt and pommel of his broken blade
 layed at rogero's helmet with such might
 that him another stroke might have dismaid
 but good rogero who should win of right
 seizing his arm the king so rudely swayed
 bringing his left his better hand to speed
 that he pulled down the paynim from his steed

 cxxviii
 through force or skill so fell the moorish lord
 he stood his match i rather ought to say
 fell on his feet because rogero's sword
 gave him 'twas deemed advantage in the fray
 rogero stands aloof with wary ward
 as fain to keep the paynim king at bay
 for the wise champion will not let a wight
 so talk and bulky close with him in fight

 cxxix
 rogero flank and thigh dyed red beheld
 and other wounds and hoped he would have failed
 by little and by little as it welled
 so that he finally should have prevailed
 his hilt and pommel in his fist yet held
 the paynim which with all his might he scaled
 at young rogero whom he smote so sore
 the stripling never was so stunned before

 cxxx
 in the helmetcheek and shoulderbone below
 the child was smit and left so sore astound
 he tripping still and staggering to and fro
 scarce kept himself from falling to the ground
 rodomont fain would close upon his foe
 but his foot fails him weakened by the wound
 which pierced his thigh he overtasked his might
 and on his kneepan fell the paynim knight

 cxxxi
 rogero lost no time and with fierce blows
 smote him in face and bosom with his brand
 hammered and held the saracen so close
 to ground he bore that champion with his hand
 but he so stirred himself again he rose
 he gripes rogero so fast locked they stand
 seconding their huge vigour by address
 they circle one another shake and press

 cxxxii
 his wounded thigh and gaping flank had sore
 weakened the vigour of the moorish king
 rogero had address had mickle lore
 was greatly practised in the wrestlers' ring
 he marked his vantage nor from strife forbore
 and where he saw the blood most freely spring
 and where most wounded was the warrior prest
 the paynim with his feet his arms and breast

 cxxxiii
 rodomont filled with spite and rage his foe
 takes by the neck and shoulders and now bends
 towards him and now pushes from him now
 raises from earth and on his chest suspends
 whirls here and there and grapples and to throw
 the stripling sorely in that strife contends
 collected in himself rogero wrought
 to keep his vantage taxing strength and thought

 cxxxiv
 so shifting oft his hold about the moor
 his arms the good and bold rogero wound
 against his left flank shoved his breast and sore
 strained him with all his strength engirdled round
 at once he past his better leg before
 rodomont's knees and pushed and from the ground
 uplifted high in air the moorish lord
 then hurled him down head foremost on the sward

 cxxxv
 such was the shock wherewith king rodomont
 with battered head and spine the champion smote
 that issuing from his wounds as from a font
 streams of red blood the crimsoned herbage float
 rogero holding fortune by the front
 lest he should rise with one hand griped his throat
 with one a dagger at his eyes addrest
 and with his knees the paynim's belly prest

 cxxvi
 as sometimes where they work the golden vein
 within pannonian or iberian cave
 in unexpected ruin whelm the train
 by impious avarice there condemned to slave
 so with the load they lie opprest with pain
 a passage can their prisoned spirit have
 no less opprest the doughty paynim lay
 pinned to the ground in that disastrous fray

 cxxxvii
 rogero at his vizor doth present
 his naked poniard's point with threatening cry
 that he will slay him save he yields content
 to let him live if he for grace apply
 but rodomont who rather than be shent
 for the least deed of shame preferred to die
 writhed struggled and with all his vigour tried
 to pull rogero down and nought replied

 cxxxviii
 as mastiff that below the deerhound lies
 fixed by the gullet fast with holding bite
 sorely bestirs himself and vainly tries
 with lips besmeared with foam and eyes alight
 and cannot from beneath the conqueror rise
 who foils his foe by force and not despite
 so vainly strives the monarch of argier
 to rise from underneath the cavalier

 cxxxix
 yet rodomont so twists and strives he gains
 the freedom of his better arm anew
 and with the right hand which his poniard strains
 for he had drawn his deadly dagger too
 would wound rogero underneath the reins
 but now the wary youth the error knew
 through which he might have died by his delay
 that impious saracen forthwith to slay

 cxl
 and smiting twice or thrice his horrid front
 raising as high as he could raise in air
 his dagger buried it in rodomont
 and freed himself withal from further care
 loosed from the more than icy corse to font
 of fetid acheron and hell's foul repair
 the indignant spirit fled blaspheming loud
 erewhile on earth so haughty and so proud

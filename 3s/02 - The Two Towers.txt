 _chapter 1_
 departure boromir

 aragorn sped hill every bent ground hobbits go light footprints easy even ranger read far top spring crossed path wet earth saw seeking
 'i read signs aright' said 'frodo ran hilltop wonder saw returned way went hill again'
 aragorn hesitated desired go high seat hoping see something would guide perplexities time pressing suddenly leaped forward ran summit across great flagstones steps sitting high seat looked sun seemed darkened world dim remote turned north back north saw nothing save distant hills unless far away could see great bird like eagle high air descending slowly wide circles towards earth
 even gazed quick ears caught sounds woodlands west side river stiffened cries among horror could distinguish harsh voices orcs suddenly deepthroated call great horn blew blasts smote hills echoed hollows rising mighty shout roaring falls
 'the horn boromir' cried 'he need' sprang steps away leaping path 'alas ill fate day goes amiss sam'
 ran cries came louder fainter desperately horn blowing fierce shrill rose yells orcs suddenly horncalls ceased aragorn raced last slope could reach hill's foot sounds died away turned left ran towards retreated last could hear drawing bright sword crying _elendil elendil_ crashed trees
 mile maybe parth galen little glade far lake found boromir sitting back great tree resting aragorn saw pierced many blackfeathered arrows sword still hand broken near hilt horn cloven two side many orcs lay slain piled feet
 aragorn knelt beside boromir opened eyes strove speak last slow words came 'i tried take ring frodo ' said 'i sorry paid' glance strayed fallen enemies twenty least lay 'they gone halflings orcs taken think dead orcs bound them' paused eyes closed wearily moment spoke
 'farewell aragorn go minas tirith save people failed'
 'no' said aragorn taking hand kissing brow 'you conquered gained victory peace minas tirith shall fall'
 boromir smiled
 'which way go frodo there' said aragorn
 boromir speak
 'alas' said aragorn 'thus passes heir denethor lord tower guard bitter end company ruin failed vain gandalf's trust shall boromir laid go minas tirith heart desires ring bearer shall find save quest disaster'
 knelt bent weeping still clasping boromir's hand legolas gimli found came western slopes hill silently creeping trees hunting gimli axe hand legolas long knife arrows spent came glade halted amazement stood moment heads bowed grief seemed plain happened
 'alas' said legolas coming aragorn's side 'we hunted slain many orcs woods use came heard hornbut late seems fear taken deadly hurt'
 'boromir dead' said aragorn 'i unscathed fell defending hobbits away upon hill'
 'the hobbits' cried gimli 'where frodo'
 'i know' answered aragorn wearily 'before died boromir told orcs bound think dead sent follow merry pippin ask frodo sam late done today gone amiss done now'
 'first must tend fallen' said legolas 'we cannot leave lying like carrion among foul orcs'
 'but must swift' said gimli 'he would wish us linger must follow orcs hope company living prisoners'
 'but know whether ringbearer ' said aragorn 'are abandon must seek first evil choice us'
 'then let us first must do' said legolas 'we time tools bury comrade fitly raise mound cairn might build'
 'the labour would hard long stones could use nearer waterside' said gimli
 'then let us lay boat weapons weapons vanquished foes' said aragorn 'we send falls rauros give anduin river gondor take care least evil creature dishonours bones'
 quickly searched bodies orcs gathering swords cloven helms shields heap 'see' cried aragorn 'here find tokens' picked pile grim weapons two knives leafbladed damasked gold red searching found also sheaths black set small red gems 'no orctools these' said 'they borne hobbits doubtless orcs despoiled feared keep knives knowing work westernesse wound spells bane mordor well still live friends weaponless take things hoping hope give back'
 'and i' said legolas 'will take arrows find quiver empty' searched pile ground found undamaged longer shaft arrows orcs accustomed use looked closely
 aragorn looked slain said 'here lie many folk mordor north misty mountains know anything orcs kinds others strange gear manner orcs all'
 four goblinsoldiers greater stature swart slanteyed thick legs large hands armed short broadbladed swords curved scimitars usual orcs bows yew length shape like bows men upon shields bore strange device small white hand centre black field front iron helms set srune wrought white metal
 'i seen tokens before' said aragorn 'what mean'
 's sauron' said gimli 'that easy read'
 'nay' said legolas 'sauron use elfrunes'
 'neither use right name permit spelt spoken' said aragorn 'and use white orcs service baradd�r use sign red eye' stood moment thought 's saruman guess' said length 'there evil afoot isengard west longer safe gandalf feared means traitor saruman news journey likely knows gandalf's fall pursuers moria may escaped vigilance l�rien may avoided land come isengard paths orcs travel fast saruman many ways learning news remember birds'
 'well time ponder riddles' said gimli 'let us bear boromir away'
 'but must guess riddles choose course rightly' answered aragorn
 'maybe right choice' said gimli
 taking axe dwarf cut several branches lashed together bowstrings spread cloaks upon frame upon rough bier carried body companion shore together trophies last battle chose send forth short way yet found easy task boromir man tall strong
 waterside aragorn remained watching bier legolas gimli hastened back foot parth galen mile time came back paddling two boats swiftly along shore
 'there strange tale tell' said legolas 'there two boats upon bank could find trace other'
 'have orcs there' asked aragorn
 'we saw signs them' answered gimli 'and orcs would taken destroyed boats baggage well'
 'i look ground come there' said aragorn
 laid boromir middle boat bear away grey hood elvencloak folded placed beneath head combed long dark hair arrayed upon shoulders golden belt l�rien gleamed waist helm set beside across lap laid cloven horn hilts shards sword beneath feet put swords enemies fastening prow stern boat drew water rowed sadly along shore turning swiftrunning channel passed green sward parth galen steep sides tol brandir glowing midafternoon went south fume rauros rose shimmered haze gold rush thunder falls shook windless air
 sorrowfully cast loose funeral boat boromir lay restful peaceful gliding upon bosom flowing water stream took held boat back paddles floated slowly boat departed waning dark spot golden light suddenly vanished rauros roared unchanging river taken boromir son denethor seen minas tirith standing used stand upon white tower morning gondor afterdays long said elvenboat rode falls foaming pool bore osgiliath past many mouths anduin great sea night stars
 three companions remained silent gazing aragorn spoke 'they look white tower' said 'but return mountain sea' slowly began sing

 rohan fen field long grass grows
 west wind comes walking walls goes
 'what news west wandering wind bring tonight
 seen boromir tall moon starlight'
 'i saw ride seven streams waters wide grey
 saw walk empty lands passed away
 shadows north saw
 north wind may heard horn son denethor'
 'o boromir high walls westward looked afar
 came empty lands men are'

 legolas sang

 mouths sea south wind flies sandhills stones
 wailing gulls bears gate moans
 'what news south sighing wind bring eve
 boromir fair tarries grieve'
 'ask doth dwellso many bones lie
 white shores dark shores stormy sky
 many passed anduin find flowing sea
 ask north wind news north wind sends me'
 'o boromir beyond gate seaward road runs south
 came wailing gulls grey sea's mouth'

 aragorn sang

 gate kings north wind rides past roaring falls
 clear cold tower loud horn calls
 'what news north mighty wind bring today
 news boromir bold long away'
 'beneath amon hen heard cry many foes fought
 cloven shield broken sword water brought
 head proud face fair limbs laid rest
 rauros golden raurosfalls bore upon breast'
 'o boromir tower guard shall ever northward gaze
 rauros golden raurosfalls end days'

 ended turned boat drove speed could stream back parth galen
 'you left east wind me' said gimli 'but say naught it'
 'that be' said aragorn 'in minas tirith endure east wind ask tidings boromir taken road must make haste choose own'
 surveyed green lawn quickly thoroughly stooping often earth 'the orcs ground' said 'otherwise nothing made certain footprints crossing recrossing cannot tell whether hobbits come back since search frodo began' returned bank close rill spring trickled river 'there clear prints here' said 'a hobbit waded water back cannot say long ago'
 'how read riddle' asked gimli
 aragorn answer went back campingplace looked baggage 'two packs missing' said 'and one certainly sam's rather large heavy answer frodo gone boat servant gone frodo must returned away met sam going hill told follow plainly guessed master mind came back frodo gone find easy leave sam behind'
 'but leave us behind without word' said gimli 'that strange deed'
 'and brave deed' said aragorn 'sam right think frodo wish lead friend death mordor knew must go something happened left us overcame fear doubt'
 'maybe hunting orcs came fled' said legolas
 'he fled certainly' said aragorn 'but think orcs' thought cause frodo's sudden resolve flight aragorn say last words boromir long kept secret
 'well much least clear' said legolas 'frodo longer side river taken boat sam would taken pack'
 'our choice then' said gimli 'is either take remaining boat follow frodo else follow orcs foot little hope either way already lost precious hours'
 'let think' said aragorn 'and may make right choice change evil fate unhappy day' stood silent moment 'i follow orcs' said last 'i would guided frodo mordor gone end seek wilderness must abandon captives torment death heart speaks clearly last fate bearer hands longer company played part yet remain cannot forsake companions strength left come go leave spared behind press day dark'
 drew last boat carried trees laid beneath goods need could carry away left parth galen afternoon fading came back glade boromir fallen picked trail orcs needed little skill find
 'no folk make trampling' said legolas 'it seems delight slash beat growing things even way'
 'but go great speed that' said aragorn 'and tire later may search path hard bare lands'
 'well them' said gimli 'dwarves go swiftly tire sooner orcs long chase long start'
 'yes' said aragorn 'we shall need endurance dwarves come hope without hope follow trail enemies woe prove swifter make chase shall accounted marvel among three kindreds  elves dwarves men forth three hunters'
 like deer sprang away trees sped led tireless swift mind last made woods lake left behind long slopes climbed dark hardedged sky already red sunset dusk came passed away grey shadows stony land


 _chapter 2_
 riders rohan

 dusk deepened mist lay behind among trees brooded pale margins anduin sky clear stars came waxing moon riding west shadows rocks black come feet stony hills pace slower trail longer easy follow highlands emyn muil ran north south two long tumbled ridges western side ridge steep difficult eastward slopes gentler furrowed many gullies narrow ravines night three companions scrambled bony land climbing crest first tallest ridge darkness deep winding valley side
 still cool hour dawn rested brief space moon long gone stars glittered first light day yet come dark hills behind moment aragorn loss orctrail descended valley vanished
 'which way would turn think' said legolas 'northward take straighter road isengard fangorn aim guess southward strike entwash'
 'they make river whatever mark aim at'' said aragorn 'and unless much amiss rohan power saruman greatly increased take shortest way find fields rohirrim let us search northwards'
 dale ran like stony trough ridged hills trickling stream flowed among boulders bottom cliff frowned upon right left rose grey slopes dim shadowy late night went mile northwards aragorn searching bent towards ground among folds gullies leading western ridge legolas way ahead suddenly elf gave cry others came running towards
 'we already overtaken hunting' said 'look' pointed saw first taken boulders lying foot slope huddled bodies five dead orcs lay hewn many cruel strokes two beheaded ground wet dark blood
 'here another riddle' said gimli 'but needs light day cannot wait'
 'yet however read seems unhopeful' said legolas 'enemies orcs likely friends folk dwell hills'
 'no' said aragorn 'the rohirrim seldom come far minas tirith might company men hunting reasons know yet think not'
 'what think' said gimli
 'i think enemy brought enemy him' answered aragorn 'these northern orcs far away among slain none great orcs strange badges quarrel guess uncommon thing foul folk maybe dispute road'
 'or captives' said gimli 'let us hope meet end here'
 aragorn searched ground wide circle traces fight could found went already eastward sky turning pale stars fading grey light slowly growing little north came fold tiny stream falling winding cut stony path valley bushes grew patches grass upon sides
 'at last' said aragorn 'here tracks seek waterchannel way orcs went debate'
 swiftly pursuers turned followed new path fresh night's rest sprang stone stone last reached crest grey hill sudden breeze blew hair stirred cloaks chill wind dawn
 turning back saw across river far hills kindled day leaped sky red rim sun rose shoulders dark land west world lay still formless grey even looked shadows night melted colours waking earth returned green flowed wide meads rohan white mists shimmered watervales far left thirty leagues blue purple stood white mountains rising peaks jet tipped glimmering snows flushed rose morning
 'gondor gondor' cried aragorn 'would looked happier hour yet road lie southward bright streams

 gondor gondor mountains sea
 west wind blew light upon silver tree
 fell like bright rain gardens kings old
 proud walls white towers winged crown throne gold
 gondor gondor shall men behold silver tree
 west wind blow mountains sea

 let us go' said drawing eyes away south looking west north way must tread
 ridge upon companions stood went steeply feet twenty fathoms wide rugged shelf ended suddenly brink sheer cliff east wall rohan ended emyn muil green plains rohirrim stretched away edge sight
 'look' cried legolas pointing pale sky 'there eagle high seems flying away land back north going great speed look'
 'no even eyes see good legolas' said aragorn 'he must far aloft indeed wonder errand bird seen look see something nearer hand urgent something moving plain'
 'many things' said legolas 'it great company foot cannot say see kind folk may many leagues away twelve guess flatness plain hard measure'
 'i think nonetheless longer need trail tell us way go' said gimli 'let us find path fields quick may be'
 'i doubt find path quicker one orcs chose' said aragorn
 followed enemies clear light day seemed orcs pressed possible speed every pursuers found things dropped cast away foodbags rinds crusts hard grey bread torn black cloak heavy ironnailed shoe broken stones trail led north along top escarpment length came deep cleft carved rock stream splashed noisily narrow ravine rough path descended like steep stair plain
 bottom came strange suddenness grass rohan swelled like green sea foot emyn muil falling stream vanished deep growth cresses waterplants could hear tinkling away green tunnels long gentle slopes towards fens entwash vale far away seemed left winter clinging hills behind air softer warmer faintly scented spring already stirring sap flowing herb leaf legolas took deep breath like one drinks great draught long thirst barren places
 'ah green smell' said 'it better much sleep let us run'
 'light feet may run swiftly here' said aragorn 'more swiftly maybe ironshod orcs chance lessen lead'
 went single file running like hounds strong scent eager light eyes nearly due west broad swath marching orcs tramped ugly slot sweet grass rohan bruised blackened passed presently aragorn gave cry turned aside 'stay' shouted 'do follow yet' ran quickly right away main trail seen footprints went way branching others marks small unshod feet however go far crossed orcprints also coming main trail behind front curved sharply back lost trampling furthest point aragorn stooped picked something grass ran back
 'yes' said 'they quite plain hobbit's footprints pippin's think smaller look held thing glittered sunlight looked like newopened leaf beechtree fair strange treeless plain
 'the brooch elvencloak' cried legolas gimli together
 'not idly leaves l�rien fall' said aragorn 'this drop chance cast away token might follow think pippin ran away trail purpose'
 'then least alive' said gimli 'and use wits legs heartening pursue vain'
 'let us hope pay dearly boldness' said legolas 'come let us go thought merry young folk driven like cattle burns heart'
 sun climbed noon rode slowly sky light clouds came sea distant south blown away upon breeze sun sank shadows rose behind reached long arms east still hunters held one day passed since boromir fell orcs yet far ahead longer could sight seen level plains
 nightshade closing aragorn halted twice day's march rested brief twelve leagues lay eastern wall stood dawn
 'we come last hard choice' said 'shall rest night shall go strength hold'
 'unless enemies rest also leave us far behind stay sleep' said legolas 'surely even orcs must pause march' said gimli 'seldom orcs journey open sun yet done so' said legolas 'certainly rest night'
 'but walk night cannot follow trail' said gimli
 'the trail straight turns neither right left far eyes see' said legolas
 'maybe could lead guess darkness hold line' said aragorn 'but strayed turned aside light came might long delay trail found again'
 'and also' said gimli 'only day see tracks lead away prisoner escape one carried eastward say great river towards mordor might pass signs never know it'
 'that true' said aragorn 'but read signs back yonder rightly orcs white hand prevailed whole company bound isengard present course bears out'
 'yet would rash sure counsels' said gimli 'and escape dark passed signs led brooch'
 'the orcs doubly guard since prisoners even wearier' said legolas 'there escape contrive done cannot guessed first must overtake them'
 'and yet even dwarf many journeys least hardy folk cannot run way isengard without pause ' said gimli 'my heart burns would started sooner must rest little run better rest blind night time so'
 'i said hard choice' said aragorn 'how shall end debate'
 'you guide' said gimli 'and skilled chase shall choose'
 'my heart bids go on' said legolas 'but must hold together follow counsel'
 'you give choice ill chooser' said aragorn 'since passed argonath choices gone amiss' fell silent gazing north west gathering night long
 'we walk dark' said length 'the peril missing trail signs coming going seems greater moon gave enough light would use alas sets early yet young pale'
 'and tonight shrouded anyway' gimli murmured 'would lady given us light gift gave frodo'
 'it needed bestowed' said aragorn 'with lies true quest small matter great deeds time vain pursuit beginning maybe choice mine mar mend well chosen let us use time best may'
 cast ground fell sleep slept since night shadow tol brandir dawn sky woke rose gimli still deep slumber legolas standing gazing northwards darkness thoughtful silent young tree windless night
 'they far far away' said sadly turning aragorn 'i know heart rested night eagle could overtake now'
 'nonetheless still follow may' said aragorn stooping roused dwarf 'come must go' said 'the scent growing cold'
 'but still dark' said gimli 'even legolas hilltop could see till sun up'
 'i fear passed beyond sight hill plain moon sun' said legolas
 'where sight fails earth may bring us rumour' said aragorn 'the land must groan hated feet' stretched upon ground ear pressed turf lay motionless long time gimli wondered swooned fallen asleep dawn came glimmering slowly grey light grew last rose friends could see face pale drawn look troubled
 'the rumour earth dim confused' said 'nothing walks upon many miles us faint far feet enemies loud hoofs horses comes mind heard even lay ground sleep troubled dreams horses galloping passing west drawing ever us riding northward wonder happening land'
 'let us go' said legolas
 third day pursuit began long hours cloud fitful sun hardly paused striding running weariness could quench fire burned seldom spoke wide solitude passed elvencloaks faded background greygreen fields even cool sunlight midday elvish eyes would marked close hand often hearts thanked lady l�rien gift _lembas_ could eat find new strength even ran
 day track enemies led straight going northwest without break turn day wore end came long treeless slopes land rose swelling towards line low humpbacked downs ahead orctrail grew fainter bent north towards ground became harder grass shorter far away left river entwash wound silver thread green floor moving thing could seen often aragorn wondered saw sign beast man dwellings rohirrim part many leagues away south wooded eaves white mountains hidden mist cloud yet horselords formerly kept many herds studs eastemnet easterly region realm herdsmen wandered much living camp tent even wintertime land empty silence seem quiet peace

 dusk halted twice twelve leagues passed plains rohan wall emyn muil lost shadows east young moon glimmering misty sky gave small light stars veiled
 'now grudge time rest halt chase ' said legolas 'the orcs run us whips sauron behind fear already reached forest dark hills even passing shadows trees'
 gimli ground teeth 'this bitter end hope toil' said
 'to hope maybe toil' said aragorn 'we shall turn back yet weary' gazed back along way come towards night gathering east 'there something strange work land distrust silence distrust even pale moon stars faint weary seldom weary ranger clear trail follow lends speed foes sets unseen barrier us weariness heart limb'
 'truly' said legolas 'that known since first came emyn muil behind us us' pointed away land rohan darkling west sickle moon 'saruman' muttered aragorn 'but shall turn us back halt must see even moon falling gathering cloud north lies road fen day returns'
 legolas first afoot indeed ever slept 'awake awake' cried 'it red dawn strange things await us eaves forest good evil know called awake'
 others sprang almost set slowly downs drew near still hour noon reached green slopes rising bare ridges ran line straight towards north feet ground dry turf short long strip sunken land ten miles wide lay river wandering deep dim thickets reed rush west southernmost slope great ring turf torn beaten many trampling feet orctrail ran turning north along dry skirts hills aragorn halted examined tracks closely
 'they rested while' said 'but even outward trail already old fear heart spoke truly legolas thrice twelve hours guess since orcs stood stand held pace sundown yesterday would reach borders fangorn'
 'i see nothing away north west grass dwindling mist' said gimli 'could see forest climbed hills'
 'it still far away' said aragorn 'if remember rightly downs run eight leagues north northwest issuing entwash lies still wide land another fifteen leagues may be'
 'well let us go on' said gimli 'my legs must forget miles would willing heart less heavy'
 sun sinking last drew near end line downs many hours marched without rest going slowly gimli's back bent stonehard dwarves labour journey endless chase began tell hope failed heart aragorn walked behind grim silent stooping scan print mark upon ground legolas still stepped lightly ever feet hardly seeming press grass leaving footprints passed waybread elves found sustenance needed could sleep sleep could called men resting mind strange paths elvish dreams even walked openeyed light world
 'let us go green hill' said wearily followed climbing long slope came upon top round hill smooth bare standing northerly downs sun sank shadows evening fell like curtain alone grey formless world without mark measure far away northwest deeper darkness dying light mountains mist forest feet
 'nothing see guide us here' said gimli 'well must halt wear night away growing cold'
 'the wind north snows' said aragorn
 'and ere morning east' said legolas 'but rest must yet cast hope away tomorrow unknown rede oft found rising sun'
 'three suns already risen chase brought counsel ' said gimli

 night grew ever colder aragorn gimli slept fitfully whenever awoke saw legolas standing beside walking fro singing softly tongue sang white stars opened hard black vault night passed together watched dawn grow slowly sky bare cloudless last sunrise came pale clear wind east mists rolled away wide lands lay bleak bitter light
 ahead eastward saw windy uplands wold rohan already glimpsed many days ago great river northwestward stalked dark forest fangorn still ten leagues away stood shadowy eaves slopes faded distant blue beyond glimmered far away floating grey cloud white head tall methedras last peak misty mountains forest entwash flowed meet stream swift narrow banks deepcloven orctrail turned downs towards
 following keen eyes trail river river back towards forest aragorn saw shadow distant green dark swiftmoving blur cast upon ground listened intently legolas stood beside shading bright elveneyes long slender hand saw shadow blur small figures horsemen many horsemen glint morning tips spears like twinkle minute stars beyond edge mortal sight far behind dark smoke rose thin curling threads
 silence empty fields arid gimli could hear air moving grass
 'riders' cried aragorn springing feet 'many riders swift steeds coming towards us'
 'yes' said legolas 'there one hundred five yellow hair bright spears leader tall'
 aragorn smiled 'keen eyes elves' said
 'nay riders little five leagues distant' said legolas
 'five leagues one' said gimli 'we cannot escape bare land shall wait go way'
 'we wait' said aragorn 'i weary hunt failed least others us horsemen riding back orctrail may get new them'
 'or spears' said gimli
 'there three empty saddles see hobbits' said legolas
 'i say hear good news' said aragorn 'but evil good await here'
 three companions left hilltop might easy mark pale sky walked slowly northward slope little hill's foot halted wrapping cloaks sat huddled together upon faded grass time passed slowly heavily wind thin searching gimli uneasy
 'what know horsemen aragorn' said 'do sit waiting sudden death'
 'i among them' answered aragorn 'they proud wilful truehearted generous thought deed bold cruel wise unlearned writing books singing many songs manner children men dark years know happened late mind rohirrim may traitor saruman threat sauron long friends people gondor though akin forgotten years long ago eorl young brought north kinship rather bardings dale beornings wood among may still seen many men tall fair riders rohan least love orcs'
 'but gandalf spoke rumour pay tribute mordor ' said gimli
 'i believe boromir' answered aragorn
 'you soon learn truth' said legolas 'already approach'
 length even gimli could hear distant beat galloping hoofs horsemen following trail turned river drawing near downs riding like wind
 cries clear strong voices came ringing fields suddenly swept noise like thunder foremost horseman swerved passing foot hill leading host back southward along western skirts downs rode long line mailclad men swift shining fell fair look upon
 horses great stature strong cleanlimbed grey coats glistened long tails flowed wind manes braided proud necks men rode matched well tall longlimbed hair flaxenpale flowed light helms streamed long braids behind faces stern keen hands tall spears ash painted shields slung backs long swords belts burnished skirts mail hung upon knees
 pairs galloped though every one rose stirrups gazed ahead either side appeared perceive three strangers sitting silently watching host almost passed suddenly aragorn stood called loud voice
 'what news north riders rohan'
 astonishing speed skill checked steeds wheeled came charging round soon three companions found ring horsemen moving running circle hillslope behind round round drawing ever inwards aragorn stood silent two sat without moving wondering way things would turn
 without word cry suddenly riders halted thicket spears pointed towards strangers horsemen bows hand arrows already fitted string one rode forward tall man taller rest helm crest white horsetail flowed advanced point spear within foot aragorn's breast aragorn stir
 'who land' said rider using common speech west manner tone like speech boromir man gondor
 'i called strider' answered aragorn 'i came north hunting orcs'
 rider leaped horse giving spear another rode dismounted side drew sword stood face face aragorn surveying keenly without wonder length spoke
 'at first thought orcs' said 'but see indeed know little orcs go hunting fashion swift wellarmed many would changed hunters prey ever overtaken something strange strider' bent clear bright eyes upon ranger 'that name man give strange raiment sprung grass escape sight elvish folk'
 'no' said aragorn 'one us elf legolas woodland realm distant mirkwood passed lothl�rien gifts favour lady go us'
 rider looked renewed wonder eyes hardened 'then lady golden wood old tales tell' said 'few escape nets say strange days favour also netweavers sorcerers maybe' turned cold glance suddenly upon legolas gimli 'why speak silent ones' demanded
 gimli rose planted feet firmly apart hand gripped handle axe dark eyes flashed 'give name horsemaster give mine besides' said
 'as that' said rider staring dwarf 'the stranger declare first yet named �omer son �omund called third marshal riddermark'
 'then �omer son �omund third marshal riddermark let gimli dwarf gl�in's son warn foolish words speak evil fair beyond reach thought little wit excuse you'
 �omer's eyes blazed men rohan murmured angrily closed advancing spears 'i would cut head beard master dwarf stood little higher ground ' said �omer
 'he stands alone' said legolas bending bow fitting arrow hands moved quicker sight 'you would die stroke fell'
 �omer raised sword things might gone ill aragorn sprang raised hand 'your pardon �omer' cried 'when know understand angered companions intend evil rohan folk neither man horse hear tale strike'
 'i will' said �omer lowering blade 'but wanderers riddermark would wise less haughty days doubt first tell right name'
 'first tell serve' said aragorn 'are friend foe sauron dark lord mordor'
 'i serve lord mark th�oden king son thengel' answered �omer 'we serve power black land far away neither yet open war fleeing best leave land trouble borders threatened desire free live lived keeping serving foreign lord good evil welcomed guests kindly better days times unbidden stranger finds us swift hard come _you_ serve whose command hunt orcs land'
 'i serve man' said aragorn 'but servants sauron pursue whatever land may go among mortal men know orcs hunt fashion choice orcs pursued took captive two friends need man horse go foot ask leave follow trail count heads enemy save sword weaponless'
 aragorn threw back cloak elvensheath glittered grasped bright blade and�ril shone like sudden flame swept 'elendil' cried 'i aragorn son arathorn called elessar elfstone d�nadan heir isildur elendil's son gondor sword broken forged aid thwart choose swiftly'
 gimli legolas looked companion amazement seen mood seemed grown stature �omer shrunk living face caught brief vision power majesty kings stone moment seemed eyes legolas white flame flickered brows aragorn like shining crown
 �omer stepped back look awe face cast proud eyes 'these indeed strange days' muttered 'dreams legends spring life grass
 'tell lord' said 'what brings meaning dark words long boromir son denethor gone seeking answer horse lent came back riderless doom bring north'
 'the doom choice' said aragorn 'you may say th�oden son thengel open war lies sauron none may live lived shall keep call great matters speak later chance allows come king great need ask help least tidings heard pursuing orchost carried friends tell us'
 'that need pursue further' said �omer 'the orcs destroyed'
 'and friends'
 'we found none orcs'
 'but strange indeed' said aragorn 'did search slain bodies orckind would small children eyes unshod clad grey'
 'there dwarves children' said �omer 'we counted slain despoiled piled carcases burned custom ashes smoking still'
 'we speak dwarves children' said gimli 'our friends hobbits'
 'hobbits' said �omer 'and may strange name'
 'a strange name strange folk' said gimli 'but dear us seems heard rohan words troubled minas tirith spoke halfling hobbits halflings'
 'halflings' laughed rider stood beside �omer 'halflings little people old songs children's tales north walk legends green earth daylight'
 'a man may both' said aragorn 'for come make legends time green earth say mighty matter legend though tread light day'
 'time pressing' said rider heeding aragorn 'we must hasten south lord let us leave wild folk fancies let us bind take king'
 'peace �othain' said �omer tongue 'leave tell _�ored_ assemble path' make ready ride entwade'

 muttering �othain retired spoke others soon drew left �omer alone three companions
 'all say strange aragorn' said 'yet speak truth plain men mark lie therefore easily deceived told speak fully errand may judge do'
 'i set imladris named rhyme many weeks ago' answered aragorn 'with went boromir minas tirith errand go city son denethor aid folk war sauron company journeyed business cannot speak gandalf grey leader'
 'gandalf' �omer exclaimed 'gandalf greyhame known mark name warn longer password king's favour guest land many times memory men coming season many years ever herald strange events bringer evil say
 'indeed since last coming summer things gone amiss time trouble saruman began counted saruman friend hut gandalf came warned us sudden war preparing isengard said prisoner orthanc hardly escaped begged help th�oden would listen went away speak name gandalf loudly th�oden's ears wroth gandalf took horse called shadowfax precious king's steeds chief _mearas_ lord mark may ride sire race great horse eorl knew speech men seven nights ago shadowfax returned king's anger less horse wild let man handle him'
 'then shadowfax found way alone far north' said aragorn 'for gandalf parted alas gandalf ride longer fell darkness mines moria comes again'
 'that heavy tidings' said �omer 'at least many though may find come king'
 'it tidings grievous land understand though may touch sorely ere year much older' said aragorn 'but great fall less must lead part guide company long road moria l�rien came � well learn truth ere speak � thence leagues great river falls rauros boromir slain orcs destroyed'
 'your news woe' cried �omer dismay 'great harm death minas tirith us worthy man spoke praise came seldom mark ever wars eastborders seen like swift sons eorl grave men gondor seemed likely prove great captain people time came word grief gondor fall'
 'it fourth day since slain' answered aragorn 'and since evening day journeyed shadow tol brandir'
 'on foot' cried �omer
 'yes even see us'
 wide wonder came �omer's eyes 'strider poor name son arathorn' said 'wingfoot name deed three friends sung many hall forty leagues five measured ere fourth day ended hardy race elendil
 'but lord would must return haste th�oden spoke warily men true yet open war black land close king's ear speak craven counsels war coming shall forsake old alliance gondor fight shall aid say hold eastmark charge ward third marshal removed herds herdfolk withdrawing beyond entwash leaving none guards swift scouts'
 'then pay tribute sauron' said gimli

 last afternoon waning came eaves forest open glade among first trees found place great burning ashes still hot smoking beside great pile helms mail cloven shields broken swords bows darts gear war upon stake middle set great goblin head upon shattered helm white badge could still seen away far river came streaming edge wood mound newly raised raw earth covered freshcut turves planted fifteen spears
 aragorn companions searched far wide field battle light faded evening soon drew dim misty nightfall discovered trace merry pippin
 'we more' said gimli sadly 'we set many riddles since came tol brandir hardest unravel would guess burned bones hobbits mingled orcs' hard news frodo lives hear hard old hobbit waits rivendell elrond coming'
 'but gandalf not' said legolas
 'but gandalf chose come first lost ' answered gimli 'his foresight failed him'
 'the counsel gandalf founded foreknowledge safety others' said aragorn 'there things better begin refuse even though end may dark shall depart place yet case must await morninglight'
 little way beyond battlefield made camp spreading tree looked like chestnut yet still bore many broad brown leaves former year like dry hands long splayed fingers rattled mournfully nightbreeze
 gimli shivered brought one blanket apiece 'let us light fire' said 'i care longer danger let orcs come thick summermoths round candle'
 'if unhappy hobbits astray woods might draw hither' said legolas
 'and might draw things neither orc hobbit' said aragorn 'we near mountainmarches traitor saruman also edge fangorn perilous touch trees wood said'
 'but rohirrim made great burning yesterday' said gimli 'and felled trees fire seen yet passed night safely labour ended'
 'they many' said aragorn 'and heed wrath fangorn come seldom go trees paths likely lead us forest care cut living wood'
 'there need' said gimli 'the riders left chip bough enough dead wood lying plenty' went gather fuel busied building kindling fire aragorn sat silent back great tree deep thought legolas stood alone open looking towards profound shadow wood leaning forward one listens voices calling distance
 dwarf small bright blaze going three companions drew close sat together shrouding light hooded forms legolas looked boughs tree reaching
 'look' said 'the tree glad fire'
 may dancing shadows tricked eyes certainly companions boughs appeared bending way come flames upper branches stooping brown leaves stood stiff rubbed together like many cold cracked hands taking comfort warmth
 silence suddenly dark unknown forest near hand made felt great brooding presence full secret purpose legolas spoke
 'celeborn warned us go far fangorn' said 'do know aragorn fables forest boromir heard'
 'i heard many tales gondor elsewhere' said aragorn 'but words celeborn deem fables men made true knowledge fades thought asking truth matter elf wood know shall man answer'
 'you journeyed i' said legolas 'i heard nothing land save songs tell onodrim men call ents dwelt long ago fangorn old old even elves would reckon it'
 'yes old' said aragorn 'as old forest barrowdowns far greater elrond says two akin last strongholds mighty woods elder days firstborn roamed men still slept yet fangorn holds secret know'
 'and wish know' said gimli 'let nothing dwells fangorn troubled account'

 fell asleep legolas already lay motionless fair hands folded upon breast eyes unclosed blending living night deep dream way elves gimli sat hunched fire running thumb thoughtfully along edge axe tree rustled sound
 suddenly gimli looked edge firelight stood old bent man leaning staff wrapped great cloak widebrimmed hat pulled eyes gimli sprang amazed moment cry though thought flashed mind saruman caught aragorn legolas roused sudden movement sat stared old man speak make sign
 'well father you' said aragorn leaping feet 'come warm cold' strode forward old man gone trace found near hand dare wander far moon set night dark
 suddenly legolas gave cry 'the horses horses'
 horses gone dragged pickets disappeared time three companions stood still silent troubled new stroke ill fortune eaves fangorn endless leagues lay men rohan friends wide dangerous land stood seemed heard far night sound horses whinnying neighing quiet except cold rustle wind

 'well gone' said aragorn last 'we cannot find catch return must without started feet still'
 'feet' said gimli 'but cannot eat well walk ' threw fuel fire slumped beside
 'only hours ago unwilling sit horse rohan' laughed legolas 'you make rider yet'
 'it seems unlikely shall chance' said gimli
 'if wish know think' began 'i think saruman else remember words �omer walks like old man hooded cloaked words gone horses scared away trouble coming us mark words'
 'i mark them' said aragorn 'but marked also old man hat hood still doubt guess right peril night day yet meantime nothing rest may watch gimli need thought sleep'
 night passed slowly legolas followed aragorn gimli followed legolas watches wore away nothing happened old man appear horses return


 _chapter 3_
 urukhai

 pippin lay dark troubled dream seemed could hear small voice echoing black tunnels calling _frodo frodo_ instead frodo hundreds hideous orcfaces grinned shadows hundreds hideous arms grasped every side merry
 woke cold air blew face lying back evening coming sky growing dim turned found dream little worse waking wrists legs ankles tied cords beside merry lay whitefaced dirty rag bound across brows sat stood great company orcs
 slowly pippin's aching head memory pieced together became separated dreamshadows course merry run woods come dashed like taking notice old strider run long way shouting�he could remember far long suddenly crashed right group orcs standing listening appear see merry pippin almost arms yelled dozens goblins sprung trees merry drawn swords orcs wish fight tried lay hold even merry cut several arms hands good old merry
 boromir come leaping trees made fight slew many rest fled gone far way back attacked hundred orcs least large shot rain arrows always boromir boromir blown great horn till woods rang first orcs dismayed drawn back answer echoes came attacked fierce ever pippin remember much last memo boromir leaning tree plucking arrow darkness fell suddenly
 'i suppose knocked head' said 'i wonder poor merry much hurt happened boromir orcs kill us going'
 could answer questions felt cold sick 'i wish gandalf never persuaded elrond let us come' thought 'what good nuisance passenger piece luggage stolen piece luggage orcs hope strider someone come claim us ought hope throw plans wish could get free'

 struggled little quite uselessly one orcs sitting near laughed said something companion abominable tongue 'rest little fool' said pippin common speech made almost hideous language 'rest we'll find use legs long wish got none get home'
 'if way wish dead now' said 'i'd make squeak miserable rat' stooped pippin bringing yellow fangs close face black knife long jagged blade hand 'lie quiet i'll tickle this' hissed 'don't draw attention may forget orders curse isengarders _ugl�k u bagronk sha pushdug sarumanglob b�bhosh skai'_ passed long angry speech tongue slowly died away muttering snarling
 terrified pippin lay still though pain wrists ankles growing stones beneath boring back take mind listened intently could hear many voices round though orcspeech sounded times full hate anger seemed plain something like quarrel begun getting hotter
 pippin's surprise found much talk intelligible many orcs using ordinary language apparently members two three quite different tribes present could understand one another's orcspeech angry debate concerning way take done prisoners
 'there's time kill properly' said one 'no time play trip'
 'that can't helped' said another 'but kill quick kill they're cursed nuisance we're hurry evening's coming ought get move on'
 'orders' said third voice deep growl _'kill but_not_ halfings brought back_alive_ quickly possible_ that's orders'
 'what wanted for' asked several voices 'why alive give good sport'
 'no heard one got something something that's wanted war elvish plot anyway they'll questioned'
 'is know search find might find something could use ourselves'
 'that interesting remark' sneered voice softer others evil 'i may report prisoners searched plundered _my_ orders'
 'and mine too' said deep voice '_alive captured spoiling_ that's orders'
 'not orders' said one earlier voices 'we come way mines kill avenge folk wish kill go back north'
 'then wish again' said growling voice 'i ugl�k command return isengard shortest road'
 'is saruman master great eye' said evil voice 'we go back lugb�rz'
 'if could cross great river might' said another voice 'but enough us venture bridges'
 'i came across' said evil voice 'a winged nazg�l awaits us northward eastbank'
 'maybe maybe fly prisoners get pay praise lugb�rz leave us foot best horsecountry must stick together lands dangerous full foul rebels brigands'
 'aye must stick together' growled ugl�k 'i trust little swine guts outside sties us run away fighting urukhai slew great warrior took prisoners servants saruman wise white hand hand gives us man'sflesh eat came isengard led shall lead back way choose ugl�k spoken'
 'you spoken enough ugl�k' sneered evil voice 'i wonder would like lugb�rz might think ugl�k's shoulders needed relieving swollen head might ask strange ideas came come saruman perhaps _he_ think setting filthy white badges might agree grishn�kh trusted messenger grishn�kh say saruman fool dirty treacherous fool great eye
 '_swine_ folk like called _swine_ muckrakers dirty little wizard orcflesh eat i'll warrant'
 many loud yells orcspeech answered ringing clash weapons drawn cautiously pippin rolled hoping see would happen guards gone join fray twilight saw large black orc probably ugl�k standing facing grishn�kh short crooklegged creature broad long arms hung almost ground round many smaller goblins pippin supposed ones north drawn knives swords hesitated attack ugl�k
 ugl�k shouted number orcs nearly size ran suddenly without warning ugl�k sprang forwards two swift strokes swept heads two opponents grishn�kh stepped aside vanished shadows others gave way one stepped backwards fell merry's prostrate form curse yet probably saved life ugl�k's followers leaped cut another broadbladed swords yellowfanged guard body fell right top pippin still clutching long sawedged knife
 'put weapons' shouted ugl�k 'and let's nonsense go straight west stair straight downs along river forest march day night clear'
 'now' thought pippin 'if takes ugly fellow little get troop control i've got chance' gleam hope come edge black knife snicked arm slid wrist felt blood trickling hand also felt cold touch steel skin
 orcs getting ready march northerners still unwilling isengarders slew two rest cowed much cursing confusion moment pippin unwatched legs securely bound arms tied wrists hands front could move together though bonds cruelly tight pushed dead orc one side hardly daring breathe drew knot wristcord blade knife sharp dead hand held fast cord cut quickly pippin took fingers knotted loose bracelet two loops slipped hands lay still

 'pick prisoners' shouted ugl�k 'don't play tricks alive get back someone else die too'
 orc seized pippin like sack put head tied hands grabbed arms dragged pippin's face crushed neck jolted another treated merry way orc's clawlike hand gripped pippin's arms like iron nails bit shut eyes slipped back evil dreams
 suddenly thrown stony floor early night slim moon already falling westward edge cliff seemed look sea pale mist sound water falling nearby
 'the scouts come back last' said orc close hand
 'well discover' growled voice ugl�k
 'only single horseman made westwards all's clear now'
 'now daresay long fools shot he'll raise alarm cursed horsebreeders hear us morning we'll leg double quick'
 shadow bent pippin ugl�k 'sit up' said orc 'my lads tired lugging got climb must use legs helpful crying trying escape ways paying tricks like though spoil usefulness master'
 cut thongs round pippin's legs ankles picked hair stood feet pippin fell ugl�k dragged hair several orcs laughed ugl�k thrust flask teeth poured burning liquid throat felt hot fierce glow flow pain legs ankles vanished could stand
 'now other' said ugl�k pippin saw go merry lying close kick merry groaned seizing roughly ugl�k pulled sitting position tore bandage head smeared wound dark stuff small wooden box merry cried struggled wildly
 orcs clapped hooted 'can't take medicine' jeered 'doesn't know what's good ai shall fun later'
 moment ugl�k engaged sport needed speed humour unwilling followers healing merry orcfashion treatment worked swiftly forced drink flask hobbit's throat cut legbonds dragged feet merry stood looking pale grim defiant much alive gash forehead gave trouble bore brown scar end days
 'hullo pippin' said 'so come little expedition get bed breakfast'
 'now then' said ugl�k 'none hold tongues talk one another trouble reported end he'll know pay get bed breakfast right stomach'

 orcband began descend narrow ravine leading misty plain merry pippin separated dozen orcs climbed bottom stepped grass hearts hobbits rose
 'now straight on' shouted ugl�k 'west little north follow lugdush'
 'but going sunrise' said northerners
 'go running' said ugl�k 'what think sit grass wait whiteskins join picnic'
 'but can't run sunlight'
 'you'll run behind you' said ugl�k 'run never see beloved holes white hand what's use sending mountainmaggots trip half trained run curse run night lasts'
 whole company began run long loping strides orcs kept order thrusting jostling cursing yet speed great hobbit guard three pippin far back line wondered long would able go pace food since morning one guards whip present orcliquor still hot wits wideawake
 every came mind unbidden vision keen face strider bending dark trail running running behind could even ranger see except confused trail orcfeet little prints merry's overwhelmed trampling ironshod shoes behind
 gone mile cliff land sloped wide shallow depression ground soft wet mist lay paleglimmering last rays sickle moon dark shapes orcs front grew dim swallowed
 'ai steady now' shouted ugl�k rear
 sudden thought leaped pippin's mind acted swerved aside right dived reach clutching guard headfirst mist landed sprawling grass
 'halt' yelled ugl�k
 moment turmoil confusion pippin sprang ran orcs suddenly loomed right front
 'no hope escape' thought pippin 'but hope left marks unspoilt wet ground' groped two tied hands throat unclasped brooch cloak long arms hard claws seized let fall 'there suppose lie end time' thought 'i know others escaped they've probably gone frodo'
 whipthong curled round legs stifled cry
 'enough' shouted ugl�k running 'he's still got run long way yet make 'em run use whip reminder'
 'but that's all' snarled turning pippin 'i forget payment put leg it'

 neither pippin merry remembered much later part journey evil dreams evil waking blended long tunnel misery hope growing ever fainter behind ran ran striving keep pace set orcs licked every cruel thong cunningly handled halted stumbled seized dragged distance
 warmth orcdraught gone pippin felt cold sick suddenly fell face downward turf hard hands rending nails gripped lifted carried like sack darkness grew whether darkness another night blindness eyes could tell
 dimly became aware voices clamouring seemed many orcs demanding halt ugl�k shouting felt flung ground lay fell till black dreams took long escape pain soon iron grip merciless hands long time tossed shaken slowly darkness gave way came back waking world found morning orders shouted thrown roughly grass
 lay fighting despair head swam heat body guessed given another draught orc stooped flung bread strip raw dried flesh ate stale grey bread hungrily meat famished yet famished eat flesh flung orc flesh dared guess creature
 sat looked merry far away banks swift narrow river ahead mountains loomed tall peak catching first rays sun dark smudge forest lay lower slopes
 much shouting debating among orcs quarrel seemed point breaking northerners isengarders pointing back away south pointing eastward
 'very well' said ugl�k 'leave killing i've told want throw away we've come way get throw away i'll look let fighting urukhai work usual afraid whiteskins run run there's forest' shouted pointing ahead 'get best hope go quick knock heads put sense others'
 cursing scuffling northerners broke away dashed hundred running wildly along river towards mountains hobbits left isengarders grim dark band four score least large swart slanteyed orcs great bows short broadbladed swords larger bolder northerners remained
 'now we'll deal grishn�kh' said ugl�k even followers looking uneasily southwards
 'i know' growled ugl�k 'the cursed horseboys got wind us that's fault snaga scouts ought ears cut fighters we'll feast horseflesh yet something better'
 moment pippin saw troop pointing eastward direction came hoarse cries grishn�kh back couple score others like longarmed crooklegged orcs red eye painted shields ugl�k stepped forward meet 'so come back' said 'thought better eh'
 'i've returned see orders carried prisoners safe' answered grishn�kh
 'indeed' said ugl�k 'waste effort i'll see orders carried command else come back went hurry leave anything behind'
 'i left fool' snarled grishn�kh 'but stout fellows good lose knew lead mess i've come help them'
 'splendid' laughed ugl�k 'but unless got guts fighting taken wrong way lugb�rz road whiteskins coming what's happened precious nazg�l another mount shot brought along might usefulif nazg�l make out'
 '_nazg�l nazg�l_' said grishn�kh shivering licking lips word foul taste savoured painfully 'you speak deep beyond reach muddy dreams ugl�k' said '_nazg�l_ah make one day wish said ape' snarled fiercely 'you ought know they're apple great eye winged nazg�l yet yet let show across great river yet soon they're warand purposes'
 'you seem know lot' said ugl�k 'more good guess perhaps lugb�rz might wonder meantime urukhai isengard dirty work usual stand slavering get rabble together swine legging forest better follow get back great river alive right mark i'll heels'

 isengarders seized merry pippin slung backs troop started hour hour ran pausing sling hobbits fresh carriers either quicker hardier plan grishn�kh's isengarders gradually passed orcs mordor grishn�kh's folk closed behind soon gaining also northerners ahead forest began draw nearer
 pippin bruised torn aching head grated filthy jowl hairy ear orc held immediately front bowed backs tough thick legs going unresting made wire horn beating nightmare seconds endless time
 afternoon ugl�k's troop overtook northerners flagging rays bright sun winter sun shining pale cool sky though heads tongues lolling
 'maggots' jeered isengarders 'you're cooked whiteskins catch eat they're coming'
 cry grishn�kh showed mere jest horsemen riding swiftly indeed sighted still far behind gaining orcs gaining like tide flats folk straying quicksand
 isengarders began run redoubled pace astonished pippin terrific spurt seemed end race saw sun sinking falling behind misty mountains shadows reached land soldiers mordor lifted heads also began put speed forest dark close already passed outlying trees land beginning slope upwards ever steeply orcs halt ugl�k grishn�kh shouted spurring last effort

 'they make yet escape' thought pippin managed twist neck glance back one eye shoulder saw riders away eastward already level orcs galloping plain sunset gilded spears helmets glinted pale flowing hair hemming orcs preventing scattering driving along line river
 wondered much kind folk wished learned rivendell looked maps things days plans journey seemed competent hands never reckoned cut gandalf strider even frodo could remember rohan gandalf's horse shadowfax come land sounded hopeful far went
 'but know orcs' thought 'i suppose they've ever heard hobbits suppose ought glad beastly orcs look like destroyed would rather saved myself' chances merry would killed together captors ever men rohan aware
 riders appeared bowmen skilled shooting running horse riding swiftly range shot arrows orcs straggled behind several fell riders wheeled away range answering bows enemies shot wildly daring halt happened many times one occasion arrows fell among isengarders one front pippin stumbled get

 night came without riders closing battle many orcs fallen fully two hundred remained early darkness orcs came hillock eaves forest near probably three furlongs away could go horsemen encircled small band disobeyed ugl�k's command ran towards forest three returned
 'well are' sneered grishn�kh 'fine leadership hope great ugl�k lead us again'
 'put halflings down' ordered ugl�k taking notice grishn�kh 'you lugdush get two others stand guard they're killed unless filthy whiteskins break understand long i'm alive want 'em they're cry they're rescued bind legs'
 last part order carried mercilessly pippin found first time close merry orcs making great deal noise shouting clashing weapons hobbits managed whisper together
 'i think much this' said merry 'i feel nearly done think could crawl away far even free'
 '_lembas_' whispered pippin '_lembas_ i've got think they've taken anything swords'
 'yes packet pocket' answered merry 'but must battered crumbs anyway can't put mouth pocket'
 'you i've' savage kick warned pippin noise died guards watchful

 night cold still round knoll orcs gathered little watchfires sprang goldenred darkness complete ring within long bowshot riders show light orcs wasted many arrows shooting fires ugl�k stopped riders made sound later night moon came mist occasionally could seen shadowy shapes glinted white light moved ceaseless patrol
 'they'll wait sun curse them' growled one guards 'why get together charge what's old ugl�k think he's like know'
 'i daresay would' snarled ugl�k stepping behind 'meaning think eh curse bad rabble maggots apes lugb�rz good trying charge they'd squeal bolt enough filthy horseboys mop lot flat
 'there's one thing maggots see like gimlets dark whiteskins better nighteyes men i've heard forget horses see nightbreeze said still there's one thing fine fellows know mauh�r lads forest turn time now'
 ugl�k's words enough apparently satisfy isengarders orcs dispirited rebellious posted watchers lay ground resting pleasant darkness indeed become dark moon passed westward thick cloud pippin could see anything feet away fires brought light hillock riders however content merely wait dawn let enemies rest sudden outcry east side knoll showed something wrong seemed men ridden close slipped horses crawled edge camp killed several orcs faded away ugl�k dashed stop stampede
 pippin merry sat guards isengarders gone ugl�k hobbits thought escape soon dashed long hairy arm took neck drew close together dimly aware grishn�kh's great head hideous face foul breath cheeks began paw feel pippin shuddered hard cold fingers groped back
 'well little ones' said grishn�kh soft whisper 'enjoying nice rest little awkwardly placed perhaps swords whips one side nasty spears little people meddle _in affairs big them' fingers continued grope light like pale hot fire behind eyes
 thought came suddenly pippin's mind caught direct urgent thought enemy 'grishn�kh knows ring he's looking ugl�k busy probably wants himself' cold fear pippin's heart yet time wondering use could make grishn�kh's desire
 'i think find way' whispered 'it easy find'
 '_find it_' said grishn�kh fingers stopped crawling gripped pippin's shoulder 'find talking little one' moment pippin silent suddenly darkness made noise throat _gollum gollum_ 'nothing precious' added
 hobbits felt grishn�kh's fingers twitch 'o ho' hissed goblin softly 'that's means ho dangerous little ones'
 'perhaps' said merry alert aware pippin's guess 'perhaps us still know business best want would give it'
 'do want want it' said grishn�kh puzzled arms trembling 'what would give mean'
 'we mean' said pippin choosing words carefully 'that good groping dark could save time trouble must untie legs first we'll nothing say nothing'
 'my dear tender little fools' hissed grishn�kh 'everything everything know got due time everything wish could tell satisfy questioner indeed quite soon hurry enquiry oh dear think kept alive dear little fellows please believe say kindness that's even one ugl�k's faults'
 'i find quite easy believe' said merry 'but got prey home yet seem going way whatever happens come isengard great grishn�kh benefits saruman take find want anything now's time deal'
 grishn�kh began lose temper name saruman seemed specially enrage time passing disturbance dying ugl�k isengarders might return minute
 'have got � either you' snarled
 '_gollum gollum_' said pippin
 'untie legs' said merry
 felt orc's arms trembling violently 'curse filthy little vermin' hissed 'untie legs i'll untie every string bodies think can't search bones search i'll cut quivering shreds need help legs get awayand myself'
 suddenly seized strength long arms shoulders terrifying tucked one armpit crushed fiercely sides great stifling hand clapped mouths sprang forward stooping low quickly silently went came edge knoll choosing gap watchers passed like evil shadow night slope away westward towards river flowed forest direction wide open space one fire
 going dozen yards halted peering listening nothing could seen heard crept slowly bent almost double squatted listened stood risk sudden dash moment dark form rider loomed right front horse snorted reared man called
 grishn�kh flung ground flat dragging hobbits drew sword doubt meant kill captives rather allow escape rescued undoing sword rang faintly glinted little light fire away left arrow came whistling gloom aimed skill guided fate pierced right hand dropped sword shrieked quick beat hoofs even grishn�kh leaped ran ridden spear passed gave hideous shivering cry lay still
 hobbits remained flat ground grishn�kh left another horseman came riding swiftly comrade's aid whether special keenness sight sense horse lifted sprang lightly rider see lying covered elvencloaks crushed moment afraid move

 last merry stirred whispered softly 'so far good _we_ avoid spitted'
 answer came almost immediately cries grishn�kh roused orcs yells screeches came knoll hobbits guessed disappearance discovered ugl�k probably knocking heads suddenly answering cries orcvoices came right outside circle watchfires direction forest mountains mauh�r apparently arrived attacking besiegers sound galloping horses riders drawing ring close round knoll risking orcarrows prevent sortie company rode deal newcomers suddenly merry pippin realized without moving outside circle nothing escape
 'now' said merry 'if legs hands free might get away can't touch knots can't bite them'
 'no need try' said pippin 'i going tell i've managed free hands loops left show better bit _lembas_ first'
 slipped cords wrists fished packet cakes broken good still leafwrappings hobbits ate two three pieces taste brought back memory fair faces laughter wholesome food quiet days far away ate thoughtfully sitting dark heedless cries sounds battle nearby pippin first come back present
 'we must off' said 'half moment' grishn�kh's sword lying close hand heavy clumsy use crawled forward finding body goblin drew sheath long sharp knife quickly cut bonds
 'now it' said 'when we've warmed bit perhaps shall able stand walk case better start crawling'
 crawled turf deep yielding helped seemed long slow business gave watchfire wide berth wormed way forward bit bit came edge river gurgling away black shadows deep banks looked back
 sounds died away evidently mauh�r 'lads' killed driven riders returned silent ominous vigil would last much longer already night old east remained unclouded sky beginning grow pale
 'we must get cover' said pippin 'or shall seen comfort us riders discover orcs dead' got stamped feet 'those cords cut like wires feet getting warm could stagger merry'
 merry got 'yes' said 'i manage _lembas_ put heart wholesome sort feeling heat orcdraught wonder made better know expect let's get drink water wash away thought it'
 'not banks steep' said pippin 'forward now'
 turned walked side side slowly along line river behind light grew east walked compared notes talking lightly hobbitfashion things happened since capture listener would guessed words suffered cruelly dire peril going without hope towards torment death even knew well little chance ever finding friend safety
 'you seem well master took' said merry 'you get almost chapter old bilbo's book ever get chance report good work especially guessing hairy villain's little game playing wonder anyone ever pick trail find brooch hate lose mine afraid gone good
 'i shall brush toes get level indeed cousin brandybuck going front comes suppose much notion spent time rivendell rather better walking west along entwash buttend misty mountains front fangorn forest'
 even spoke dark edge forest loomed straight night seemed taken refuge great trees creeping away coming dawn
 'lead master brandybuck' said pippin 'or lead back warned fangorn one knowing forgotten that'
 'i not' answered merry 'but forest seems better turning back middle battle'

 led way huge branches trees old beyond guessing seemed great trailing beards lichen hung blowing swaying breeze shadows hobbits peeped gazing back slope little furtive figures dim light looked like elfchildren deeps time peering wild wood wonder first dawn
 far great river brown lands leagues upon grey leagues away dawn came red flame loud rang huntinghorns greet riders rohan sprang suddenly life horn answered horn

 meanwhile hobbits went much speed dark tangled forest allowed following line running stream westward towards slopes mountains deeper deeper fangorn slowly fear orcs died away pace slackened queer stifling feeling came air thin scanty breathing
 last merry halted 'we can't go like this' panted 'i want air'
 'let's drink rate' said pippin 'i'm parched' clambered great treeroot wound stream stooping drew water cupped hands clear cold took many draughts merry followed water refreshed seemed cheer hearts sat together brink stream dabbling sore feet legs peering round trees stood silently rank upon rank faded away grey twilight every direction

 'but sun rate must peep sometimes' said merry 'it look feel like bilbo's description mirkwood dark black home dark black things dim frightfully treeish can't imagine _animals_ living staying long'
 'no hobbits' said pippin 'and like thought trying get either nothing eat hundred miles guess supplies'
 'low' said merry 'we ran nothing couple spare packets _lembas_ left everything else behind' looked remained elvencakes broken fragments five meagre days 'and wrap blanket' said merry 'we shall cold tonight whichever way go'
 'well we'd better decide way now' said pippin 'the morning must getting on'
 became aware yellow light appeared way wood shafts sunlight seemed suddenly pierced forestroof
 'hullo' said merry 'the sun must run cloud we've trees run else climbed high enough look opening far � let's go investigate'
 found thought ground rising steeply still becoming increasingly stony light grew broader went soon saw rockwall side hill abrupt end long root thrust distant mountains trees grew sun falling full stony face twigs trees foot stretched stiff still reaching warmth looked shabby grey wood gleamed rich browns smooth blackgreys bark like polished leather boles trees glowed soft green like young grass early spring fleeting vision
 face stony wall something like stair natural perhaps made weathering splitting rock rough uneven high almost level tops foresttrees shelf cliff nothing grew grasses weeds edge one old stump tree two bent branches left looked almost like figure gnarled old man standing blinking morninglight
 'up go' said merry joyfully 'now breath air sight land'
 climbed scrambled rock stair made bigger feet longer legs eager surprised remarkable way cuts sores captivity healed vigour returned came length edge shelf almost feet old stump sprang turned round backs hill breathing deep looking eastward saw come three four miles forest heads trees marched slopes towards plain near fringe forest tall spires curling black smoke went wavering floating towards
 'the wind's changing' said merry 'it's turned east feels cool here'
 'yes' said pippin 'i'm afraid passing gleam go grey pity shaggy old forest looked different sunlight almost felt liked place'
 'almost felt liked forest that's good that's uncommonly kind you' said strange voice 'turn round let look faces almost feel dislike let us hasty turn round' large knobknuckled hand laid shoulders twisted round gently irresistibly two great arms lifted

 '_hrum hoom_' murmured voice deep voice like deep woodwind instrument 'very odd indeed hasty motto seen heard voices � liked nice little voices reminded something cannot remember � seen heard trodden taking little orcs found mistake afterwards odd indeed root twig odd'
 pippin though still amazed longer felt afraid eyes felt curious suspense fear 'please' said 'who you'
 queer look came old eyes kind wariness deep wells covered '_hrum_ now' answered voice 'well ent that's call yes ent word _the_ ent might say manner speaking _fangorn_ name according _treebeard_ others make _treebeard_ do'

 hobbits silent time felt oddly enough safe comfortable great deal think wonder last pippin ventured speak
 'please treebeard' said 'could ask something celeborn warn us forest told us risk getting entangled it'

 treebeard strode slope hardly slackening pace suddenly hobbits saw wide opening two great trees stood one either side like living gateposts gate save crossing interwoven boughs old ent approached trees lifted branches leaves quivered rustled evergreen trees leaves dark polished gleamed twilight beyond wide level space though floor great hall cut side hill either hand walls sloped upwards fifty feet high along wall stood aisle trees also increased height marched inwards

 right side bay great bed low legs couple feet high covered deep dried grass bracken treebeard lowered slowly slightest sign bending middle lay full length arms behind head looking ceiling upon lights flickering like play leaves sunshine merry pippin sat beside pillows grass
 'now tell tale hurry' said treebeard
 hobbits began tell story adventures ever since left hobbiton followed clear order interrupted one another continually treebeard often stopped speaker went back earlier point jumped forward asking questions later events said nothing whatever ring tell set going ask reasons

 treebeard however especially interested everything concerned gandalf interested saruman's doings hobbits regretted much knew little rather vague report sam gandalf told council clear rate ugl�k troop came isengard spoke saruman master

 next day spent also company go far 'house' time sat silent shelter bank wind colder clouds closer greyer little sunshine distance voices ents moot still rose fell sometimes loud strong sometimes low sad sometimes quickening sometimes slow solemn dirge second night came still ents held conclave hurrying clouds fitful stars

 'maybe' said elf 'but heavy boot might leave print grass deep springy'
 'that would baffle ranger' said gimli 'a bent blade enough aragorn read expect find traces evil phantom saruman saw last night sure even light morning eyes looking us fangorn even maybe'
 'it likely enough' said aragorn 'yet sure thinking horses said last night gimli scared away think hear legolas sound like beasts terror'
 'no' said legolas 'i heard clearly darkness fear guessed beasts wild sudden gladness spoke horses meet friend long missed'
 'so thought' said aragorn 'but cannot read riddle unless return come light growing fast let us look first guess later begin near campingground searching carefully working slope towards forest find hobbits errand whatever may think visitor night escaped chance must hidden trees would seen find nothing eaves wood make last search upon battlefield among ashes little hope horsemen rohan work well'

 time companions crawled groped upon ground tree stood mournfully dry leaves hanging limp rattling chill easterly wind aragorn moved slowly away came ashes watchfire near riverbank began retrace ground back towards knoll battle fought suddenly stooped bent low face almost grass called others came running
 'here last find news' said aragorn lifted broken leaf see large pale leaf golden hue fading turning brown 'here mallornleaf l�rien small crumbs crumbs grass see pieces cut cord lying nearby'
 'and knife cut them' said gimli stooped drew tussock heavy foot trampled short jagged blade haft snapped beside 'it orcweapon' said holding gingerly looking disgust carved handle shaped like hideous head squinting eyes leering mouth
 'well strangest riddle yet found' exclaimed legolas 'a bound prisoner escapes orcs surrounding horsemen stops still open cuts bonds orcknife legs tied walk arms tied use knife neither tied cut cords pleased skill sat quietly ate waybread least enough show hobbit without mallornleaf suppose turned arms wings flew away singing trees easy find need wings ourselves'
 'there sorcery right enough' said gimli 'what old man say aragorn reading legolas better it'
 'maybe could' said aragorn smiling 'there signs near hand considered agree prisoner hobbit must either legs hands free came guess hands riddle becomes easier also read marks _carried_ point orc blood spilled paces away orcblood deep prints hoofs spot signs heavy thing dragged away orc slain horsemen later body hauled fire hobbit seen "in open" night still elvencloak exhausted hungry wondered cut bonds knife fallen enemy rested ate little crept away comfort know _lembas_ pocket even though ran away without gear pack perhaps like hobbit say _he_ though hope guess merry pippin together however nothing show certain'
 'and suppose either friends came hand free' asked gimli
 'i know happened' answered aragorn 'nor know orc carrying away help escape may sure nay rather think begin understand matter puzzled beginning boromir fallen orcs content capture merry pippin seek rest us attack camp instead went speed towards isengard suppose captured ringbearer faithful comrade think masters would dare give plain orders orcs even knew much would speak openly ring trusty servants think orcs commanded capture _hobbits_ alive costs attempt made slip precious prisoners battle treachery perhaps likely enough folk large bold orc may trying escape prize alone ends tale others might devised may count case one least friends escaped task find help return rohan must daunted fangorn since need drove dark place'
 'i know daunts fangorn thought long road rohan foot' said gimli
 'then let us go forest' said aragorn

 long aragorn found fresh signs one point near bank entwash came upon footprints hobbitprints light much made beneath bole great tree edge wood prints discovered earth bare dry reveal much
 'one hobbit least stood looked back turned away forest' said aragorn
 'then must go too' said gimli 'but like look fangorn warned wish chase led anywhere else'
 'i think wood feels evil whatever tales may say' said legolas stood eaves forest stooping forward listening peering wide eyes shadows 'no evil evil far away catch faintest echoes dark places hearts trees black malice near us watchfulness anger'
 'well cause angry me' said gimli 'i done harm '
 'that well' said legolas 'but nonetheless suffered harm something happening inside going happen feel tenseness takes breath'
 'i feel air stuffy' said dwarf 'this wood lighter mirkwood musty shabby'
 'it old old' said elf 'so old almost feel young felt since journeyed children old full memory could happy come days peace'
 'i dare say could' snorted gimli 'you woodelf anyway though elves kind strange folk yet comfort go go keep bow ready hand keep axe loose belt use trees' added hastily looking tree stood 'i wish meet old man unawares without argument ready hand let us go'

 three hunters plunged forest fangorn legolas gimli left tracking aragorn little see floor forest dry covered drift leaves guessing fugitives would stay near water returned often banks stream came upon place merry pippin drunk bathed feet plain see footprints two hobbits one somewhat smaller
 'this good tidings' said aragorn 'yet marks two days old seems point hobbits left waterside'
 'then shall now' said gimli 'we cannot pursue whole fastness fangorn come ill supplied find soon shall use except sit beside show friendship starving together'
 'if indeed must that' said aragorn 'let us go on'
 came length steep abrupt end treebeard's hill looked rockwall rough steps leading high shelf gleams sun striking hurrying clouds forest looked less grey drear
 'let us go look us' said legolas 'i feel breath short like taste freer air while'
 companions climbed aragorn came last moving slowly scanning steps ledges closely
 'i almost sure hobbits here' said 'but marks strange marks understand wonder see anything ledge help us guess way went next'
 stood looked saw nothing use shelf faced southward eastward east view open could see heads trees descending ranks towards plain come
 'we journeyed long way round' said legolas 'we could come safe together left great river second third day struck west foresee whither road lead till come end'
 'but wish come fangorn' said gimli
 'yet areand nicely caught net' said legolas 'look'
 'look what' said gimli
 'there trees'
 'where elfeyes'
 'hush speak softly look' said legolas pointing 'down wood back way come cannot see passing tree tree'
 'i see see now' hissed gimli 'look aragorn warn old man dirty grey rags could see first'
 aragorn looked beheld bent figure moving slowly far away looked like old beggarman walking wearily leaning rough staff head bowed look towards lands would greeted kind words stood silent feeling strange expectancy something approaching held hidden poweror menace
 gimli gazed wide eyes step step figure drew nearer suddenly unable contain longer burst 'your bow legolas bend get ready saruman let speak put spell upon us shoot first'
 legolas took bow bent slowly resisted held arrow loosely hand fit string aragorn stood silent face watchful intent
 'why waiting matter you' said gimli hissing whisper
 'legolas right' said aragorn quietly 'we may shoot old man unawares unchallenged whatever fear doubt us watch wait'

 moment old man quickened pace came surprising speed foot rockwall suddenly looked stood motionless looking sound
 could see face hooded hood wore widebrimmed hat features overshadowed except end nose grey beard yet seemed aragorn caught gleam eyes keen bright within shadow hooded brows
 last old man broke silence 'well met indeed friends' said soft voice 'i wish speak come shall come up' without waiting answer began climb
 'now' said gimli 'stop legolas'
 'did say wished speak you' said old man 'put away bow master elf'
 bow arrow fell legolas' hands arms hung loose sides
 'and master dwarf pray take hand axehaft till need arguments'
 gimli started stood still stone staring old man sprang rough steps nimbly goat weariness seemed left stepped shelf gleam brief certainty quick glint white garment shrouded grey rags instant revealed intake gimli's breath could heard loud hiss silence

 'well met say again' said old man coming towards feet away stood stooping staff head thrust forward peering hood 'and may parts elf man dwarf clad elvish fashion doubt tale worth hearing behind things often seen here'
 'you speak one knows fangorn well' said aragorn 'is so'
 'not well' said old man 'that would study many lives come again'
 'might know name hear say us' said aragorn 'the morning passes errand wait'
 'as wished say said may tale tell name' broke laughing long softly aragorn felt shudder run sound strange cold thrill yet fear terror felt rather like sudden bite keen air slap cold rain wakes uneasy sleeper
 'my name' said old man 'have guessed already heard think yes heard come tale'
 three companions stood silent made answer
 'there would begin doubt whether errand fit tell' said old man 'happily know something tracking footsteps two young hobbits believe yes hobbits stare never heard strange name well climbed day yesterday met someone expect comfort would like know taken well well maybe give news standing errand see longer urgent thought let us sit ease'
 old man turned away went towards heap fallen stones rock foot cliff behind immediately spell removed others relaxed stirred gimli's hand went axehaft aragorn drew sword legolas picked bow
 old man took notice stooped sat low flat stone grey cloak drew apart saw beyond doubt clothed beneath white
 'saruman' cried gimli springing towards axe hand 'speak tell us hidden friends done speak make dint hat even wizard find hard deal with'

 old man quick sprang feet leaped top large rock stood grown suddenly tall towering hood grey rags flung away white garments shone lifted staff gimli's axe leaped grasp fell ringing ground sword aragorn stiff motionless hand blazed sudden fire legolas gave great shout shot arrow high air vanished flash flame
 'mithrandir' cried 'mithrandir'
 'well met say legolas' said old man
 gazed hair white snow sunshine gleaming white robe eyes deep brows bright piercing rays sun power hand wonder joy fear stood found words say
 last aragorn stirred 'gandalf' said 'beyond hope return us need veil sight gandalf' gimli said nothing hut sank knees shading eyes
 'gandalf' old man repeated recalling old memory long disused word 'yes name gandalf'
 stepped rock picking grey cloak wrapped seemed sun shining hid cloud 'yes may still call gandalf' said voice voice old friend guide 'get good gimli blame harm done indeed friends none weapon could hurt merry meet turn tide great storm coming tide turned'
 laid hand gimli's head dwarf looked laughed suddenly 'gandalf' said 'but white'
 'yes white now' said gandalf 'indeed _am_ saruman one might almost say saruman come tell passed fire deep water since parted forgotten much thought knew learned much forgotten see many things far many things close hand cannot see tell yourselves'

 'what wish know' said aragorn 'all happened since parted bridge would long tale first give us news hobbits find safe'
 'no find them' said gandalf 'there darkness valleys emyn muil know captivity eagle told me'
 'the eagle' said legolas 'i seen eagle high far last time three days ago emyn muil'
 'yes' said gandalf 'that gwaihir windlord rescued orthanc sent watch river gather tidings sight keen cannot see passes hill tree things seen others seen ring passed beyond help help company set rivendell nearly revealed enemy escaped part sat high place strove dark tower shadow passed weary weary walked long dark thought'
 'then know frodo' said gimli 'how things go him'
 'i cannot say saved great peril many lie still resolved go alone mordor set say'
 'not alone' said legolas 'we think sam went him'
 'did he' said gandalf gleam eye smile face 'did indeed news yet surprise good good lighten heart must tell sit tell tale journey'
 companions sat ground feet aragorn took tale long gandalf said nothing asked questions hands spread upon knees eyes closed last aragorn spoke death boromir last journey upon great river old man sighed
 'you said know guess aragorn friend' said quietly 'poor boromir could see happened sore trial man warrior lord men galadriel told peril escaped end glad vain young hobbits came us boromir's sake part play brought fangorn coming like falling small stones starts avalanche mountains even talk hear first rumblings saruman best caught away home dam bursts'
 'in one thing changed dear friend' said aragorn 'you still speak riddles'
 'what riddles' said gandalf 'no talking aloud habit old choose wisest person present speak long explanations needed young wearying' laughed sound seemed warm kindly gleam sunshine
 'i longer young even reckoning men ancient houses' said aragorn 'will open mind clearly me'
 'what shall say' said gandalf paused thought 'this brief see things moment wish piece mind plain possible enemy course long known ring abroad borne hobbit knows number company set rivendell kind us yet perceive purpose clearly supposes going minas tirith would done place according wisdom would heavy stroke power indeed great fear knowing mighty one may suddenly appear wielding ring assailing war seeking cast take place wish cast one place thought occurs mind try destroy ring yet entered darkest dream doubt see good fortune hope imagining war let loose war believing time waste strikes first blow strikes hard enough may need strike forces long preparing setting motion sooner intended wise fool used power guard mordor none could enter bent guild hunting ring indeed hope would faded neither ring bearer could long eluded eye gazes abroad rather near home mostly looks towards minas tirith soon strength fall upon like storm
 'for already knows messengers sent waylay company failed found ring neither brought away hobbits hostages done even much would heavy blow us might fatal let us darken hearts imagining trial gentle loyalty dark tower enemy failedso far thanks saruman'
 'then saruman traitor' said gimli
 'indeed yes' said gandalf 'doubly strange nothing endured late seemed grievous treason isengard even reckoned lord captain saruman grown strong threatens men rohan draws help minas tirith even main blow approaching east yet treacherous weapon ever danger hand saruman also mind capture ring least snare hobbits evil purposes enemies contrived bring merry pippin marvellous speed nick time fangorn otherwise would never come
 'also filled new doubts disturb plans tidings battle come mordor thanks horsemen rohan dark lord knows two hobbits taken emyn muil borne away towards isengard servants isengard fear well minas tirith minas tirith falls go ill saruman'
 'it pity friends lie between' said gimli 'if land divided isengard mordor could fight watched waited'
 'the victor would emerge stronger either free doubt' said gandalf 'but isengard cannot fight mordor unless saruman first obtains ring never yet know peril much know eager lay hands prey could wait home came forth meet spy messengers came late battle beyond help reached parts remain long look mind see doubt woodcraft believes horsemen slew burned upon field battle know whether orcs bringing prisoners know quarrel servants orcs mordor know winged messenger'
 'the winged messenger' cried legolas 'i shot bow galadriel sarn gebir felled sky filled us fear new terror this'
 'one cannot slay arrows' said gandalf 'you slew steed good deed rider soon horsed nazg�l one nine ride upon winged steeds soon terror overshadow last armies friends cutting sun yet allowed cross river saruman know new shape ringwraiths clad thought ever ring present battle found th�oden lord mark come learn power danger sees fled back isengard double treble assault rohan time another danger close hand see busy fiery thoughts forgotten treebeard'
 'now speak again' said aragorn smile 'treebeard known guessed part saruman's double treachery yet see way coming two hobbits fangorn served save give us long fruitless chase'
 'wait minute' cried gimli 'there another thing like know first gandalf saruman saw last night'
 'you certainly see me' answered gandalf 'therefore must guess saw saruman evidently look much alike desire make incurable dent hat must excused'
 'good good' said gimli 'i glad you'
 gandalf laughed 'yes good dwarf' said 'it comfort mistaken points know well course never blamed welcome could often counselled friends suspect even hands dealing enemy bless gimli son gl�in maybe see us together one day judge us'
 'but hobbits' legolas broke 'we come far seek seem know now'
 'with treebeard ents' said gandalf
 'the ents' exclaimed aragorn 'then truth old legends dwellers deep forests giant shepherds trees still ents world thought memory ancient days indeed ever legend rohan'
 'a legend rohan' cried legolas 'nay every elf wilderland sung songs old onodrim long sorrow yet even among us memory meet one still walking world indeed feel young treebeard rendering fangorn common speech yet seem speak person treebeard'
 'ah asking much' said gandalf 'the little know long slow story would make tale time treebeard fangorn guardian forest oldest ents oldest living thing still walks beneath sun upon middleearth hope indeed legolas may yet meet merry pippin fortunate met even sit came two days ago bore away dwelling far roots mountains often comes especially mind uneasy rumours world outside trouble saw four days ago striding among trees think saw paused speak heavy thought weary struggle eye mordor speak either call name'
 'perhaps also thought saruman' said gimli 'but speak friend thought fangorn dangerous'
 'dangerous' cried gandalf 'and dangerous dangerous anything ever meet unless brought alive seat dark lord aragorn dangerous legolas dangerous beset dangers gimli son gl�in dangerous fashion certainly forest fangorn perilousnot least ready axes fangorn perilous yet wise kindly nonetheless long slow wrath brimming forest filled coming hobbits tidings brought spilled soon running like flood tide turned saruman axes isengard thing happen happened since elder days ents going wake find strong'
 'what do' asked legolas astonishment
 'i know' said gandalf 'i think know wonder' fell silent head bowed thought

 others looked gleam sun fleeting clouds fell hands lay upturned lap seemed filled light cup water last looked gazed straight sun
 'the morning wearing away' said 'soon must go'
 'do go find friends see treebeard' asked aragorn
 'no' said gandalf 'that road must take spoken words hope hope hope victory war upon us friends war use ring could give us surety victory fills great sorrow great fear much shall destroyed may lost gandalf gandalf white black mightier still'
 rose gazed eastward shading eyes saw things far away none could see shook head 'no' said soft voice 'it gone beyond reach least let us glad longer tempted use ring must go face peril near despair yet deadly peril removed'

 'then see merry young hobbits again' said legolas
 'i say so' said gandalf 'who knows patience go must go hope edoras go thither also'
 'it long way man walk young old' said aragorn 'i fear battle long ere come there'
 'we shall see shall see' said gandalf 'will come me'
 'yes set together' said aragorn 'but doubt come wish' rose looked long gandalf others gazed silence stood facing one another grey figure man aragorn son arathorn tall stern stone hand upon hilt sword looked king mists sea stepped upon shores lesser men stooped old figure white shining light kindled within bent laden years holding power beyond strength kings
 'do say truly gandalf' said aragorn last 'that could go whithersoever wished quicker also say captain banner dark lord nine one mightier white rider passed fire abyss shall fear go leads'

 'yes together follow you' said legolas 'but first would ease heart gandalf hear befell moria tell us stay even tell friends delivered'
 'i stayed already long' answered gandalf 'time short year spend would tell all'
 'then tell us time allows' said gimli 'come gandalf tell us fared balrog'
 'name not' said gandalf moment seemed cloud pain passed face sat silent looking old death 'long time fell' said last slowly thinking back difficulty 'long fell fell fire burned plunged deep water dark cold tide death almost froze heart'
 'deep abyss spanned durin's bridge none measured it' said gimli
 'yet bottom beyond light knowledge' said gandalf 'thither came last uttermost foundations stone still fire quenched thing slime stronger strangling snake
 'we fought far living earth time counted ever clutched ever hewed till last fled dark tunnels made durin's folk gimli son gl�in far far deepest delving dwarves world gnawed nameless things even sauron knows older walked bring report darken light day despair enemy hope pursued clutching heel thus brought back last secret ways khazadd�m well knew ever went came endless stair'
 'long lost' said gimli 'many said never made save legend others say destroyed'
 'it made destroyed' said gandalf 'from lowest dungeon highest peak climbed ascending unbroken spiral many thousand steps issued last durin's tower carved living rock zirakzigil pinnacle silvertine
 'there upon celebdil lonely window snow lay narrow space dizzy eyrie mists world sun shone fiercely wrapped cloud sprang even came behind burst new flame none see perhaps ages songs would still sung battle peak' suddenly gandalf laughed 'but would say song looked afar thought mountain crowned storm thunder heard lightning said smote upon celebdil leaped back broken tongues fire enough great smoke rose us vapour steam ice fell like rain threw enemy fell high place broke mountainside smote ruin darkness took strayed thought time wandered far roads tell

 ' 'ever fated burden friend need' said
 ' 'a burden been' answered 'but light swan's feather claw sun shines indeed think need let fall would float upon wind'
 ' 'do let fall' gasped felt life 'bear lothl�rien'
 ' 'that indeed command lady galadriel sent look you' answered
 'thus came caras galadhon found lately gone tarried ageless time land days bring healing decay healing found clothed white counsel gave counsel took thence strange roads came messages bring aragorn bidden say

 grey company ride north
 dark path appointed thee
 dead watch road leads sea

 legolas sent word

 legolas greenleaf long tree
 joy thou hast lived beware sea
 thou hearest cry gull shore
 thy heart shall rest forest more'

 gandalf fell silent shut eyes
 'then sent message' said gimli bent head
 'dark words' said legolas 'and little mean receive them'
 'that comfort' said gimli
 'what then' said legolas 'would speak openly death'
 'yes nought else say'
 'what that' said gandalf opening eyes 'yes think guess words may mean pardon gimli pondering messages indeed sent words neither dark sad
 ' "to gimli son gl�in" said "give lady's greeting lockbearer wherever thou goest thought goes thee care lay thine axe right tree" '
 'in happy hour returned us gandalf' cried dwarf capering sang loudly strange dwarftongue 'come come' shouted swinging axe 'since gandalf's head sacred let us find one right cleave'
 'that far seek' said gandalf rising seat 'come spent time allowed meeting parted friends need haste'

 wrapped old tattered cloak led way following descended quickly high shelf made way back forest bank entwash spoke words stood upon grass beyond eaves fangorn sign horses seen
 'they returned' said legolas 'it weary walk'
 'i shall walk time presses' said gandalf lifting head gave long whistle clear piercing note others stood amazed hear sound come old bearded lips three times whistled faint far seemed heard whinny horse borne plains upon eastern wind waited wondering long came sound hoofs first hardly tremor ground perceptible aragorn lay upon grass growing steadily louder clearer quick beat
 'there one horse coming' said aragorn
 'certainly' said gandalf 'we great burden one'
 'there three' said legolas gazing plain 'see run hasufel friend arod beside another strides ahead great horse seen like before'
 'nor again' said gandalf 'that shadowfax chief _mearas_ lords horses even th�oden king rohan ever looked better shine like silver run smoothly swift stream come horse white rider going battle together'
 even old wizard spoke great horse came striding slope towards coat glistening mane flowing wind speed two others followed far behind soon shadowfax saw gandalf checked pace whinnied loudly trotting gently forward stooped proud head nuzzled great nostrils old man's neck
 gandalf caressed 'it long way rivendell friend' said 'but wise swift come need far let us ride together part world again'
 soon horses came stood quietly awaiting orders 'we go meduseld hall master th�oden' said gandalf addressing gravely bowed heads 'time presses leave friends ride beg use speed hasufel shall bear aragorn arod legolas set gimli leave shadowfax shall bear us wait drink little'
 'now understand part last night's riddle' said legolas sprang lightly upon arod's back 'whether fled first fear horses met shadowfax chieftain greeted joy know hand gandalf'
 'yes knew' said wizard 'i bent thought upon bidding make haste yesterday far away south land swiftly may bear back again'

 gandalf spoke shadowfax horse set good pace yet beyond measure others little turned suddenly choosing place banks lower waded river led away due south flat land treeless wide wind went like grey waves endless miles grass sign road track shadowfax stay falter
 'he steering straight course halls th�oden slopes white mountains' said gandalf 'it quicker ground firmer eastemnet chief northward track lies across river shadowfax knows way every fen hollow'
 many hours rode meads riverlands often grass high reached knees riders steeds seemed swimming greygreen sea came upon many hidden pools broad acres sedge waving wet treacherous bogs shadowfax found way horses followed swath slowly sun fell sky west looking great plain far away riders saw moment like red fire sinking grass low upon edge sight shoulders mountains glinted red upon either side smoke seemed rise darken sun's disc hue blood kindled grass passed rim earth
 'there lies gap rohan' said gandalf 'it almost due west us way lies isengard'
 'i see great smoke' said legolas 'what may be'
 'battle war' said gandalf 'ride on'


 _chapter 6_
 king golden hall

 rode sunset slow dusk gathering night last halted dismounted even aragorn stiff weary gandalf allowed hours' rest legolas gimli slept aragorn lay flat stretched upon back gandalf stood leaning staff gazing darkness east west silent sign sound living thing night barred long clouds fleeting chill wind arose cold moon went swift light day
 hours passed still rode gimli nodded would fallen seat gandalf clutched shaken hasufel arod weary proud followed tireless leader grey shadow hardly seen miles went waxing moon sank cloudy west

 bitter chill came air slowly east dark faded cold grey red shafts light leapt black walls emyn muil far away upon left dawn came clear bright wind swept across path rushing bent grasses suddenly shadowfax stood still neighed gandalf pointed ahead
 'look' cried lifted tired eyes stood mountains south whitetipped streaked black grasslands rolled hills clustered feet flowed many valleys still dim dark untouched light dawn winding way heart great mountains immediately travellers widest glens opened like long gulf among hills far inward glimpsed tumbled mountainmass one tall peak mouth vale stood like sentinel lonely height feet flowed thread silver stream issued dale upon brow caught still far away glint rising sun glimmer gold 'speak legolas' said gandalf 'tell us see us'
 legolas gazed ahead shading eyes level shafts newrisen sun 'i see white stream comes snows' said 'where issues shadow vale green hill rises upon east dike mighty wall thorny fence encircle within rise roofs houses midst set upon green terrace stands aloft great hall men seems eyes thatched gold light shines far land golden posts doors men bright mail stand else within courts yet asleep'
 'edoras courts called' said gandalf 'and meduseld golden hall dwells th�oden son thengel king mark rohan come rising day road lies plain see us must ride warily war abroad rohirrim horselords sleep even seem afar draw weapon speak haughty word counsel come th�oden's seat'

 morning bright clear birds singing travellers came stream ran swiftly plain beyond feet hills turned across path wide bend flowing away east feed entwash far reedchoked beds land green wet meads along grassy borders stream grew many willowtrees already southern land blushing red fingertips feeling approach spring stream ford low banks much trampled passage horses travellers passed came upon wide rutted track leading towards uplands
 foot walled hill way ran shadow many mounds high green upon western sides grass white drifted snow small flowers sprang like countless stars amid turf
 'look' said gandalf 'how fair bright eyes grass evermind called _simbelmyn�_ land men blossom seasons year grow dead men rest behold come great barrows sires th�oden sleep' 'seven mounds upon left nine upon right' said aragorn 'many long lives men since golden hall built'
 'five hundred times red leaves fallen mirkwood home since then' said legolas 'and little seem us'
 'but riders mark seems long ago' said aragorn 'that raising house memory song years lost mist time call land home speech sundered northern kin' began chant softly slow tongue unknown elf dwarf yet listened strong music
 'that guess language rohirrim' said legolas 'for like land rich rolling part else hard stern mountains cannot guess means save laden sadness mortal men'
 'it runs thus common speech' said aragorn 'as near make

 horse rider horn blowing
 helm hauberk bright hair flowing

 spring harvest tall corn growing

 days gone west behind hills shadow

 thus spoke forgotten poet long ago rohan recalling tall fair eorl young rode north wings upon feet steed felar�f father horses men still sing evening'
 words travellers passed silent mounds following winding way green shoulders hills came last wide windswept walls gates edoras
 sat many men bright mail sprang feet barred way spears 'stay strangers unknown' cried tongue riddermark demanding names errand strangers wonder eyes little friendliness looked darkly upon gandalf
 'well understand speech' answered language 'yet strangers speak common tongue custom west wish answered'
 'it th�oden king none enter gates save know tongue friends' replied one guards 'none welcome days war folk come mundburg land gondor come heedless plain thus strangely clad riding horses like horses long kept guard watched afar never seen riders strange horse proud one bear one _mearas_ unless eyes cheated spell say wizard spy saruman phantoms craft speak swift'
 'we phantoms' said aragorn 'nor eyes cheat indeed horses ride knew well asked guess seldom thief ride home stable hasufel arod �omer third marshal mark lent us two days ago bring back even promised �omer returned given warning coming'
 troubled look came guard's eyes 'of �omer naught say' answered 'if tell truth doubtless th�oden heard maybe coming wholly unlookedfor two nights ago wormtongue came us said th�oden stranger pass gates'
 'wormtongue' said gandalf looking sharply guard 'say errand wormtongue lord mark haste go send say come' eyes glinted deep brows bent gaze upon man
 'yes go' answered slowly 'but names shall report shall say old weary seem yet fell grim beneath deem'
 'well see speak' said wizard 'for gandalf returned behold bring back horse shadowfax great hand tame beside aragorn son arathorn heir kings mundburg goes also legolas elf gimli dwarf comrades go say master gates would speech permit us come hall' 'strange names give indeed report bid learn master's will' said guard 'wait little f bring answer seems good hope much dark days' went swiftly away leaving strangers watchful keeping comrades time returned 'follow me' said 'th�oden gives leave enter weapon bear staff must leave threshold doorwardens keep them'

 dark gates swung open travellers entered walking file behind guide found broad path paved hewn stones winding upward climbing short flights welllaid steps many houses built wood many dark doors passed beside way stone channel stream clear water flowed sparkling chattering length came crown hill stood high platform green terrace foot bright spring gushed stone carved likeness horse's head beneath wide basin water spilled fed falling stream green terrace went stair stone high broad either side topmost step stonehewn sea sat guards drawn swords laid upon knees golden hair braided shoulders sun blazoned upon green shields long corslets burnished bright rose taller seemed mortal men

 'there doors you' said guide 'i must return duty gate farewell may lord mark gracious you'
 turned went swiftly back road others climbed long stair eyes tall watchmen silent stood spoke word gandalf stepped upon paved terrace stairs head suddenly clear voices spoke courteous greeting tongue
 hail corners afar' said turned hilts swords towards travellers token peace green gems flashed sunlight one guards stepped forward spoke common speech
 'i doorward th�oden' said 'h�ma name must bid lay aside weapons enter'
 legolas gave hand silverhafted knife quiver bow 'keep well' said 'for come golden wood lady lothl�rien gave me'
 wonder came man's eyes laid weapons hastily wall feared handle 'no man touch promise you' said
 aragorn stood hesitating 'it will' said 'to put aside sword deliver and�ril hand man'
 'it th�oden' said h�ma
 'it clear th�oden son thengel even though lord mark prevail aragorn son arathorn elendil's heir gondor'
 'this house th�oden aragorn even king gondor seat denethor' said h�ma stepping swiftly doors barring way sword hand point towards strangers
 'this idle talk' said gandalf 'needless th�oden's demand useless refuse king way hall folly wisdom'
 'truly' said aragorn 'and would master house bade woodman's cot bore sword and�ril'
 'whatever name may be' said h�ma 'here shall lay would fight alone men edoras'
 'not alone' said gimli fingering blade axe looking darkly guard young tree gimli mind fell 'not alone'
 'come come' said gandalf 'we friends laughter mordor reward quarrel errand pressing least _my_ sword goodman h�ma keep well glamdring called elves made long ago let pass come aragorn'
 slowly aragorn unbuckled belt set sword upright wall 'here set it' said 'but command touch permit lay hand elvish heath dwells blade broken made telchar first wrought deeps time death shall come man draws elendil's sword save elendil's heir'
 guard stepped back looked amazement aragorn 'it seems come wings song forgotten days said shall lord command
 'well' said gimli 'if and�ril keep company axe may stay without shame' laid floor 'now wish let us go speak master'
 guard still hesitated 'your staff' said gandalf 'forgive must left doors'
 'foolishness' said gandalf 'prudence one thing discourtesy another old may lean stick go sit pleases th�oden hobble speak me'
 aragorn laughed 'every man something dear trust another would part old man support come let us enter'
 'the staff hand wizard may prop age' said h�ma looked hard ashstaff gandalf leaned 'yet doubt man worth trust wisdom believe friends folk worthy honour evil purpose may go in'

 guards lifted heavy bars doors swung slowly inwards grumbling great hinges travellers entered inside seemed dark warm clear air upon hill hall long wide filled shadows half lights mighty pillars upheld lofty roof bright sunbeams fell glimmering shafts eastern windows high deep eaves louver roof thin wisps issuing smoke sky showed pale blue eyes changed travellers perceived floor paved stones many hues branching runes strange devices intertwined beneath feet saw pillars richly carved gleaming dully gold halfseen colours many woven cloths hung upon walls wide spaces marched figures ancient legend dim years darkling shade upon one form sunlight fell young man upon white horse blowing great horn yellow hair flying wind horse's head lifted nostrils wide red neighed smelling battle afar foaming water green white rushed curled knees
 'behold eorl young' said aragorn 'thus rode north battle field celebrant'
 four companions went forward past clear woodfire burning upon long hearth midst hall halted far end house beyond hearth facing north towards doors dais three steps middle dais great gilded chair upon sat man bent age seemed almost dwarf white hair long thick fell great braids beneath thin golden circle set upon brow centre upon forehead shone single white diamond beard laid like snow upon knees eyes still burned bright light glinting gazed strangers behind chair stood woman clad white feet upon steps sat wizened figure man pale wise face heavylidded eyes
 silence old man move chair length gandalf spoke 'hail th�oden son thengel returned behold storm comes friends gather together lest singly destroyed'
 slowly old man rose feet leaning heavily upon short black staff handle white bone strangers saw bent though still tall must youth high proud indeed
 'i greet you' said 'and maybe look welcome truth tell welcome doubtful master gandalf ever herald woe troubles follow like crows ever oftener worse deceive heard shadowfax come back riderless rejoiced return horse still lack rider �omer brought tidings gone last long home mourn news afar seldom sooth come come evils worse might expected welcome gandalf stormcrow tell that' slowly sat chair
 'you speak justly lord' said pale man sitting upon steps dais 'it yet five days since bitter tidings came th�odred son slain upon west marches right hand second marshal mark �omer little trust men would left guard walls allowed rule even learn gondor dark lord stirring east hour wanderer chooses return indeed welcome master stormcrow _l�thspell_ name illnews ill news ill guest say' laughed grimly lifted heavy lids moment gazed strangers dark eyes
 'you held wise friend wormtongue doubtless great support master' answered gandalf soft voice 'yet two ways may man come evil tidings lie may worker evil may leaves well alone comes bring aid time need'
 'that so' said wormtongue 'but third kind pickers bones meddlers men's sorrows carrionfowl grow fat war aid ever brought stormcrow aid bring aid us sought last time lord bade choose horse would gone wonder took shadowfax insolence lord sorely grieved yet seemed speed land price great guess likely turn seek aid rather render bring men bring horses swords spears would call aid present need follow tail three ragged wanderers grey beggarlike four'
 'the courtesy hall somewhat lessened late th�oden son thengel' said gandalf 'has messenger gate reported names companions seldom lord rohan received three guests weapons laid doors worth many mortal man even mightiest grey raiment elves clad thus passed shadow great perils hall'
 'then true �omer reported league sorceress golden wood' said wormtongue 'it wondered webs deceit ever woven dwimordene'
 gimli strode pace forward felt suddenly hand gandalf clutch shoulder halted standing stiff stone

 dwimordene l�rien
 seldom walked feet men
 mortal eyes seen light
 lies ever long bright
 galadriel galadriel
 clear water well
 white star white hand
 unmarred unstained leaf land
 dwimordene l�rien
 fair thoughts mortal men

 thus gandalf softly sang suddenly changed casting tattered cloak aside stood leaned longer staff spoke clear cold voice 'the wise speak know gr�ma son g�lm�d witless worm become therefore silent keep forked tongue behind teeth passed fire death bandy crooked words servingman till lightning falls' raised staff roll thunder sunlight blotted eastern windows whole hall became suddenly dark night fire faded sullen embers gandalf could seen standing white tall blackened hearth
 gloom heard hiss wormtongue's voice 'did counsel lord forbid staff fool h�ma betrayed us' flash lightning cloven roof silent wormtongue sprawled face

 'now th�oden son thengel hearken me' said gandalf 'do ask help' lifted staff pointed high window darkness seemed clear opening could seen high far patch shining sky 'not dark take courage lord mark better help find counsel give despair yet counsel could give words could speak hear ears bid come doors look abroad long sat shadows trusted twisted tales crooked promptings'
 slowly th�oden left chair faint light grew hall woman hastened king's side taking arm faltering steps old man came dais paced softly hall wormtongue remained lying floor came doors gandalf knocked
 'open' cried 'the lord mark comes forth'
 doors rolled back keen air came whistling wind blowing hill 'send guards stairs foot' said gandalf 'and lady leave care him'
 'go �owyn sisterdaughter' said old king 'the time fear past'
 woman turned went slowly house passed doors turned looked back grave thoughtful glance looked king cool pity eyes fair face long hair like river gold slender tall white robe girt silver strong seemed stern steel daughter kings thus aragorn first time full light day beheld �owyn lady rohan thought fair fair cold like morning pale spring yet come womanhood suddenly aware tall heir kings wise many winters greycloaked hiding power yet felt moment still stone stood turning swiftly gone
 'now lord' said gandalf 'look upon land breathe free air again'
 porch upon top high terrace could see beyond stream green fields rohan fading distant grey curtains windblown rain slanting sky west still dark thunder lightning far away flickered among tops hidden hills wind shifted north already storm come east receding rolling away southward sea suddenly rent clouds behind shaft sun stabbed falling showers gleamed like silver far away river glittered like shimmering glass
 'it dark here' said th�oden
 'no' said gandalf 'nor age lie heavily shoulders would think cast aside prop'
 king's hand black staff fell clattering stones drew slowly man stiff long bending dull toil tall straight stood eyes blue looked opening sky
 'dark dreams late' said 'but feel one newawakened would come gandalf fear already come late see last days house long shall stand high hall brego son eorl built fire shall devour high seat done'
 'much' said gandalf 'but first send �omer guess rightly hold prisoner counsel gr�ma save name wormtongue'
 'it true' said th�oden 'he rebelled commands threatened death gr�ma hall'
 'a man may love yet love wormtongue counsels' said gandalf
 'that may ask call h�ma since proved untrusty doorward let become errandrunner guilty shall bring guilty judgement' said th�oden voice grim yet looked gandalf smiled many lines care smoothed away return

 h�ma summoned gone gandalf led th�oden stone seat sat king upon topmost stair aragorn companions stood nearby
 'there time tell hear' said gandalf 'yet hope cheated time come ere long speak fully behold come peril greater even wit wormtongue could weave dreams see dream longer live gondor rohan stand alone enemy strong beyond reckoning yet hope guessed'
 quickly gandalf spoke voice low secret none save king heard said ever spoke light shone brighter th�oden's eye last rose seat full height gandalf beside together looked high place towards east
 'verily' said gandalf loud voice keen clear 'that way lies hope sits greatest fear doom hangs still thread yet hope still stand unconquered little while'
 others turned eyes eastward sundering leagues land far away gazed edge sight hope fear bore thoughts still beyond dark mountains land shadow ringbearer thin indeed thread upon doom still hung seemed legolas strained farseeing eyes caught glint white far away perchance sun twinkled pinnacle tower guard still endlessly remote yet present threat tiny tongue flame
 slowly th�oden sat weariness still struggled master gandalf turned looked great house 'alas' said 'that evil days mine come old age instead peace earned alas boromir brave young perish old linger withering' clutched knees wrinkled hands
 'your fingers would remember old strength better grasped swordhilt' said gandalf
 th�oden rose put hand side sword hung belt 'where gr�ma stowed it' muttered breath
 'take dear lord' said clear voice 'it ever service' two men come softly stair stood steps top �omer helm head mail breast hand held drawn sword knelt offered hilt master
 'how comes this' said th�oden sternly turned towards �omer men looked wonder standing proud erect old man left crouching chair leaning stick
 'it lord' said h�ma trembling understood �omer set free joy heart maybe erred yet since free marshal mark brought sword bade me'
 'to lay feet lord' said �omer
 moment silence th�oden stood looking �omer knelt still neither moved
 'will take sword' said gandalf
 slowly th�oden stretched forth hand fingers took hilt seemed watchers firmness strength returned thin arm suddenly lifted blade swung shimmering whistling air gave great cry voice rang clear chanted tongue rohan call arms

 _arise arise riders th�oden
 dire deeds awake dark eastward
 let horse bridled horn sounded
 forth eorlingas_

 guards thinking summoned sprang stair looked lord amazement one man drew swords laid feet 'command us' said
 '_westu th�oden h�l_' cried �omer 'it joy us see return never shall said gandalf come grief'
 'take back sword �omer sisterson' said king 'go h�ma seek sword gr�ma keeping bring also gandalf said counsel give would hear counsel'
 'you already taken it' answered gandalf 'to put trust �omer rather man crooked mind cast aside regret fear deed hand every man ride sent west �omer counselled must first destroy threat saruman time fail fall succeed � face next task meanwhile people left women children old stay refuges mountains prepared evil day let take provision delay burden treasures great small lives stake'
 'this counsel seems good now' said th�oden 'let folk get ready gueststruly said gandalf courtesy hall lessened ridden night morning wears away neither sleep food guesthouse shall made ready shall sleep eaten'
 'nay lord' said aragorn 'there rest yet weary men rohan must ride forth today ride axe sword bow bring rest wall lord mark promised �omer sword drawn together'
 'now indeed hope victory' said �omer
 'hope yes' said gandalf 'but isengard strong perils draw ever nearer delay th�oden gone lead people swiftly hold dunharrow hills'
 'nay gandalf' said king 'you know skill healing shall go war fall front battle must thus shall sleep better'
 'then even defeat rohan glorious song' said aragorn armed men stood near clashed weapons crying 'the lord mark ride forth eorlingas'
 'but people must unarmed shepherdless' said gandalf 'who shall guide govern place'
 'i take thought ere go' answered th�oden 'here comes counsellor'

 moment h�ma came hall behind cringing two men came gr�ma wormtongue face white eyes blinked sunlight h�ma knelt presented th�oden long sword scabbard clasped gold set green gems 'here lord herugrim ancient blade' said 'it found chest loth render keys many things men missed'
 'you lie' said wormtongue 'and sword master gave keeping'
 'and requires again' said th�oden 'does displease you'
 'assuredly lord' said wormtongue 'i care best may weary tax heavily strength let others deal irksome guests meat set board go it'
 'i will' said th�oden 'and let food guests set board beside host rides today send heralds forth let summon dwell nigh every man strong lad able bear arms horses let ready saddle gate ere second hour noon'
 'dear lord' cried wormtongue 'it feared wizard bewitched none left defend golden hall fathers treasure none guard lord mark'
 'if bewitchment' said th�oden 'it seems wholesome whisperings leechcraft ere long would walking fours like beast one shall left even gr�ma gr�ma shall ride go yet time clean rust sword'
 'mercy lord' whined wormtongue grovelling ground 'have pity one worn service send side least stand others gone send faithful gr�ma away'
 'you pity' said th�oden 'and send side go war men bid come prove faith'
 wormtongue looked face face eyes hunted look beast seeking gap ring enemies licked lips long pale tongue 'such resolve might expected lord house eorl old though be' said 'but truly love would spare failing years yet see come late others death lord would perhaps grieve less already persuaded cannot undo work hear least lord one knows mind honours commands left edoras appoint faithful steward let counsellor gr�ma keep things till returnand pray may see though wise man deem hopeful'
 �omer laughed 'and plea excuse war noble wormtongue' said office less honour would accept carry sack meal mountainsif man would trust it'
 'nay �omer fully understand mind master wormtongue' said gandalf turning piercing glance upon 'he bold cunning even plays game peril wins throw hours precious time wasted already 'down snake' said suddenly terrible voice 'down belly long since saruman bought promised price men dead pick share treasure take woman desire long watched eyelids haunted steps'
 �omer grasped sword 'that knew already' muttered 'for reason would slain forgetting law hall reasons' stepped forward gandalf stayed hand
 '�owyn safe now' said 'but wormtongue done could true master reward earned least yet saruman apt overlook bargains advise go quickly remind lest forget faithful service'
 'you lie' said wormtongue
 'that word comes oft easy lips' said gandalf 'i lie see th�oden snake safety cannot take leave behind slay would always man service fashion give horse let go wherever chooses choice shall judge him'
 'do hear wormtongue' said th�oden 'this choice ride war let us see battle whether true go whither ever meet shall merciful'
 slowly wormtongue rose looked halfclosed eyes last scanned th�oden's face opened mouth speak suddenly drew hands worked eyes glittered malice men stepped back bared teeth hissing breath spat king's feet darting one side fled stair
 'after him' said th�oden 'see harm hurt hinder give horse wishes it'
 'and bear him' said �omer
 one guards ran stair another went well foot terrace helm drew water washed clean stones wormtongue defiled

 'now guests come' said th�oden 'come take refreshment haste allows'
 passed back great house already heard town heralds crying warhorns blowing king ride forth soon men town dwelling near could armed assembled
 king's board sat �omer four guests also waiting upon king lady �owyn ate drank swiftly others silent th�oden questioned gandalf concerning saruman
 'how far back treachery goes guess' said gandalf 'he always evil doubt friend rohan even heart grew colder found useful still long plotted ruin wearing mask friendship ready years wormtongue's task easy swiftly known isengard land open strangers came went ever wormtongue's whispering ears poisoning thought chilling heart weakening limbs others watched could nothing keeping
 'but escaped warned mask torn would see wormtongue played dangerously always seeking delay prevent full strength gathered crafty dulling men's wariness working fears served occasion remember eagerly urged man spared wildgoose chase northward immediate peril westward persuaded forbid �omer pursue raiding orcs �omer defied wormtongue's voice speaking mouth orcs would reached isengard bearing great prize indeed prize saruman desires else least two members company sharers secret hope even lord cannot yet speak openly dare think might suffering saruman might learned destruction'
 'i owe much �omer' said th�oden 'faithful heart may forward tongue' 'say also' said gandalf 'that crooked eyes truth may wear wry face'
 'indeed eyes almost blind' said th�oden 'most owe guest come time would give gift ere go choosing name aught mine reserve sword'
 'whether came time yet seen' said gandalf 'but gift lord choose one fit need swift sure give shadowfax lent loan may call shall ride great hazard setting silver black would risk anything already bond love us'
 'you choose well' said th�oden 'and give gladly yet great gift none like shadowfax one mighty steeds old returned none shall return guests offer things may found armoury swords need helms coats mail cunning work gifts fathers gondor choose ere go may serve well'

 gimli bowed 'i proud lord mark bear device' said 'indeed sooner would bear horse borne one love feet better maybe shall come yet stand fight'
 'it may well so' said th�oden
 king rose �owyn came forward bearing wine '_ferthu th�oden h�l_' said 'receive cup drink happy hour health thee thy going coming'
 th�oden drank cup proffered guests stood aragorn paused suddenly looked upon eyes shining looked upon fair face smiled took cup hand met knew trembled touch 'hail aragorn son arathorn' said 'hail lady rohan' answered face troubled smile

 'i said �omer' answered h�ma 'and last �owyn daughter �omund sister fearless highhearted love let lord eorlingas gone'
 'it shall so' said th�oden 'let heralds announce folk lady �owyn lead them'
 king sat upon seat doors �owyn knelt received sword fair corslet 'farewell sisterdaughter' said 'dark hour yet maybe shall return golden hall dunharrow people may long defend battle go ill thither come escape' 'speak so' answered 'a year shall endure every day passes return' spoke eyes went aragorn stood nearby

 king went stair gandalf beside others followed aragorn looked back passed towards gate alone �owyn stood doors house stair's head sword set upright hands laid upon hilt clad mail shone like silver sun

 gandalf whistled called aloud horse's name far away tossed head neighed turning sped towards host like arrow
 'were breath west wind take body visible even would appear' said �omer great horse ran stood wizard
 'the gift seems already given' said th�oden 'but hearken name guest gandalf greyhame wisest counsellors welcome wanderers lord mark chieftain eorlingas kin shall last give shadowfax prince horses'
 'i thank th�oden king' said gandalf suddenly threw back grey cloak cast aside hat leaped horseback wore helm mail snowy hair flew free wind white robes shone dazzling sun

 _chapter 7_
 helm's deep

 sun already westering rode edoras light eyes turning rolling fields rohan golden haze beaten way northwestward along foothills white mountains followed green country crossing small swift streams many fords far ahead right misty mountains loomed ever darker taller grew miles went sun went slowly evening came behind
 host rode need drove fearing come late rode speed could pausing seldom swift enduring steeds rohan many leagues go forty leagues bird flies edoras fords isen hoped find king's men held back hosts saruman
 night closed last halted make camp ridden five hours far upon western plain yet half journey lay still great circle starry sky waxing moon made bivouac lit fires uncertain events set ring mounted guards scouts rode far ahead passing like shadows folds land slow night passed without tidings alarm dawn horns sounded within hour took road
 clouds overhead yet heaviness air hot season year rising sun hazy behind following slowly sky growing darkness great storm moving east away northwest seemed another darkness brooding feet misty mountains shadow crept slowly wizard's vale
 gandalf dropped back legolas rode beside �omer 'you keen eyes fair kindred legolas' said 'and tell sparrow finch league tell sec anything away yonder towards isengard'
 'many miles lie between' said legolas gazing thither shading eyes long hand 'i see darkness shapes moving great shapes far away upon bank river cannot tell mist cloud defeats eyes veiling shadow power lays upon land marches slowly stream twilight endless trees flowing downwards hills'
 'and behind us comes storm mordor' said gandalf 'it black night'

 second day riding drew heaviness air increased afternoon dark clouds began overtake sombre canopy great billowing edges flecked dazzling light sun went bloodred smoking haze spears riders tipped fire last shafts light kindled steep faces peaks thrihyrne near stood northernmost arm white mountains three jagged horns staring sunset last red glow men vanguard saw black speck horseman riding back towards halted awaiting
 came weary man dinted helm cloven shield slowly climbed horse stood gasping length spoke 'is �omer here' asked 'you come last late little strength things gone evilly since th�odred fell driven back yesterday isen great loss many perished crossing night fresh forces came river camp isengard must emptied saruman armed wild hillmen herdfolk dunland beyond rivers also loosed upon us overmastered shieldwall broken erkenbrand westfold drawn men could gather towards fastness helm's deep rest scattered
 'where �omer tell hope ahead return edoras wolves isengard come there' th�oden sat silent hidden man's sight behind guards urged horse forward 'come stand ceorl' said 'i last host eorlingas ridden forth return without battle'
 man's face lightened joy wonder drew knelt offering notched sword king 'command lord' cried 'and pardon thought'
 'you thought remained meduseld bent like old tree winter snow rode war west wind shaken boughs' said th�oden 'give man fresh horse let us ride help erkenbrand'

 th�oden speaking gandalf rode short way ahead sat alone gazing north isengard west setting sun came back
 'ride th�oden' said 'ride helm's deep go fords isen tarry plain must leave shadowfax must bear swift errand' turning aragorn �omer men king's household cried 'keep well lord mark till return await helm's gate farewell'
 spoke word shadowfax like arrow bow great horse sprang away even looked gone flash silver sunset wind grass shadow fled passed sight snowmane snorted reared eager follow swift bird wing could overtaken
 'what mean' said one guard h�ma
 'that gandalf greyhame need haste' answered h�ma 'ever goes comes unlookedfor'
 'wormtongue would find hard explain 'said
 'true enough' said h�ma 'but wait see gandalf again'
 'maybe wait long' said

 host turned away road fords isen bent course southward night fell still rode hills drew near tall peaks thrihyrne already dim darkening sky still miles away far side westfold vale lay green coomb great bay mountains gorge opened hills men land called helm's deep hero old wars made refuge ever steeper narrower wound inward north shadow thrihyrne till crowhaunted cliffs rose like mighty towers either side shutting light

 'we found many folk lying slain fled thither' said scout 'and met scattered companies going way leaderless become erkenbrand none seem know likely overtaken ere reach helm's gate already perished'
 'has aught seen gandalf' asked th�oden
 'yes lord many seen old man white upon horse passing hither thither plains like wind grass thought saruman said went away ere nightfall towards isengard say also wormtongue seen earlier going northward company orcs'
 'it go ill wormtongue gandalf comes upon said th�oden 'nonetheless miss counsellors old new need better choice go gandalf said helm's gate whether erkenbrand known great host comes north'
 'it great' said scout 'he flies counts every foeman twice yet spoken stouthearted men doubt main strength enemy many times great here'
 'then let us swift' said �omer 'let us drive foes already us fastness caves helm's deep hundreds may lie hid secret ways lead thence hills
 'trust secret ways' said king 'saruman long spied land still place defence may last long let us go'

 aragorn legolas went �omer van dark night rode ever slower darkness deepened way climbed southward higher higher dim folds mountains' feet found enemy came upon roving bands orcs fled ere riders could take slay
 'it long fear' said �omer 'ere coming king's host known leader enemies saruman whatever captain sent forth'
 rumour war grew behind could hear borne dark sound harsh singing climbed far deepingcoomb looked back saw torches countless points fiery light upon black fields behind scattered like red flowers winding lowlands long flickering lines larger blaze leapt
 'it great host follows us hard' said aragorn
 'they bring fire' said th�oden 'and burning come rick cot tree rich vale many homesteads alas folk'
 'would day might ride upon like storm mountains' said aragorn 'it grieves fly them'
 'we need fly much further' said �omer 'not far ahead lies helm's dike ancient trench rampart scored across coomb two furlongs helm's gate turn give battle'
 'nay defend dike' said th�oden 'it mile long breach wide'
 'at breach rearguard must stand pressed' said �omer

 neither star moon riders came breach dike stream passed road beside ran hornburg rampart loomed suddenly high shadow beyond dark pit rode sentinel challenged

 host passed breach halted sloping sward learned joy erkenbrand left many men hold helm's gate since escaped thither
 'maybe thousand fit fight foot' said gamling old man leader watched dike 'but seen many winters son's son news erkenbrand word came yesterday retreating hither left best riders westfold come'
 'i fear come now' said �omer 'our scouts gained news enemy fills valley behind us'
 'i would escaped' said th�oden 'he mighty man lived valour helm hammerhand cannot await must draw forces behind walls well stored bring little provision rode forth open battle siege'
 'behind us caves deep three parts folk westfold old young children women' said gamling 'but great store food many beasts fodder also gathered there'
 'that well' said �omer 'they burning despoiling left vale'
 'if come bargain goods helm's gate pay high price' said gamling

 king riders passed causeway crossed stream dismounted long file led horses ramp passed within gates hornburg welcomed joy renewed hope men enough man burg barrier wall

 'that may shown yet given good counsel peril made use speed shadowfax valour done stout legs westfoldmen marching night'
 gazed gandalf still greater wonder glanced darkly wood passed hands brows thought eyes saw otherwise
 gandalf laughed long merrily 'the trees' said 'nay see wood plainly deed mine thing beyond counsel wise better design better even hope event proved'
 'then whose wizardry' said th�oden 'not saruman's plain mightier sage yet learn'
 'it wizardry power far older' said gandalf 'a power walked earth ere elf sang hammer rang

 'and may answer riddle' said th�oden
 'if would learn come isengard ' answered gandalf
 'to isengard' cried

 'yet also sad' said th�oden 'for however fortune war shall go may end much fair wonderful shall pass ever middleearth'
 'it may' said gandalf 'the evil sauron cannot wholly cured made days doomed let us go journey begun'

 merry yawned 'work fingers' said 'but must know long since left l�rien'
 'oh that' said pippin 'i mean real bed bedroom'
 'well rivendell then' said merry 'but could sleep anywhere tonight'
 'you luck merry' said pippin softly long pause 'you riding gandalf'
 'well it'
 'did get news information him'
 'yes good deal usual heard close talking secrets go tomorrow think get himand he'll you'
 'can good he's close changed all'
 'oh yes is' said merry waking little beginning wonder bothering companion 'he grown something kinder alarming merrier solemn think changed chance see much yet think last part business saruman remember saruman gandalf's superior head council whatever may exactly saruman white gandalf white saruman came told rod taken told go went'
 'well gandalf changed he's closer ever that's all' pippin argued 'thatglass ball seemed mighty pleased knows guesses something tell us word yet picked saved rolling pool _here i'll take lad_ � that's wonder felt heavy' pippin's voice fell low talking
 'hullo' said merry 'so that's bothering pippin lad forget gildor's saying � one sam used quote_ meddle fairs wizards subtle quick anger_'
 'but whole life months one long meddling affairs wizards' said pippin 'i like bit information well danger like look ball'
 'go sleep' said merry 'you'll get information enough sooner later dear pippin took ever beat brandybuck inquisitiveness time ask you'
 'all right what's harm telling like look stone know can't old gandalf sitting like hen egg help much get _youcan'thaveit sogotosleep_'
 'well else could say' said merry 'i'm sorry pippin really must wait till morning i'll curious like breakfast i'll help way wizardwheedling can't keep awake longer yawn shall split ears good night'

 pippin said lay still sleep remained far away encouraged sound merry breathing softly asleep minutes saying good night 'the thought dark globe seemed grow stronger grew quiet pippin felt weight hands saw mysterious red depths looked moment tossed turned tried think something else
 last could stand longer got looked round chilly wrapped cloak moon shining cold white dell shadows bushes black lay sleeping shapes two guards view hill perhaps hidden bracken driven impulse understand pippin walked softly gandalf lay looked wizard seemed asleep lids fully closed glitter eyes long lashes pippin stepped back hastily gandalf made sign drawn forward half hobbit crept behind wizard's head rolled blanket cloak spread top close beside right side bent arm hummock something round wrapped dark cloth hand seemed slipped ground
 hardly breathing pippin crept nearer foot foot last knelt put hands stealthily slowly lifted lump seem quite heavy expected 'only bundle oddments perhaps all' thought strange sense relief put bundle stood moment clasping idea came mind tiptoed away found large stone came back
 quickly drew cloth wrapped stone kneeling laid back wizard's hand last looked thing uncovered smooth globe crystal dark dead lying bare knees pippin lifted covered hurriedly cloak half turned go back bed moment gandalf moved sleep muttered words seemed strange tongue hand groped clasped wrapped stone sighed move
 'you idiotic fool' pippin muttered 'you're going get frightful trouble put back quick' found knees quaked dare go near enough wizard reach bundle 'i'll never get back without waking him' thought 'not till i'm bit calmer may well look first though' stole away sat green hillock far bed moon looked edge dell
 pippin sat knees drawn ball bent low looking like greedy child stooping bowl food corner away others drew cloak aside gazed air seemed still tense first globe dark black jet moonlight gleaming surface came faint glow stir heart held eyes could look away soon inside seemed fire ball spinning lights within revolving suddenly lights went gave gasp struggled remained bent clasping ball hands closer closer bent became rigid lips moved soundlessly strangled cry fell back lay still
 cry piercing guards leapt banks camp soon astir

 'so thief' said gandalf hastily cast cloak globe lay 'but pippin grievous turn things' knelt pippin's body hobbit lying back rigid unseeing eyes staring sky 'the devilry mischief doneto us' wizard's face drawn haggard
 took pippin's hand bent face listening breath laid hands brow hobbit shuddered eyes closed cried sat staring bewilderment faces round pale moonlight
 'it saruman' cried shrill toneless voice shrinking away gandalf 'i send understand say that' struggled get escape gandalf held gently firmly
 'peregrin took' said 'come back'
 hobbit relaxed fell back clinging wizard's hand 'gandalf' cried 'gandalf forgive me'
 'forgive you' said wizard 'tell first done'
 'i took ball looked it' stammered pippin 'and saw things frightened wanted go away came questioned looked remember'
 'that do' said gandalf sternly 'what see say'
 pippin shut eyes shivered said nothing stared silence except merry turned away gandalf's face still hard 'speak' said
 low hesitating voice pippin began slowly words grew clearer stronger 'i saw dark sky tall battlements' said 'and tiny stars seemed far away long ago yet hard clear stars went outthey cut things wings big think really glass looked like bats wheeling round tower thought nine one began fly straight towards getting bigger bigger horrible � can't say
 'i tried get away thought would fly covered globe disappeared _he_ came speak could hear words looked understood
 '"so come back neglected report long"
 'i answer said "who you" still answer hurt horribly pressed said "a hobbit"
 'then suddenly seemed see laughed cruel like stabbed knives struggled said "wait moment shall meet soon tell saruman dainty send understand say that"
 'then gloated felt falling pieces can't say remember anything else'
 'look me' said gandalf
 pippin looked straight eyes wizard held gaze moment silence face grew gentler shadow smile appeared laid hand softly pippin's head
 'all right' said 'say taken harm lie eyes feared speak long fool honest fool remain peregrin took wiser ones might done worse pass mark saved friends mainly good fortune called cannot count second time questioned almost certainly would told know ruin us eager want information wanted quickly could deal dark tower slowly shudder meddle affairs wizards must prepared think things come forgive comforted things turned evilly might'
 lifted pippin gently carried back bed merry followed sat beside lie rest pippin' said gandalf 'trust feel itch palms tell things cured anyway dear hobbit put lump rock elbow leave two together while'
 gandalf returned others still standing orthancstone troubled thought 'peril comes night least expected' said 'we narrow escape'
 'how hobbit pippin' asked aragorn
 'i think well now' answered gandalf 'he held long hobbits amazing power recovery memory horror probably fade quickly quickly perhaps aragorn take orthancstone guard dangerous charge'
 'dangerous indeed all' said aragorn 'there one may claim right assuredly _palant�r_ orthanc treasury elendil set kings gondor hour draws near take it'
 gandalf looked aragorn surprise others lifted covered stone bowed presented
 'receive lord' said 'in earnest things shall given back may counsel use use � yet wary'
 'when hasty unwary waited prepared many long years' said aragorn
 'never yet stumble end road' answered gandalf 'but least keep thing secret others stand hobbit peregrin know bestowed evil fit may come alas handled looked never happened ought never touched isengard quicker mind bent saruman guess nature stone weary lay pondering sleep overcame know'
 'yes doubt' said aragorn 'at last know link' isengard mordor worked much explained' 'strange powers enemies strange weaknesses' said th�oden 'but long said _oft evil shall evil mar_'
 'that many times seen' said gandalf 'but time strangely fortunate maybe saved hobbit grave blunder considered whether probe stone find uses done revealed ready trial indeed shall ever even found power withdraw would disastrous see yet � hour comes secrecy avail longer'
 'that hour come think' said aragorn
 'not yet' said gandalf 'there remains short doubt must use enemy clear thought stone orthanc � therefore hobbit captive driven look glass torment saruman dark mind filled voice face hobbit expectation may take time learns error must snatch time leisurely must move neighbourhood isengard place linger ride ahead peregrin took better lying dark others sleep'
 'i keep �omer ten riders' said king 'they shall ride early day rest may go aragorn ride soon mind'
 'as will' said gandalf 'but make speed may cover hills helm's deep'

 moment shadow fell bright moonlight seemed suddenly cut several riders cried crouched holding arms heads ward blow blind fear deadly cold fell cowering looked vast winged shape passed moon like black cloud wheeled went north flying speed greater wind middleearth stars fainted gone
 stood rigid stones gandalf gazing arms downwards stiff hands clenched
 'nazg�l' cried 'the messenger mordor storm coming nazg�l crossed river ride ride wait dawn let swift wait slow ride'
 sprang away calling shadowfax ran aragorn followed going pippin gandalf picked arms 'you shall come time' said 'shadowfax shall show paces' ran place slept shadowfax stood already slinging small bag luggage across shoulders wizard leapt upon horse's back aragorn lifted pippin set gandalf's arms wrapped cloak blanket
 'farewell follow fast' cried gandalf 'away shadowfax'
 great horse tossed head flowing tail flicked moonlight leapt forward spurning earth gone like north wind mountains

 'a beautiful restful night' said merry aragorn 'some folk wonderful luck want sleep wanted ride gandalf � goes instead turned stone stand ever warning'
 'if first lift orthancstone would now' said aragorn 'you might done worse say luck come fear go get ready bring anything pippin left behind make haste'

 plains shadowfax flying needing urging guidance less hour passed reached fords isen crossed mound riders cold spears lay grey behind
 pippin recovering warm wind face keen refreshing gandalf horror stone hideous shadow moon fading things left behind mists mountains passing dream drew deep breath
 'i know rode bareback gandalf' said 'you saddle bridle'
 'i ride elffashion except shadowfax' said gandalf 'but shadowfax harness ride shadowfax willing carry youor willing enough business see remain back unless jump air'
 'how fast going' asked pippin 'fast wind smooth light footfalls are'
 'he running fast swiftest horse could gallop' answered gandalf 'but fast land rising little broken beyond river see white mountains drawing near stars yonder thrihyrne peaks like black spears long reach branching roads come deepingcoomb battle fought two nights ago'
 pippin silent heard gandalf singing softly murmuring brief snatches rhyme many tongues miles ran last wizard passed song hobbit caught words lines came clear ears rushing wind
 _tall ships tall kings
 three times three
 brought foundered land
 flowing sea
 seven stars seven stones
 one white tree


 'what saying gandalf' asked pippin
 'i running rhymes lore mind ' answered wizard 'hobbits suppose forgotten even ever knew'
 'no all' said pippin 'and many interest perhaps never heard one � seven stars seven stones'
 'about _palant�ri_ kings old' said gandalf
 'and they'
 'the name meant _that looks far away_ orthancstone one'
 'then made made' � pippin hesitated � 'by enemy'
 'no' said gandalf 'nor saruman beyond art beyond sauron's _palant�ri_ came beyond westernesse eldamar noldor made f�anor maybe wrought days long ago time cannot measured years nothing sauron cannot turn evil uses alas saruman downfall perceive perilous us devices art deeper possess yet must bear blame fool keep secret profit word ever speak council yet given thought fate _palant�ri_ gondor ruinous wars men almost forgotten even gondor secret known arnor remembered rhyme lore among d�nedain'
 'what men old use for' asked pippin delighted astonished getting answers many questions wondering long would last
 'to see far converse thought one another' said gandalf 'in way long guarded united realm gondor set stones minas anor minas ithil orthanc ring isengard chief master dome stars osgiliath ruin three others far away north house elrond told ann�minas amon s�l elendil's stone tower hills look towards mithlond gulf lune grey ships lie

 'i wish known before' said pippin 'i notion doing'
 'oh yes had' said gandalf 'you knew behaving wrongly foolishly told though listen tell musing happened last understood even ride together spoken sooner would lessened desire made easier resist contrary burned hand teaches best advice fire goes heart'
 'it does' said pippin 'if seven stones laid shut eyes put hands pockets'
 'good' said gandalf 'that hoped'
 'but like know' pippin began
 'mercy' cried gandalf 'if giving information cure inquisitiveness shall spend rest days answering want know'
 'the names stars living things whole history middleearth overheaven sundering seas ' laughed pippin 'of course less hurry tonight moment wondering black shadow heard shout "messenger mordor" could isengard'
 'it black rider wings nazg�l' said gandalf 'it could taken away dark tower'

 pippin made answer clutched cloak sudden chill struck grey land passed
 'see now' said gandalf 'the westfold dales opening us come back eastward road dark shadow yonder mouth deepingcoomb way lies aglarond glittering caves ask ask gimli meet first time may get answer longer wish see caves journey soon far behind'
 'i thought going stop helm's deep' said pippin 'where going then'

 'oh far that'
 'leagues upon leagues' answered gandalf 'thrice far dwellings king th�oden hundred miles east messengers mordor fly shadowfax must run longer road prove swifter

 _chapter 1_
 taming sm�agol

 'well master we're fix mistake' said sam gamgee stood despondently hunched shoulders beside frodo peered puckered eyes gloom
 third evening since fled company far could tell almost lost count hours climbed laboured among barren slopes stones emyn muil sometimes retracing steps could find way forward sometimes discovering wandered circle back hours yet whole worked steadily eastward keeping near could find way outer edge strange twisted knot hills always found outward faces sheer high impassable frowning plain beyond tumbled skirts lay livid festering marshes nothing moved even bird seen

 hobbits stood brink tall cliff bare bleak feet wrapped mist behind rose broken highlands crowned drifting cloud chill wind` blew east night gathering shapeless lands sickly green fading sullen brown far away right anduin gleamed fitfully sunbreaks day hidden shadow eyes look beyond river back gondor friends lands men south east stared edge oncoming night dark line hung like distant mountains motionless smoke every tiny red gleam far away flickered upwards rim earth sky
 `what fix ' said sam `that's one place lands we've ever heard want see closer that's one place we're trying get that's can't get nohow we've come wrong way altogether seemingly can't get get we'd find green land nasty bog i'll warrant phew smell it' sniffed wind
 'yes smell it' said frodo move eyes remained fixed staring towards dark line flickering flame `mordor ' muttered breath 'if must go wish could come quickly make end ' shuddered wind chilly yet heavy odour cold decay `well' said last withdrawing eyes `we cannot stay night fix fix must find sheltered spot camp perhaps another day show us path'
 'or another another another' muttered sam `or maybe day we've come wrong way'
 'i wonder' said frodo 'it's doom think go shadow yonder way found good evil show hope speed delay plays enemy's handsand delayed dark tower steers us choices proved ill left company long come north east river emyn muil hard battle plain passes mordor possible alone find way back orcs prowling east bank every day passes precious day lost tired sam know done food got left'
 'only d'you call 'em _lembas_ mr frodo fair supply better naught long bite never thought though first set tooth ever come wish change bit plain bread mug � aye half mug � beer would go proper i've lugged cookinggear way last camp use naught make fire start naught cook even grass'

 turned away went stony hollow westering sun caught clouds night came swiftly slept well could cold turn turn nook among great jagged pinnacles weathered rock least sheltered easterly wind
 `did see mr frodo' asked sam sat stiff chilled munching wafers _lembas_ cold grey early morning
 'no' said frodo `i've heard nothing seen nothing two nights now'
 `nor me' said sam `grrr eyes give turn perhaps we've shaken last miserable slinker gollum i'll give _gollum_ throat ever get hands neck'
 'i hope never need to' said frodo `i know followed us may he's lost us say dry bleak land can't leave many footprints much scent even snuffling nose'
 'i hope that's way it' said sam 'i wish could rid good'
 'so i' said frodo 'but he's chief trouble wish could get away hills hate feel naked east side stuck nothing dead flats shadow yonder there's eye come we've got get today somehow'

 day wore afternoon faded towards evening still scrambling along ridge found way escape
 sometimes silence barren country fancied heard faint sounds behind stone falling imagined step flapping feet rock halted stood still listening heard nothing wind sighing edges stones � yet even reminded breath softly hissing sharp teeth
 day outer ridge emyn muil bending gradually northward struggled along brink stretched wide tumbled flat scored weathered rock cut every trenchlike gullies sloped steeply deep notches cliffface find path clefts becoming deeper frequent frodo sam driven left well away edge notice several miles going slowly steadily downhill clifftop sinking towards level lowlands
 last brought halt ridge took sharper bend northward gashed deeper ravine side reared many fathoms single leap great grey cliff loomed cut sheer knife stroke could go forwards must turn either west east west would lead labour delay back towards heart hills east would take outer precipice
 `there's nothing scramble gully sam' said frodo `let's see leads to'
 'a nasty drop i'll bet' said sam
 cleft longer deeper seemed way found gnarled stunted trees first seen days twisted birch part firtree many dead gaunt bitten core eastern winds milder days must fair thicket ravine fifty yards trees came end though old broken stumps straggled almost cliff's brink bottom gully lay along edge rockfault rough broken stone slanted steeply came last end frodo stooped leaned
 `look' said `we must come long way else cliff sunk much lower looks easier too'
 sam knelt beside peered reluctantly edge glanced great cliff rising away left `easier ' grunted `well suppose always easier getting can't fly jump'
 `it would big jump still' said frodo `about well' � stood moment measuring eyes � `about eighteen fathoms guess more'
 'and that's enough ' said sam `ugh hate looking height looking's better climbing'
 `all same' said frodo `i think could climb think shall try see � rock quite different miles back slipped cracked'
 outer fall indeed longer sheer sloped outwards little looked like great rampart seawall whose foundations shifted courses twisted disordered leaving great fissures long slanting edges places almost wide stairs
 `and we're going try get better try getting dark early think there's storm coming'
 smoky blur mountains east lost deeper blackness already reaching westwards long arms distant mutter thunder borne rising breeze frodo sniffed air looked doubtfully sky strapped belt outside cloak tightened settled light pack back stepped towards edge `i'm going try it' said
 `very good ' said sam gloomily `but i'm going first'
 'you ' said frodo `what's made change mind climbing'
 'i changed mind sense put one lowest likely slip want come atop knock sense killing two one fall'
 frodo could stop sat swung legs brink twisted round scrabbling toes foothold doubtful ever anything braver cold blood unwise
 'no sam old ass ' said frodo `you'll kill certain going like without even look see make come back ' took sam armpits hauled 'now wait bit patient ' said lay ground leaning looking light seemed fading quickly although sun yet set 'i think could manage this' said presently `i could rate could kept head followed carefully'
 `i know sure' said sam `why can't see bottom light comes place there's nowhere put feet hands'
 'climb back suppose' said frodo
 'easy said' objected sam 'better wait till morning light'
 `no help it' said frodo sudden strange vehemence `i grudge every hour every minute i'm going try follow till come back call'
 gripping stony lip fall fingers let gently arms almost full stretch toes found ledge 'on_ e step ' said 'and ledge broadens right could stand without hold i'll' words cut short

 hurrying darkness gathering great speed rushed east swallowed sky dry splitting crack thunder right overhead searing lightning smote hills came blast savage wind mingling roar came high shrill shriek hobbits heard cry far away marish fled hobbiton even woods shire frozen blood waste terror far greater pierced cold blades horror despair stopping heart breath sam fell flat face involuntarily frodo loosed hold put hands head ears swayed slipped slithered downwards wailing cry
 sam heard crawled effort edge 'master master ' called 'master'
 heard answer found shaking gathered breath shouted 'master' wind seemed blow voice back throat passed roaring gully away hills faint answering cry came ears
 'all right right i'm can't see'
 frodo calling weak voice actually far away slid fallen come jolt feet wider ledge many yards lower fortunately rockface point leaned well back wind pressed cliff toppled steadied little laying face cold stone feeling heart pounding either darkness grown complete else eyes lost sight black wondered struck blind took deep breath
 `come back come back ' heard sam's voice blackness
 `i can't' said `i can't see can't find hold can't move yet'
 `what mr frodo ' shouted sam leaning dangerously far could master see dim certainly dark could see frodo grey forlorn figure splayed cliff far reach helping hand
 another crack thunder rain came blinding sheet mingled hail drove cliff bitter cold
 'i'm coming you' shouted sam though hoped help way could said
 `no wait ' frodo called back strongly `i shall better soon feel better already wait can't anything without rope'
 `rope' cried sam talking wildly excitement relief `well deserve hung end one warning numbskulls nowt ninnyhammer sam gamgee that's gaffer said often enough word rope'
 `stop chattering' cried frodo recovered enough feel amused annoyed 'never mind gaffer trying tell got rope pocket
 `yes mr frodo pack carried hundreds miles i'd clean forgotten it'
 `then get busy let end down'
 quickly sam unslung pack rummaged indeed bottom coil silkengrey rope made folk l�rien cast end master darkness seemed lift frodo's eyes else sight returning could see grey line came dangling thought faint silver sheen point darkness fix eyes felt less giddy leaning weight forward made end fast round waist grasped line hands
 sam stepped back braced feet stump yard two edge half hauled half scrambling frodo came threw ground
 thunder growled rumbled distance rain still falling heavily hobbits crawled away back gully find much shelter rills water began run soon grew spate splashed fumed stones spouted cliff like gutters vast roof
 `i half drowned washed clean off' said frodo 'what piece luck rope'
 `better luck i'd thought sooner' said sam 'maybe remember putting ropes boats started elvish country took fancy stowed coil pack years ago seems "it may help many needs" said haldir one folk spoke right'
 `a pity think bringing another length' said frodo `but left company hurry confusion enough could use get long rope wonder'
 sam paid slowly measuring arms 'five ten twenty thirty ells less' said
 'who'd thought it' frodo exclaimed
 `ah would ' said sam `elves wonderful folk looks bit thin tough soft milk hand packs close light light wonderful folk sure'
 `thirty ells ' said frodo considering 'i believe would enough storm passes nightfall i'm going try it'
 `the rain's nearly given already' said sam 'but go anything risky dim mr frodo got shriek wind yet like black rider soundedbut one air fly i'm thinking we'd best lay crack till night's over'
 'and i'm thinking spend moment longer need stuck edge eyes dark country looking marshes' said frodo
 stood went bottom gully looked clear sky growing east skirts storm lifting ragged wet main battle passed spread great wings emyn muil upon dark thought sauron brooded thence turned smiting vale anduin hail lightning casting shadow upon minas tirith threat war lowering mountains gathering great spires rolled slowly gondor skirts rohan far away riders plain saw black towers moving behind sun rode west desert reeking marshes deep blue sky evening opened pallid stars appeared like small white holes canopy crescent moon
 `it's good able see again' said frodo breathing deep `do know thought bit lost sight lightning something else worse could see nothing nothing grey rope came seemed shimmer somehow'
 `it look sort silver dark' said sam `never noticed though can't remember i've ever since first stowed set climbing mr frodo going use thirty ells say eighteen fathom that's guess height cliff'
 frodo thought `make fast stump sam ' said `then think shall wish time go first i'll lower need use feet hands fend rock though put weight ledges give rest help i'll follow feel quite now'
 'very well' said sam heavily `if must let's get ' took rope made fast stump nearest brink end tied waist reluctantly turned prepared go edge second time

 however turn half bad expected rope seemed give confidence though shut eyes looked feet one awkward spot ledge wall sheer even undercut short space slipped swung silver line frodo lowered slowly steadily last chief fear ropelength would give still high still good bight frodo's hands sam came bottom called `i'm ' voice came clearly frodo could see grey elvencloak melted twilight
 frodo took rather time follow rope waist fast shortened would pull reached ground still want risk fall quite sam's faith slender grey line found two places trust wholly smooth surfaces hold even strong hobbit fingers ledges far apart last
 `well' cried `we've done we've escaped emyn muil next wonder maybe shall soon sighing good hard rock foot again'
 sam answer staring back cliff `ninnyhammers ' said `noodles beautiful rope tied stump we're bottom nice little stair slinking gollum could leave better put signpost say way we've gone thought seemed bit easy'
 `if think way could used rope yet brought us pass ninnyhammer name gaffer gave you' said frodo `climb untie let want to'
 sam scratched head `no can't think begging pardon' said `but like leaving that's fact' stroked rope's end shook gently `it goes hard parting anything brought elfcountry made galadriel maybe galadriel' murmured nodding head mournfully looked gave one last pull rope farewell
 complete surprise hobbits came loose sam fell long grey coils slithered silently top frodo laughed `who tied rope ' said `a good thing held long think trusted weight knot'
 sam laugh `i may much good climbing mr frodo' said injured tones `but know something rope knots family might say granddad uncle andy gaffer's eldest brother ropewalk tighfield many year put fast hitch stump one could done shire it'
 `then rope must broken � frayed rockedge expect' said frodo
 `i bet ' said sam even injured voice stooped examined ends `nor neither strand'
 'then i'm afraid must knot' said frodo
 sam shook head answer passing rope fingers thoughtfully `have way mr frodo' said last `but think rope came � called' coiled stowed lovingly pack
 'it certainly came' said frodo `and that's chief thing we've got think next move night us soon beautiful stars moon'
 'they cheer heart ' said sam looking 'elvish somehow moon's growing seen night two cloudy weather he's beginning give quite light'
 'yes' said frodo `but full days think we'll try marshes light half moon'
 first shadows night started next stage journey sam turned looked back way come mouth gully black notch dim cliff `i'm glad we've got rope' said 'we've set little puzzle footpad anyhow try nasty flappy feet ledges'
 picked steps away skirts cliff among wilderness boulders rough stones wet slippery heavy rain ground still fell away sharply gone far came upon great fissure yawned suddenly black feet wide wide jump across dim light thought could hear water gurgling depths curved away left northward back towards hills barred road direction rate darkness lasted
 'we better try way back southwards along line cliff think' said sam `we might find nook even cave something'
 'i suppose so' said frodo 'i'm tired think scramble among stones much longer tonight � though grudge delay wish clear path front us i'd go till legs gave way'

 find going easier broken feet emyn muil sam find nook hollow shelter bare stony slopes frowned cliff rose higher sheer went back end worn cast ground lee boulder lying far foot precipice time sat huddled mournfully together cold stony night sleep crept upon spite could hold moon rode high clear thin white light lit faces rocks drenched cold frowning walls cliff turning wide looming darkness chill pale grey scored black shadows
 'well ' said frodo standing drawing cloak closely round `you sleep bit sam take blanket i'll walk sentry while' suddenly stiffened stooping gripped sam arm `what's ' whispered `look cliff'
 sam looked breathed sharply teeth `ssss' said 'that's gollum snakes adders think thought we'd puzzle bit climb look like nasty crawling spider wall'

 face precipice sheer almost smooth seemed pale moonlight small black shape moving thin limbs splayed maybe soft clinging hands toes finding crevices holds hobbit could ever seen used looked creeping sticky pads like large prowling thing insectkind coming head first smelling way lifted head slowly turning right back long skinny neck hobbits caught glimpse two small pale gleaming lights eyes blinked moon moment quickly lidded
 `do think see us ' said sam
 `i know' said frodo quietly `but think hard even friendly eyes see elvencloaks cannot see shadow even paces i've heard like sun moon'
 `then coming ' asked sam
 'quietly sam ' said frodo `he smell us perhaps hear keen elves believe think heard something voices probably lot shouting away back talking far loudly minute ago'
 `well i'm sick him' said sam `he's come often i'm going word suppose could give slip anyway' drawing grey hood well face sam crept stealthily towards cliff
 `careful' whispered frodo coming behind `don't alarm he's much dangerous looks'
 black crawling shape threequarters way perhaps fifty feet less cliff's foot crouching stonestill shadow large boulder hobbits watched seemed come difficult passage troubled something could hear snuffling harsh hiss breath sounded like curse lifted head thought heard spit moved could hear voice creaking whistling
 `ach sss cautious precious haste less speed musstn't rissk neck musst precious precious � _gollum_' lifted head blinked moon quickly shut eyes `we hate it' hissed `nassty nassty shivery light � sss � spies us precious � hurts eyes'
 getting lower hisses became sharper clearer 'where iss iss precious precious wants thieves thieves filthy little thieves precious curse hates them'
 `it sound knew ' whispered sam `and what's precious mean the'
 `hsh ' breathed frodo 'he's getting near near enough hear whisper'
 indeed gollum suddenly paused large head scrawny neck lolling side side listening pale eyes half unlidded sam restrained though fingers twitching eyes filled anger disgust fixed wretched creature began move still whispering hissing
 last dozen feet ground right heads point sheer drop cliff slightly undercut even gollum could find hold kind seemed trying twist round go legs first suddenly shrill whistling shriek fell curled legs arms round like spider whose descending thread snapped
 sam hiding flash crossed space cliff foot couple leaps gollum could get top found gollum bargained even taken like suddenly guard fall sam could get hold long legs arms wound round pinning arms clinging grip soft horribly strong squeezing like slowly tightening cords clammy fingers feeling throat sharp teeth bit shoulder could butt hard round head sideways creature's face gollum hissed spat let go
 things would gone ill sam alone frodo sprang drew sting sheath left hand drew back gollum's head thin lank hair stretching long neck forcing pale venomous eyes stare sky
 `let go gollum' said `this sting seen upon time let go feel time i'll cut throat'
 gollum collapsed went loose wet string sam got fingering shoulder eyes smouldered anger could avenge miserable enemy lay grovelling stones whimpering
 `don't hurt us let hurt us precious hurt us nice little hobbitses mean harm jumps us like cats poor mices precious we're lonely _gollum_ we'll nice nice they'll nice us yes yess'
 `well what's done ' said sam `tie can't come sneaking us say'
 `but would kill us kill us' whimpered gollum `cruel little hobbitses tie us cold hard lands leave us _gollum_ _gollum_' sobs welled gobbling throat
 `no' said frodo `if kill must kill outright can't things poor wretch done us harm'
 `oh ' said sam rubbing shoulder `anyway meant _and_ means i'll warrant throttle us sleep that's plan'
 'i daresay' said frodo `but means another matter' paused thought gollum lay still stopped whimpering sam stood glowering
 seemed frodo heard quite plainly far voices past
 _what pity bilbo stub vile creature chance_
 _pity pity stayed hand pity mercy strike without need_
 _i feel pity gollum deserves death_
 _deserves death daresay many live deserve death die deserve life give eager deal death name justice fearing safety even wise cannot see ends_
 `very well' answered aloud lowering sword 'but still afraid yet see touch creature see pity him'

 sam stared master seemed speaking one gollum lifted head
 'yess wretched precious' whined 'misery misery hobbits kill us nice hobbits'
 'no won't' said frodo `but let go either full wickedness mischief gollum come us that's keep eye must help us one good turn deserves another'
 'yess yes indeed' said gollum sitting 'nice hobbits come find safe paths dark yes going cold hard lands wonders yes wonders ' looked faint light cunning eagerness flickered second pale blinking eyes
 sam scowled sucked teeth seemed sense something odd master's mood matter beyond argument amazed frodo's reply
 frodo looked straight gollum's eyes flinched twisted away `you know guess well enough sm�agol' said quietly sternly `we going mordor course know way believe'
 `ach sss ' said gollum covering ears hands frankness open speaking names hurt `we guessed yes guessed' whispered `and want go precious nice hobbits ashes ashes dust thirst pits pits pits orcs thousands orcses nice hobbits go � sss � places'
 `so ' frodo insisted `and drawn back you'
 `yess yess ' shrieked gollum `once accident precious yes accident go back no' suddenly voice language changed sobbed throat spoke `leave alone _gollum_ hurt poor hands _gollum_ want come back can't find tired can't find _gollum_ _gollum_ nowhere they're always awake dwarves men elves terrible elves bright eyes can't find ach ' got clenched long hand bony fleshless knot shaking towards east 'we ' cried 'not you' collapsed '_gollum_ _gollum_' whimpered face ground 'don't look us go away go sleep'
 `he go away go sleep command sm�agol' said frodo `but really wish free must help fear means finding us path towards need go way beyond gates land'
 gollum sat looked eyelids 'he's there' cackled `always orcs take way easy find orcs east river ask sm�agol poor poor sm�agol went away long ago took precious he's lost now'
 `perhaps we'll find come us' said frodo
 'no never he's lost precious' said gollum
 'get ' said frodo
 gollum stood backed away cliff
 `now ' said frodo 'can find path easier day night we're tired choose night we'll start tonight'
 `the big lights hurt eyes do' gollum whined `not white face yet go behind hills soon yess rest bit first nice hobbits'
 `then sit down' said frodo `and move'

 hobbits seated beside one either side backs stony wall resting legs need arrangement word knew must sleep moment slowly moon went shadows fell hills grew dark stars grew thick bright sky one stirred gollum sat legs drawn knees chin flat hands feet splayed ground eyes closed seemed tense thinking listening
 frodo looked across sam eyes met understood relaxed leaning heads back shutting eyes seeming soon sound soft breathing could heard gollum's hands twitched little hardly perceptibly head moved left right first one eye opened slit hobbits made sign
 suddenly startling agility speed straight ground jump like grasshopper frog gollum bounded forward darkness frodo sam expected sam gone two paces spring frodo coming behind grabbed leg threw
 'your rope might prove useful sam' said
 sam got rope 'and cold hard lands mr gollum' growled 'we wonders aye wonders find orcfriends warrant nasty treacherous creature round neck rope ought go tight noose too'
 gollum lay quiet tried tricks answer sam gave swift venomous look
 `all need something keep hold him' said frodo 'we want walk good tying legsor arms seems use nearly much tie one end ankle keep grip end'
 stood gollum sam tied knot result surprised gollum began scream thin tearing sound horrible hear writhed tried get mouth ankle bite rope kept screaming
 last frodo convinced really pain could knot examined found tight indeed hardly tight enough sam gentler words 'what's matter ' said `if try run away must tied wish hurt you'
 'it hurts us hurts us' hissed gollum `it freezes bites elves twisted curse nasty cruel hobbits that's tries escape course precious guessed cruel hobbits visits elves fierce elves bright eyes take us hurts us'
 `no take you' said frodo `not unless' � paused moment thought � `not unless promise make trust'
 'we swear wants yes yess said gollum still twisting grabbling ankle `it hurts us'
 `swear ' said frodo
 'sm�agol' said gollum suddenly clearly opening eyes wide staring frodo strange light 'sm�agol swear precious'
 frodo drew sam startled words stern voice 'on precious dare ' said 'think

 one ring rule darkness bind

 would commit promise sm�agol hold treacherous may twist words beware'
 gollum cowered 'on precious precious ' repeated
 `and would swear ' asked frodo
 `to good' said gollum crawling frodo's feet grovelled whispering hoarsely shudder ran words shook bones fear 'sm�agol swear never never let never sm�agol save must swear precious'
 'no it' said frodo looking stern pity 'all wish see touch though know would drive mad swear know yes know sm�agol you'
 moment appeared sam master grown gollum shrunk tall stern shadow mighty lord hid brightness grey cloud feet little whining dog yet two way akin alien could reach one another's minds gollum raised began pawing frodo fawning knees
 'down ' said frodo `now speak promise'
 `we promises yes promise' said gollum 'i serve master precious good master good sm�agol _gollum_ _gollum_' suddenly began weep bite ankle
 'take rope sam' said frodo
 reluctantly sam obeyed gollum got began prancing like whipped cur whose master patted moment change lasted time came spoke less hissing whining spoke companions direct precious self would cringe flinch stepped near made sudden movement avoided touch elvencloaks friendly indeed pitifully anxious please would cackle laughter caper jest made even frodo spoke kindly weep frodo rebuked sam said little sort suspected deeply ever possible liked new gollum sm�agol less old
 'well gollum whatever we're call you' said 'now moon's gone night's going we'd better start'
 'yes yes' agreed gollum skipping 'off go there's one way across northend southend found orcs use orcs know orcs cross marshes go round miles miles lucky came way lucky found sm�agol yes follow sm�agol'
 took steps away looked back inquiringly like dog inviting walk 'wait bit gollum' cried sam `not far ahead i'm going tail i've got rope handy'
 'no ' said gollum 'sm�agol promised'
 deep night hard clear stars set gollum led back northward along way come slanted right away steep edge emyn muil broken stony slopes towards vast fens faded swiftly softly darkness leagues waste gates mordor black silence


 _chapter 2_
 passage marshes

 gollum moved quickly head neck thrust forward often using hands well feet frodo sam hard put keep seemed longer thought escaping fell behind would turn wait time brought brink narrow gully struck hills
 `here is' cried 'there way inside yes follows � away there' pointed south east towards marshes reek came nostrils heavy foul even cool night air 
 gollum cast along brink length called `here get sm�agol went way went way hiding orcs'
 led way following hobbits climbed gloom difficult rift point fifteen feet deep dozen across running water bottom fact bed one many small rivers trickled hills feed stagnant pools mires beyond gollum turned right southward less splashed along feet shallow stony stream seemed greatly delighted feel water chuckled sometimes even croaking sort song

 cold hard lands
 bites hands
 gnaws feet

 'ha ha wish' said looking sidelong hobbits 'we'll tell you' croaked `he guessed long ago baggins guessed it' glint came eyes sam catching gleam darkness thought far pleasant

 alive without breath
 cold death
 never thirsting ever drinking
 clad mail never clinking
 drowns dry land

 words made pressing sam's mind problem troubling moment understood hir master going adopt gollum guide problem food occur master might also thought hut supposed gollum indeed gollum kept lonely wandering 'not well' thought sam 'he looks fair famished dainty try hobbit tastes like ain't fish i'll wager � supposing could catch us napping well sam gamgee one'
 stumbled along dark winding gully long time seemed tired feet frodo sam gully turned eastward went broadened got gradually shallower last sky grew faint first grey morning gollum shown signs tiring looked halted
 `day near' whispered day something might overhear spring `sm�agol stay stay yellow face see me'
 `we glad see sun' said frodo `but stay tired go present'
 `you wise glad yellow face' said gollum `it shows nice sensible hobbits stay sm�agol orcs nasty things see long way stay hide '
 three settled rest foot rocky wall gully much tall man's height base wide flat shelves dry stone water ran channel side frodo sam sat one flats resting backs gollum paddled scrabbled stream
 `we must take little food' said frodo `are hungry sm�agol little share spare can'
 word _hungry_ greenish light kindled gollum's pale eyes seemed protrude ever thin sickly face moment relapsed old gollummanner 'we famisshed yes famisshed precious' said `what eats nice fisshes ' tongue lolled sharp yellow teeth licking colourless lips
 `no got fish' said frodo `we got this' � held wafer _lembas_ � 'and water water fit drink'
 `yess yess nice water' said gollum `drink drink they've got precious crunchable tasty '
 frodo broke portion wafer handed leafwrapping gollum sniffed leaf face changed spasm disgust came hint old malice `sm�agol smells ' said `leaves elfcountry gah stinks climbed trees wash smell hands nice hands' dropping leaf took corner _lembas_ nibbled spat fit coughing shook
 `ach ' spluttered `you try choke poor sm�agol dust ashes can't eat must starve sm�agol mind nice hobbits sm�agol promised starve can't eat hobbits' food starve poor thin sm�agol '
 `i'm sorry' said frodo `but can't help i'm afraid think food would good would try perhaps can't even try yet anyway'

 hobbits munched _lembas_ silence sam thought tasted far better somehow good gollum's behaviour made attend flavour feel comfortable gollum watched every morsel hand mouth like expectant dog diner's chair finished preparing rest apparently convinced hidden dainties could share went sat paces away whimpered little
 'look ' sam whispered frodo softly really care whether gollum heard `we've got get sleep together hungry villain nigh promise promise sm�agol gollum change habits hurry i'll warrant go sleep mr frodo i'll call can't keep eyelids propped turn he's loose'
 'perhaps right sam' said frodo speaking openly 'there _is_ change kind change deep i'm sure yet seriously though think need fear � present still watch wish give two hours call me'
 tired frodo head fell forward breast slept almost soon spoken words gollum seemed longer fears curled went quickly sleep quite unconcerned presently breath hissing softly clenched teeth hut lay still stone fearing would drop sat listening two companions breathing sam got gently prodded gollum hands uncurled twitched made movement sam bent said _fissh_ close ear response even catch gollum's breathing
 sam scratched head `must really asleep' muttered `and like gollum wake never again' restrained thoughts sword rope sprang mind went sat master

 woke sky dim lighter darker breakfasted sam leapt feet least feeling vigour hunger suddenly understood slept daylight away nine hours least frodo still fast asleep lying stretched side gollum seen various reproachful names came sam's mind drawn gaffer's large paternal wordhoard also occurred master right present nothing guard rate alive unthrottled
 'poor wretch ' said half remorsefully 'now wonder he's got '
 'not far far ' said voice looked saw shape gollum's large head ears evening sky
 'here ' cried sam suspicions coming back soon saw shape
 `sm�agol hungry' said gollum `be back soon'
 'come back now' shouted sam 'hi come back' gollum vanished
 frodo woke sound sam's shout sat rubbing eyes 'hullo' said 'anything wrong what's time'
 'i dunno' said sam 'after sundown reckon he's gone says he's hungry'
 `don't worry' said frodo `there's help he'll come back see promise hold yet leave precious anyway'
 frodo made light learned slept soundly hours gollum hungry gollum loose beside `don't think gaffer's hard names' said 'you worn turned well rested hard road ahead worst road all'
 `about food' said sam 'how long's going take us job done going waybread keeps legs wonderful way though satisfy innards proper might say feeling anyhow meaning disrespect made eat every day grow reckon we've got enough last say three weeks tight belt light tooth mind we've bit free far'
 `i know long shall take � finish' said frodo `we miserably delayed hills samwise gamgee dear hobbit � indeed sam dearest hobbit friend friends � think need give thought comes _do job_ put � hope ever shall knows come one goes fire hand ask sam ever likely need bread think nurse limbs bring us mount doom begin feel'
 sam nodded silently took master's hand bent kiss though tears fell turned away drew sleeve nose got stamped trying whistle saying efforts 'where's dratted creature'
 actually long gollum returned came quietly hear till stood fingers face soiled black mud still chewing slavering chewing ask like think
 'worms beetles something slimy holes' thought sam 'brr nasty creature poor wretch '
 gollum said nothing drunk deeply washed stream came licking lips 'better now' said `are rested ready go nice hobbits sleep beautifully trust sm�agol good'

 next stage journey much last went gully became ever shallower slope floor gradual bottom less stony earthy slowly sides dwindled mere banks began wind wander night drew end clouds moon star knew coming day slow spreading thin grey light
 chill hour came end watercourse banks became mossgrown mounds last shelf rotting stone stream gurgled fell brown bog lost dry reeds hissed rattled though could feel wind

 either side front wide fens mires lay stretching away southward eastward dim halflight mists curled smoked dark noisome pools reek hung stifling still air far away almost due south mountainwalls mordor loomed like black bar rugged clouds floating dangerous fogbound sea
 hobbits wholly hands gollum know could guess misty light fact within northern borders marshes main expanse lay south could known lands delay retraced steps little turning east come round hard roads bare plain dagorlad field ancient battle gates mordor great hope course stony plain cover across ran highways orcs soldiers enemy even cloaks l�rien would concealed
 'how shape course sm�agol ' asked frodo 'must cross evilsmelling fens '
 `no need need all' said gollum 'not hobbits want reach dark mountains go see quick back little round little' � skinny arm waved north east � `and come hard cold roads gates country lots people looking guests pleased take straight yes eye watches way time caught sm�agol long ago' gollum shuddered 'but sm�agol used eyes since yes yes i've used eyes feet nose since know ways difficult quick better want see follow sm�agol take marshes mists nice thick mists follow sm�agol carefully may go long way quite long way catches yes perhaps'

 already day windless sullen morning marshreeks lay heavy banks sun pierced low clouded sky gollum seemed anxious continue journey brief rest set soon lost shadowy silent world cut view lands either hills left mountains sought went slowly single file gollum sam frodo
 frodo seemed weary three slow though went often lagged hobbits soon found looked like one vast fen really endless network pools soft mires winding halfstrangled watercourses among cunning eye foot could thread wandering path gollum certainly cunning needed head long neck ever turning way sniffed muttered time sometimes would hold hand halt went forward little crouching testing ground fingers toes merely listening one ear pressed earth
 dreary wearisome cold clammy winter still held sway forsaken country green scum livid weed dark greasy surfaces sullen waters dead grasses rotting reeds loomed mists like ragged shadows longforgotten summers
 day wore light increased little mists lifted growing thinner transparent far rot vapours world sun riding high golden serene country floors dazzling foam passing ghost could see bleared pale giving colour warmth even faint reminder presence gollum scowled flinched halted journey rested squatting like little hunted animals borders great brown reedthicket deep silence scraped surfaces faint quiver empty seedplumes broken grassblades trembling small airmovements could feel
 'not bird ' said sam mournfully
 `no birds' said gollum `nice birds ' licked teeth 'no birds snakeses wormses things pools lots things lots nasty things birds' ended sadly sam looked distaste

 passed third day journey gollum shadows evening long happier lands went always brief halts made much rest help gollum even go forward great care sometimes loss come midst dead marshes dark
 walked slowly stooping keeping close line following attentively every move gollum made fens grew wet opening wide stagnant meres among grew difficult find firmer places feet could tread without sinking gurgling mud travellers light maybe none would ever found way
 presently grew altogether dark air seemed black heavy breathe lights appeared sam rubbed eyes thought head going queer first saw one corner left eye wisp pale sheen faded away others appeared soon like dimly shining smoke like misty flames flickering slowly unseen candles twisted like ghostly sheets unfurled hidden hands neither companions spoke word
 last sam could bear longer `what's gollum ' said whisper `these lights they're round us trapped '
 gollum looked dark water crawling ground way doubtful way 'yes round us' whispered 'the tricksy lights candles corpses yes yes heed look follow where's master '
 sam looked back found frodo lagged could see went paces back darkness daring move far call hoarse whisper suddenly stumbled frodo standing lost thought looking pale lights hands hung stiff sides water slime dripping
 `come mr frodo ' said sam 'don't look gollum says let's keep get cursed place quick � '
 `all right' said frodo returning dream 'i'm coming go '
 hurrying forward sam tripped catching foot old root tussock fell came heavily hands sank deep sticky ooze face brought close surface dark mere faint hiss noisome smell went lights flickered danced swirled moment water looked like window glazed grimy glass peering wrenching hands bog sprang back cry 'there dead things dead faces water' said horror 'dead faces '
 gollum laughed 'the dead marshes yes yes names' cackled `you look candles lit'
 `who ' asked sam shuddering turning frodo behind
 'i know' said frodo dreamlike voice 'but seen pools candles lit lie pools pale faces deep deep dark water saw grim faces evil noble faces sad many faces proud fair weeds silver hair foul rotting dead fell light them' frodo hid eyes hands 'i know thought saw men elves orcs beside them'
 `yes yes' said gollum `all dead rotten elves men orcs dead marshes great battle long ago yes told sm�agol young young precious came great battle tall men long swords terrible elves orcses shrieking fought plain days months black gates marshes grown since swallowed graves always creeping creeping'
 'but age ago' said sam 'the dead can't really devilry hatched dark land '
 `who knows sm�agol know' answered gollum 'you cannot reach cannot touch tried yes precious tried cannot reach shapes see perhaps touch precious dead'
 sam looked darkly shuddered thinking guessed sm�agol tried touch `well want see them' said 'never can't get get away '
 `yes yes' said gollum `but slowly slowly carefully hobbits go join dead ones light little candles follow sm�agol look lights '

 crawled away right seeking path round mere came close behind stooping often using hands even 'three precious little gollums row shall goes much longer' thought sam
 last came end black mere crossed perilously crawling hopping one treacherous island tussock another often floundered stepping falling handsfirst waters noisome cesspool till slimed fouled almost necks stank one another's nostrils
 late night length reached firmer ground gollum hissed whispered appeared pleased mysterious way blended sense feel smell uncanny memory shapes dark seemed know sure road ahead
 `now go ' said 'nice hobbits brave hobbits weary course precious us must take master away wicked lights yes yes must' words started almost trot appeared long lane high reeds stumbled quickly could little stopped suddenly sniffed air doubtfully hissing troubled displeased
 'what ' growled sam misinterpreting signs `what's need sniff stink nearly knocks nose held stink master stinks whole place stinks'
 'yes yes sam stinks ' answered gollum `poor sm�agol smells good sm�agol bears helps nice master that's matter air's moving change coming sm�agol wonders he's happy'

 went uneasiness grew every stood full height craning neck eastward southward time hobbits could hear feel troubling suddenly three halted stiffening listening frodo sam seemed heard far away long wailing cry high thin cruel shivered moment stirring air became perceptible grew cold stood straining ears heard noise like wind coming distance misty lights wavered dimmed went
 gollum would move stood shaking gibbering rush wind came upon hissing snarling marshes night became less dark light enough see half see shapeless drifts fog curling twisting rolled passed looking saw clouds breaking shredding high south moon glimmered riding flying wrack
 moment sight gladdened hearts hobbits gollum cowered muttering curses white face frodo sam staring sky breathing deeply fresher air saw come small cloud flying accursed hills black shadow loosed mordor vast shape winged ominous scudded across moon deadly cry went away westward outrunning wind fell speed
 fell forward grovelling heedlessly cold earth shadow horror wheeled returned passing lower right sweeping fenreek ghastly wings gone flying back mordor speed wrath sauron behind wind roared away leaving dead marshes bare bleak naked waste far eye could pierce even distant menace mountains dappled fitful moonlight
 frodo sam got rubbing eyes like children wakened evil dream find familiar night still world gollum lay ground stunned roused difficulty time would lift face knelt forward elbows covering back head large flat hands
 `wraiths' wailed `wraiths wings precious master see everything everything nothing hide curse white face tell everything sees knows ach _gollum_ _gollum_ _gollum_ ' moon sunk westering far beyond tol brandir would get make move

 time sam thought sensed change gollum fawning wouldbe friendly sam surprised strange looks eyes times especially towards frodo went back old manner speaking sam another growing anxiety frodo seemed weary weary point exhaustion said nothing indeed hardly spoke complain walked like one carries load weight ever increasing dragged along slower slower sam often beg gollum wait leave master behind
 fact every step towards gates mordor frodo felt ring chain neck grow burdensome beginning feel actual weight dragging earthwards far troubled eye called drag ring made cower stoop walked eye horrible growing sense hostile strove great power pierce shadows cloud earth flesh see pin deadly gaze naked immovable thin frail thin veils become still warded frodo knew present habitation heart certainly man tell direction sun eyes shut facing potency beat upon brow
 gollum probably felt something sort went wretched heart pressure eye lust ring near grovelling promise made half fear cold iron hobbits guess frodo gave thought sam's mind occupied mostly master hardly noticing dark cloud fallen heart put frodo front kept watchful eye every movement supporting stumbled trying encourage clumsy words

 day came last hobbits surprised see much closer ominous mountains already drawn air clearer colder though still far walls mordor longer cloudy menace edge sight grim black towers frowned across dismal waste marshes end dying away dead peats wide flats dry cracked mud land ahead rose long shallow slopes barren pitiless towards desert lay sauron's gate
 grey light lasted cowered black stone like worms shrinking lest winged terror pass spy cruel eyes remainder journey shadow growing fear memory could find nothing rest upon two nights struggled weary pathless land air seemed grew harsh filled bitter reek caught breath parched mouths
 last fifth morning since took road gollum halted dark dawn great mountains reached roofs smoke cloud feet flung huge buttresses broken hills nearest scarce dozen miles away frodo looked round horror dreadful dead marshes arid moors nomanlands loathsome far country crawling day slowly unveiled shrinking eyes even mere dead faces haggard phantom green spring would come neither spring summer would ever come nothing lived even leprous growths feed rottenness gasping pools choked ash crawling muds sickly white grey mountains vomited filth entrails upon lands high mounds crushed powdered rock great cones earth fireblasted poisonstained stood like obscene graveyard endless rows slowly revealed reluctant light
 come desolation lay mordor lasting monument dark labour slaves endure purposes made void land defiled diseased beyond healing � unless great sea enter wash oblivion `i feel sick' said sam frodo speak
 stood like men edge sleep nightmare lurks holding though know come morning shadows light broadened hardened gasping pits poisonous mounds grew hideously clear sun walking among clouds long flags smoke even sunlight defiled hobbits welcome light unfriendly seemed revealing helplessness � little squeaking ghosts wandered among ashheaps dark lord

 weary go sought place could rest sat without speaking shadow mound slag foul fumes leaked catching throats choking gollum first get spluttering cursing rose without word glance hobbits crawled away fours frodo sam crawled came wide almost circular pit highbanked upon west cold dead foul sump oily manycoloured ooze lay bottom evil hole cowered hoping shadow escape attention eye
 day passed slowly great thirst troubled drank drops bottleslast filled gully looked back thought seemed place peace beauty hobbits took turn watch first tired neither could sleep sun far away climbing slow moving cloud sam dozed frodo's turn bc guard lay back slope pit ease sense burden looked smokestreaked sky saw strange phantoms dark riding shapes faces past lost count time hovering sleep waking forgetfulness came
 suddenly sam woke thinking heard master calling evening frodo could called fallen asleep slid nearly bottom pit gollum moment sam thought trying rouse frodo saw gollum talking sm�agol holding debate thought used voice made squeak hiss pale light green light alternated eyes spoke
 `sm�agol promised' said first thought
 `yes yes precious' came answer 'we promised save precious let � never going yes nearer every step what's hobbit going wonders yes wonders'
 `i know can't help master's got sm�agol promised help master'
 `yes yes help master master precious master could help ourselfs yes still keep promises'
 `but sm�agol said would good nice hobbit took cruel rope sm�agol's leg speaks nicely me'
 'very good eh precious let's good good fish sweet one ourselfs hurt nice hobbit course no'
 `but precious holds promise' voice sm�agol objected
 `then take it' said `and let's hold ourselfs shall master _gollum_ make hobbit nasty suspicious hobbit make crawl yes _gollum_'
 `but nice hobbit '
 `oh please us still he's baggins precious yes baggins baggins stole found said nothing nothing hates bagginses'
 'no baggins'
 'yes every baggins peoples keep precious must '
 `but he'll see he'll know he'll take us '
 'he sees knows heard us make silly promises � orders yes must take wraiths searching must take it'
 'not '
 'no sweet one see precious escape even eh perhaps grows strong stronger wraiths lord sm�agol gollum great _the_ gollum eat fish every day three times day fresh sea precious gollum must wants wants wants '
 'but there's two they'll wake quick kill us' whined sm�agol last effort `not yet'
 'we wants but' � long pause new thought wakened `not yet eh perhaps might help might yes'
 `no way ' wailed sm�agol
 `yes wants wants '
 time second thought spoke gollum's long hand crept slowly pawing towards frodo drawn back jerk sm�agol spoke finally arms long fingers flexed twitching clawed towards neck

 sam lain still fascinated debate watching every move gollum made halfclosed eyelids simple mind ordinary hunger desire eat hobbits seemed chief danger gollum realized gollum feeling terrible call ring dark lord _he_ course sam wondered _she_ one nasty friends little wretch made wanderings supposed forgot point things plainly gone far enough getting dangerous great heaviness limbs roused effort sat something warned careful reveal overheard debate let loud sigh gave huge yawn
 `what's time ' said sleepily
 gollum sent long hiss teeth stood moment tense menacing collapsed falling forward fours crawling bank pit 'nice hobbits nice sam ' said 'sleepy heads yes sleepy heads leave good sm�agol watch evening dusk creeping time go'
 `high time ' thought sam 'and time parted too' yet crossed mind wonder indeed gollum dangerous turned loose kept 'curse wish choked' muttered stumbled bank roused master
 strangely enough frodo felt refreshed dreaming dark shadow passed fair vision visited land disease nothing remained memory yet felt glad lighter heart burden less heavy gollum welcomed doglike delight chuckled chattered cracking long fingers pawing frodo's knees frodo smiled
 'come ' said `you guided us well faithfully last stage bring us gate ask go bring us gate may go wish � enemies'
 'to gate eh' gollum squeaked seeming surprised frightened 'to gate master says yes says good sm�agol asks yes gets closer we'll see perhaps we'll see look nice no'
 'go ' said sam `let's get '

 falling dusk scrambled pit slowly threaded way dead land gone far felt fear fallen winged shape swept marshes halted cowering evilsmelling ground saw nothing gloomy evening sky soon menace passed high overhead going maybe swift errand baradd�r gollum got crept forward muttering shaking
 hour midnight fear fell third time seemed remote passing far clouds rushing terrible speed west gollum however helpless terror convinced hunted approach known
 `three times ' whimpered 'three times threat feel us feel precious precious master cannot go way use use '
 pleading kind words longer avail frodo commanded angrily laid hand swordhilt gollum would get last rose snarl went like beaten dog
 stumbled weary end night coming another day fear walked silence bowed heads seeing nothing hearing nothing wind hissing ears


 _chapter 3_
 black gate closed

 next day dawned journey mordor marshes desert behind darkling pallid sky great mountains reared threatening heads
 upon west mordor marched gloomy range ephel d�ath mountains shadow upon north broken peaks barren ridges ered lithui grey ash ranges approached one another indeed parts one great wall mournful plains lithlad gorgoroth bitter inland sea n�rnen amidmost swung long arms northward arms deep defile cirith gorgor haunted pass entrance land enemy high cliffs lowered upon either side thrust forward mouth two sheer hills blackboned bare upon stood teeth mordor two towers strong tall days long past built men gondor pride power overthrow sauron flight lest seek return old realm strength gondor failed men slept long years towers stood empty sauron returned watchtowers fallen decay repaired filled arms garrisoned ceaseless vigilance stonyfaced dark windowholes staring north east west window full sleepless eyes
 across mouth pass cliff cliff dark lord built rampart stone single gate iron upon battlement sentinels paced unceasingly beneath hills either side rock bored hundred caves maggotholes host orcs lurked ready signal issue forth like black ants going war none could pass teeth mordor feel bite unless summoned sauron knew secret passwords would open morannon black gate land
 two hobbits gazed towers wall despair even distance could see dim light movement black guards upon wall patrols gate lay peering edge rocky hollow beneath outstretched shadow northmost buttress ephel d�ath winging heavy air straight flight crow maybe would flown furlong hidingplace black summit nearer tower faint smoke curled fire smouldered hill beneath

 day came fallow sun blinked lifeless ridges ered lithui suddenly cry brazenthroated trumpets heard watchtowers blared far away hidden holds outposts hills came answering calls still remote deep ominous echoed hollow land beyond mighty horns drums baradd�r another dreadful day fear toil come mordor nightguards summoned dungeons deep halls dayguards evileyed fell marching posts steel gleamed dimly battlement

 `well ' said sam `here's gate looks that's far ever going get word gaffer would thing two say saw often said i'd come bad end watch step suppose i'll ever see old fellow he'll miss chance _i told'ee sam_ more's pity could go telling long he'd got breath could see old face i'd get wash first know
 `i suppose good asking "what way go now" can't go furtherunless want ask orcs lift'
 `no ' said gollum `no use can't go sm�agol said said we'll go gate we'll see see yes precious see sm�agol knew hobbits could go way yes sm�agol knew '
 'then plague bring us ' said sam feeling mood reasonable
 `master said master says bring us gate good sm�agol master said wise master'
 'i did' said frodo face grim set resolute filthy haggard pinched weariness cowered longer eyes clear `i said purpose enter mordor know way therefore shall go way ask anyone go me'
 `no master ' wailed gollum pawing seeming great distress `no use way use take precious he'll eat us gets eat world keep nice master kind sm�agol let go away go nice places give back little sm�agol yes yes master give back eh sm�agol keep safe lots good especially nice hobbits hobbits go home go gate '
 'i commanded go land mordor therefore shall go' said frodo 'if one way must take comes must come'

 sam said nothing look frodo's face enough knew words useless never real hope affair beginning cheerful hobbit needed hope long despair could postponed come bitter end stuck master way chiefly come would still stick master would go mordor alone sam would go himand rate would get rid gollum
 gollum however intend got rid yet knelt frodo's feet wringing hands squeaking 'not way master ' pleaded 'there another way yes indeed another way darker difficult find secret sm�agol knows let sm�agol show '
 'another way ' said frodo doubtfully looking gollum searching eyes
 'yess yess indeed _was_ another way sm�agol found let's go see still '
 `you spoken before'
 `no master ask master say meant tell poor sm�agol says sm�agol take gate � good bye sm�agol run away good says purpose enter mordor way sm�agol afraid want lose nice master promised master made promise save precious master going take straight black hand master go way sm�agol must save thinks another way upon time nice master sm�agol good always helps'

 sam frowned could bored holes gollum eyes would done mind full doubt appearances gollum genuinely distressed anxious help frodo sam remembering overheard debate found hard believe long submerged sm�agol come top voice rate last word debate sam's guess sm�agol gollum halves mind called slinker stinker made truce temporary alliance neither wanted enemy get ring wished keep frodo capture eye long possible � rate long stinker still chance laying hands 'precious' whether really another way mordor sam doubted
 `and good thing neither half old villain know master means do' thought `if knew mr frodo trying put end precious good there'd trouble pretty quick bet anyhow old stinker frightened enemy � he's orders kind � he'd give us away rather caught helping us rather let precious melted maybe least that's idea hope master think carefully he's wise he's softhearted that's beyond gamgee guess he'll next'
 frodo answer gollum doubts passing sam's slow shrewd mind stood gazing towards dark cliff cirith gorgor hollow taken refuge delved side low hill little height long trenchlike valley lay outer buttresses mountains midst valley stood black foundations western watchtower morninglight roads converged upon gate mordor could clearly seen pale dusty one winding back northwards another dwindling eastwards mists clung feet ered lithui third ran towards bent sharply round tower entered narrow defile passed far hollow stood westward right turned skirting shoulders mountains went southwards deep shadows mantled western sides ephel d�ath beyond sight journeyed narrow land mountains great river
 gazed frodo became aware great stir movement plain seemed whole armies march though part hidden reeks fumes drifting fens wastes beyond caught gleam spears helmets levels beside roads horsemen could seen riding many companies remembered vision afar upon amon hen days though seemed many years ago knew hope one wild moment stirred heart vain trumpets rung challenge greeting assault upon dark lord men gondor risen like avenging ghosts graves valour long passed away men race wide eastlands gathering summons overlord armies encamped gate night marched swell mounting power suddenly made fully aware peril position alone growing light day near vast menace frodo quickly drew frail grey hood close upon head stepped dell turned gollum
 `sm�agol' said `i trust indeed seems must fate receive help least looked fate help long pursued evil purpose far deserved well kept promise truly truly say mean' added glance sam 'for twice power done harm us tried take sought may third time prove best warn sm�agol danger'
 `yes yes master ' said gollum `dreadful danger sm�agol's bones shake think run away must help nice master'
 'i mean danger share' said frodo 'i mean danger alone swore promise call precious remember hold seek way twist undoing already twisted revealed foolishly_ give back sm�agol_ said say let thought grow never get back desire may betray bitter end never get back last need sm�agol put precious precious mastered long ago wearing command would obey even leap precipice cast fire would command care sm�agol'

 frodo waited patiently spoke less sternly `come gollum sm�agol wish tell way show hope enough justify turning aside plain path haste'
 gollum pitiable state frodo's threat quite unnerved easy get clear account amid mumblings squeakings frequent interruptions crawled floor begged kind `poor little sm�agol' grew little calmer frodo gathered bit bit traveller followed road turned west ephel d�ath would come time crossing circle dark trees right road went osgiliath bridges anduin middle road went southwards
 `on on' said gollum `we never went way say goes hundred leagues see great water never still lots fishes big birds eat fishes nice birds never went alas never chance still lands say yellow face hot seldom clouds men fierce dark faces want see land'
 `no ' said frodo `but wander road third turning '
 `o yes yes third way' said gollum `that road left begins climb winding climbing back towards tall shadows turns round black rock see suddenly see want hide'
 `see see see '
 `the old fortress old horrible used hear tales south sm�agol young long ago yes used tell lots tales evening sitting banks great river willowlands river younger _gollum_ _gollum_' began weep mutter hobbits waited patiently
 `tales south' gollum went `about tall men shining eyes houses like hills stone silver crown king white tree wonderful tales built tall towers one raised silverwhite stone like moon round great white walls yes many tales tower moon'
 `that would minas ithil isildur son elendil built ' said frodo `it isildur cut finger enemy'
 `yes four black hand enough' said gollum shuddering 'and hated isildur's city'
 'what hate ' said frodo 'but tower moon us '
 'well master tall tower white houses wall nice beautiful conquered long ago terrible place travellers shiver see creep sight avoid shadow master go way way mountains lower old road goes reaches dark pass top goes � gorgoroth' voice sank whisper shuddered
 `but help us ' asked sam `surely enemy knows mountains road guarded close tower empty '
 `o empty ' whispered gollum `it seems empty dreadful things live orcs yes always orcs worse things worse things live road climbs right shadow walls passes gate nothing moves road know things inside know silent watchers'
 `so that's advice it' said sam 'that go another long march south find fix worse one get ever '
 `no indeed' said gollum `hobbits must see must try understand expect attack way eye round attends places others can't see everything yet see conquered country west shadowy mountains river holds bridges thinks one come moontower without fighting big battle bridges getting lots boats cannot hide know about'
 'you seem know lot he's thinking' said sam `have talking lately hobnobbing orcs '
 'not nice hobbit sensible' said gollum giving sam angry glance turning frodo 'sm�agol talked orcs yes course met master many peoples walked far says many peoples saying north big danger us come black gate one day one day soon way big armies come away west afraid silent watchers'
 `just ' said sam put `and walk knock gate ask we're right road mordor silent answer sense might well save long tramp'
 'don't make jokes it' hissed gollum `it funny amusing nut sense try get mordor master says _i must go_ _i go_ must try way must go terrible city course sm�agol helps nice sm�agol though one tells sm�agol helps found knows it'
 'what find ' asked frodo
 gollum crouched voice sank whisper 'a little path leading mountains stair narrow stair yes long narrow stairs then' � voice sank even lower � `a tunnel dark tunnel last little cleft path high main pass way sm�agol got darkness years ago path may vanished perhaps perhaps not'
 `i like sound all' said sam `sounds easy rate telling path still it'll guarded guarded gollum ' said caught fancied caught green gleam gollum's eye gollum muttered reply
 'is guarded ' asked frodo sternly `and _escape_ darkness sm�agol rather permitted depart upon errand least w hat aragorn thought found dead marshes years ago'
 'it's lie ' hissed gollum evil light came eyes naming aragorn `he lied yes escape poor self indeed told seek precious searched searched course black one precious mine tell escape'
 frodo felt strange certainty matter gollum far truth might suspected somehow found way mordor least believed cunning one thing noted gollum used seemed usually sign rare appearances remnants old truth sincerity moment top even gollum could trusted point frodo forget wiles enemy 'escape' may allowed arranged well known dark tower case gollum plainly keeping good deal back
 'i ask again' said `is secret way guarded '
 name aragorn put gollum sullen mood injured air liar suspected told truth part answer
 'is guarded ' frodo repeated
 `yes yes perhaps safe places country' said gollum sulkily 'no safe places master must try go home  way' could get say name perilous place high pass could tell would
 name cirith ungol name dreadful rumour aragorn could perhaps told name significance gandalf would warned alone aragorn far away gandalf stood amid ruin isengard strove saruman delayed treason yet even spoke last words saruman _palant�r_ crashed fire upon steps orthanc thought ever upon frodo samwise long leagues mind sought hope pity
 maybe frodo felt knowing upon amon hen even though believed gandalf gone gone ever shadow moria far away sat upon ground long silent head bowed striving recall gandalf said choice could recall counsel indeed gandalf's guidance taken soon soon dark land still far away enter last gandalf said perhaps could say stronghold enemy north dol guldur ventured mordor mountain fire baradd�r since dark lord rose power ever journeyed frodo think little halfling shire simple hobbit quiet countryside expected find way great ones could go dared go evil fate taken sittingroom faroff spring another year remote like chapter story world's youth trees silver gold still bloom evil choice way choose led terror death good lay choice

 day drew deep silence fell upon little grey hollow lay near borders land fear silence could felt thick veil cut world dome pale sky barred fleeting smoke seemed high far away seen great deeps air heavy brooding thought
 even eagle poised sun would marked hobbits sitting weight doom silent  moving shrouded thin grey cloaks moment might paused consider gollum tiny figure sprawling ground perhaps lay famished skeleton child men ragged garment still clinging long arms legs almost bonewhite bonethin flesh worth peck
 frodo's head bowed knees sam leaned back hands behind head staring hood empty sky least long empty presently sam thought saw dark birdlike figure wheel circle sight hover wheel away two followed fourth small look yet knew somehow huge vast stretch pinion flying great height covered eyes bent forward cowering warning fear felt presence black riders helpless horror come cry wind shadow moon though crushing compelling menace remote menace frodo felt thought broken stirred shivered look gollum huddled together like cornered spider winged shapes wheeled stooped swiftly speeding back mordor
 sam took deep breath `the riders air' said hoarse whisper 'i saw think could see us high black riders can't see much daylight '
 'no perhaps not' said frodo `but steeds could see winged creatures ride probably see creature like great carrion birds looking something enemy watch fear'
 feeling dread passed enfolding silence broken time cut world invisible island laid bare peril returned still frodo speak gollum make choice eyes closed dreaming looking inward heart memory last stirred stood seemed speak decide `hark' said `what that'

 new fear upon heard singing hoarse shouting first seemed long way drew nearer coming towards leaped minds black wings spied sent armed soldiers seize speed seemed great terrible servants sauron crouched listening voices clink weapons harness close frodo sam loosened small swords sheaths flight impossible
 gollum rose slowly crawled insectlike lip hollow cautiously raised inch inch could peer two broken points stone remained without moving time making sound presently voices began recede slowly faded away far horn blew ramparts morannon quietly gollum drew back slipped hollow
 'more men going mordor' said low voice `dark faces seen men like sm�agol fierce black eyes long black hair gold rings ears yes lots beautiful gold red paint cheeks red cloaks flags red tips spears round shields yellow black big spikes nice cruel wicked men look almost bad orcs much bigger sm�agol thinks come south beyond great river's end came road passed black gate may follow always people coming mordor one day peoples inside'
 `were oliphaunts' asked sam forgetting fear eagerness news strange places
 `no oliphaunts oliphaunts ' said gollum

 sam stood putting hands behind back always 'speaking poetry' began

 grey mouse
 big house
 nose like snake
 make earth shake
 tramp grass
 trees crack pass
 horns mouth
 walk south
 flapping big ears
 beyond count years
 stump round round
 never lie ground
 even die
 oliphaunt
 biggest
 huge old tall
 ever met
 forget
 never
 think i'm true
 old oliphaunt
 never lie

 'that' said sam finished reciting `that's rhyme shire nonsense maybe maybe tales news south know old days hobbits used go travels many ever came back said believed _news bree_ _sure shiretalk_ sayings go i've heard tales big folk away sunlands swertings call 'em tales ride oliphaunts 'tis said fight put houses towers oliphauntses backs oliphaunts throw rocks trees one another said "men south red gold" said "were oliphaunts " going take look risk suppose i'll ever see oliphaunt maybe ain't beast' sighed
 `no oliphaunts' said gollum 'sm�agol heard want see want sm�agol wants go away hide somewhere safer sm�agol wants master go nice master come sm�agol '
 frodo stood laughed midst cares sam trotted old fireside rhyme _oliphaunt_ laugh released hesitation `i wish thousand oliphaunts gandalf white one head' said `then we'd break way evil land perhaps we've tired legs that's well sm�agol third turn may turn best come you'
 'good master wise master nice master' cried gollum delight patting frodo's knees `good master rest nice hobbits shadow stones close stones rest lie quiet till yellow face goes away go quickly soft quick shadows must be'

 hours daylight left rested shifting shade sun moved last shadow western rim dell grew long darkness filled hollow ate little drank sparingly gollum ate nothing accepted water gladly
 `soon get now' said licking lips `good water runs streams great river nice water lands going sm�agol get food perhaps he's hungry yes _gollum_' set two large flat hands shrunken belly pale green light came eyes

 dusk deep length set creeping westward rim dell fading like ghosts broken country borders road moon three nights full climb mountains nearly midnight early night dark single red light burned high towers teeth otherwise sign could seen heard sleepless watch morannon
 many miles red eye seemed stare fled stumbling barren stony country dare take road kept left following line well could little distance last night growing old already weary taken one short rest eye dwindled small fiery point vanished turned dark northern shoulder lower mountains heading southwards
 hearts strangely lightened rested long going quick enough gollum reckoning nearly thirty leagues morannon crossroads osgiliath hoped cover distance four journeys soon struggled dawn began spread slowly wide grey solitude walked almost eight leagues hobbits could gone even dared

 growing light revealed land already less barren ruinous mountains still loomed ominously left near hand could see southward road bearing away black roots hills slanting westwards beyond slopes covered sombre trees like dark clouds lay tumbled heathland grown ling broom cornel shrubs know saw knots tall pinetrees hearts hobbits rose little spite weariness air fresh fragrant reminded uplands northfarthing far away seemed good reprieved walk land years dominion dark lord yet fallen wholly decay forget danger black gate still near hidden though behind gloomy heights looked hidingplace could shelter evil eyes light lasted

 day passed uneasily lay deep heather counted slow hours seemed little change still shadows ephel d�ath sun veiled frodo slept times deeply peacefully either trusting gollum tired trouble sam found difficult doze even gollum plainly fast asleep whiffling twitching secret dreams hunger perhaps mistrust kept wakeful begun long good homely meal `something hot pot'
 soon land faded formless grey coming night started little gollum led southward road went quickly though danger greater ears strained sound hoof foot road ahead following behind night passed heard sound walker rider
 road made long lost time perhaps thirty miles morannon newly repaired went south wild encroached upon handiwork men old could still seen straight sure flight level course cut way hillside slopes leaped stream upon wide shapely arch enduring masonry last signs stonework faded save broken pillar peering bushes side old pavingstones still lurking amid weeds moss heather trees bracken scrambled overhung banks sprawled surface dwindled last country cartroad little used wind held sure course guided swiftest way

 passed northern marches land men called ithilien fair country climbing woods swiftfalling streams night became fine star round moon seemed hobbits fragrance air grew went forward blowing muttering gollum seemed noticed relish first signs day halted come end long cutting deep sheersided middle road clove way stony ridge climbed westward bank looked abroad

 little way back lake found deep brown bed last year's fern beyond thicket darkleaved baytrees climbing steep bank crowned old cedars decided rest pass day already promised bright warm good day strolling way along groves glades ithilien though orcs may shun sunlight many places could lie hid watch evil eyes abroad sauron many servants gollum case would move yellow face soon would look dark ridges ephel d�ath would faint cower light heat
 sam giving earnest thought food marched despair impassable gate behind feel inclined master take thought livelihood beyond end errand anyway seemed wiser save waybread elves worse times ahead six days passed since reckoned bare supply three weeks
 'if reach fire time we'll lucky rate ' thought `and might wanting get back might '
 besides end long nightmarch bathing drinking felt even hungry usual supper breakfast fire old kitchen bagshot row really wanted idea struck turned gollum gollum begun sneak crawling away fours fern
 `hi gollum ' said sam `where going hunting well see old noser like food i'd sorry change new motto's _always ready help_ could find anything fit hungry hobbit '
 `yes perhaps yes' said gollum `sm�agol always helps asks � asks nicely'
 `right' said sam `i ask nice enough begs'

 gollum disappeared away time frodo mouthfuls _lembas_ settled deep brown fern went sleep sam looked early daylight creeping shadows trees saw master's face clearly hands lying rest ground beside reminded suddenly frodo lain asleep house elrond deadly wound kept watch sam noticed times light seemed shining faintly within light even clearer stronger frodo's face peaceful marks fear care left looked old old beautiful chiselling shaping years revealed many fine lines hidden though identity face changed sam gamgee put way shook head finding words useless murmured `i love he's like sometimes shines somehow love whether no'
 gollum returned quietly peered sam's shoulder looking frodo shut eyes crawled away without sound sam came moment later found chewing something muttering ground beside lay two small rabbits beginning eye greedily
 'sm�agol always helps' said `he brought rabbits nice rabbits master gone sleep perhaps sam wants sleep want rabbits sm�agol tries help can't catch things minute'
 sam however objection rabbit said least cooked rabbit hobbits course cook begin learn art letters many never reach sam good cook even hobbit reckoning done good deal campcooking travels chance still hopefully carried gear pack small tinderbox two small shallow pans smaller fitting larger inside wooden spoon short twopronged fork skewers stowed hidden bottom pack flat wooden box dwindling treasure salt needed fire things besides thought bit took knife cleaned whetted began dress rabbits going leave frodo alone asleep even minutes
 'now gollum' said 'i've another job go fill pans water bring 'em back '
 'sm�agol fetch water yes' said gollum 'but hobbit want water drunk washed'
 'never mind' said sam `if can't guess soon find sooner fetch water sooner learn damage one pans i'll carve mincemeat'
 gollum away sam took another look frodo still sleeping quietly sam struck leanness face hands 'too thin drawn is' muttered 'not right hobbit get coneys cooked i'm going wake up'
 sam gathered pile driest fern scrambled bank collecting bundle twigs broken wood fallen branch cedar top gave good supply cut turves foot bank outside fernbrake made shallow hole laid fuel handy flint tinder soon small blaze going made little smoke gave aromatic scent stooping fire shielding building heavier wood gollum returned carrying pans carefully grumbling
 set pans suddenly saw sam gave thin hissing shriek seemed frightened angry `ach sss � no' cried `no silly hobbits foolish yes foolish it'
 `mustn't what' asked sam surprise
 `not make nassty red tongues' hissed gollum `fire fire dangerous yes burns kills bring enemies yes will'
 'i think so' said sam `don't see put wet stuff make smother i'm going risk anyhow i'm going stew coneys'
 'stew rabbits' squealed gollum dismay `spoil beautiful meat sm�agol saved poor hungry sm�agol silly hobbit young tender nice eat eat them' clawed nearest rabbit already skinned lying fire
 `now ' said sam `each fashion bread chokes raw coney chokes give coney coney's mine see cook mind watch go catch another eat fancy � somewhere private o' sight see fire see we'll happier i'll see fire smoke that's comfort you'
 gollum withdrew grumbling crawled fern sam busied pans `what hobbit needs coney' said `is herbs roots especially taters � mention bread herbs manage seemingly'
 `gollum' called softly `third time pays want herbs' gollum's head peeped fern looks neither helpful friendly `a bayleaves thyme sage � water boils' said sam
 `no ' said gollum `sm�agol pleased sm�agol like smelly leaves eat grasses roots precious till he's starving sick poor sm�agol '
 `sm�agol'll get real true hot water water boils he's asked' growled sam `sam'll put head yes precious i'd make look turnips carrots taters time o' year i'll bet there's sorts good things running wild country i'd give lot half dozen taters'
 `sm�agol go precious time' hissed gollum `he's frightened he's tired hobbit's nice nice sm�agol grub roots carrotses � taters what's taters precious eh what's taters
 `potatoes' said sam 'the gaffer's delight rare good ballast empty belly find look good sm�agol fetch herbs i'll think better what's turn new leaf keep turned i'll cook taters one days fried fish chips served gamgee say that'
 `yes yes could spoiling nice fish scorching give fish _now_ keep nassty chips '
 `oh hopeless' said sam 'go sleep'

 end find wanted go far sight place master lay still sleeping sam sat musing tending fire till water boiled daylight grew air became warm dew faded turf leaf soon rabbits cut lay simmering pans bunched herbs almost sam fell asleep time went let stew close hour testing fork tasting broth
 thought ready lifted pans fire crept along frodo frodo half opened eyes sam stood wakened dreaming another gentle unrecoverable dream peace
 `hullo sam ' said `not resting anything wrong time '
 `about couple hours daybreak' said sam `and nigh half past eight shire clocks maybe nothing's wrong though ain't quite i'd call right stock onions taters i've got bit stew broth mr frodo good sup mug straight pan cooled bit brought bowls nothing proper'
 frodo yawned stretched 'you resting sam' said 'and lighting fire dangerous parts feel hungry hmm smell stewed '
 'a present sm�agol' said sam `a brace o' young coneys though fancy gollum's regretting there's nought go herbs'

 sam master sat within fernbrake ate stew pans sharing old fork spoon allowed half piece elvish waybread seemed feast
 'wheew gollum ' sam called whistled softly 'come still time change mind there's left want try stewed coney' answer
 `oh well suppose he's gone find something we'll finish it' said sam
 `and must take sleep' said frodo
 `don't drop i'm nodding mr frodo feel sure there's good deal stinkerthe bad gollum understand mein still getting stronger think he'd try throttle first see eye eye he's pleased sam precious pleased all'

 finished sam went stream rinse gear stood return looked back slope moment saw sun rise reek haze dark shadow whatever lay ever east sent golden beams upon trees glades noticed thin spiral bluegrey smoke plain see caught sunlight rising thicket shock realized smoke little cookingfire neglected put
 `that never thought would show like ' muttered started hurry back suddenly halted listened heard whistle call strange bird whistle come frodo's direction went another place sam began run well could uphill
 found small brand burning away outer end kindled fern edge fire fern blazing set turves smouldering hastily stamped left fire scattered ashes laid turves hole crept back frodo
 'did hear whistle sounded like answer ' asked `a minutes back hope bird sound quite like like somebody mimicking birdcall thought i'm afraid bit fire's smoking i've gone brought trouble i'll never forgive chance maybe '
 `hush ' whispered frodo `i thought heard voices'

 two hobbits trussed small packs put ready flight crawled deeper fern crouched listening
 doubt voices speaking low furtively near coming nearer quite suddenly one spoke clearly close hand
 `here smoke came ' said `'twill nigh hand fern doubt shall like coney trap shall learn kind thing is'
 `aye knows ' said second voice
 four men came striding fern different directions since flight hiding longer possible frodo sam sprang feet putting back back whipping small swords
 astonished saw captors even astonished four tall men stood two spears hands broad bright heads two great bows almost height great quivers long greenfeathered arrows swords sides clad green brown varied hues better walk unseen glades ithilien green gauntlets covered hands faces hooded masked green except eyes keen bright frodo thought boromir men like stature bearing manner speech
 `we found sought' said one `but found '
 'not orcs' said another releasing hilt sword seized saw glitter sting frodo's hand
 `elves ' said third doubtfully
 `nay elves' said fourth tallest appeared chief among `elves walk ithilien days elves wondrous fair look upon 'tis said'
 'meaning we're take you' said sam `thank kindly finished discussing us perhaps say can't let two tired travellers rest'
 tall green man laughed grimly `i faramir captain gondor' said `but travellers land servants dark tower white'
 `but neither' said frodo `and travellers whatever captain faramir may say'
 'then make haste declare errand' said faramir 'we work time place riddling parleying come third company '
 `the third '
 'yes skulking fellow saw nose pool yonder illfavoured look spying breed orc guess creature gave us slip foxtrick'
 'i know is' said frodo 'he chance companion met upon road answerable come spare bring send us wretched gangrel creature care us hobbits shire far north west beyond many rivers frodo son drogo name samwise son hamfast worthy hobbit service come long ways � rivendell imladris call it' faramir started grew intent 'seven companions one lost moria others left parth galen rauros two kin dwarf also elf two men aragorn boromir said came minas tirith city south'
 'boromir ' four men exclaimed
 'boromir son lord denethor' said faramir strange stern look came face 'you came news indeed true know little strangers boromir son denethor high warden white tower captaingeneral sorely miss swift sun climbing'
 'are riddling words known boromir brought rivendell ' frodo replied

 seek sword broken
 imladris dwells

 'the words known indeed' said faramir astonishment `it token truth also know them'
 `aragorn named bearer sword broken' said frodo 'and halflings rhyme spoke of'
 `that see' said faramir thoughtfully `or see might isildur's bane '
 `that hidden' answered frodo `doubtless made clear time'
 `we must learn this' said faramir `and know brings far east shadow yonder' pointed said name 'but business hand peril would gone far field road day hard handstrokes nigh hand ere day full death swift flight bark anduin leave two guard good mine wise man trusts chancemeeting road land return speak you'
 'farewell' said frodo bowing low `think friend enemies one enemy would go halfling folk could hope serve doughty men strong seem errand permitted may light shine swords'
 'the halflings courteous folk whatever else be' said faramir `farewell'

 hobbits sat said nothing one another thoughts doubts close dappling shadow dark baytrees two men remained guard took masks cool dayheat grew frodo saw goodly men paleskinned dark hair grey eyes faces sad proud spoke together soft voices first using common speech manner older days changing another language amazement listened frodo became aware elventongue spoke one little different looked wonder knew must d�nedain south men line lords westernesse
 spoke slow cautious answering named mablung damrod soldiers gondor rangers ithilien descended folk lived ithilien one time overrun men lord denethor chose forayers crossed anduin secretly would say harry orcs enemies roamed ephel d�ath river
 `it close ten leagues hence eastshore anduin' said mablung 'and seldom come far afield new errand journey come ambush men harad curse '
 'aye curse southrons ' said damrod ` 'tis said dealings old gondor kingdoms harad far south though never friendship days bounds away south beyond mouths anduin umbar nearest realms acknowledged sway long since 'tis many lives men since passed fro us late learned enemy among gone back himthey ever ready willas many also east doubt days gondor numbered walls minas tirith doomed great strength malice'
 `but still sit idle let would' said mablung `these cursed southrons come marching ancient roads swell hosts dark tower yea roads craft gondor made go ever heedlessly learn thinking power new master great enough mere shadow hills protect come teach another lesson great strength reported us days ago marching north one regiments due reckoning pass time ere noonup road passes cloven way road may pass shall faramir captain leads perilous ventures life charmed fate spares end'

 talk died listening silence seemed still watchful sam crouched edge fernbrake peered keen hobbiteyes saw many men could see stealing slopes singly long files keeping always shade grove thicket crawling hardly visible brown green raiment grass brake hooded masked gauntlets hands armed like faramir companions long passed vanished sun rose till neared south shadows shrank
 `i wonder dratted gollum ' thought sam crawled back deeper shade `he stands fair chance spitted orc roasted yellow face fancy he'll look himself' lay beside frodo began doze
 woke thinking heard horns blowing sat high noon guards stood alert tense shadow trees suddenly horns rang louder beyond mistake top slope sam thought heard cries wild shouting also sound faint came distant cave presently noise fighting broke near hand hidingplace could hear plainly ringing grate steel steel clang sword iron cap dull beat blade shield men yelling screaming one clear loud voice calling _gondor_ _gondor_
 `it sounds like hundred blacksmiths smithying together' said sam frodo 'they're near want now'

 noise grew closer `they coming' cried damrod `see southrons broken trap flying road go men captain leading'
 sam eager see went joined guards scrambled little way one larger baytrees moment caught glimpse swarthy men red running slope way greenclad warriors leaping hewing fled arrows thick air suddenly straight rim sheltering bank man fell crashing slender trees nearly top came rest fern feet away face downward green arrowfeathers sticking neck golden collar scarlet robes tattered corslet overlapping brazen plates rent hewn black plaits hair braided gold drenched blood brown hand still clutched hilt broken sword
 sam's first view battle men men like much glad could see dead face wondered man's name came really evil heart lies threats led long march home would really rather stayed peaceall flash thought quickly driven mind mablung stepped towards fallen body new noise great crying shouting amidst sam heard shrill bellowing trumpeting great thudding bumping like huge rams dinning ground
 'ware ware' cried damrod companion 'may valar turn aside m�mak m�mak'
 astonishment terror lasting delight sam saw vast shape crash trees come careering slope big house much bigger house looked greyclad moving hill fear wonder maybe enlarged hobbit's eyes m�mak harad indeed beast vast bulk like walk middleearth kin live still latter days memories girth majesty came straight towards watchers swerved aside nick time passing yards away rocking ground beneath feet great legs like trees enormous saillike ears spread long snout upraised like huge serpent strike small red eyes raging upturned hornlike tusks bound bands gold dripped blood trappings scarlet gold flapped wild tatters ruins seemed wartower lay upon heaving back smashed furious passage woods high upon neck still desperately clung tiny figurethe body mighty warrior giant among swertings
 great beast thundered blundering blind wrath pool thicket arrows skipped snapped harmlessly triple hide flanks men sides fled many overtook crushed ground soon lost view still trumpeting stamping far away became sam never heard whether escaped roam wild time perished far home trapped deep pit whether raged plunged great river swallowed

 sam drew deep breath 'an oliphaunt was' said `so oliphaunts seen one life one home ever believe well that's i'll bit sleep'
 'sleep may' said mablung `but captain return unhurt comes shall depart swiftly shall pursued soon news deed reaches enemy long'
 `go quietly must' said sam `no need disturb sleep walking night'
 mablung laughed `i think captain leave master samwise' said 'but shall see'


 _chapter 5_
 window west

 seemed sam dozed minutes awoke find late afternoon faramir come back brought many men indeed survivors foray gathered slope nearby two three hundred strong sat wide semicircle arms faramir seated ground frodo stood looked strangely like trial prisoner
 sam crept fern one paid attention placed end rows men could see hear going watched listened intently ready dash master's aid needed could see faramir's face unmasked stern commanding keen wit lay behind searching glance doubt grey eyes gazed steadily frodo
 sam soon became aware captain satisfied frodo's account several points part play company set rivendell left boromir going particular returned often isildur's bane plainly saw frodo concealing matter great importance
 'but coming halfling isildur's bane waken one must read words' insisted `if halfling named doubtless brought thing whatever may council speak boromir saw deny '
 frodo made answer 'so ' said faramir `i wish learn concerns boromir concerns orcarrow slew isildur far old tales tell orcarrows plenty sight one would taken sign doom boromir gondor thing keeping hidden say choose hide '
 'no choose' answered frodo `it belong belong mortal great small though could claim would aragorn son arathorn named leader company moria rauros'
 'why boromir prince city sons elendil founded '
 'because aragorn descended direct lineage father father isildur elendil's son sword bears elendil's sword'
 murmur astonishment ran ring men cried aloud 'the sword elendil sword elendil comes minas tirith great tidings ' faramir's face unmoved
 `maybe' said `but great claim need established clear proofs required aragorn ever come minas tirith come company set six days ago'
 'boromir satisfied claim' said frodo `indeed boromir would answer questions since already rauros many days back intended go straight city return may soon learn answers part company known others appointed elrond imladris whole council errand came country mine reveal outside company yet claim oppose enemy would well hinder it'
 frodo's tone proud whatever felt sam approved appease faramir
 `so' said `you bid mind affairs get back home let boromir tell comes comes say friend boromir'
 vividly frodo's mind came memory boromir's assault upon moment hesitated faramir's eyes watching grew harder 'boromir valiant member company ' said frodo length 'yes friend part'
 faramir smiled grimly `then would grieve learn boromir dead '
 'i would grieve indeed' said frodo catching look faramir's eyes faltered 'dead' said `do mean dead knew trying trap words playing trying snare falsehood'
 `i would snare even orc falsehood' said faramir
 `how die know since say none company reached city left'
 'as manner death hoped friend companion would tell was'
 `but alive strong parted lives still know though surely many perils world'
 `many indeed' said faramir `and treachery least'

 sam getting impatient angry conversation last words could bear bursting middle ring strode master's side
 'begging pardon mr frodo' said `but gone long enough he's right talk gone much good great men anyone else
 'see captain ' planted squarely front faramir hands hips look face addressing young hobbit offered called `sauce' questioned visits orchard murmuring also grins faces men looking sight captain sitting ground eye eye young hobbit legs well apart bristling wrath one beyond experience `see ' said `what driving let's come point orcs mordor come us think master murdered boromir ran away got sense say done let us know mean pity folk talk fighting enemy can't let others bit way without interfering he'd mighty pleased could see think he'd got new friend would'
 `patience' said faramir without anger `do speak master whose wit greater need teach peril even spare brief time order judge justly hard matter hasty might slain long ago commanded slay find land without leave lord gondor slay man beast needlessly gladly even needed neither talk vain comforted sit master silent '
 sam sat heavily red face faramir turned frodo 'you asked know son denethor dead tidings death many wings _night oft brings news near kindred_ 'tis said boromir brother'
 shadow sorrow passed face `do remember aught special mark lord boromir bore among gear'
 frodo thought moment fearing trap wondering debate would turn end hardly saved ring proud grasp boromir would fare among many men warlike strong know yet felt heart faramir though much like brother looks man less selfregarding sterner wiser 'i remember boromir bore horn' said last
 `you remember well one truth seen him' said faramir `then maybe see mind's eye great horn wild ox east bound silver written ancient characters horn eldest son house borne many generations said blown need anywhere within bounds gondor realm old voice pass unheeded
 'five days ere set venture eleven days ago hour day heard blowing horn northward seemed dim echo mind boding ill thought father tidings heard boromir since went away watcher borders seen pass third night another stranger thing befell
 'i sat night waters anduin grey dark young pale moon watching evermoving stream sad reeds rustling ever watch shores nigh osgiliath enemies partly hold issue harry lands night world slept midnight hour saw seemed saw boat floating water glimmering grey small boat strange fashion high prow none row steer
 `an awe fell pale light round rose went bank began walk stream drawn towards boat turned towards stayed pace floated slowly within hand's reach yet durst handle waded deep heavily burdened seemed passed gaze almost filled clear water came light lapped water warrior lay asleep
 `a broken sword knee saw many wounds boromir brother dead knew gear sword beloved face one thing missed horn one thing knew fair belt linked golden leaves waist _boromir_ cried_ thy horn whither goest thou boromir_ gone boat turned stream passed glimmering night dreamlike yet dream waking doubt dead passed river sea'

 'alas' said frodo 'that indeed boromir knew golden belt given lothl�rien lady galadriel clothed us see us elvengrey brooch workmanship' touched green silver leaf fastened cloak beneath throat
 faramir looked closely `it beautiful' said 'yes 'tis work craft passed land l�rien laurelind�renan named old long lain beyond knowledge men' added softly regarding frodo new wonder eyes `much strange begin understand tell bitter thought boromir died within sight land home'
 'no say said' answered frodo `though tale fills foreboding vision saw think shadow evil fortune unless indeed lying trick enemy seen faces fair warriors old laid sleep beneath pools dead marshes seeming foul arts'
 'nay so' said faramir 'for works fill heart loathing heart filled grief pity'
 `yet could thing happened truth ' asked frodo 'for boat could carried stony hills tol brandir boromir purposed go home across entwash fields rohan yet could vessel ride foam great falls founder boiling pools though laden water '
 'i know not' said faramir 'but whence came boat '
 `from l�rien' said frodo 'in three boats rowed anduin falls also elvenwork'
 'you passed hidden land' said faramir `but seems little understood power men dealings mistress magic dwells golden wood may look strange things follow perilous mortal man walk world sun old came thence unchanged 'tis said
 `_boromir boromir_' cried `_what say lady dies see woke heart went ever laurelind�renan came road upon horses rohan riding home morning_'
 turning frodo spoke quiet voice 'to questions guess could make answer frodo son drogo maybe lest still think tale vision tell horn boromir least returned truth seeming horn came cloven two axe sword shards came severally shore one found among reeds watchers gondor lay northwards infalls entwash found spinning flood one errand water strange chances murder 'tis said
 'and horn elder son lies two pieces upon lap denethor sitting high chair waiting news tell nothing cleaving horn '
 'no know it' said frodo `but day heard blowing reckoning true day parted servant left company tale fills dread boromir peril slain must fear companions perished kindred friends
 `will put aside doubt let go weary full grief afraid deed attempt slain need haste two halflings remain fellowship
 'go back faramir valiant captain gondor defend city may let go doom takes me'
 `for comfort speech together' said faramir `but surely draw dread need unless people l�rien came arrayed boromir funeral orcs servants nameless company guess live still
 `but whatever befell north march frodo doubt longer hard days made judge men's words faces may make guess halflings though' smiled `there something strange frodo elvish air maybe lies upon words together thought first take back minas tirith answer denethor life justly forfeit choose course proves ill city decide haste done yet must move hence without delay'
 sprang feet issued orders men gathered round broke small groups went way vanishing quickly shadows rocks trees soon mablung damrod remained
 'now frodo samwise come guards' said faramir `you cannot go along road southwards purpose unsafe days always closely watched affray yet cannot think go far today case weary going secret place somewhat less ten miles orcs spies enemy found yet could hold long even many may lie rest us morning decide best you'

 nothing frodo fall request order seemed case wise course moment since foray men gondor made journey ithilien dangerous ever
 set mablung damrod little ahead faramir frodo sam behind skirting hither side pool hobbits bathed crossed stream climbed long bank passed greenshadowed woodlands marched ever downwards westwards walked swiftly hobbits could go talked hushed voices
 'i broke speech together' said faramir 'not time pressed master samwise reminded also drawing near matters better debated openly many men reason turned rather matter brother let _isildur's bane_ wholly frank frodo'
 `i told lies truth could' said frodo
 `i blame you' said faramir 'you spoke skill hard place wisely seemed learned guessed words said friendly boromir part friendship master samwise guess grievance loved dearly would gladly avenge death yet knew well _isildur's bane_ � would hazard _isildur's bane_ lay cause contention company clearly mighty heirloom sort things breed peace among confederates aught may learned ancient tales hit near mark'
 `near' said frodo 'but gold contention company though doubt doubt way take emyn muil may ancient tales teach us also peril rash words concerning things � heirlooms'
 'ah thought trouble boromir alone wished thing brought minas tirith alas crooked fate seals lips saw last holds long know heart thought latest hours whether erred sure died well achieving good thing face beautiful even life

 'and remember boromir boy together learned tale sires history city always displeased father king "how many hundreds years needs make steward king king returns " asked "few years maybe places less royalty" father answered "in gondor ten thousand years would suffice" alas poor boromir tell something '
 'it does' said frodo `yet always treated aragorn honour'
 'i doubt not' said faramir `if satisfied aragorn's claim say would greatly reverence pinch yet come yet reached minas tirith become rivals wars
 `but stray house denethor know much ancient lore long tradition moreover treasuries many things preserved books tablets writ withered parchments yea stone leaves silver gold divers characters none read rest ever unlock read little teaching records brought grey pilgrim us first saw child twice thrice since then'
 'the grey pilgrim ' said frodo 'had name'
 'mithrandir called elffashion' said faramir 'and content _many names many countries_ said _mithrandir among elves thark�n dwarves ol�rin youth west forgotten south inc�nus north gandalf east go not_'
 'gandalf' said frodo 'i thought gandalf grey dearest counsellors leader company lost moria'
 'mithrandir lost ' said faramir 'an evil fate seems pursued fellowship hard indeed believe one great wisdom power � many wonderful things among us � could perish much lore taken world sure leave depart would '
 'alas yes' said frodo `i saw fall abyss'
 'i see great tale dread this' said faramir `which perhaps may tell eveningtime mithrandir guess loremaster great mover deeds done time among us consult concerning hard words dream could made clear us without need messenger yet maybe would done journey boromir doomed mithrandir never spoke us reveal purposes got leave denethor know look secrets treasury learned little would teach seldom ever would search would question us else concerning great battle fought upon dagorlad beginning gondor name overthrown eager stories isildur though less tell nothing certain ever known among us end'
 faramir's voice sank whisper 'but much learned guessed kept ever secret heart since isildur took somewhat hand unnamed ere went away gondor never seen among mortal men thought answer mithrandir's questioning seemed matter concerned seekers ancient learning riddling words dream debated among us think _isildur's bane_ thing isildur ambushed slain orcarrows according legend knew mithrandir never told

 walked silence passing like grey green shadows old trees feet making sound many birds sang sun glistened polished roof dark leaves evergreen woods ithilien
 sam taken part conversation though listened time attended keen hobbit ears soft woodland noises one thing noted talk name gollum come glad though felt much hope would never hear soon became aware also though walked alone many men close hand damrod mablung flitting shadows ahead others either side making swift secret way appointed place
 looking suddenly back prickle skin told watched behind thought caught brief glimpse small dark shape slipping behind treetrunk opened mouth speak shut `i'm sure it' said 'and remind old villain choose forget wish could'

 passed woodlands grew thinner land began fall steeply turned aside right came quickly small river narrow gorge stream trickled far round pool grown swift torrent leaping many stones deepcloven bed overhung ilex dark boxwoods looking west could see haze light lowlands broad meads glinting far westering sun wide waters anduin
 'here alas must discourtesy' said faramir "i hope pardon one far made orders give way courtesy slay bind command stranger even one rohan fights us shall see path go open eyes must blindfold you'
 `as will' said frodo 'even elves likewise need blindfolded crossed borders fair lothl�rien gimli dwarf took ill hobbits endured it'
 `it place fair shall lead you' said faramir 'but glad take willingly force'
 called softly immediately mablung damrod stepped trees came back 'blindfold guests' said faramir `securely discomfort tie hands give word try see could trust shut eyes accord eyes blink feet stumble lead falter'
 green scarves two guards bound hobbits' eyes drew hoods almost mouths quickly took one hand went way frodo sam knew last mile road learned guessing dark little found path descending steeply soon grew narrow went single file brushing stony wall either side guards steered behind hands laid firmly shoulders came rough places lifted feet set always noise running water right hand grew nearer louder length halted quickly mablung damrod turned several times lost sense direction climbed upwards little seemed cold noise stream become faint picked carried many steps round corner suddenly heard water loud rushing splashing round seemed felt fine rain hands cheeks last set feet moment stood half fearful blindfold knowing one spoke

 stood wet floor polished stone doorstep roughhewn gate rock opening dark behind front thin veil water hung near frodo could put outstretched arm faced westward level shafts setting sun behind beat upon red light broken many flickering beams everchanging colour stood window elventower curtained threaded jewels silver gold ruby sapphire amethyst kindled unconsuming fire

 faramir went among men questioning came soft voice came back pursuit southrons others left behind scouts near road came latest southrons accounted save great m�mak happened none could say enemy movement could seen even orcspy abroad
 'you saw heard nothing anborn' faramir asked latest comer
 `well lord' said man `no orc least saw thought saw something little strange getting deep dusk eyes make things greater perhaps may squirrel' sam pricked ears 'yet black squirrel saw tail 'twas like shadow ground whisked behind treetrunk drew nigh went aloft swift squirrel could us slay wild beasts purpose seemed tried arrow dark sure shooting anyway creature gone gloom leaves twinkling stayed seemed strange hastened back thought heard thing hiss high turned away large squirrel maybe perhaps shadow unnamed beasts mirkwood wandering hither woods black squirrels 'tis said'
 `perhaps' said faramir `but would ill omen want escapes mirkwood ithilien' sam fancied gave swift glance towards hobbits spoke sam said nothing frodo lay back watched torchlight men moving fro speaking hushed voices suddenly frodo fell asleep
 sam struggled arguing way `he may right' thought 'and may fair speech may hide foul heart' yawned `i could sleep week i'd better keep awake alone great men nothing sam gamgee got keep awake same' somehow managed light faded cave door grey veil falling water grew dim lost gathering shadow always sound water went never changing note morning evening night murmured whispered sleep sam stuck knuckles eyes

 torches lit cask wine broached storage barrels opened men fetching water fall laving hands basins wide copper bowl white cloth brought faramir washed
 `wake guests' said `and take water time eat'
 frodo sat yawned stretched sam used waited looked surprise tall man bowed holding basin water
 'put ground master please ' said 'easier you' astonishment amusement men plunged head cold water splashed neck ears

 'so always do' said sat `we look towards n�menor beyond elvenhome beyond elvenhome ever custom meat '
 `no' said frodo feeling strangely rustic untutored `but guests bow host eaten rise thank him'
 'that also' said faramir

 long journeying camping days spent lonely wild evening meal seemed feast hobbits drink pale yellow wine cool fragrant eat bread butter salted meats dried fruits good red cheese clean hands clean knives plates neither frodo sam refused anything offered second indeed third helping wine coursed veins tired limbs felt glad easy heart done since left land l�rien

 `you may soon desire sleep' said 'and especially good samwise would close eyes ate � whether fear blunting edge noble hunger fear know good sleep soon meat following fast let us talk journey rivendell must many things tell would perhaps wish learn something us lands tell boromir brother old mithrandir fair people lothl�rien'
 frodo longer felt sleepy willing talk though food wine put ease lost caution sam beaming humming frodo spoke first content listen occasionally venturing make exclamation agreement
 frodo told many tales yet always steered matter away quest company ring enlarging rather valiant part boromir played adventures wolves wild snows caradhras mines moria gandalf fell faramir moved story fight bridge
 `it must irked boromir run orcs' said `or even fell thing name balrog � even though last leave'
 `he last' said frodo 'but aragorn forced lead us alone knew way gandalf's fall us lesser folk care think either boromir would fled'
 `maybe would better boromir fallen mithrandir' said faramir `and gone fate waited falls rauros'
 'maybe tell fortunes' said frodo turning matter aside `for would learn minas ithil osgiliath minas tirith longenduring hope city long war '
 'what hope ' said faramir 'it long since hope sword elendil returns indeed may rekindle think put evil day unless help unlookedfor also comes elves men enemy increases decrease failing people springless autumn
 `the men n�menor settled far wide shores seaward regions great lands part fell evils follies many became enamoured darkness black arts given wholly idleness ease fought among conquered weakness wild men

 `you say much tales elves sir' said sam suddenly plucking courage noted faramir seemed refer elves reverence even courtesy food wine sam's respect quieted suspicions
 `no indeed master samwise' said faramir `for learned elvenlore touch upon another point changed declining n�menor middleearth may know mithrandir companion spoken elrond edain fathers n�menoreans fought beside elves first wars rewarded gift kingdom midst sea within sight elvenhome middleearth men elves became estranged days darkness arts enemy slow changes time kind walked sundered roads men fear misdoubt elves yet know little gondor grow like men like men rohan even foes dark lord shun elves speak golden wood dread
 `yet among us still dealings elves may ever anon one go secret l�rien seldom return deem perilous mortal man wilfully seek elder people yet envy spoken white lady'
 `the lady l�rien galadriel' cried sam `you see indeed sir hobbit gardening's job home sir understand i'm much good poetry � making bit comic rhyme perhaps know real poetry � can't tell mean ought sung get strider aragorn old mr bilbo wish could make song beautiful sir lovely sometimes like great tree flower sometimes like white daffadowndilly small slender like hard di'monds soft moonlight warm sunlight cold frost stars proud faroff snowmountain merry lass ever saw daisies hair springtime that's lot o' nonsense wide mark'
 'then must lovely indeed' said faramir `perilously fair'
 `i know _perilous_' said sam `it strikes folk takes peril l�rien finds they've brought perhaps could call perilous strong could dash pieces like ship rock drownd like hobbit river neither rock river would blame boro � ' stopped went red face
 `yes _now boromir_you would say ' said faramir `what would say took peril '
 `yes sir begging pardon fine man brother may say warm scent along watched boromir listened rivendell road � looking master understand meaning harm boromir � opinion l�rien first saw clearly guessed sooner wanted moment first saw wanted enemy's ring '
 `sam ' cried frodo aghast fallen deep thoughts came suddenly late
 'save ' said sam turning white flushing scarlet `there go _when ever open big mouth put foot gaffer used say me_ right enough dear dear
 `now look sir ' turned facing faramir courage could muster `don't go taking advantage master servant's better fool spoken handsome along put guard talking elves _handsome handsome does_ say now's chance show quality'
 'so seems' said faramir slowly softly strange smile `so answer riddles one ring thought perished world boromir tried take force escaped ran way � wild two halflings host men call ring rings pretty stroke fortune chance faramir captain gondor show quality ha' stood tall stern grey eyes glinting
 frodo sam sprang stools set side side backs wall fumbling swordhilts silence men cave stopped talking looked towards wonder faramir sat chair began laugh quietly suddenly became grave
 'alas boromir sore trial ' said `how increased sorrow two strange wanderers far country bearing peril men less judges men halflings truthspeakers men gondor boast seldom perform die attempt_ found highway would take it_ said even man desire thing even though knew clearly thing spoke still take words vow held
 'but man wise enough know perils man must flee sit peace comforted samwise seem stumbled think fated heart shrewd well faithful saw clearer eyes strange though may seem safe declare may even help master love shall turn good power comforted even name thing aloud enough'

 hobbits came back seats sat quiet men turned back drink talk perceiving captain jest little guests
 'well frodo last understand one another' said faramir 'if took thing unwilling others' asking pity honour marvel keep hid use new people new world kin like sort land must realm peace content must gardeners high honour'
 `not well there' said frodo `but certainly gardeners honoured'
 `but folk must grow weary even gardens things sun world far home wayworn tonight sleep � peace fear wish see touch know know enough lest peril perchance waylay fall lower test frodo son drogo go rest � first tell whither wish go must watch wait think time passes morning must go swiftly ways appointed us'
 frodo felt trembling first shock fear passed great weariness came like cloud could dissemble resist longer
 'i going find way mordor' said faintly `i going gorgoroth must find mountain fire cast thing gulf doom gandalf said think shall ever get there'
 faramir stared moment grave astonishment suddenly caught swayed lifting gently carried bed laid covered warmly fell deep sleep
 another bed set beside servant sam hesitated moment bowing low `good night captain lord' said `you took chance sir'
 `did so' said faramir
 `yes sir showed quality highest'
 faramir smiled 'a pert servant master samwise nay praise praiseworthy rewards yet naught praise lure desire done'
 `ah well sir' said sam `you said master elvish air good true say air sir reminds � well gandalf wizards
 'maybe' said faramir `maybe discern far away air n�menor good night'


 _chapter 6_
 forbidden pool

 frodo woke find faramir bending second old fears seized sat shrank away
 `there nothing fear' said faramir
 'is morning already ' said frodo yawning
 `not yet night drawing end full moon setting come see also matter desire counsel sorry rouse sleep come '
 `i will' said frodo rising shivering little left warm blanket pelts seemed cold fireless cave noise water loud stillness put cloak followed faramir
 sam waking suddenly instinct watchfulness saw first master's empty bed leapt feet saw two dark figures frodo man framed archway filled pale white light hurried past rows men sleeping mattresses along wall went cavemouth saw curtain become dazzling veil silk pearls silver thread melting icicles moonlight pause admire turning aside followed master narrow doorway wall cave
 went first along black passage many wet steps came small flat landing cut stone lit pale sky gleaming high long deep shaft two flights steps led one going seemed high bank stream turning away left followed wound way like turretstair

 last came stony darkness looked wide flat rock without rail parapet right eastwards torrent fell splashing many terraces pouring steep race filled smoothhewn channel dark force water flecked foam curling rushing almost feet plunged sheer edge yawned upon left man stood near brink silent gazing
 frodo turned watch sleek necks water curved dived lifted eyes gazed far away world quiet cold dawn near far west full moon sinking round white pale mists shimmered great vale wide gulf silver fume beneath rolled cool nightwaters anduin black darkness loomed beyond glinted cold sharp remote white teeth ghosts peaks ered nimrais white mountains realm gondor tipped everlasting snow
 frodo stood high stone shiver ran wondering anywhere vastness nightlands old companions walked slept lay dead shrouded mist brought forgetful sleep
 sam eager answer question could refrain muttering master's ear alone thought 'it's fine view doubt mr frodo chilly heart mention bones what's going '
 faramir heard answered `moonset gondor fair ithil goes middleearth glances upon white locks old mindolluin worth shivers brought seethough samwise brought pay penalty watchfulness draught wine shall amend come look '
 stepped beside silent sentinel dark edge frodo followed sam hung back already felt insecure enough high wet platform faramir frodo looked far saw white waters pour foaming bowl swirl darkly deep oval basin rocks found way narrow gate flowed away fuming chattering calmer level reaches moonlight still slanted fall's foot gleamed ripples basin presently frodo aware small dark thing near bank even looked dived vanished beyond boil bubble fall cleaving black water neatly arrow edgewise stone
 faramir turned man side `now would say anborn squirrel kingfisher black kingfishers nightpools mirkwood '
 `'tis bird whatever else be' answered anborn `it four limbs dives manwise pretty mastery craft shows seeking way behind curtain hidings seems discovered last bow posted archers nigh good marksmen either bank wait command shoot captain'
 `shall shoot ' said faramir turning quickly frodo
 frodo answer moment `no ' said `no beg to' sam dared would said `yes' quicker louder could see guessed well enough words looking
 'you know thing ' said faramir `come seen tell spared words together spoken gangrel companion let time could wait till caught brought sent keenest huntsmen seek slipped sight till save anborn dusk yesterevening done worse trespass go coneysnaring uplands dared come henneth ann�n life forfeit marvel creature secret sly come sporting pool window think men sleep without watch night so'
 'there two answers think' said frodo `for one thing knows little men sly though refuge hidden perhaps know men concealed another think allured mastering desire stronger caution'
 `he lured say ' said faramir low voice `can know burden '
 `indeed yes bore many years'
 '_he_ bore ' said faramir breathing sharply wonder `this matter winds ever new riddles pursuing '
 'maybe precious speak that'
 `what creature seek '
 `fish' said frodo `look '

 peered dark pool little black head appeared far end basin deep shadow rocks brief silver glint swirl tiny ripples swam side marvellous agility froglike figure climbed water bank sat began gnaw small silver thing glittered turned last rays moon falling behind stony wall pool's end
 faramir laughed softly `fish ' said `it less perilous hunger maybe fish pool henneth ann�n may cost give'
 `now arrowpoint' said anborn `shall shoot captain coming unbidden place death law'
 `wait anborn' said faramir `this harder matter seems say frodo spare '
 `the creature wretched hungry' said frodo `and unaware danger gandalf mithrandir would bidden slay reason others forbade elves know clearly guess cannot speak openly creature way bound errand found us took us guide'
 `your guide ' said faramir `the matter becomes ever stranger would much frodo cannot grant let sly wanderer go free join later please caught orcs tell knows threat pain must slain taken slain taken swiftly slippery thing many guises caught save feathered shaft '
 `let go quietly him' said frodo `you may keep bows bent shoot least fail shall run away'
 `go swift ' said faramir `if comes alive faithful servant rest unhappy days lead frodo bank anborn go softly thing nose ears give bow'
 anborn grunted led way winding stair landing stair last came narrow opening shrouded thick bushes passing silently frodo found top southern bank pool dark falls pale grey reflecting lingering moonlight western sky could see gollum went forward short way anborn came softly behind
 `go ' breathed frodo's ear `have care right fall pool one fishing friend help forget bowmen near hand though may see them'
 frodo crept forward using hands gollumlike feel way steady rocks part flat smooth slippery halted listening first could hear sound unceasing rush fall behind presently heard far ahead hissing murmur
 'fissh nice fissh white face vanished precious last yes eat fish peace peace precious precious lost yes lost dirty hobbits nasty hobbits gone left us _gollum_ precious gone poor sm�agol alone precious nasty men they'll take steal precious thieves hates fissh nice fissh makes us strong makes eyes bright fingers tight yes throttle precious throttle yes gets chances nice fissh nice fissh '
 went almost unceasing waterfall interrupted faint noise slavering gurgling frodo shivered listening pity disgust wished would stop never need hear voice anborn far behind could creep back ask get huntsmen shoot would probably get close enough gollum gorging guard one true shot frodo would rid miserable voice ever gollum claim servant claim master service even service fear would foundered dead marshes gollum frodo knew somehow quite clearly gandalf would wished
 `sm�agol ' said softly
 `fissh nice fissh' said voice
 `sm�agol ' said little louder voice stopped
 `sm�agol master come look master come sm�agol ' answer soft hiss intaken breath
 'come sm�agol ' said frodo `we danger men kill find come quickly wish escape death come master'
 'no' said voice `not nice master leaves poor sm�agol goes new friends master wait sm�agol finished'
 `there's time' said frodo `bring fish come '
 `no must finish fish'
 'sm�agol ' said frodo desperately 'precious angry shall take precious shall say make swallow bones choke never taste fish come precious waiting '
 sharp hiss presently darkness gollum came crawling fours like erring dog called heel halfeaten fish mouth another hand came close frodo almost nose nose sniffed pale eyes shining took fish mouth stood
 `nice master ' whispered `nice hobbit come back poor sm�agol good sm�agol comes let's go go quickly yes trees faces dark yes come let's go '
 `yes we'll go soon' said frodo `but go promised promise safe yet save must trust me'
 `we must trust master ' said gollum doubtfully 'why go one cross rude hobbit he'
 'away there' said frodo pointing waterfall 'i going without must go back him' heart sank much like trickery really fear faramir would allow gollum killed would probably make prisoner bind certainly frodo would seem treachery poor treacherous creature would probably impossible ever make understand believe frodo saved life way could else could � keep faith near might sides `come' said `or precious angry going back stream go go go front '
 gollum crawled along close brink little way snuffling suspicious presently stopped raised head `something's ' said `not hobbit' suddenly turned back green light flickering bulging eyes `masster masster' hissed 'wicked tricksy false' spat stretched long arms white snapping fingers
 moment great black shape anborn loomed behind came large strong hand took nape neck pinned twisted round like lightning wet slimy wriggling like eel biting scratching like cat two men came shadows
 'hold still ' said one `or we'll stick full pins hedgehog hold still'
 gollum went limp began whine weep tied none gently
 `easy easy ' said frodo `he strength match hurt help he'll quieter sm�agol hurt i'll go shall come harm unless kill trust master '
 gollum turned spat men picked put hood eyes carried
 frodo followed feeling wretched went opening behind bushes back stairs passages cave two three torches lit men stirring sam gave queer look limp bundle men carried `got him' said frodo
 'yes well get came trusted first i'm afraid want tied like hope right hate whole business'
 `so i' said sam `and nothing ever right piece misery is'
 man came beckoned hobbits took recess back cave faramir sitting chair lamp rekindled niche head signed sit stools beside `bring wine guests' said `and bring prisoner me'
 wine brought anborn came carrying gollum removed cover gollum's head set feet standing behind support gollum blinked hooding malice eyes heavy pale lids miserable creature looked dripping dank smelling fish still clutched one hand sparse locks hanging like rank weed bony brows nose snivelling
 `loose us loose us ' said `the cord hurts us yes hurts us we've done nothing'
 `nothing ' said faramir looking wretched creature keen glance without expression face either anger pity wonder 'nothing never done anything worthy binding worse punishment however judge happily tonight come death come fish pool dearly bought'
 gollum dropped fish hand `don't want fish' said
 'the price set fish' said faramir `only come look pool bears penalty death spared far prayer frodo says least deserved thanks must also satisfy name whence come whither go business '
 `we lost lost' said gollum 'no name business precious nothing empty hungry yes hungry little fishes nasty bony little fishes poor creature say death wise just'
 'not wise' said faramir 'but yes perhaps little wisdom allows unloose frodo ' faramir took small nailknife belt handed frodo gollum misunderstanding gesture squealed fell
 'now sm�agol ' said frodo 'you must trust desert answer truthfully good harm' cut cords gollum's wrists ankles raised feet
 'come hither ' said faramir `look know name place '
 slowly gollum raised eyes looked unwillingly faramir's light went stared bleak pale moment clear unwavering eyes man gondor still silence gollum dropped head shrank squatting floor shivering 'we know want know' whimpered `never came never come again'
 `there locked doors closed windows mind dark rooms behind them' said faramir `but judge speak truth well oath swear never return never lead living creature hither word sign'
 `master knows' said gollum sidelong glance frodo `yes knows promise master saves us we'll promise yes' crawled frodo's feet 'save us nice master ' whined `sm�agol promises precious promises faithfully never come never speak never precious no'
 `are satisfied ' said faramir
 `yes' said frodo 'at least must either accept promise carry law get promised came harmed would proved faithless'

 faramir sat moment thought `very good' said last `i surrender master frodo son drogo let declare '
 'but lord faramir' said frodo bowing `you yet declared concerning said frodo made known cannot shape plans companions judgement postponed morning hand'
 `then declare doom' said faramir `as frodo far lies higher authority declare free realm gondor furthest ancient bounds save neither go leave come place unbidden doom shall stand year day cease unless shall term come minas tirith present lord steward city entreat confirm done make lifelong meantime whomsoever take protection shall protection shield gondor answered '
 frodo bowed low 'i answered' said `and place service worth one high honourable'
 `it great worth' said faramir 'and take creature sm�agol protection '
 `i take sm�agol protection' said frodo sam sighed audibly courtesies hobbit would thoroughly approved indeed shire matter would required great many words bows
 'then say you' said faramir turning gollum 'you doom death walk frodo safe part yet ever found man gondor astray without doom shall fall may death find swiftly within gondor without well serve answer whither would go guide says whither leading ' gollum made reply
 `this secret' said faramir `answer reverse judgement ' still gollum answer
 `i answer him' said frodo `he brought black gate asked impassable'
 `there open gate nameless land' said faramir
 `seeing turned aside came southward road ' frodo continued 'for said may path near minas ithil'
 `minas morgul' said faramir
 `i know clearly' said frodo `but path climbs think mountains northern side vale old city stands goes high cleft � beyond'
 `do know name high pass ' said faramir
 'no' said frodo
 'it called cirith ungol' gollum hissed sharply began muttering `is name ' said faramir turning
 `no ' said gollum squealed something stabbed 'yes yes heard name name matter us master says must get must try way way try no'
 'no way ' said faramir `how know explored confines dark realm ' looked long thoughtfully gollum presently spoke `take creature away anborn treat gently watch sm�agol try dive falls rocks teeth would slay time leave us take fish '
 anborn went gollum went cringing curtain drawn across recess

 `frodo think unwisely this' said faramir `i think go creature wicked'
 'no altogether wicked' said frodo
 'not wholly perhaps' said faramir 'but malice eats like canker evil growing lead good part give safeconduct guidance point borders gondor may name'
 `he would take it' said frodo 'he would follow long done promised many times take protection go led would ask break faith him'
 'no' said faramir `but heart would seems less evil counsel another man break troth oneself especially one sees friend bound unwitting harm � go must endure think holden go cirith ungol told less knows much perceived clearly mind go cirith ungol'
 `where shall go ' said frodo `back black gate deliver guard know place makes name dreadful '
 `nothing certain' said faramir 'we gondor ever pass east road days none us younger men ever done us set foot upon mountains shadow know old report rumour bygone days dark terror dwells passes minas morgul cirith ungol named old men masters lore blanch fall silent

 `i would so' said faramir

 `i know would go death torment think mithrandir would chosen way'

 frodo sam returned beds lay silence resting little men bestirred business day began water brought led table food set three faramir broke fast slept since battle day yet look weary
 finished stood `may hunger trouble road' said faramir `you little provision small store food fit travellers ordered stowed packs lack water walk ithilien drink stream flows imlad morgul valley living death also must tell scouts watchers returned even crept within sight morannon find strange thing land empty nothing road sound foot horn bowstring anywhere heard waiting silence broods nameless land know portends time draws swiftly great conclusion storm coming hasten may ready let us go sun soon rise shadow'
 hobbits' packs brought little heavier also two stout staves polished wood shod iron carven heads ran plaited leathern thongs
 'i fitting gifts give parting' said faramir `but take staves may service walk climb wild men white mountains use though cut height newly shod made fair tree _lebethron_ beloved woodwrights gondor virtue set upon finding returning may virtue wholly fail shadow go'
 hobbits bowed low `most gracious host' said frodo 'it said elrond halfelven find friendship upon way secret unlooked certainly looked friendship shown found turns evil great good'

 made ready depart gollum brought corner hidinghole seemed better pleased though kept close frodo avoided glance faramir
 'your guide must blindfolded' said faramir 'but servant samwise release wish'
 gollum squealed squirmed clutched frodo came bind eyes frodo said 'blindfold us three cover eyes first perhaps see harm meant' done led cave henneth ann�n passed passages stairs felt cool morning air fresh sweet still blind went little time gently last voice faramir ordered uncovered
 stood boughs woods noise falls could heard long southward slope lay ravine stream flowed west could see light trees world came sudden end brink looking sky
 'here last parting ways' said faramir 'if take counsel turn eastward yet go straight thus cover woodland many miles west edge land falls great vales sometimes suddenly sheer sometimes long hillsides keep near edge skirts forest beginning journey may walk daylight think land dreams false peace evil withdrawn fare well may'
 embraced hobbits manner people stooping placing hands upon shoulders kissing foreheads 'go good good men' said
 bowed ground turned without looking back left went two guards stood little distance away marvelled see speed greenclad men moved vanishing almost twinkling eye forest faramir stood seemed empty drear dream passed

 frodo sighed turned back southward mark disregard courtesy gollum scrabbling mould foot tree `hungry already' thought sam `well again'
 'have gone last ' said gollum `nassty wicked men sm�agol's neck still hurts yes let's go '
 `yes let us go' said frodo `but speak ill showed mercy keep silent '
 `nice master ' said gollum `sm�agol joking always forgives yes yes even nice master's little trickses oh yes nice master nice sm�agol '
 frodo sam answer hoisting packs taking staves hand passed woods ithilien
 twice day rested took little food provided faramir dried fruits salted meat enough many days bread enough last still fresh gollum ate nothing
 sun rose passed overhead unseen began sink light trees west grew golden always walked cool green shadow silence birds seemed flown away fallen dumb
 darkness came early silent woods fall night halted weary walked seven leagues henneth ann�n frodo lay slept away night deep mould beneath ancient tree sam beside uneasy woke many times never sign gollum slipped soon others settled rest whether slept hole nearby wandered restlessly prowling night say returned first glimmer light roused companions
 `must get yes must' said 'long ways go still south east hobbits must make haste'

 day passed much day gone except silence seemed deeper air grew heavy began stifling trees felt thunder brewing gollum often paused sniffing air would mutter urge greater speed
 third stage day's march drew afternoon waned forest opened trees became larger scattered great ilexes huge girth stood dark solemn wide glades among hoary ashtrees giant oaks putting browngreen buds lay long launds green grass dappled celandine anemones white blue folded sleep acres populous leaves woodland hyacinths already sleek bellstems thrusting mould living creature beast bird seen open places gollum grew afraid walked caution flitting one long shadow another
 light fading fast came forestend sat old gnarled oak sent roots twisting like snakes steep crumbling bank deep dim valley lay side woods gathered blue grey sullen evening marched southwards right mountains gondor glowed remote west fireflecked sky left lay darkness towering walls mordor darkness long valley came falling steeply everwidening trough towards anduin bottom ran hurrying stream frodo could hear stony voice coming silence beside hither side road went winding like pale ribbon chill grey mists gleam sunset touched seemed frodo descried far floating shadowy sea high dim tops broken pinnacles old towers forlorn dark
 turned gollum `do know ' said
 'yes master dangerous places road tower moon master ruined city shores river ruined city yes nasty place full enemies taken men's advice hobbits come long way path must go east away there' waved skinny arm towards darkling mountains `and can't use road oh cruel peoples come way tower'
 frodo looked road rate nothing moving appeared lonely forsaken running empty ruins mist evil feeling air things might indeed passing eyes could see frodo shuddered looked distant pinnacles dwindling night sound water seemed cold cruel voice morgulduin polluted stream flowed valley wraiths
 'what shall ' said 'we walked long far shall look place woods behind lie hidden '
 'no good hiding dark' said gollum 'it's day hobbits must hide yes day'
 `oh come ' said sam 'we must rest bit even get middle night there'll still hours dark time enough take us long march know way'
 gollum reluctantly agreed turned back towards trees working eastward along straggling edges wood would rest ground near evil road debate climbed crotch large holmoak whose thick branches springing together trunk made good hidingplace fairly comfortable refuge night fell grew altogether dark canopy tree frodo sam drank little water ate bread dried fruit gollum curled went sleep hobbits shut eyes

 must little midnight gollum woke suddenly aware pale eyes unlidded gleaming listened sniffed seemed noticed usual method discovering time night
 'are rested beautiful sleep' said 'let's go'
 'we haven't' growled sam 'but we'll go must'
 gollum dropped branches tree fours hobbits followed slowly
 soon went gollum leading eastwards dark sloping land could see little night deep hardly aware stems trees stumbled ground became broken walking difficult gollum seemed way troubled led thickets wastes brambles sometimes round lip deep cleft dark pit sometimes black bushshrouded hollows ever went little downward always slope longer steeper climbing steadily first halt looked back could dimly perceive roofs forest left behind lying like vast dense shadow darker night dark blank sky seemed great blackness looming slowly east eating faint blurred stars later sinking moon escaped pursuing cloud ringed sickly yellow glare
 last gollum turned hobbits 'day soon' said 'hobbits must hurry safe stay open places make haste '
 quickened pace followed wearily soon began climb great hogback land part covered thick growth gorse whortleberry low tough thorns though clearings opened scars recent fires gorsebushes became frequent got nearer top old tall gaunt leggy thick already putting yellow flowers glimmered gloom gave faint sweet scent tall spiny thickets hobbits could walk upright passing long dry aisles carpeted deep prickly mould
 edge broad hillback stayed march crawled hiding underneath tangled knot thorns twisted boughs stooping ground overridden clambering maze old briars deep inside hollow hall raftered dead branch bramble roofed first leaves shoots spring lay tired yet eat peering holes covert watched slow growth day
 day came dead brown twilight east dull red glare lowering cloud red dawn across tumbled lands mountains ephel d�ath frowned black shapeless night lay thick pass away jagged tops edges outlined hard menacing fiery glow away right great shoulder mountains stood dark black amid shadows thrusting westward
 `which way go here' asked frodo `is opening ofof morgul valley away beyond black mass'
 `need think yet' said sam `surely we're going move today day is'
 `perhaps perhaps not' said gollum `but must go soon crossroads yes crossroads that's way yes master'

 red glare mordor died away twilight deepened great vapours rose east crawled frodo sam took little food lay gollum restless would eat food drank little water crawled bushes sniffing muttering suddenly disappeared
 `off hunting suppose' said sam yawned turn sleep first soon deep dream thought back bag end garden looking something heavy pack back made stoop seemed weedy rank somehow thorns bracken invading beds near bottom hedge
 `a job work see i'm tired' kept saying presently remembered looking `my pipe' said woke
 `silly' said opened eyes wondered lying hedge `it's pack time' realized first pipe might pack leaf next hundreds miles bag end sat seemed almost dark master let sleep turn right till evening
 `haven't sleep mr frodo' said 'what's time seems getting late'
 'no isn't' said frodo `but day getting darker instead lighter darker darker far tell midday yet slept three hours'
 'i wonder what's up' said sam 'is storm coming going worst ever shall wish deep hole stuck hedge' listened `what's thunder drums '
 'i know' said frodo `it's going good sometimes ground seems tremble sometimes seems heavy air throbbing ears'
 sam looked round `where's gollum ' said 'hasn't come back yet'
 `no' said frodo `there's sign sound him'
 `well can't abide him' said sam `in fact i've never taken anything journey i'd less sorry lose way would like coming miles go get lost shall need � he's ever going use doubt'
 `you forget marshes' said frodo `i hope nothing happened him'
 `and hope he's tricks anyway hope fall hands might say shall soon trouble'
 moment rolling rumbling noise heard louder deeper ground seemed quiver feet 'i think trouble anyhow' said frodo `i'm afraid journey drawing end'
 'maybe' said sam `but _where there's life there's hope_ gaffer used say _and need vittles_ mostways used add bite mr frodo bit sleep'

 afternoon sam supposed must called wore looking covert could see dun shadowless world fading slowly featureless colourless gloom felt stifling warm frodo slept unquietly turning tossing sometimes murmuring twice sam thought heard speaking gandalf's name time seemed drag interminably suddenly sam heard hiss behind gollum fours peering gleaming eyes
 `wake wake wake sleepies' whispered `wake time lose must go yes must go time lose'
 sam stared suspiciously seemed frightened excited `go what's little game time yet can't teatime even leastways decent places teatime'
 `silly ' hissed gollum `we're decent places time's running short yes running fast time lose must go wake master wake u clawed frodo frodo startled sleep sat suddenly seized arm gollum tore loose backed away
 'they silly' hissed `we must go time lose' nothing could get thought brewing make hurry would say sam filled deep suspicion showed frodo gave sign passing mind sighed hoisted pack prepared go evergathering darkness
 stealthily gollum led hillside keeping cover wherever possible running almost bent ground across open space light dim even keeneyed beast wild could scarcely seen hobbits hooded grey cloaks heard walking warily little people without crack twig rustle leaf passed vanished

 hour went silently single file oppressed gloom absolute stillness land broken faint rumbling thunder far away drumbeats hollow hills hidingplace went turning south steered straight course gollum could find across long broken slope leaned towards mountains presently far ahead looming like black wall saw belt trees drew nearer became aware vast size ancient seemed still towering high though tops gaunt broken tempest lightningblast swept across failed kill shake fathomless roots
 'the crossroads yes' whispered gollum first words spoken since left hidingplace 'we must go way' turning eastward led slope suddenly southward road winding way outer feet mountains presently plunged great ring trees
 'this way' whispered gollum 'no paths beyond road paths must go crossroads make haste silent '
 furtively scouts within campment enemies crept road stole along westward edge stony bank grey stones softfooted hunting cats length reached trees found stood great roofless ring open middle sombre sky spaces immense boles like great dark arches ruined hall centre four ways met behind lay road morannon ran upon long journey south right road old osgiliath came climbing crossing passed eastward darkness fourth way road take
 standing moment filled dread frodo became aware light shining saw glowing sam's face beside turning towards saw beyond arch boughs road osgiliath running almost straight stretched ribbon west far away beyond sad gondor overwhelmed shade sun sinking finding last hem great slowrolling pall cloud falling ominous fire towards yet unsullied sea brief glow fell upon huge sitting figure still solemn great stone kings argonath years gnawed violent hands maimed head gone place set mockery round roughhewn stone rudely painted savage hands likeness grinning face one large red eye midst forehead upon knees mighty chair pedestal idle scrawls mixed foul symbols maggotfolk mordor used
 suddenly caught level beams frodo saw old king's head lying rolled away roadside `look sam' cried startled speech `look king got crown again'
 eyes hollow carven beard broken high stern forehead coronal silver gold trailing plant flowers like small white stars bound across brows reverence fallen king crevices stony hair yellow stonecrop gleamed
 'they cannot conquer ever' said frodo suddenly brief glimpse gone sun dipped vanished shuttering lamp black night fell

 gollum tugging frodo's cloak hissing fear impatience `we must go' said `we stand make haste'
 reluctantly frodo turned back west followed guide led darkness east left ring trees crept along road towards mountains road ran straight soon began bend away southwards came right great shoulder rock seen distance black forbidding loomed darker dark sky behind crawling shadow road went rounding sprang east began climb steeply
 frodo sam plodding along heavy hearts longer able care greatly peril frodo's head bowed burden dragging soon great crossroads passed weight almost forgotten ithilien begun grow feeling way become steep feet looked wearily saw even gollum said would city ringwraiths cowered stony bank
 longtilted valley deep gulf shadow ran back far mountains upon side way within valley's arms high rocky seat upon black knees ephel d�ath stood walls tower minas morgul dark earth sky lit light imprisoned moonlight welling marble walls minas ithil long ago tower moon fair radiant hollow hills paler indeed moon ailing slow eclipse light wavering blowing like noisome exhalation decay corpselight light illuminated nothing walls tower windows showed like countless black holes looking inward emptiness topmost course tower revolved slowly first one way another huge ghostly head leering night moment three companions stood shrinking staring unwilling eyes gollum first recover pulled cloaks urgently spoke word almost dragged forward every step reluctant time seemed slow pace raising foot setting minutes loathing passed
 came slowly white bridge road gleaming faintly passed stream midst valley went winding deviously towards city's gate black mouth opening outer circle northward walls wide flats lay either bank shadowy meads filled pale white flowers luminous beautiful yet horrible shape like demented forms uneasy dream gave forth faint sickening charnelsmell odour rottenness filled air mead mead bridge sprang figures stood head carven cunning forms human bestial corrupt loathsome water flowing beneath silent steamed vapour rose curling twisting bridge deadly cold frodo felt senses reeling mind darkening suddenly force work began hurry tottering forward groping hands held head lolling side side sam gollum ran sam caught master arms stumbled almost fell right threshold bridge
 `not way way ' whispered gollum breath teeth seemed tear heavy stillness like whistle cowered ground terror
 `hold mr frodo ' muttered sam frodo's ear 'come back way gollum says agree him'
 frodo passed hand brow wrenched eyes away city hill luminous tower fascinated fought desire run gleaming road towards gate last effort turned back felt ring resisting dragging chain neck eyes looked away seemed moment blinded darkness impenetrable
 gollum crawling ground like frightened animal already vanishing gloom sam supporting guiding stumbling master followed quickly could far near bank stream gap stonewall beside road passed sam saw narrow path gleamed faintly first main road climbing meads deadly flowers faded went dark winding crooked way northern sides valley
 along path hobbits trudged side side unable see gollum front except turned back beckon eyes shone greenwhite light reflecting noisome morgulsheen perhaps kindled answering mood within deadly gleam dark eyeholes frodo sam always conscious ever glancing fearfully shoulders ever dragging eyes back find darkening path slowly laboured rose stench vapours poisonous stream breath became easier heads clearer limbs deadly tired walked night burden swimming long heavy tide water last could go without halt
 frodo stopped sat stone climbed top great hump bare rock ahead bay valleyside round head path went wide ledge chasm right across sheer southward face mountain crawled upwards disappeared blackness
 `i must rest sam' whispered frodo `it's heavy sam lad heavy wonder far carry anyway must rest venture that' pointed narrow way ahead
 `sssh ssh ' hissed gollum hurrying back `sssh ' fingers lips shook head urgently tugging frodo's sleeve pointed towards path frodo would move
 `not yet' said 'not yet' weariness weariness oppressed seemed heavy spell laid mind body `i must rest' muttered
 gollum's fear agitation became great spoke hissing behind hand keep sound unseen listeners air `not rest fools eyes see us come bridge see us come away climb climb come '
 `come mr frodo' said sam `he's right can't stay here'
 'all right' said frodo remote voice one speaking half asleep `i try' wearily got feet

 late moment rock quivered trembled beneath great rumbling noise louder ever rolled ground echoed mountains searing suddenness came great red flash far beyond eastern mountains leapt sky splashed lowering clouds crimson valley shadow cold deathly light seemed unbearably violent fierce peaks stone ridges like notched knives sprang staring black uprushing flame gorgoroth came great crack thunder
 minas morgul answered flare livid lightnings forks blue flame springing tower encircling hills sullen clouds earth groaned city came cry mingled harsh high voices birds prey shrill neighing horses wild rage fear came rending screech shivering rising swiftly piercing pitch beyond range hearing hobbits wheeled round towards cast holding hands upon ears
 terrible cry ended falling back long sickening wail silence frodo slowly raised head across narrow valley almost level eyes walls evil city stood cavernous gate shaped like open mouth gleaming teeth gaping wide gate army came
 host clad sable dark night wan walls luminous pavement road frodo could see small black figures rank upon rank marching swiftly silently passing outwards endless stream went great cavalry horsemen moving like ordered shadows head one greater rest rider black save hooded head helm like crown flickered perilous light drawing near bridge frodo's staring eyes followed unable wink withdraw surely lord nine riders returned earth lead ghastly host battle yes indeed haggard king whose cold hand smitten ringbearer deadly knife old wound throbbed pain great chill spread towards frodo's heart
 even thoughts pierced dread held bound spell rider halted suddenly right entrance bridge behind host stood still pause dead silence maybe ring called wraithlord moment troubled sensing power within valley way turned dark head helmed crowned fear sweeping shadows unseen eyes frodo waited like bird approach snake unable move waited felt urgent ever command put ring great pressure felt inclination yield knew ring would betray even put power face morgulkingnot yet longer answer command dismayed terror though felt beating upon great power outside took hand frodo watched mind willing suspense looked old story far away moved hand inch inch towards chain upon neck stirred slowly forced hand back set find another thing thing lying hidden near breast cold hard seemed grip closed phial galadriel long treasured almost forgotten till hour touched thought ring banished mind sighed bent head
 moment wraithking turned spurred horse rode across bridge dark host followed maybe elvenhoods defied unseen eyes mind small enemy strengthened turned aside thought haste already hour struck great master's bidding must march war west
 soon passed like shadow shadow winding road behind still black ranks crossed bridge great army never issued vale since days isildur's might host fell strong arms yet assailed fords anduin yet one greatest hosts mordor sent forth

 frodo stirred suddenly heart went faramir 'the storm burst last' thought `this great array spears swords going osgiliath faramir get across time guessed know hour hold fords king nine riders comes armies come late lost tarried way lost even errand performed one ever know one tell vain' overcome weakness wept still host morgul crossed bridge
 great distance came memories shire sunlit early morning day called doors opening heard sam's voice speaking `wake mr frodo wake ' voice added `your breakfast ready' would hardly surprised certainly sam urgent `wake mr frodo they're gone' said
 dull clang gates minas morgul closed last rank spears vanished road tower still grinned across valley light fading whole city falling back dark brooding shade silence yet still filled watchfulness
 'wake mr frodo they're gone we'd better go there's something still alive place something eyes seeing mind take longer stay one spot sooner get us come mr frodo '
 frodo raised head stood despair left weakness passed even smiled grimly feeling clearly moment felt opposite could whether faramir aragorn elrond galadriel gandalf anyone else ever knew beside purpose took staff one hand phial saw clear light already welling fingers thrust bosom held heart turning city morgul grey glimmer across dark gulf prepared take upward road
 gollum seemed crawled along ledge darkness beyond gates minas morgul opened leaving hobbits lay came creeping back teeth chattering fingers snapping `foolish silly ' hissed `make haste think danger passed make haste '
 answer followed climbing ledge little liking either even facing many perils last long soon path reached rounded angle mountainside swelled suddenly entered narrow opening rock come first stair gollum spoken darkness almost complete could see nothing much beyond hands' stretch gollum's eyes shone pale several feet turned back towards
 `careful ' whispered `steps lots steps must careful '
 care certainly needed frodo sam first felt easier wall either side stairway almost steep ladder climbed became aware long black fall behind steps narrow spaced unevenly often treacherous worn smooth edges broken cracked foot set upon hobbits struggled last clinging desperate fingers steps ahead forcing aching knees bend straighten ever stair cut way deeper sheer mountain rocky walls rose higher higher heads
 length felt could endure saw gollum's eyes peering `we're up' whispered 'first stair's past clever hobbits climb high clever hobbits little steps that's yes'

 dizzy tired sam frodo following crawled last step sat rubbing legs knees deep dark passage seemed still go though gentler slope without steps gollum let rest long
 'there's another stair still' said `much longer stair rest get top next stair yet'
 sam groaned 'longer say ' asked
 'yes yess longer' said gollum `but difficult hobbits climbed straight stair next comes winding stair'
 'and ' said sam
 `we shall see' said gollum softly `o yes shall see '
 'i thought said tunnel' said sam `isn't tunnel something go '
 'o yes there's tunnel' said gollum `but hobbits rest try get they'll nearly top nearly get yes '
 frodo shivered climb made sweat felt cold clammy chill draught dark passage blowing invisible heights got shook `well let's go ' said `this place sit in'

 passage seemed go miles always chill air flowed rising went bitter wind mountains seemed trying deadly breath daunt turn back secrets high places blow away darkness behind knew come end suddenly felt wall right hand could see little great black shapeless masses deep grey shadows loomed dull red light flickered lowering clouds moment aware tall peaks front either side like pillars holding vast sagging roof seemed climbed many hundreds feet wide shelf cliff left chasm right
 gollum led way close cliff present longer climbing ground broken dangerous dark blocks lumps fallen stone way going slow cautious many hours passed since entered morgul vale neither sam frodo could longer guess night seemed endless
 length aware wall looming stairway opened halted began climb long weary ascent stairway delve mountainside huge cliff face sloped backwards path like snake wound fro across one point crawled sideways right edge dark chasm frodo glancing saw vast deep pit great ravine head morgul valley depths glimmered like glowworm thread wraithroad dead city nameless pass turned hastily away

 still stairway bent crawled last final flight short straight climbed another level path veered away main pass great ravine followed perilous course bottom lesser cleft among higher regions ephel d�ath dimly hobbits could discern tall piers jagged pinnacles stone either side great crevices fissures blacker night forgotten winters gnawed carved sunless stone red light sky seemed stronger though could tell whether dreadful morning indeed coming place shadow whether saw flame great violence sauron torment gorgoroth beyond still far ahead still high frodo looking saw guessed crown bitter road sullen redness eastern sky cleft outlined topmost ridge narrow deepcloven two black shoulders either shoulder horn stone
 paused looked attentively horn upon left tall slender burned red light else red light land beyond shining hole saw black tower poised outer pass touched sam's arm pointed
 'i like look ' said sam `so secret way guarded all' growled turning gollum 'as knew along suppose '
 'all ways watched yes' said gollum `of course hobbits must try way may least watched perhaps they've gone away big battle perhaps '
 'perhaps' grunted sam 'well still seems long way long way get there's still tunnel think ought rest mr frodo know time day night we've kept going hours hours'
 `yes must rest' said frodo 'let us find corner wind gather strengthfor last lap' felt terrors land beyond deed done seemed remote far yet trouble mind bent getting impenetrable wall guard could impossible thing somehow errand would accomplished seemed dark hour weariness still labouring stony shadows cirith ungol

 dark crevice two great piers rock sat frodo sam little way within gollum crouched upon ground near opening hobbits took expected would last meal went nameless land maybe last meal would ever eat together food gondor ate wafers waybread elves drank little water sparing took enough moisten dry mouths
 `i wonder we'll find water ' said sam 'but suppose even drink orcs drink '
 'yes drink' said frodo 'but let us speak drink us'
 `then need fill bottles' said sam `but water sound trickle heard anyway faramir said drink water morgul'
 'no water flowing imlad morgul words' said frodo `we valley came spring would flowing it'
 'i trust it' said sam 'not till dying thirst there's wicked feeling place' sniffed 'and smell fancy notice queer kind smell stuffy like it'
 'i like anything all' said frodo `step stone breath bone earth air water seem accursed path laid'
 'yes that's so' said sam `and we'd known started suppose often way brave things old tales songs mr frodo adventures used call used think things wonderful folk stories went looked wanted exciting life bit dull kind sport might say that's way tales really mattered ones stay mind folk seem landed usually � paths laid way put expect lots chances like us turning back know they'd forgotten hear went � good end mind least folk inside story outside call good end know coming home finding things right though quite � like old mr bilbo always best tales hear though may best tales get landed wonder sort tale we've fallen '
 `i wonder' said frodo 'but know that's way real tale take one fond may know guess kind tale happyending sadending people know want to'
 'no sir course beren never thought going get silmaril iron crown thangorodrim yet worse place blacker danger that's long tale course goes past happiness grief beyond � silmaril went came e�rendil sir never thought we've got � got light starglass lady gave think we're tale still going great tales never end '
 'no never end tales' said frodo `but people come go part's ended part end later � sooner'
 'and rest sleep' said sam laughed grimly 'and mean mr frodo mean plain ordinary rest sleep waking morning's work garden i'm afraid that's i'm hoping time big important plans sort still wonder shall ever put songs tales we're one course mean put words know told fireside read great big book red black letters years years afterwards people say "let's hear frodo ring " they'll say "yes that's one favourite stories frodo brave dad" "yes boy famousest hobbits that's saying lot"'
 `it's saying lot much' said frodo laughed long clear laugh heart sound heard places since sauron came middleearth sam suddenly seemed stones listening tall rocks leaning frodo heed laughed 'why sam' said 'to hear somehow makes merry story already written left one chief characters samwise stouthearted "i want hear sam dad put talk dad that's like makes laugh frodo got far without sam would dad " '
 `now mr frodo' said sam 'you make fun serious '
 `so i' said frodo 'and we're going bit fast sam still stuck worst places story likely say point "shut book dad want read more" '
 `maybe' said sam 'but one say things done made part great tales different even gollum might good tale better anyway used like tales account wonder thinks he's hero villain
 `gollum' called `would like hero � where's got again'
 sign mouth shelter shadows near refused food though usual accepted mouthful water seemed curl sleep supposed one rate objects long absence day hunt food liking evidently slipped talked time
 `i like sneaking without saying' said sam 'and least can't looking food unless there's kind rock fancies even bit moss '
 `it's good worrying now' said frodo `we got far even within sight pass without we'll put ways he's false he's false'
 'all i'd rather eye' said sam 'all he's false remember never would say pass guarded see tower � may deserted may think he's gone fetch orcs whatever are'
 `no think so' answered frodo 'even he's wickedness suppose that's unlikely think fetch orcs servants enemy wait till go labour climb come near land fears could probably betrayed us orcs many times since met anything little private trick ownthat thinks quite secret'
 `well suppose right mr frodo' said sam 'not comforts mightily make mistake doubt he'd hand _me_ orcs gladly kiss hand forgetting � precious suppose whole time _the precious poor sm�agol_ that's one idea little schemes bringing us help guess'
 'very likely can't guess himself' said frodo `and think he's got one plain scheme muddled head think really part trying save precious enemy long would last disaster enemy got part perhaps he's biding time waiting chance'
 'yes slinker stinker i've said before' said sam 'but nearer get enemy's land like stinker slinker get mark words ever get pass let us really take precious thing border without making kind trouble'
 `we got yet' said frodo
 'no we'd better keep eyes skinned till we're caught napping stinker come top pretty quick would safe wink master safe lay close i'd dearly glad see sleep i'd keep watch anyway lay near arm round one could come pawing without sam knowing it'
 `sleep' said frodo sighed desert seen mirage cool green 'yes even could sleep'
 `sleep master lay head lap'

 gollum found hours later returned crawling creeping path gloom ahead sam sat propped stone head dropping sideways breathing heavy lap lay frodo's head drowned deep sleep upon white forehead lay one sam's brown hands lay softly upon master's breast peace faces
 gollum looked strange expression passed lean hungry face gleam faded eyes went dim grey old tired spasm pain seemed twist turned away peering back towards pass shaking head engaged interior debate came back slowly putting trembling hand cautiously touched frodo's knee � almost touch caress fleeting moment could one sleepers seen would thought beheld old weary hobbit shrunken years carried far beyond time beyond friends kin fields streams youth old starved pitiable thing
 touch frodo stirred cried softly sleep immediately sam wide awake first thing saw gollum � `pawing master' thought
 `hey you' said roughly `what to'
 'nothing nothing' said gollum softly `nice master'
 `i daresay' said sam 'but � sneaking sneaking back old villain '
 gollum withdrew green glint flickered heavy lids almost spiderlike looked crouched back bent limbs protruding eyes fleeting moment passed beyond recall `sneaking sneaking' hissed 'hobbits always polite yes nice hobbits sm�agol brings secret ways nobody else could find tired thirsty yes thirsty guides searches paths say _sneak sneak_ nice friends yes precious nice'
 sam felt bit remorseful though trustful 'sorry' said 'i'm sorry startled sleep sleeping made bit sharp mr frodo he's tired asked wink well that's sorry _have_ '
 `sneaking' said gollum green glint leave eyes
 'o well' said sam `have way suppose far truth we'd better sneaking along together what's time today tomorrow '
 'it's tomorrow' said gollum 'or tomorrow hobbits went sleep foolish dangerousif poor sm�agol sneaking watch'
 `i think shall get tired word soon' said sam 'but never mind i'll wake master up' gently smoothed hair back frodo's brow bending spoke softly
 `wake mr frodo wake '
 frodo stirred opened eyes smiled seeing sam's face bending `calling early sam' said `it's dark still '
 'yes always dark here' said sam `but gollum's come back mr frodo says tomorrow must walking last lap'
 frodo drew deep breath sat `the last lap ' said 'hullo sm�agol found food rest '
 `no food rest nothing sm�agol' said gollum `he's sneak'
 sam clicked tongue restrained
 'don't take names sm�agol' said frodo 'it's unwise whether true false'
 `sm�agol take what's given him' answered gollum 'he given name kind master samwise hobbit knows much'
 frodo looked sam 'yes sir' said `i use word waking sleep sudden finding hand said sorry soon be'
 'come let pass then' said frodo 'but seem come point sm�agol tell find rest way we're sight pass way find suppose agreement said done promised free free go back food rest wherever wish go except servants enemy one day may reward remember me'
 `no yet' gollum whined `o can't find way indeed there's tunnel coming sm�agol must go rest food yet'

 may indeed daytime gollum said hobbits could see little difference unless perhaps heavy sky less utterly black like great roof smoke instead darkness deep night lingered still cracks holes grey blurring shadow shrouded stony world passed gollum front hobbits side side long ravine piers columns torn weathered rock standing like huge unshapen statues either hand sound way ahead mile perhaps great grey wall last huge upthrusting mass mountainstone darker loomed steadily rose approached towered high shutting view lay beyond deep shadow lay feet sam sniffed air
 `ugh smell' said `it's getting stronger stronger'
 presently shadow midst saw opening cave `this way in' said gollum softly `this entrance tunnel' speak name torech ungol shelob's lair came stench sickly odour decay meads morgul foul reek filth unnameable piled hoarded dark within
 `is way sm�agol ' said frodo
 'yes yes' answered 'yes must go way now'
 'd'you mean say hole' said sam `phew perhaps mind bad smells'
 gollum's eyes glinted `he know minds precious sm�agol bear things yes he's yes right way'
 `and makes smell wonder' said sam `it's like � well like say beastly hole orcs i'll warrant hundred years filth it'
 'well' said frodo 'orcs way must take it'

 drawing deep breath passed inside steps utter impenetrable dark since lightless passages moria frodo sam known darkness possible deeper denser airs moving echoes sense space air still stagnant heavy sound fell dead walked black vapour wrought veritable darkness breathed brought blindness eyes mind even memory colours forms light faded thought night always always would night
 could still feel indeed senses feet fingers first seemed sharpened almost painfully walls felt surprise smooth floor save step straight even going ever stiff slope tunnel high wide wide though hobbits walked abreast touching sidewalls outstretched hands separated cut alone darkness
 gollum gone first seemed steps ahead still able give heed things could hear breath hissing gasping front time senses became duller touch hearing seemed grow numb kept groping walking mainly force entered go desire come last high gate beyond
 gone far perhaps time distance soon passed reckoning sam right feeling wall aware opening side moment caught faint breath air less heavy passed
 'there's one passage here' whispered effort seemed hard make breath give sound `it's orclike place ever could '
 first right frodo left passed three four openings wider smaller yet doubt main way straight turn still went steadily long much would endure could endure breathlessness air growing climbed seemed often blind dark sense resistance thicker foul air thrust forward felt things brush heads hands long tentacles hanging growths perhaps could tell still stench grew grew almost seemed smell clear sense left torment one hour two hours three hours many passed lightless hole hoursdays weeks rather sam left tunnelside shrank towards frodo hands met clasped together still went
 length frodo groping along lefthand wall came suddenly void almost fell sideways emptiness opening rock far wider yet passed came reek foul sense lurking malice intense frodo reeled moment sam lurched fell forwards
 fighting sickness fear frodo gripped sam's hand `up ' said hoarse breath without voice 'it comes stench peril quick '
 calling remaining strength resolution dragged sam feet forced limbs move sam stumbled beside one step two steps three stepsat last six steps maybe passed dreadful unseen opening whether suddenly easier move hostile moment released struggled still hand hand
 almost came new difficulty tunnel forked seemed dark could tell wider way kept nearer straight take left right knew nothing guide yet false choice would almost certainly fatal
 `which way gollum gone ' panted sam 'and wait '
 `sm�agol ' said frodo trying call 'sm�agol ' voice croaked name fell dead almost left lips answer echo even tremor air
 `he's really gone time fancy' muttered sam `i guess exactly meant bring us gollum ever lay hands sorry it'
 presently groping fumbling dark found opening left blocked either blind else great stone fallen passage 'this can't way' frodo whispered 'right wrong must take other'
 'and quick ' sam panted 'there's something worse gollum feel something looking us'
 gone yards behind came sound startling horrible heavy padded silence gurgling bubbling noise long venomous hiss wheeled round nothing could seen still stones stood staring waiting know
 `it's trap' said sam laid hand upon hilt sword thought darkness barrow whence came 'i wish old tom near us now' thought stood darkness blackness despair anger heart seemed saw light light mind almost unbearably bright first sunray eyes one long hidden windowless pit light became colour green gold silver white far little picture drawn elvenfingers saw lady galadriel standing grass l�rien gifts hands _and ringbearer_ heard say remote clear_ prepared this_
 bubbling hiss drew nearer creaking great jointed thing moved slow purpose dark reek came 'master master' cried sam life urgency came back voice 'the lady's gift starglass light dark places said starglass'
 `the starglass' muttered frodo one answering sleep hardly comprehending `why yes forgotten _a light lights go out_ indeed light alone help us'

 slowly hand went bosom slowly held aloft phial galadriel moment glimmered faint rising star struggling heavy earthward mists power waxed hope grew frodo's mind began burn kindled silver flame minute heart dazzling light though e�rendil come high sunset paths last silmaril upon brow darkness receded seemed shine centre globe airy crystal hand held sparkled white fire
 frodo gazed wonder marvellous gift long carried guessing full worth potency seldom remembered road came morgul vale never used fear revealing light _aiya e�rendil elenion ancalima_ cried knew spoken seemed another voice spoke clear untroubled foul air pit
 potencies middleearth powers night old strong walked darkness heard elves cry cry far back deeps time heeded daunt even frodo spoke felt great malice bent upon deadly regard considering far tunnel opening reeled stumbled aware eyes growing visible two great clusters manywindowed eyes � coming menace unmasked last radiance starglass broken thrown back thousand facets behind glitter pale deadly fire began steadily glow within flame kindled deep pit evil thought monstrous abominable eyes bestial yet filled purpose hideous delight gloating prey trapped beyond hope escape

 frodo sam horrorstricken began slowly back away gaze held dreadful stare baleful eyes backed eyes advanced frodo's hand wavered slowly phial drooped suddenly released holding spell run little vain panic amusement eyes turned fled together even ran frodo looked back saw terror eyes came leaping behind stench death like cloud
 'stand stand ' cried desperately `running use'
 slowly eyes crept nearer
 `galadriel ' called gathering courage lifted phial eyes halted moment regard relaxed hint doubt troubled frodo's heart flamed within without thinking whether folly despair courage took phial left hand right hand drew sword sting flashed sharp elvenblade sparkled silver light edges blue fire flicked holding star aloft bright sword advanced frodo hobbit shire walked steadily meet eyes
 wavered doubt came light approached one one dimmed slowly drew back brightness deadly ever afflicted sun moon star safe underground star descended earth still approached eyes began quail one one went dark turned away great bulk beyond light's reach heaved huge shadow gone

 'master master' cried sam close behind sword drawn ready 'stars glory elves would make song ever heard may live tell hear sing go master go den now's chance let's get foul hole'
 back turned first walking running went floor tunnel rose steeply every stride climbed higher stenches unseen lair strength returned limb heart still hatred watcher lurked behind blind perhaps undefeated still bent death came flow air meet cold thin opening tunnel's end last panting yearning roofless place flung forward amazement staggered tumbling back outlet blocked barrier stone soft little yielding seemed yet strong impervious air filtered hut glimmer light charged hurled back
 holding aloft phial frodo looked saw greyness radiance starglass pierce illuminate shadow cast light light could dissipate across width height tunnel vast web spun orderly web huge spider denserwoven far greater thread thick rope
 sam laughed grimly `cobwebs ' said `is cobwebs spider 'em 'em '
 fury hewed sword thread struck break gave little sprang back like plucked bowstring turning blade tossing sword arm three times sam struck force last one single cord countless cords snapped twisted curling whipping air one end lashed sam's hand cried pain starting back drawing hand across mouth
 `it take days clear road like this' said `what's done eyes come back '
 `no seen' said frodo `but still feel looking thinking making plan perhaps light lowered failed would quickly come again'
 `trapped end ' said sam bitterly anger rising weariness despair `gnats net may curse faramir bite gollum bite quick '
 'that would help us now' said frodo `come let us see sting elvenblade webs horror dark ravines beleriand forged must guard hold back eyes take starglass afraid hold watch'

 frodo stepped great grey net hewed wide sweeping stroke drawing bitter edge swiftly across ladder closestrung cords springing away bluegleaming blade shore like scythe grass leaped writhed hung loose great rent made
 stroke stroke dealt last web within reach shattered upper portion blew swayed like loose veil incoming wind trap broken
 `come ' cried frodo `on ' wild joy escape mouth despair suddenly filled mind head whirled draught potent wine sprang shouting came
 seemed light dark land eyes passed den night great smokes risen grown thinner last hours sombre day passing red glare mordor died away sullen gloom yet seemed frodo looked upon morning sudden hope almost reached summit wall little higher cleft cirith ungol dim notch black ridge horns rock darkling sky either side short race sprinter's course would
 `the pass sam ' cried heeding shrillness voice released choking airs tunnel rang high wild 'the pass run run we'll throughthrough one stop us '
 sam came behind fast could urge legs glad free uneasy ran kept glancing back dark arch tunnel fearing see eyes shape beyond imagining spring pursuit little master know craft shelob many exits lair

 agelong dwelt evil thing spiderform even old lived land elves west sea beren fought mountains terror doriath came l�thien upon green sward amid hemlocks moonlight long ago shelob came flying ruin tale tells dark years tales come still sauron first stone baradd�r served none drinking blood elves men bloated grown fat endless brooding feasts weaving webs shadow living things food vomit darkness far wide lesser broods bastards miserable mates offspring slew spread glen glen ephel d�ath eastern hills dol guldur fastnesses mirkwood none could rival shelob great last child ungoliant trouble unhappy world
 already years gollum beheld sm�agol pried dark holes past days bowed worshipped darkness evil walked ways weariness beside cutting light regret promised bring food lust lust little knew cared towers rings anything devised mind hand desired death others mind body glut life alone swollen till mountains could longer hold darkness could contain
 desire yet far away long hungry lurking den power sauron grew light living things forsook borders city valley dead elf man came near unhappy orcs poor food wary must eat however busily delved new winding passages pass tower ever found way snare lusted sweeter meat gollum brought
 `we'll see we'll see' said often evil mood walked dangerous road emyn muil morgul vale 'we'll see may well yes may well throws away bones empty garments shall find shall get precious reward poor sm�agol brings nice food we'll save precious promised yes we've got safe she'll know yes we'll pay back precious we'll pay everyone back '
 thought inner chamber cunning still hoped hide even come bowed low companions slept
 sauron knew lurked pleased dwell hungry unabated malice sure watch upon ancient path land skill could devised orcs useful slaves plenty shelob caught stay appetite welcome could spare sometimes man may cast dainty cat _his cat_ calls owns sauron would send prisoners better uses would driven hole report brought back play made
 lived delighting devices feared assault wrath end wickedness never yet fly escaped shelob's webs greater rage hunger

 nothing evil stirred poor sam know except fear growing menace could see weight become burden run feet seemed leaden
 dread round enemies pass master fey mood running heedlessly meet turning eyes away shadow behind deep gloom beneath cliff upon left looked ahead saw two things increased dismay saw sword frodo still held unsheathed glittering blue flame saw though sky behind dark still window tower glowing red
 `orcs ' muttered `we'll never rush like there's orcs worse orcs' returning quickly long habit secrecy closed hand precious phial still bore red living blood hand shone moment thrust revealing light deep pocket near breast drew elvencloak tried quicken pace master gaining already twenty strides ahead flitting like shadow soon would lost sight grey world

 hardly sam hidden light starglass came little way ahead left saw suddenly issuing black hole shadow cliff loathly shape ever beheld horrible beyond horror evil dream like spider huger great hunting beasts terrible evil purpose remorseless eyes eyes thought daunted defeated lit fell light clustering outthrust head great horns behind short stalklike neck huge swollen body vast bloated bag swaying sagging legs great bulk black blotched livid marks belly underneath pale luminous gave forth stench legs bent great knobbed joints high back hairs stuck like steel spines leg's end claw
 soon squeezed soft squelching body folded limbs upper exit lair moved horrible speed running creaking legs making sudden bound sam master either see sam avoided moment bearer light` fixed intent upon one prey upon frodo bereft phial running heedless path unaware yet peril swiftly ran shelob swifter leaps would
 sam gasped gathered remaining breath shout 'look behind ' yelled 'look master i'm' � suddenly cry stifled
 long clammy hand went mouth another caught neck something wrapped leg taken guard toppled backwards arms attacker
 `got ' hissed gollum ear `at last precious we've got yes nassty hobbit takes one she'll get yes shelob get sm�agol promised hurt master he's got nassty filthy little sneak' spat sam's neck
 fury treachery desperation delay master deadly peril gave sam sudden violence strength far beyond anything gollum expected slow stupid hobbit thought gollum could twisted quickly fiercely hold sam's mouth slipped sam ducked lunged forward trying tear away grip neck sword still hand left arm hanging thong faramir's staff desperately tried turn stab enemy gollum quick long right arm shot grabbed sam's wrist fingers like vice slowly relentlessly bent hand forward till cry pain sam released sword fell ground gollum's hand tightening sam's throat
 sam played last trick strength pulled away got feet firmly planted suddenly drove legs ground whole force hurled backwards
 expecting even simple trick sam gollum fell sam top received weight sturdy hobbit stomach sharp hiss came second hand upon sam's throat loosened fingers still gripped swordhand sam tore forward away stood quickly wheeled away right pivoted wrist held gollum laying hold staff left hand sam swung came whistling crack gollum's outstretched arm elbow
 squeal gollum let go sam waded waiting change staff left right dealt another savage blow quick snake gollum slithered aside stroke aimed head fell across back staff cracked broke enough grabbing behind old game seldom failed time misled spite made mistake speaking gloating hands victim's neck everything gone wrong beautiful plan since horrible light unexpectedly appeared darkness face face furious enemy little less size fight sam swept sword ground raised gollum squealed springing aside fours jumped away one big bound like frog sam could reach running amazing speed back towards tunnel
 sword hand sam went moment forgotten everything else red fury brain desire kill gollum could overtake gollum gone dark hole stood stench came meet like clap thunder thought frodo monster smote upon sam's mind spun round rushed wildly path calling calling master's name late far gollum's plot succeeded

 choices master samwise

 frodo lying face upward ground monster bending intent upon victim took heed sam cries close hand rushed saw frodo already bound cords wound ankle shoulder monster great forelegs beginning half lift half drag body away
 near side lay gleaming ground elvenblade fallen useless grasp sam wait wonder done whether brave loyal filled rage sprang forward yell seized master's sword left hand charged onslaught fierce ever seen savage world beasts desperate small creature armed little teeth alone spring upon tower horn hide stands fallen mate
 disturbed gloating dream small yell turned slowly dreadful malice glance upon almost aware fury upon greater known countless years shining sword bit upon foot shore away claw sam sprang inside arches legs quick upthrust hand stabbed clustered eyes upon lowered head one great eye went dark
 miserable creature right moment reach sting claws vast belly putrid light stench almost smote still fury held one blow could sink upon smothering little impudence courage slashed bright elvenblade across desperate strength
 shelob dragons softer spot save eyes knobbed pitted corruption ageold hide ever thickened within layer layer evil growth blade scored dreadful gash hideous folds could pierced strength men though elf dwarf forge steel hand beren t�rin wield yielded stroke heaved great bag belly high sam's head poison frothed bubbled wound splaying legs drove huge bulk soon sam still stood upon feet dropping sword hands held elvenblade point upwards fending ghastly roof shelob driving force cruel strength greater warrior's hand thrust upon bitter spike deep deep pricked sam crushed slowly ground
 anguish shelob ever known dreamed knowing long world wickedness doughtiest soldier old gondor savage orc entrapped ever thus endured set blade beloved flesh shudder went heaving wrenching away pain bent writhing limbs beneath sprang backwards convulsive leap
 sam fallen knees frodo's head senses reeling foul stench two hands still gripping hilt sword mist eyes aware dimly frodo's face stubbornly fought master drag swoon upon slowly raised head saw paces away eyeing beak drabbling spittle venom green ooze trickling wounded eye crouched shuddering belly splayed upon ground great bows legs quivering gathered another springthis time crush sting death little bite poison still struggling meat time slay rend
 even sam crouched looking seeing death eyes thought came remote voice spoken fumbled breast left hand found sought cold hard solid seemed touch phantom world horror phial galadriel

 staggered feet samwise hobbit hamfast's son
 `now come filth' cried `you've hurt master brute pay we're going we'll settle first come taste again'
 indomitable spirit set potency motion glass blazed suddenly like white torch hand flamed like star leaping firmament sears dark air intolerable light terror heaven ever burned shelob's face beams entered wounded head scored unbearable pain dreadful infection light spread eye eye fell back beating air forelegs sight blasted inner lightnings mind agony turning maimed head away rolled aside began crawl claw claw towards opening dark cliff behind
 sam came reeling like drunken man came shelob cowed last shrunken defeat jerked quivered tried hasten reached hole squeezing leaving trail greenyellow slime slipped even sam hewed last stroke dragging legs fell ground

 shelob gone whether lay long lair nursing malice misery slow years darkness healed within rebuilding clustered eyes hunger like death spun dreadful snares glens mountains shadow tale tell
 sam left alone wearily evening nameless land fell upon place battle crawled back master
 'master dear master' said frodo speak run forward eager rejoicing free shelob hideous speed come behind one swift stroke stung neck lay pale heard voice move
 `master dear master ' said sam long silence waited listening vain
 quickly could cut away binding cords laid head upon frodo's breast mouth stir life could find feel faintest flutter heart often chafed master's hands feet touched brow cold
 `frodo mr frodo ' called 'don't leave alone sam calling go can't follow wake mr frodo wake frodo dear dear wake up'

 anger surged hint ran master's body rage stabbing air smiting stones shouting challenges presently came back bending looked frodo's face pale beneath dusk suddenly saw picture revealed mirror galadriel l�rien frodo pale face lying fast asleep great dark cliff fast asleep thought `he's dead ' said 'not asleep dead ' said words set venom work seemed hue face grew livid green
 black despair came sam bowed ground drew grey hood head night came heart knew

 last blackness passed sam looked shadows many minutes hours world gone dragging could tell still place still master lay beside dead mountains crumbled earth fallen ruin
 'what shall shall ' said `did come way nothing ' remembered voice speaking words time understand beginning journey _i something end must see sir understand_
 `but leave mr frodo dead unburied top mountains go home go go on' repeated moment doubt fear shook `go i've got leave him'
 last began weep going frodo composed body folded cold hands upon breast wrapped cloak laid sword one side staff faramir given
 'if i'm go on' said `then must take sword leave mr frodo i'll put one lie lay old king barrow got beautiful mithril coat old mr bilbo starglass mr frodo lend i'll need i'll always dark good lady gave maybe she'd understand _you_ understand mr frodo i've got go on'

 could go yet knelt held frodo's hand could release time went still knelt holding master's hand heart keeping debate
 tried find strength tear away go lonely journey � vengeance could go anger would bear roads world pursuing last gollum gollum would die corner set would worth leave master would bring back nothing would better dead together would lonely journey
 looked bright point sword thought places behind black brink empty fall nothingness escape way nothing even grieve set 'what ' cried seemed plainly know hard answer _see through_ another lonely journey worst
 `what alone go crack doom ' quailed still resolve grew `what _me_ take ring _him_ council gave him'
 answer came `and council gave companions errand fail last company errand must fail'
 `i wish last' groaned `i wish old gandalf hare somebody left alone make mind i'm sure go wrong go taking ring putting forward'
 'but put forward put forward right proper person mr frodo might say mr bilbo choose themselves'
 `ah well must make mind make i'll sure go wrong that'd sam gamgee
 'let see we're found mr frodo's found thing's well enemy get that's end us lorien rivendell shire time lose it'll end anyway war's begun likely things going enemy's way already chance go back get advice permission sit till come kill master's body gets take go' drew deep breath 'then take '
 stooped gently undid clasp neck slipped hand inside frodo's tunic hand raising head kissed cold forehead softly drew chain head lay quietly back rest change came still face tokens sam convinced last frodo died laid aside quest
 `goodbye master dear ' murmured 'forgive sam he'll come back spot job's done � manages he'll leave rest quiet till come may foul creature come anigh lady could hear give one wish would wish come back find goodbye '
 bent neck put chain upon head bowed ground weight ring great stone strung slowly weight became less new strength grew raised head great effort got feet found could walk bear burden moment lifted phial looked master light burned gently soft radiance eveningstar summer light frodo's face fair hue pale beautiful elvish beauty one long passed shadows bitter comfort last sight sam turned hid light stumbled growing dark

 far go tunnel way behind cleft couple hundred yards ahead less path visible dusk` deep rut worn ages passage running gently long trough cliffs either side trough narrowed rapidly soon sam came long flight broad shallow steps orctower right frowning black red eye glowed hidden dark shadow coming top steps cleft last
 'i've made mind' kept saying though done best think altogether grain nature `have got wrong ' muttered `what ought done '
 sheer sides cleft closed reached actual summit looked last path descending nameless land turned moment motionless intolerable doubt looked back could still see like small blot gathering gloom mouth tunnel thought could see guess frodo lay fancied glimmer ground perhaps trick tears peered high stony place life fallen ruin
 'if could wish one wish' sighed `to go back find ' last turned road front took steps heaviest reluctant ever taken

 steps would going would never see high place suddenly heard cries voices stood still stone orcvoices behind noise tramping feet harsh shouts orcs coming cleft far side entry tower perhaps tramping feet shouts behind wheeled round saw small red lights torches winking away issued tunnel last hunt red eye tower blind caught
 flicker approaching torches clink steel ahead near minute would reach top taken long making mind good could escape save save ring ring aware thought decision simply found drawing chain taking ring hand head orccompany appeared cleft right put

 world changed single moment time filled hour thought aware hearing sharpened sight dimmed otherwise shelob's lair things dark vague grey hazy world alone like small black solid rock ring weighing left hand like orb hot gold feel invisible horribly uniquely visible knew somewhere eye searching
 heard crack stone murmur water far morgul vale away rock bubbling misery shelob groping lost blind passage voices dungeons tower cries orcs came tunnel deafening roaring ears crash feet rending clamour orcs shrank cliff marched like phantom company grey distorted figures mist dreams fear pale flames hands passed cowered trying creep away cranny hide
 listened orcs tunnel others marching sighted one another parties hurrying shouting heard clearly understood said perhaps ring gave understanding tongues simply understanding especially servants sauron maker gave heed understood translated thought certainly ring grown greatly power approached places forging one thing confer courage present sam still thought hiding lying low till quiet listened anxiously could tell near voices words seemed almost ears

 'hola gorbag enough war already '
 'orders lubber shagrat tired lurking thinking coming fight '
 'orders i'm command pass speak civil what's report '
 'nothing'
 `hai hai yoi' yell broke exchanges leaders orcs lower suddenly seen something began run others
 `hai hola here's something lying right road spy spy ' hoot snarling horns babel baying voices

 dreadful stroke sam wakened cowering mood seen master would heard tales orcs make blood run cold could borne sprang flung quest decisions away fear doubt knew place master's side though could clear back ran steps path towards frodo
 `how many there' thought `thirty forty tower least lot guess many kill get they'll see flame sword soon draw they'll get sooner later wonder song ever mention samwise fell high pass made wall bodies round master song course ring'll found there'll songs can't help place mr frodo must understand � elrond council great lords ladies wisdom plans gone wrong can't ringbearer without mr frodo'

 orcs dim sight time consider realized weary weary almost exhaustion legs would carry wished slow path seemed miles long got mist
 good way ahead still cluster figures round something lying ground seemed darting way bent like dogs trail tried make spurt
 'come sam ' said `or late again' loosened sword sheath minute would draw
 wild clamour hooting laughing something lifted ground 'ya hoi ya harri hoi '
 voice shouted `now quick way back undergate she'll trouble us tonight signs' whole band orcfigures began move four middle carrying body high shoulders `ya hoi '

 taken frodo's body could catch still laboured orcs reached tunnel passing burden went first behind good deal struggling jostling sam came drew sword flicker blue wavering hand see even came panting last vanished black hole
 moment stood gasping clutching breast drew sleeve across face wiping away grime sweat tears 'curse filth ' said sprang darkness

 longer seemed dark tunnel rather stepped thin mist heavier fog weariness growing hardened thought could see light torches little way ahead try would could catch orcs go fast tunnels tunnel knew well spite shelob forced use often swiftest way dead city mountains faroff time main tunnel great round pit made shelob taken abode ages past know many byways delved either side escape lair goings fro business masters tonight intend go far hastening find sidepassage led back watchtower cliff gleeful delighted found seen ran gabbled yammered fashion kind sam heard noise harsh voices flat hard dead air could distinguish two voices among rest louder nearer captains two parties seemed bringing rear debating went

 'can't stop rabble making racket shagrat ' grunted one `we want shelob us'
 `go gorbag making half noise' said `but let lads play need worry shelob bit reckon sat nail seems cry see nasty mess way back cursed crack we've stopped we've stopped hundred times let 'em laugh we've struck bit luck last got something lugb�rz wants'
 'lugb�rz wants eh d'you think elvish looked undersized what's danger thing like '
 'don't know till we've look'
 'oho told expect tell us know half make mistakes even top ones can'
 `sh gorbag' shagrat's voice lowered even strangely sharpened hearing sam could catch said 'they may they've got eyes ears everywhere among lot like there's doubt they're troubled something nazg�l account lugb�rz something nearly slipped'
 `nearly say ' said gorbag
 `all right' said shagrat `but we'll talk later wait till get underway there's place talk bit lads go on'
 shortly afterwards sam saw torches disappear rumbling noise hurried bump far could guess orcs turned gone opening frodo tried found blocked still blocked
 seemed great stone way orcs got somehow could hear voices side still running along deeper deeper mountain back towards tower sam felt desperate carrying master's body foul purpose could follow thrust pushed block threw yield far inside thought heard two captains' voices talking stood still listening little hoping perhaps learn something useful perhaps gorbag seemed belong minas morgul would come could slip
 `no know' said gorbag's voice `the messages go quicker anything could fly rule enquire done safest grr nazg�l give creeps skin body soon look leave cold dark side likes 'em they're favourites nowadays use grumbling tell game serving city'
 `you try shelob company' said shagrat
 'i'd like try somewhere there's none 'em war's that's things may easier'
 `it's going well say'
 'they would' grunted gorbag `we'll see anyway go well lot room d'you say � get chance me'll slip set somewhere trusty lads somewhere there's good loot nice handy big bosses'
 'ah ' said shagrat `like old times'
 `yes' said gorbag 'but count i'm easy mind said big bosses ay' voice sank almost whisper `ay even biggest make mistakes something nearly slipped say say something _has_ slipped we've got look always poor uruks put slips right small thanks forget enemies love us love get topsides we're done see ordered '
 `about hour ago saw us message came _nazg�l uneasy spies feared stairs double vigilance patrol head stairs_ came once'
 'bad business' said gorbag `see � silent watchers uneasy two days ago know patrol ordered another day message sent lugb�rz either owing great signal going high nazg�l going war get lugb�rz pay attention good i'm told'
 `the eye busy elsewhere suppose' said shagrat `big things going away west say'
 'i daresay' growled gorbag `but meantime enemies got stairs supposed keep watch special orders for'
 `that's enough try teach job awake right knew funny things going on'
 `very funny '
 `yes funny lights shouting shelob go lads saw sneak'
 `her sneak what's '
 `you must seen little thin black fellow like spider perhaps like starved frog he's came _out_ lugb�rz first time years ago word high let pass he's stairs twice since we've left alone seems understanding ladyship suppose he's good eat worry words high fine guard keep valley day racket early last night saw anyway lads reported ladyship fun seemed good enough message came thought sneak brought toy perhaps sent present prisoner war something interfere playing nothing gets shelob hunt'
 'nothing say use eyes back tell i'm easy mind whatever came stairs _did_ get cut web got clean hole that's something think '
 `ah well got end '
 `_got_ got _who_ little fellow one she'd larder long he'd lugb�rz wanted _you'd_ go get nice one'
 point sam began listen attentively pressed ear stone
 'who cut cords she'd put round shagrat one cut web see stuck pin ladyship one reckon shagrat '
 shagrat made reply
 `you may well put thinking cap got one laughing matter one one ever stuck pin shelob know well enough there's grief thinkthere's someone loose hereabouts dangerous damned rebel ever walked since bad old times since great siege something _has_ slipped'
 `and ' growled shagrat
 `by signs captain shagrat i'd say there's large warrior loose elf likely elfsword anyway axe well maybe he's loose bounds never spotted funny indeed ' gorbag spat sam smiled grimly description
 'ah well always take gloomy view' said shagrat 'you read signs like may ways explain anyhow i've got watchers every point i'm going deal one thing time i've look fellow _have_ caught i'll begin worry something else'
 `it's guess find much little fellow' said gorbag 'he may nothing real mischief big fellow sharp sword seem thought worth much anyhow � left lying regular elvish trick'
 `we'll see come we've talked enough let's go look prisoner
 `what going forget spotted first there's game lads must it'
 'now now' growled shagrat 'i orders belly's worth break 'em _any_ trespasser found guard held tower prisoner stripped full description every article garment weapon letter ring trinket sent lugb�rz lugb�rz _only_ prisoner kept safe intact pain death every member guard sends comes that's plain enough that's i'm going do'
 'stripped eh ' said gorbag 'what teeth nails hair '
 `no none he's lugb�rz tell he's wanted safe whole'
 'you'll find difficult' laughed gorbag 'he's nothing carrion lugb�rz stuff can't guess might well go pot'
 'you fool' snarled shagrat 'you've talking clever there's lot know though folk pot shelob take care carrion know ladyship binds cords meat eat dead meat suck cold blood fellow dead '

 sam reeled clutching stone felt whole dark world turning upside great shock almost swooned even fought keep hold senses deep inside aware comment 'you fool dead heart knew trust head samwise best part trouble never really hope done ' fur moment nothing prop unmoving stone listen listen vile orcvoices

 `garn' said shagrat 'she's got one poison hunting gives 'em dab neck go limp boned fish way d'you remember old ufthak lost days found corner hanging wide awake glaring laughed she'd forgotten maybe touch himno good interfering nar � little filth he'll wake hours beyond feeling bit sick hit he'll right would lugb�rz would let alone course beyond wondering what's happened him'
 'and what's going happen him' laughed gorbag 'we tell stories rate can't anything else suppose he's ever lovely lugb�rz may like know expect going funny thought let's go'
 `there's going fun tell you' said shagrat 'and he's got kept safe we're good dead'
 `all right i'd catch big one that's loose send report lugb�rz sound pretty say caught kitten let cat escape'

 voices began move away sam heard sound feet receding recovering shock wild fury `i got wrong ' cried `i knew would they've got devils filth never leave master never never right rule knew heart may forgiven i've got get back somehow somehow '
 drew sword beat stone hilt gave dull sound sword however blazed brightly could see dimly light surprise noticed great block shaped like heavy door less twice height dark blank space top low arch opening probably meant stop intrusion shelob fastened inside latch bolt beyond reach cunning remaining strength sam leaped caught top scrambled dropped ran madly sword blazing hand round bend winding tunnel
 news master still alive roused last effort beyond thought weariness could see anything ahead new passage twisted turned constantly thought catching two orcs voices growing nearer seemed quite close

 `that's i'm going do' said shagrat angry tones 'put right top chamber'
 `what ' growled gorbag `haven't lockups '
 `he's going harm's way tell you' answered shagrat 'see he's precious trust lads none neither mad fun he's going want come keep civil top say he'll safe there'
 `will he' said sam 'you're forgetting great big elvish warrior that's loose' raced round last corner find trick tunnel hearing ring gave misjudged distance
 two orcfigures still way ahead could see black squat red glare passage ran straight last incline end wide open great double doors leading probably deep chambers far high horn tower already orcs burden passed inside gorbag shagrat drawing near gate
 sam heard burst hoarse singing blaring horns banging gongs hideous clamour gorbag shagrat already threshold
 sam yelled brandished sting little voice drowned tumult one heeded
 great doors slammed boom bars iron fell place inside clang gate shut sam hurled bolted brazen plates fell senseless ground darkness frodo alive taken enemy

 prologue

 book largely concerned hobbits pages reader may discover much character little history information also found selection red book westmarch already published title _the hobbit_ story derived earlier chapters red book composed bilbo first hobbit become famous world large called _there back again_ since told journey east return adventure later involved hobbits great events age related
 many however may wish know remarkable people outset may possess earlier book readers notes important points collected hobbitlore first adventure briefly recalled


 hobbits unobtrusive ancient people numerous formerly today love peace quiet good tilled earth wellordered wellfarmed countryside favourite haunt understand like machines complicated forgebellows watermill handloom though skilful tools even ancient days rule shy 'the big folk' call us avoid us dismay becoming hard find quick hearing sharpeyed though inclined fat hurry unnecessarily nonetheless nimble deft movements possessed first art disappearing swiftly silently large folk wish meet come blundering developed men may seem magical hobbits never fact studied magic kind elusiveness due solely professional skill heredity practice close friendship earth rendered inimitable bigger clumsier races
 little people smaller dwarves less tout stocky even actually much shorter height variable ranging two four feet measure seldom reach three feet hive dwindled say ancient days taller according red book bandobras took bullroarer son isengrim second four foot five able ride horse surpassed hobbit records two famous characters old curious matter dealt book
 hobbits shire tales concerned days peace prosperity merry folk dressed bright colours notably fond yellow green seldom wore shoes since feet tough leathery soles clad thick curling hair much like hair heads commonly brown thus craft little practised among shoemaking long skilful fingers could make many useful comely things faces rule goodnatured rather beautiful broad brighteyed redcheeked mouths apt laughter eating drinking laugh eat drink often heartily fond simple jests times six meals day could get hospitable delighted parties presents gave away freely eagerly accepted
 plain indeed spite later estrangement hobbits relatives far nearer us elves even dwarves old spoke languages men fashion liked disliked much things men exactly relationship longer discovered beginning hobbits lies far back elder days lost forgotten elves still preserve records vanished time traditions concerned almost entirely history men appear seldom hobbits mentioned yet clear hobbits fact lived quietly middleearth many long years folk became even aware world full strange creatures beyond count little people seemed little importance days bilbo frodo heir suddenly became wish important renowned troubled counsels wise great

 days third age middleearth long past shape lands changed regions hobbits lived doubtless still linger northwest old world east sea original home hobbits bilbo's time preserved knowledge love learning genealogical lore far general among remained still older families studied books even gathered reports old times distant lands elves dwarves men records began settlement shire ancient legends hardly looked back wandering days clear nonetheless legends evidence peculiar words customs like many folk hobbits distant past moved westward earliest tales seem glimpse time dwelt upper vales anduin eaves greenwood great misty mountains later undertook hard perilous crossing mountains eriador longer certain accounts speak multiplying men land shadow fell forest became darkened new name mirkwood
 crossing mountains hobbits already become divided three somewhat different breeds harfoots stoors fallohides harfoots browner skin smaller shorter beardless bootless hands feet neat nimble preferred highlands hillsides stoors broader heavier build feet hands larger preferred flat lands riversides fallohides fairer skin also hair taller slimmer others lovers trees woodlands
 harfoots much dwarves ancient times long lived foothills mountains moved westward early roamed eriador far weathertop others still wilderland normal representative variety hobbit far numerous inclined settle one place longest preserved ancestral habit living tunnels holes
 stoors lingered long banks great river anduin less shy men came west harfoots followed course loudwater southwards many long dwelt tharbad borders dunland moved north
 fallohides least numerous northerly branch friendly elves hobbits skill language song handicrafts old preferred hunting tilling crossed mountains north rivendell came river hoarwell eriador soon mingled kinds preceded somewhat bolder adventurous often found leaders chieftains among clans harfoots stoors even bilbo's time strong fallohidish strain could still noted among greater families tooks masters buckland
 westlands eriador misty mountains mountains lune hobbits found men elves indeed remnant still dwelt d�nedain kings men came sea westernesse dwindling fast lands north kingdom falling far wide waste room spare incomers ere long hobbits began settle ordered communities earlier settlements long disappeared forgotten bilbo's time one first become important still endured though reduced size bree chetwood lay round forty miles east shire
 early days doubtless hobbits learned letters began write manner d�nedain turn long learned art elves days also forgot whatever languages used spoke ever common speech westron named current lands kings arnor gondor coasts sea belfalas lune yet kept words well names months days great store personal names past
 time legend among hobbits first becomes history reckoning years one thousand six hundred first year third age fallohide brothers marcho blanco set bree obtained permission high king fornost crossed brown river baranduin great following hobbits passed bridge stonebows built days power north kingdom took ail land beyond dwell river far downs demanded keep great bridge repair bridges roads speed king's messengers acknowledge lordship

 time hobbits kind warlike never fought among olden days course often obliged fight maintain hard world bilbo's time ancient history last battle story opens indeed one ever fought within borders shire beyond living memory battle greenfields sr 1147 bandobras took routed invasion orcs even weathers grown milder wolves come ravening north bitter white winters grandfather's tale though still store weapons shire used mostly trophies hanging hearths walls gathered museum michel delving mathomhouse called anything hobbits immediate use unwilling throw away called _mathom_ dwellings apt become rather crowded mathoms many presents passed hand hand son
 nonetheless ease peace left people still curiously tough came difficult daunt kill perhaps unwearyingly fond good things least could put without could survive rough handling grief foe weather way astonished know well looked bellies wellfed faces though slow quarrel sport killing nothing lived doughty bay need could still handle arms shot well bow keeneyed sure mark bows arrows hobbit stooped stone well get quickly cover trespassing beasts knew well
 hobbits originally lived holes ground believed dwellings still felt home course time obliged adopt forms abode actually shire bilbo's days rule richest poorest hobbits maintained old custom poorest went living burrows primitive kind mere holes indeed one window none welltodo still constructed luxurious versions simple diggings old suitable sites large ramifying tunnels _smials_ called everywhere found flats lowlying districts hobbits multiplied began build ground indeed even hilly regions older villages hobbiton tuckborough chief township shire michel delving white downs many houses wood brick stone specially favoured millers smiths ropers cartwrights others sort even holes live hobbits long accustomed build sheds workshops
 habit building farmhouses barns said begun among inhabitants marish brandywine hobbits quarter eastfarthing rather large heavylegged wore dwarfboots muddy weather well known stoors large part blood indeed shown many grew chins harfoot fallohide trace beard indeed folk marish buckland east river afterwards occupied came part later shire southaway still many peculiar names strange words found elsewhere shire
 probable craft building many crafts beside derived d�nedain hobbits may learned direct elves teachers men youth elves high kindred yet forsaken middleearth dwelt still time grey havens away west places within reach shire three elftowers immemorial age still seen tower hills beyond western marches shone far moonlight tallest furthest away standing alone upon green mound hobbits westfarthing said one could see sea lop tower hobbit ever known climb indeed hobbits ever seen sailed upon sea fewer still ever returned report hobbits regarded even rivers small boats deep misgivings many could swim days shire lengthened spoke less less elves grew afraid distrustful dealings sea became word fear among token death turned faces away hills west
 craft building may come elves men hobbits used fashion go towers houses usually long low comfortable oldest kind indeed built imitations _smials_ thatched dry grass straw roofed turves walls somewhat bulged stage however belonged early days shire hobbitbuilding long since altered improved devices learned dwarves discovered preference round windows even round doors chief remaining peculiarity hobbitarchitecture

 another astonishing thing hobbits old must mentioned astonishing habit imbibed inhaled pipes clay wood smoke burning leaves herb called _pipeweed_ _leaf_ variety probably _nicotiana_ great deal mystery surrounds origin peculiar custom 'art' hobbits preferred call could discovered antiquity put together meriadoc brandybuck later master buckland since tobacco southfarthing play part history follows remarks introduction _herblore shire_ may quoted
 'this' says 'is one art certainly claim invention hobbits first began smoke known legends family histories take granted ages folk shire smoked various herbs fouler sweeter accounts agree tobold hornblower longbottom southfarthing first grew true pipeweed gardens days isengrim second year 1070 shirereckoning best homegrown still comes district especially varieties known longbottom leaf old toby southern star
 'how old toby came plant recorded dying day would tell knew much herbs traveller said youth went often bree though certainly never went shire thus quite possible learned plant bree rate grows well south slopes hill breehobbits claim first actual smokers pipeweed claim course done everything people shire refer "colonists" case claim think likely true certainly bree art smoking genuine weed spread recent centuries among dwarves folk rangers wizards wanderers still passed fro ancient roadmeeting home centre thus found old inn bree _the prancing pony_ kept family butterbur time beyond record
 'all observations made many journeys south convinced weed native parts world came northward lower anduin whither suspect originally brought sea men westernesse grows abundantly gondor richer larger north never found wild flourishes warm sheltered places like longbottom men gondor call _sweet galenas_ esteem fragrance flowers land must carried greenway long centuries coming elendil day even d�nedain gondor allow us credit hobbits first put pipes even wizards first thought though one wizard knew took art long ago became skilful things put mind to'


 shire divided four quarters farthings already referred north south east west number folklands still bore names old leading families although time history names longer found proper folklands nearly tooks still lived tookland true many families bagginses boffins outside farthings east west marches buckland see beginning chapter v book westmarch added shire sr 1462
 shire time hardly 'government' families part managed affairs growing food eating occupied time matters rule generous greedy contented moderate estates farms workshops small trades tended remain unchanged generations
 remained course ancient tradition concerning high king fornost norbury called away north shire king nearly thousand years even ruins kings' norbury covered grass yet hobbits still said wild folk wicked things trolls heard king attributed king old essential laws usually kept laws free rules said ancient
 true took family long preeminent office thain passed oldbucks centuries chief took borne title ever since thain master shiremoot captain shiremuster hobbitryinarms muster moot held times emergency longer occurred thainship ceased nominal dignity took family still indeed accorded special respect remained numerous exceedingly wealthy liable produce every generation strong characters peculiar habits even adventurous temperament latter qualities however rather tolerated rich generally approved custom endured nonetheless referring head family took adding name required number isengrim second instance
 real official shire date mayor michel delving shire elected every seven years free fair white downs lithe midsummer mayor almost duty preside banquets given shireholidays occurred frequent intervals offices postmaster first shirriff attached mayoralty managed messenger service watch shireservices messengers numerous much busier two means hobbits lettered wrote constantly friends selection relations lived afternoon's walk
 shirriffs name hobbits gave police nearest equivalent possessed course uniforms things quite unknown feather caps practice rather haywards policemen concerned strayings beasts people shire twelve three farthing inside work rather larger body varying need employed 'beat bounds' see outsiders kind great small make nuisance
 time story begins bounders called greatly increased many reports complaints strange persons creatures prowling borders first sign quite always except tales legends long ago heeded sign even bilbo yet notion portended sixty years passed since set memorable journey old even hobbits reached hundred often much evidently still remained considerable wealth brought back much little revealed one even frodo favourite 'nephew' still kept secret ring bad found

 told hobbit came one day bilbo's door great wizard gandalf grey thirteen dwarves none indeed thorin oakenshield descendant kings twelve companions exile set lasting astonishment morning april year 1341 shirereckoning quest great treasure dwarfhoards kings mountain beneath erebor dale far east quest successful dragon guarded hoard destroyed yet though battle five armies fought thorin slain many deeds renown done matter would scarcely concerned later history earned note long annals third age 'accident' way party assailed orcs high pass misty mountains went towards wilderland happened bilbo lost black orcmines deep mountains groped vain dark put hand ring lying floor tunnel put pocket seemed like mere luck
 trying find way bilbo went roots mountains could go bottom tunnel lay cold lake far light island rock water lived gollum loathsome little creature paddled small boat large flat feet peering pale luminous eyes catching blind fish long fingers eating raw ate living thing even orc could catch strangle without struggle possessed secret treasure come long ages ago still lived light ring gold made wearer invisible one thing loved 'precious' talked even kept hidden safe hole island except hunting spying ores mines
 maybe would attacked bilbo ring met hobbit held hand elvish knife served sword gain time gollum challenged bilbo riddlegame saying asked riddle bilbo could guess would kill eat bilbo defeated would bilbo wished would lead way tunnels
 since lost dark without hope could neither go back bilbo accepted challenge asked one another many riddles end bilbo game luck seemed wits stumped last riddle ask cried hand came upon ring lad picked forgotten _what haw got pocket_ gollum failed answer though demanded three guesses
 authorities true differ whether last question mere 'question' 'riddle' according strict rules game agree accepting trying guess answer gollum bound promise bilbo pressed keep word thought came slimy creature might prove false even though promises held sacred old wickedest things feared break ages alone dark gollum's heart black treachery slipped away returned island bilbo knew nothing far dark water thought lay ring hungry angry 'precious' would fear weapon
 ring island lost gone screech sent shiver bilbo's back though yet understand happened gollum last leaped guess late _what got pocketses_ cried light eyes like green flame sped back murder hobbit recover 'precious' time bilbo saw peril fled blindly passage away water saved luck ran put hand pocket ring slipped quietly finger gollum passed without seeing went guard way lest 'thief' escape warily bilbo followed went along cursing talking 'precious' talk last even bilbo guessed truth hope came darkness found marvellous ring chance escape orcs gollum
 length came halt unseen opening led lower gates mines eastward side mountains gollum crouched bay smelling listening bilbo tempted slay sword pity stayed though kept ring hope lay would use help kill wretched creature disadvantage end gathering courage leaped gollum dark fled away passage pursued enemy's cries hate despair _thief thief baggins hates ever_

 curious fact story bilbo first told companions account gollum promised give _present_ game gollum went fetch island found treasure gone magic ring given long ago birthday bilbo guessed ring found game already right tight place said nothing made gollum show way reward instead present account bilbo set memoirs seems never altered even council elrond evidently still appeared original red book several copies abstracts many copies contain true account alternative derived doubt notes frodo samwise learned truth though seem unwilling delete anything actually written old hobbit
 gandalf however disbelieved bilbo's first story soon heard continued curious ring eventually got true tale bilbo much questioning strained friendship wizard seemed think truth important though say bilbo also thought important disturbing find good hobbit told truth first quite contrary habit idea 'present' mere hobbitlike invention suggested bilbo confessed gollum's talk overheard gollum fact call ring 'birthday present' many times also gandalf thought strange suspicious discover truth point many years seen book

 bilbo's later adventures little need said help ring escaped orcguards gate rejoined companions used ring many times quest chiefly help friends kept secret long could return home never spoke anyone save gandalf frodo one else shire knew existence believed frodo show account journey writing

 longexpected party

 mr bilbo baggins bag end announced would shortly celebrating eleventyfirst birthday party special magnificence much talk excitement hobbiton
 bilbo rich peculiar wonder shire sixty years ever since remarkable disappearance unexpected return riches brought back travels become local legend popularly believed whatever old folk might say hill bag end full tunnels stuffed treasure enough fame also prolonged vigour marvel time wore seemed little effect mr baggins ninety much fifty ninetynine began call _well_preserved _unchanged_ would nearer mark shook heads thought much good thing seemed unfair anyone possess apparently perpetual youth well reputedly inexhaustible wealth
 'it paid for' said 'it natural trouble come it'
 far trouble come mr baggins generous money people willing forgive oddities good fortune remained visiting terms relatives except course sackvillebagginses many devoted admirers among hobbits poor unimportant families close friends younger cousins began grow
 eldest bilbo's favourite young frodo baggins bilbo ninetynine adopted frodo heir brought live bag end hopes sackvillebagginses finally dashed bilbo frodo happened birthday september 22nd 'you better come live frodo lad' said bilbo one day 'and celebrate birthdayparties comfortably together' time frodo still _tweens_ hobbits called irresponsible twenties childhood coming age thirtythree


 twelve years passed year bagginses given lively combined birthdayparties bag end understood something quite exceptional planned autumn bilbo going _eleventyone_ 111 rather curious number respectable age hobbit old took reached 130 frodo going _thirtythree_ 33 important number date 'coming age'
 tongues began wag hobbiton bywater rumour coming event travelled shire history character mr bilbo baggins became chief topic conversation older folk suddenly found reminiscences welcome demand
 one attentive audience old ham gamgee commonly known gaffer held forth _the ivy bush_ small inn bywater road spoke authority tended garden bag end forty years helped old holman job growing old stiff joints job mainly carried youngest son sam gamgee father son friendly terms bilbo frodo lived hill number 3 bagshot row bag end
 'a nice wellspoken gentlehobbit mr bilbo i've always said' gaffer declared perfect truth bilbo polite calling 'master hamfast' consulting constantly upon growing vegetables � matter 'roots' especially potatoes gaffer recognized leading authority neighbourhood including
 'but frodo lives him' asked old noakes bywater 'baggins name he's half brandybuck say beats baggins hobbiton go looking wife away buckland folks queer'
 'and wonder they're queer' put daddy twofoot gaffer's nextdoor neighbour 'if live wrong side brandywine river right agin old forest that's dark bad place half tales true'
 'you're right dad' said gaffer 'not brandybucks buckland live _in_ old forest they're queer breed seemingly fool boats big river � natural small wonder trouble came say may mr frodo nice young hobbit could wish meet much like mr bilbo looks father baggins decent respectable hobbit mr drogo baggins never much tell till drownded'
 'drownded' said several voices heard darker rumours course hobbits passion family history ready hear 'well say' said gaffer 'you see mr drogo married poor miss primula brandybuck mr bilbo's first cousin mother's side mother youngest old took's daughters mr drogo second cousin mr frodo first _and_ second cousin removed either way saying follow mr drogo staying brandy hall fatherinlaw old master gorbadoc often marriage partial vittles old gorbadoc keeping mighty generous table went _boating_on brandywine river wife drownded poor mr frodo child '
 'i've heard went water dinner moonlight' said old noakes 'and drogo's weight sunk boat'
 'and _i_ heard pushed pulled him' said sandyman hobbiton miller
 'you listen hear sandyman' said gaffer much like miller 'there call go talking pushing pulling boats quite tricky enough sit still without looking cause trouble anyway mr frodo left orphan stranded might say among queer bucklanders brought anyhow brandy hall regular warren accounts old master gorbadoc never fewer couple hundred relations place mr bilbo never kinder deed brought lad back live among decent folk
 'but reckon nasty shock sackvillebagginses thought going get bag end time went thought dead comes back orders goes living living never looking day older bless suddenly produces heir papers made proper sackvillebagginses never see inside bag end hoped not'
 'there's tidy bit money tucked away hear tell' said stranger visitor business michel delving westfarthing 'all top hill full tunnels packed chests gold silver _and_jools i've heard '
 'then heard speak to' answered gaffer know nothing _jools_ mr bilbo free money seems lack know tunnelmaking saw mr bilbo came back matter sixty years ago lad i'd long come prentice old holman dad's cousin bag end helping keep folks trampling trapessing garden sale middle mr bilbo comes hill pony mighty big bags couple chests doubt mostly full treasure picked foreign parts mountains gold say enough fill tunnels lad sam know he's bag end crazy stories old days listens mr bilbo's tales mr bilbo learned letters � meaning harm mark hope harm come
 _'elves dragons'_ says '_cabbages potatoes better go getting mixed business betters land trouble big you'_i says might say others' added look stranger miller
 gaffer convince audience legend bilbo's wealth firmly fixed minds younger generation hobbits
 'ah likely enough adding brought first' argued miller voicing common opinion 'he's often away home look outlandish folk visit dwarves coming night old wandering conjuror gandalf say like gaffer bag end's queer place folk queerer'
 'and say _what you_ like know boating mr sandyman' retorted gaffer disliking miller even usual that's queer could bit queerness parts there's far away offer pint beer friend lived hole golden walls things proper bag end sam says _everyone's_ going invited party there's going presents mark presents � month is'

 month september fine could ask day two later rumour probably started knowledgeable sam spread going fireworks � fireworks seen shire nigh century indeed since old took died
 days passed day drew nearer oddlooking waggon laden oddlooking packages rolled hobbiton one evening toiled hill bag end startled hobbits peered lamplit doors gape driven outlandish folk singing strange songs dwarves long beards deep hoods remained bag end end second week september cart came bywater direction brandywine bridge broad daylight old man driving alone wore tall pointed blue hat long grey cloak silver scarf long white beard bushy eyebrows stuck beyond brim hat small hobbitchildren ran cart hobbiton right hill cargo fireworks rightly guessed bilbo's front door old man began unload great bundles fireworks sorts shapes labelled large red g elfrune 

 gandalf's mark course old man gandalf wizard whose fame shire due mainly skill fires smokes lights real business far difficult dangerous shirefolk knew nothing one 'attractions' party hence excitement hobbitchildren 'g grand' shouted old man smiled knew sight though appeared hobbiton occasionally never stopped long neither oldest elders seen one firework displays � belonged legendary past
 old man helped bilbo dwarves finished unloading bilbo gave pennies away single squib cracker forthcoming disappointment onlookers
 'run away now' said gandalf 'you get plenty time comes' disappeared inside bilbo door shut young hobbits stared door vain made feeling day party would never come

 inside bag end bilbo gandalf sitting open window small room looking west garden late afternoon bright peaceful flowers glowed red golden snapdragons sunflowers nasturtiums trailing turf walls peeping round windows
 'how bright garden looks' said gandalf
 'yes' said bilbo fond indeed dear old shire think need holiday'
 'you mean go plan then'
 'i made mind months ago changed it'
 'very well good saying stick plan � whole plan mind � hope turn best us'
 'i hope anyway mean enjoy thursday little joke'
 'who laugh wonder' said gandalf shaking head
 'we shall see' said bilbo

 next day carts rolled hill still carts might grumbling 'dealing locally' week orders began pour bag end every kind provision commodity luxury could obtained hobbiton bywater anywhere neighbourhood people became enthusiastic began tick days calendar watched eagerly postman hoping invitations
 long invitations began pouring hobbiton postoffice blocked bywater postoffice snowed voluntary assistant postmen called constant stream going hill carrying hundreds polite variations _thank shall certainly come_

 one hundred fortyfour guests expected pleasant feast though rather dreaded afterdinner speech host inevitable item liable drag bits called poetry sometimes glass two would allude absurd adventures mysterious journey guests disappointed _very_ pleasant feast fact engrossing entertainment rich abundant varied prolonged purchase provisions fell almost nothing throughout district ensuing weeks bilbo's catering depleted stocks stores cellars warehouses miles around matter much
 feast less came speech company however tolerant mood delightful stage called 'filling corners' sipping favourite drinks nibbling favourite dainties fears forgotten prepared listen anything cheer every full stop
 _my dear people_ began bilbo rising place 'hear hear hear' shouted kept repeating chorus seeming reluctant follow advice bilbo left place went stood chair illuminated tree light lanterns fell beaming face golden buttons shone embroidered silk waistcoat could see standing waving one hand air trouserpocket

 _thirdly finally_ said _i wish make announcement_ spoke last word loudly suddenly everyone sat still could _i regret announce � though said eleventyone years far short time spend among � end going leaving goodbye_
 stepped vanished blinding flash light guests blinked opened eyes bilbo nowhere seen one hundred fortyfour flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless old odo proudfoot removed feet table stamped dead silence suddenly several deep breaths every baggins boffin took brandybuck grubb chubb burrows bolger bracegirdle brockhouse goodbody hornblower proudfoot began talk
 generally agreed joke bad taste food drink needed cure guests shock annoyance 'he's mad always said so' probably popular comment even tooks exceptions thought bilbo's behaviour absurd moment took granted disappearance nothing ridiculous prank
 old rory brandybuck sure neither age enormous dinner clouded wits said daughterinlaw esmeralda 'there's something fishy dear believe mad baggins silly old fool worry taken vittles him' called loudly frodo send wine round
 frodo one present said nothing time sat silent beside bilbo's empty chair ignored remarks questions enjoyed joke course even though know difficulty keeping laughter indignant surprise guests time felt deeply troubled realized suddenly loved old hobbit dearly guests went eating drinking discussing bilbo baggins' oddities past present sackvillebagginses already departed wrath frodo want party gave orders wine served got drained glass silently health bilbo slipped pavilion
 bilbo baggins even making speech fingering golden ring pocket magic ring kept secret many years stepped slipped finger never seen hobbit hobbiton

 'hullo' said bilbo 'i wondered would turn up'
 'i glad find visible' replied wizard sitting chair 'i wanted catch final words suppose feel everything gone splendidly according plan'
 'yes do' said bilbo "though flash surprising quite startled let alone others little addition suppose'
 wisely kept ring secret years seemed necessary give guests something else would seem explain sudden vanishment'
 'and would spoil joke interfering old busybody' laughed bilbo 'but expect know best usual'
 'i � know anything feel sure whole affair come final point joke alarmed offended relations given whole shire something talk nine days ninetynine likely going further'
 'yes feel need holiday long holiday told probably permanent holiday expect shall return fact mean made arrangements
 'i old gandalf look beginning feel heart hearts _wellpreserved_ indeed' snorted 'why feel thin sort _stretched_ know mean like butter scraped much bread can't right need change something'
 gandalf looked curiously closely 'no seem right' said thoughtfully 'no believe plan probably best'
 'well i've made mind anyway want see mountains gandalf _mountains_ find somewhere _rest_ peace quiet without lot relatives prying around string confounded visitors hanging bell might find somewhere finish book thought nice ending _and lived happily ever end days '_
 gandalf laughed hope nobody read book however ends'
 'oh may years come frodo read already far gone keep eye frodo you'
 'yes � two eyes often spare them'
 'he would come course asked fact offered party really want yet want see wild country die mountains still love shire woods fields little rivers ought comfortable leaving everything course except oddments hope happy gets used time master now'
 'everything' said gandalf 'the ring well agreed remember'
 'well er yes suppose so' stammered bilbo
 'where it'
 'in envelope must know' said bilbo impatiently 'there mantelpiece well pocket' hesitated 'isn't odd now' said softly 'yet stay there'
 gandalf looked hard bilbo gleam eyes 'i think bilbo' said quietly 'i leave behind want to'
 'well yes � comes like parting may say really see want to' asked curious change came voice sharp suspicion annoyance 'you always badgering ring never bothered things got journey'
 'no badger you' said gandalf 'i wanted truth important magic rings � well magical rare curious professionally interested ring may say still like know go wandering also think _you_have quite long enough need bilbo unless quite mistaken'
 bilbo flushed angry light eyes kindly face grew hard 'why not' cried 'and business anyway know things found came me'
 'yes yes' said gandalf 'but need get angry'
 'if fault' said bilbo 'it mine tell precious yes precious'
 wizard's face remained grave attentive flicker deep eyes showed startled indeed alarmed 'it called before' said 'but you'
 'but say even gollum said mine shall keep say'
 gandalf stood spoke sternly 'you fool bilbo' said 'you make clearer every word say got far much hold let go go free'
 'i'll choose go please' said bilbo obstinately
 'now dear hobbit ' said gandalf 'all long life friends owe something come promised give '
 'well want ring say so' cried bilbo 'but get give precious away tell you' hand strayed hilt small sword
 gandalf's eyes flashed turn get angry soon' said say shall see gandalf grey uncloaked' took step towards hobbit seemed grow tall menacing shadow filled little room
 bilbo backed away wall breathing hard hand clutching pocket stood facing one another air room tingled gandalf's eyes remained bent hobbit slowly hands relaxed began tremble
 'i know come gandalf' said 'you never like mine found gollum would killed kept i'm thief whatever said'
 'i never called one' gandalf answered 'and one either trying rob help wish would trust used' turned away shadow passed seemed dwindle old grey man bent troubled
 bilbo drew hand eyes sorry' said 'but felt queer yet would relief way bothered growing mind lately sometimes felt like eye looking always wanting put disappear know wondering safe pulling make sure tried locking found rest without pocket know seem able make mind'
 'then trust mine' said gandalf 'it quite made go away leave behind stop possessing give frodo look him'
 bilbo stood moment tense undecided presently sighed 'all right' said effort will' shrugged shoulders smiled rather ruefully 'after that's party business really give away lots birthday presents somehow make easier give away time made easier end would pity waste preparations would quite spoil joke'
 'indeed would take away point ever saw affair' said gandalf
 'very well' said bilbo 'it goes frodo rest' drew deep breath 'and really must starting somebody else catch said goodbye bear again' picked bag moved door
 'you still got ring pocket' said wizard 'well have' cried bilbo 'and documents better take deliver safest'
 'no give ring me' said gandalf 'put mantelpiece safe enough till frodo comes shall wait him'
 bilbo took envelope set clock hand jerked back packet fell floor could pick wizard stooped seized set place spasm anger passed swiftly hobbit's face suddenly gave way look relief laugh 'well that's that' said 'now i'm off'
 went hall bilbo chose favourite stick stand whistled three dwarves came different rooms busy
 'is everything ready' asked bilbo 'everything packed labelled'
 'everything' answered
 'well let's start then' stepped frontdoor
 fine night black sky dotted stars looked sniffing air 'what fun fun road dwarves really longing years goodbye ' said looking old home bowing door 'goodbye gandalf'
 'goodbye present bilbo take care old enough perhaps wise enough'
 'take care care worry happy ever saying great deal time come swept feet last' added low voice sang softly dark

 road goes ever
 door began
 far ahead road gone
 must follow
 pursuing eager feet
 joins larger way
 many paths errands meet
 whither cannot say

 paused silent moment without another word turned away lights voices fields tents followed three companions went round garden trotted long sloping path jumped low place hedge bottom took meadows passing night like rustle wind grass
 gandalf remained staring darkness 'goodbye dear bilbo � next meeting' said softly went back indoors
 frodo came soon afterwards found sitting dark deep thought 'has gone' asked
 'yes' answered gandalf 'he gone last'
 ' wish � mean hoped evening joke' said frodo 'but knew heart really meant go always used joke serious things wish come back sooner see off'
 think really preferred slipping quietly end' said gandalf 'don't troubled he'll right � left packet is'
 frodo took envelope mantelpiece glanced open
 'you'll find documents think' said wizard 'you master bag end also fancy find golden ring'
 'the ring' exclaimed frodo 'has left wonder still may useful'
 'it may may not' said gandalf 'i make use keep secret keep safe going bed'
 master bag end frodo felt painful duty say goodbye guests rumours strange events spread field frodo would say _no doubt everything cleared morning_ midnight carriages came important folk one one rolled away filled full unsatisfied hobbits gardeners came arrangement removed wheelbarrows inadvertently remained behind
 night slowly passed sun rose hobbits rose rather later morning went people came began orders clear away pavilions tables chairs spoons knives bottles plates lanterns flowering shrubs boxes crumbs crackerpaper forgotten bags gloves handkerchiefs uneaten food small item number people came without orders bagginses boffins bolgers tooks guests lived staying near midday even bestfed large crowd bag end uninvited unexpected
 frodo waiting step smiling looking rather tired worried welcomed callers much say reply inquiries simply 'mr bilbo baggins gone away far know good' visitors invited come inside bilbo left 'messages'
 inside hall piled large assortment packages parcels small articles furniture every item label tied several labels sort
 _for adelard took bilbo_ umbrella adelard carried many unlabelled ones

 _for lobelia sackvillebaggins present_ case silver spoons bilbo believed acquired good many spoons away former journey lobelia knew quite well arrived later day took point also took spoons
 small selection assembled presents bilbo's residence got rather cluttered things course long life tendency hobbitholes get cluttered custom giving many birthdaypresents largely responsible course birthdaypresents always _new_ one two old _mathoms_ forgotten uses circulated around district bilbo usually given new presents kept received old hole cleared little
 every one various parting gifts labels written personally bilbo several point joke course things given would wanted welcome poorer hobbits especially bagshot row well old gaffer gamgee got two sacks potatoes new spade woollen waistcoat bottle ointment creaking joints old rory brandybuck return much hospitality got dozen bottles old winyards strong red wine southfarthing quite mature laid bilbo's father rory quite forgave bilbo voted capital fellow first bottle
 plenty everything left frodo course chief treasures well books pictures enough furniture left possession however sign mention money jewellery pennypiece glass bead given away
 frodo trying time afternoon false rumour whole household distributed free spread like wildfire long place packed people business could kept labels got torn mixed quarrels broke people tried swaps deals hall others tried make _off_ minor items addressed anything seemed unwanted unwatched road gate blocked barrows handcarts
 middle commotion sackvillebagginses arrived frodo retired left friend merry brandybuck keep eye things otho loudly demanded see frodo merry bowed politely
 'he indisposed' said 'he resting'
 'hiding mean' said lobelia 'anyway want see mean see go tell so'
 merry left long hall time discover parting gift spoons improve tempers eventually shown study frodo sitting table lot papers front looked indisposed � see sackvillebagginses rate stood fidgeting something pocket spoke quite politely
 sackvillebagginses rather offensive began offering bad bargainprices friends various valuable unlabelled things frodo replied things specially directed bilbo given away said whole affair fishy
 'only one thing clear me' said otho 'and exceedingly well insist seeing will'
 otho would bilbo's heir adoption frodo read carefully snorted unfortunately clear correct according legal customs hobbits demand among things seven signatures witnesses red ink
 'foiled again' said wife 'and waiting _sixty_ years spoons fiddlesticks' snapped fingers frodo's nose slumped lobelia easily got rid little later frodo came study see things going found still place investigating nooks comers tapping floors escorted firmly premises relieved several small rather valuable articles somehow fallen inside umbrella face looked throes thinking really crushing parting remark found say turning round step
 'you'll live regret young fellow go belong baggins � � brandybuck'
 'did hear merry insult like' said frodo shut door
 'it compliment' said merry brandybuck 'and course true'

 went round hole evicted three young hobbits two boffins bolger knocking holes walls one cellars frodo also tussle young sancho proudfoot old odo proudfoot's grandson begun excavation larger pantry thought echo legend bilbo's gold excited curiosity hope legendary gold mysteriously obtained positively illgotten every one knows one's finding � unless search interrupted
 overcome sancho pushed frodo collapsed chair hall time close shop merry' said 'lock door open anyone today even bring battering ram' went revive belated cup tea
 hardly sat came soft knock frontdoor 'lobelia likely' thought 'she must thought something really nasty come back say wait'
 went tea knock repeated much louder took notice suddenly wizard's head appeared window
 'if let frodo shall blow door right hole hill' said
 'my dear gandalf half minute' cried frodo running room door 'come come thought lobelia'
 'then forgive saw time ago driving ponytrap towards bywater face would curdled new milk'
 'she already nearly curdled honestly nearly tried bilbo's ring longed disappear'
 'don't that' said gandalf sitting 'do careful ring frodo fact partly come say last word'
 'well it'
 'what know already'
 'only bilbo told heard story found used journey mean'
 'which story wonder' said gandalf
 'oh told dwarves put book' said frodo 'he told true story soon came live said pestered till told better know "no secrets us frodo" said "but go mine anyway"'
 'that's interesting' said gandalf 'well think all'
 'if mean inventing "present" well thought true story much likely see point altering unlike bilbo anyway thought rather odd'
 'so odd things may happen people treasures � use let warning careful may powers making vanish wish to'
 'i understand' said frodo
 'neither i' answered wizard 'i merely begun wonder ring especially since last night need worry take advice use seldom least beg use way cause talk rouse suspicion say keep safe keep secret'
 'you mysterious afraid of'
 'i certain say may able tell something come back going goodbye present' got
 'at once' cried frodo 'why thought staying least week looking forward help'
 'i mean � change mind may away good i'll come see soon expect see shall slip quietly often visiting shire openly find become rather unpopular say nuisance disturber peace people actually accusing spiriting bilbo away worse want know supposed plot get hold wealth'
 'some people' exclaimed frodo 'you mean otho lobelia abominable would give bag end everything else could get bilbo back go tramping country love shire begin wish somehow gone wonder shall ever see again'
 'so i' said gandalf 'and wonder many things goodbye take care look especially unlikely times goodbye'
 frodo saw door gave final wave hand walked surprising pace frodo thought old wizard looked unusually bent almost carrying great weight evening closing cloaked figure quickly vanished twilight frodo see long time


 _chapter 2_
 shadow past

 talk die nine even ninetynine days second disappearance mr bilbo baggins discussed hobbiton indeed shire year day remembered much longer became firesidestory young hobbits eventually mad baggins used vanish bang flash reappear bags jewels gold became favourite character legend lived long true events forgotten
 meantime general opinion neighbourhood bilbo always rather cracked last gone quite mad run blue undoubtedly fallen pool river come tragic hardly untimely end blame mostly laid gandalf
 'if dratted wizard leave young frodo alone perhaps he'll settle grow hobbitsense' said appearance wizard leave frodo alone settle growth hobbitsense noticeable indeed began carry bilbo's reputation oddity refused go mourning next year gave party honour bilbo's hundredandtwelfth birthday called hundredweight feast short mark twenty guests invited several meals snowed food rained drink hobbits say
 people rather shocked frodo kept custom giving bilbo's birthday party year year got used said think bilbo dead asked 'where then' shrugged shoulders
 lived alone bilbo done good many friends especially among younger hobbits mostly descendants old took children fond bilbo often bag end folco boffin fredegar bolger two closest friends peregrin took usually called pippin merry brandybuck real name meriadoc seldom remembered frodo went tramping shire often wandered amazement sensible folk sometimes seen far home walking hills woods starlight merry pippin suspected visited elves times bilbo done
 time went people began notice frodo also showed signs good 'preservation' outwardly retained appearance robust energetic hobbit tweens 'some folk luck' said frodo approached usually sober age fifty began think queer
 frodo first shock found master _the_ mr baggins bag end rather pleasant years quite happy worry much future half unknown regret gone bilbo steadily growing found wondering times especially autumn wild lands strange visions mountains never seen came dreams began say 'perhaps shall cross river one day' half mind always replied 'not yet'
 went forties running fiftieth birthday drawing near fifty number felt somehow significant ominous rate age adventure suddenly befallen bilbo frodo began feel restless old paths seemed welltrodden looked maps wondered lay beyond edges maps made shire showed mostly white spaces beyond borders took wandering afield often merry friends watched anxiously often seen walking talking strange wayfarers began time appear shire

 rumours strange things happening world outside gandalf time appeared sent message several years frodo gathered news could elves seldom walked shire could seen passing westward woods evening passing returning leaving middleearth longer concerned troubles however dwarves road unusual numbers ancient eastwest road ran shire end grey havens dwarves always used way mines blue mountains hobbits' chief source news distant parts � wanted rule dwarves said little hobbits asked frodo often met strange dwarves far countries seeking refuge west troubled spoke whispers enemy land mordor
 name hobbits knew legends dark past like shadow background memories ominous disquieting seemed evil power mirkwood driven white council reappear greater strength old strongholds mordor dark tower rebuilt said power spreading far wide away far east south wars growing fear orcs multiplying mountains trolls abroad longer dullwitted cunning armed dreadful weapons murmured hints creatures terrible name

 little course reached ears ordinary hobbits even deafest stayathome began hear queer tales whose business took borders saw strange things conversation _the green dragon_ bywater one evening spring frodo's fiftieth year showed even comfortable heart shire rumours heard though hobbits still laughed
 sam gamgee sitting one corner near fire opposite ted sandyman miller's son various rustic hobbits listening talk
 'queer things hear days sure' said sam
 'ah' said ted 'you listen hear firesidetales children's stories home want to'
 'no doubt can' retorted sam 'and daresay there's truth reckon invented stories anyway take dragons now'
 'no thank 'ee' said ted 'i heard tell youngster there's call believe there's one dragon bywater that's green' said getting general laugh
 'all right' said sam laughing rest 'but treemen giants might call say one bigger tree seen away beyond north moors long back'
 'who's _they_'
 'my cousin hal one works mr boffin overhill goes northfarthing hunting _saw_ one'
 'says perhaps hal's always saying he's seen things maybe sees things ain't there'
 'but one big elm tree walking � walking seven yards stride inch'
 'then bet inch saw _was_ elm tree like not'
 'but one _walking_ tell ain't elm tree north moors'
 'then hal can't seen one' said ted laughing clapping audience seemed think ted scored point
 'all same' said sam 'you can't deny others besides halfast seen queer folk crossing shire � crossing mind turned back borders bounders never busy
 'and i've heard tell elves moving west say going harbours away beyond white towers' sam waved arm vaguely neither knew far sea past old towers beyond western borders shire old tradition away stood grey havens times elvenships set sail never return
 'they sailing sailing sailing sea going west leaving us' said sam half chanting words shaking head sadly solemnly ted laughed
 'well anything new believe old tales see matters let sail warrant seen one else shire'
 'well know' said sam thoughtfully believed seen elf woods still hoped see one day legends heard early years fragments tales halfremembered stories elves hobbits knew always moved deeply 'there even parts know fair folk get news them' said 'there's mr baggins work told sailing knows bit elves old mr bilbo knew many's talk little lad'
 'oh they're cracked' said ted 'leastways old bilbo cracked frodo's cracking that's get news never want moonshine well friends i'm home good health' drained mug went noisily
 sam sat silent said good deal think one thing lot bag end garden would busy day tomorrow weather cleared grass growing fast sam mind gardening sighed got went
 early april sky clearing heavy rain sun cool pale evening quietly fading night walked home early stars hobbiton hill whistling softly thoughtfully

 time gandalf reappeared long absence three years party away paid frodo brief visit taking good look went next year two turned fairly often coming unexpectedly dusk going without warning sunrise would discuss business journeys seemed chiefly interested small news frodo's health doings
 suddenly visits ceased nine years since frodo seen heard begun think wizard would never return given interest hobbits evening sam walking home twilight fading came familiar tap study window
 frodo welcomed old friend surprise great delight looked hard one another
 'ah well eh' said gandalf 'you look ever frodo'
 'so you' frodo replied secretly thought gandalf looked older careworn pressed news wide world soon deep talk stayed far night

 next morning late breakfast wizard sitting frodo open window study bright fire hearth sun warm wind south everything looked fresh new green spring shimmering fields tips trees' fingers
 gandalf thinking spring nearly eighty years bilbo run bag end without handkerchief hair perhaps whiter beard eyebrows perhaps longer face lined care wisdom eyes bright ever smoked blew smokerings vigour delight
 smoking silence frodo sitting still deep thought even light morning felt dark shadow tidings gandalf brought last broke silence
 'last night began tell strange things ring gandalf' said 'and stopped said matters best left daylight think better finish say ring dangerous far dangerous guess way'
 'in many ways' answered wizard far powerful ever dared think first powerful end would utterly overcome anyone mortal race possessed would possess
 'in eregion long ago many elvenrings made magic rings call course various kinds potent less lesser rings essays craft fullgrown elvensmiths trifles � yet still mind dangerous mortals great rings rings power perilous
 'a mortal frodo keeps one great rings die grow obtain life merely continues last every minute weariness often uses ring make invisible he_ fades_ becomes end invisible permanently walks twilight eye dark power rules rings yes sooner later � later strong wellmeaning begin neither strength good purpose last � sooner later dark power devour him'
 'how terrifying' said frodo another long silence sound sam gamgee cutting lawn came garden

 'how long known this' asked frodo length 'and much bilbo know'
 'bilbo knew told sure' said gandalf 'he would certainly never passed anything thought would danger even though promised look thought ring beautiful useful need anything wrong queer said "growing mind" always worrying suspect ring blame though found thing needed looking seem always size weight shrank expanded odd way might suddenly slip finger tight'
 'yes warned last letter' said frodo 'so always kept chain'
 'very wise' said gandalf 'but long life bilbo never connected ring took credit proud though getting restless uneasy _thin stretched_ said sign ring getting control'
 'how long known this' asked frodo
 'known' said gandalf 'i known much wise know frodo mean "known _this_ ring" well still _know_one might say last test make longer doubt guess
 'when first begin guess' mused searching back memory 'let see � year white council drove dark power mirkwood battle five armies bilbo found ring shadow fell heart though know yet feared wondered often gollum came great ring plainly � least clear first heard bilbo's strange story "won" could believe last got truth saw trying put claim ring beyond doubt much like gollum "birthday present" lies much alike comfort clearly ring unwholesome power set work keeper first real warning well told bilbo often rings better left unused resented soon got angry little else could could take without greater harm right anyway could watch wait might perhaps consulted saruman white something always held back'
 'who he' asked frodo never heard before'
 'maybe not' answered gandalf 'hobbits concern yet great among wise chief order head council knowledge deep pride grown takes ill meddling lore elvenrings great small province long studied seeking lost secrets making rings debated council would reveal us ringlore told fears doubt slept � uneasily still watched waited
 'and seemed well bilbo years passed yes passed seemed touch showed signs age shadow fell said "after comes longlived family mother's side time yet wait"
 'and waited night left house said things filled fear words saruman could allay knew last something dark deadly work spent years since finding truth it'
 'there permanent harm done there' asked frodo anxiously 'he would get right time able rest peace mean'
 'he felt better once' said gandalf 'but one power world knows rings effects far know power world knows hobbits among wise one goes hobbitlore obscure branch knowledge full surprises soft butter yet sometimes tough old treeroots think likely would resist rings far longer wise would believe think need worry bilbo
 'of course possessed ring many years used might take long influence wear � safe see instance otherwise might live years quite happily stop parted gave end accord important point troubled dear bilbo let thing go _you_ feel responsible
 'ever since bilbo left deeply concerned charming absurd helpless hobbits would grievous blow world dark power overcame shire kind jolly stupid bolgers hornblowers boffins bracegirdles rest mention ridiculous bagginses became enslaved'
 frodo shuddered 'but be' asked 'and want slaves'
 'to tell truth' replied gandalf 'i believe hitherto � _hitherto_mark � entirely overlooked existence hobbits thankful safety passed need � many useful servants � forget hobbits miserable slaves would please far hobbits happy free thing malice revenge'
 'revenge' said frodo 'revenge still understand bilbo ring'
 'it everything it' said gandalf 'you know real peril yet shall sure last time come speak give ring moment'

 frodo took breechespocket clasped chain hung belt unfastened handed slowly wizard felt suddenly heavy either frodo way reluctant gandalf touch
 gandalf held looked made pure solid gold 'can see markings it' asked
 'no' said frodo 'there none quite plain never shows scratch sign wear'
 'well look' frodo's astonishment distress wizard threw suddenly middle glowing corner fire frodo gave cry groped tongs gandalf held back
 'wait' said commanding voice giving frodo quick look bristling brows
 apparent change came ring gandalf got closed shutters outside window drew curtains room became dark silent though clack sam's shears nearer windows could still heard faintly garden moment wizard stood looking fire stooped removed ring hearth tongs picked frodo gasped
 quite cool' said gandalf 'take it' frodo received shrinking palm seemed become thicker heavier ever
 'hold up' said gandalf 'and look closely'
 frodo saw fine lines finer finest penstrokes running along ring outside inside lines fire seemed form letters flowing script shone piercingly bright yet remote great depth

 'i cannot read fiery letters' said frodo quavering voice
 'no' said gandalf 'but letters elvish ancient mode language mordor utter common tongue said close enough

 _one ring rule one ring find
 one ring bring darkness bind them_

 two lines verse long known elvenlore

 _three rings elvenkings sky
 seven dwarflords halls stone
 nine mortal men doomed die
 one dark lord dark throne
 land mordor shadows lie
 one ring rule one ring find
 one ring bring darkness bind
 land mordor shadows lie'_

 paused said slowly deep voice 'this masterring one ring rule one ring lost many ages ago great weakening power greatly desires � must _not_ get it'
 frodo sat silent motionless fear seemed stretch vast hand like dark cloud rising east looming engulf 'this ring' stammered 'how earth come me'

 'ah' said gandalf 'that long story beginnings lie back black years loremasters remember tell tale still sitting spring passed winter
 'but last night told sauron great dark lord rumours heard true indeed arisen left hold mirkwood returned ancient fastness dark tower mordor name even hobbits heard like shadow borders old stories always defeat respite shadow takes another shape grows again'
 'i wish need happened time' said frodo
 'so i' said gandalf 'and live see times decide decide time given us already frodo time beginning look black enemy fast becoming strong plans far ripe think ripening shall hard put hard put even dreadful chance
 'the enemy still lacks one thing give strength knowledge beat resistance break last defences cover lands second darkness lacks one ring
 'the three fairest elflords hid hand never touched sullied seven dwarfkings possessed three recovered others dragons consumed nine gave mortal men proud great ensnared long ago fell dominion one became ringwraiths shadows great shadow terrible servants long ago many year since nine walked abroad yet knows shadow grows may walk come speak things even morning shire
 'so nine gathered seven also else destroyed three hidden still longer troubles needs one made ring let great part former power pass could rule others recovers command wherever even three wrought laid bare stronger ever
 'and dreadful chance frodo believed one perished elves destroyed done knows _not_ perished found seeking seeking thought bent great hope great fear'
 'why destroyed' cried frodo 'and enemy ever come lose strong precious him' clutched ring hand saw already dark fingers stretching seize
 'it taken him' said gandalf 'the strength elves resist greater long ago men estranged men westernesse came aid chapter ancient history might good recall sorrow gathering dark great valour great deeds wholly vain one day perhaps tell tale shall hear told full one knows best
 'but moment since need know thing came tale enough say gilgalad elvenking elendil westernesse overthrew sauron though perished deed isildur elendil's son cut ring sauron's hand took sauron vanquished spirit fled hidden long years shadow took shape mirkwood
 'but ring lost fell great river anduin vanished isildur marching north along east banks river near gladden fields waylaid orcs mountains almost folk slain leaped waters ring slipped finger swam orcs saw killed arrows'
 gandalf paused 'and dark pools amid gladden fields' said 'the ring passed knowledge legend even much history known council wise could discover last carry story think

 'long still long ago lived banks great river edge wilderland cleverhanded quietfooted little people guess hobbitkind akin fathers fathers stoors loved river often swam made little boats reeds among family high repute large wealthier ruled grandmother folk stern wise old lore inquisitive curiousminded family called sm�agol interested roots beginnings dived deep pools burrowed trees growing plants tunnelled green mounds ceased look hilltops leaves trees flowers opening air head eyes downward

 'so journeyed night highlands found little cave dark stream ran wormed way like maggot heart hills vanished knowledge ring went shadows even maker power begun grow could learn nothing it'

 'gollum' cried frodo 'gollum mean gollumcreature bilbo met loathsome'
 'i think sad story' said wizard 'and might happened others even hobbits known'
 'i can't believe gollum connected hobbits however distantly' said frodo heat 'what abominable notion'
 'it true same' replied gandalf 'about origins rate know hobbits even bilbo's story suggests kinship great deal background minds memories similar understood one another remarkably well much better hobbit would understand say dwarf orc even elf think riddles knew one thing'
 'yes' said frodo 'though folks besides hobbits ask riddles much sort hobbits cheat gollum meant cheat time trying put poor bilbo guard daresay amused wickedness start game might end providing easy victim lost would hurt him'
 'only true fear' said gandalf 'but something else think see yet even gollum wholly ruined proved tougher even one wise would guessed hobbit might little corner mind still light came chink dark light past actually pleasant think hear kindly voice bringing memories wind trees sun grass forgotten things
 'but course would make evil part angrier end � unless could conquered unless could cured' gandalf sighed 'alas little hope yet hope though possessed ring long almost far back remember long since worn much black darkness seldom needed certainly never "faded" thin tough still thing eating mind course torment become almost unbearable
 'all "great secrets" mountains turned empty night nothing find nothing worth nasty furtive eating resentful remembering altogether wretched hated dark hated light hated everything ring all'
 'what mean' said frodo 'surely ring precious thing cared hated get rid go away leave it'
 'you ought begin understand frodo heard' said gandalf 'he hated loved hated loved could get rid left matter
 'a ring power looks frodo _it_ may slip treacherously keeper never abandons plays idea handing someone else's care � early stage first begins grip far know bilbo alone history ever gone beyond playing really done needed help even would never forsaken cast aside gollum frodo ring decided things ring left _him'_
 'what time meet bilbo' said frodo 'wouldn't orc suited better'
 'it laughing matter' said gandalf 'not strangest event whole history ring far bilbo's arrival time putting hand blindly dark
 'there one power work frodo ring trying get back master slipped isildur's hand betrayed chance came caught poor deal murdered gollum devoured could make use small mean long stayed would never leave deep pool master awake sending dark thought mirkwood abandoned gollum picked unlikely person imaginable bilbo shire
 'behind something else work beyond design ringmaker put plainer saying bilbo _meant_to find ring _not_ maker case also _meant_to maybe encouraging thought'

 gandalf looked frodo eyes glinted knew much learned much' answered 'but going give account doings _you_ history elendil isildur one ring known wise ring shown one ring firewriting alone apart evidence' 'and discover that' asked frodo interrupting 'just room course' answered wizard sharply 'but expected find come back dark journeys long search make final test last proof clear making gollum's part fitting gap history required thought may started guesses gollum guessing know seen him'
 'you seen gollum' exclaimed frodo amazement
 'yes obvious thing course one could tried long ago managed last'
 'then happened bilbo escaped know that'
 'not clearly told gollum willing tell � though course way reported gollum liar sift words instance called ring "birthday present" stuck said came grandmother lots beautiful things kind ridiculous story doubt sm�agol's grandmother matriarch great person way talk possessing many elvenrings absurd giving away lie lie grain truth

 'but find out' asked frodo
 'well name bilbo foolishly told gollum would difficult discover country gollum came oh yes came longing ring proved stronger fear orcs even light year two left mountains see though still bound desire ring longer devouring began revive little felt old terribly old yet less timid mortally hungry
 'light light sun moon still feared hated always think cunning found could hide daylight moonshine make way swiftly softly dead night pale cold eyes catch small frightened unwary things grew stronger bolder new food new air found way mirkwood one would expect'
 'is found him' asked frodo
 'i saw there' answered gandalf 'but wandered far following bilbo's trail difficult learn anything certain talk constantly interrupted curses threats "what got pocketses" said "it say precious little cheat fair question cheated first broke rules ought squeezed yes precious precious"
 'that sample talk suppose want weary days hints dropped among snarls even gathered padding feet taken last esgaroth even streets dale listening secretly peering well news great events went far wide wilderland many heard bilbo's name knew came made secret return journey home west gollum's sharp ears would soon learn wanted'
 'then track bilbo further' asked frodo 'why come shire'
 'ah' said gandalf 'now come think gollum tried set came back westward far great river turned aside daunted distance sure something else drew away friends think hunted
 'the woodelves tracked first easy task trail still fresh mirkwood back led though never caught wood full rumour dreadful tales even among beasts birds woodmen said new terror abroad ghost drank blood climbed trees find nests crept holes find young slipped windows find cradles
 'but western edge mirkwood trail turned away wandered southwards passed woodelves' ken lost made great mistake yes frodo first though fear may prove worst let matter let go much else think time still trusted lore saruman
 'well years ago paid since many dark dangerous days trail long cold took bilbo left search would vain help friend aragorn greatest traveller huntsman age world together sought gollum whole length wilderland without hope without success last given chase turned parts gollum found friend returned great perils bringing miserable creature
 'what would say wept called us cruel many _gollum_ throat pressed whined cringed rubbed long hands licking fingers pained remembered old torture afraid possible doubt made slow sneaking way step step mile mile south last land mordor'

 heavy silence fell room frodo could hear heart beating even outside everything seemed still sound sam's shears could heard
 'yes mordor' said gandalf 'alas mordor draws wicked things dark power bending gather ring enemy would leave mark leave open summons folk whispering new shadow south hatred west fine new friends would help revenge
 'wretched fool land would learn much much comfort sooner later lurked pried borders would caught taken � examination way fear found already long way back errand mischief matter much worst mischief done
 'yes alas enemy learned one found knows isildur fell knows gollum found ring knows great ring gave long life knows one three never lost endure evil knows one seven nine accounted knows one last heard think _hobbits_ _shire_
 'the shire � may seeking already found lies indeed frodo fear may even think longunnoticed name _baggins_ become important'
 'but terrible' cried frodo 'far worse worst imagined hints warnings gandalf best friends really afraid pity bilbo stab vile creature chance'
 'pity pity stayed hand pity mercy strike without need well rewarded frodo sure took little hurt evil escaped end began ownership ring pity'
 'i sorry' said frodo 'but frightened feel pity gollum'
 'you seen him' gandalf broke
 'no want to' said frodo can't understand mean say elves let live horrible deeds rate bad orc enemy deserves death'
 'deserves daresay many live deserve death die deserve life give eager deal death judgement even wise cannot see ends much hope gollum cured dies chance bound fate ring heart tells part play yet good ill end comes pity bilbo may rule fate many � least case kill old wretched woodelves prison treat kindness find wise hearts'
 'all same' said frodo 'even bilbo could kill gollum wish kept ring wish never found got let keep make throw away destroy it'
 'let make you' said wizard 'haven't listening said thinking saying throwing away obviously wrong rings way found evil hands might done great evil worst might fallen hands enemy indeed certainly would one exerting power find draw
 'of course dear frodo dangerous troubled deeply much stake take risk � though even far away never day shire guarded watchful eyes long never used think ring would lasting effect evil rate long time must remember nine years ago last saw still knew little certain'
 'but destroy say done long ago' cried frodo warned even sent message would done away it'
 'would would ever tried'
 'no suppose one could hammer melt it'
 'try' said gandalf try now'
 frodo drew ring pocket looked appeared plain smooth without mark device could see gold looked fair pure frodo thought rich beautiful colour perfect roundness admirable thing altogether precious took intended fling hottest part fire found could without great struggle weighed ring hand hesitating forcing remember gandalf told effort made movement cast away � found put back pocket
 gandalf laughed grimly 'you see already frodo cannot easily let go damage could "make" � except force would break mind breaking ring force useless even took struck heavy sledgehammer would make dint cannot unmade hands mine
 'your small fire course would melt even ordinary gold ring already passed unscathed even unheated smith's forge shire could change even anvils furnaces dwarves could said dragonfire could melt consume rings power dragon left earth old fire hot enough ever dragon even ancalagon black could harmed one ring ruling ring made sauron one way find cracks doom depths orodruin firemountain cast ring really wish destroy put beyond grasp enemy ever'
 'i really wish destroy it' cried frodo 'or well destroyed made perilous quests wish never seen ring come chosen'
 'such questions cannot answered' said gandalf 'you may sure merit others possess power wisdom rate chosen must therefore use strength heart wits have'
 'but little things wise powerful take ring'
 'no' cried gandalf springing feet 'with power power great terrible ring would gain power still greater deadly' eyes flashed face lit fire within 'do tempt wish become like dark lord yet way ring heart pity pity weakness desire strength good tempt dare take even keep safe unused wish wield would great strength shall need great perils lie me'
 went window drew aside curtains shutters sunlight streamed back room sam passed along path outside whistling 'and now' said wizard turning back frodo 'the decision lies always help you' laid hand frodo's shoulder 'i help bear burden long bear must something soon enemy moving'

 long silence gandalf sat puffed pipe lost thought eyes seemed closed lids watching frodo intently frodo gazed fixedly red embers hearth filled vision seemed looking profound wells fire thinking fabled cracks doom terror fiery mountain
 'well' said gandalf last 'what thinking decided do'
 'no' answered frodo coming back darkness finding surprise dark window could see sunlit garden 'or perhaps yes far understand said suppose must keep ring guard least present whatever may me'
 'whatever may slow slow evil keep purpose' said gandalf
 'i hope so' said frodo 'but hope may find better keeper soon meanwhile seems danger danger live near cannot keep ring stay ought leave bag end leave shire leave everything go away' sighed
 'i like save shire could � though times thought inhabitants stupid dull words felt earthquake invasion dragons might good feel like feel long shire lies behind safe comfortable shall find wandering bearable shall know somewhere firm foothold even feet cannot stand
 'of course sometimes thought going away imagined kind holiday series adventures like bilbo's better ending peace would mean exile flight danger danger drawing suppose must go alone save shire feel small uprooted well � desperate enemy strong terrible'
 tell gandalf speaking great desire follow bilbo flamed heart � follow bilbo even perhaps find strong overcame fear could almost run road without hat bilbo done similar morning long ago
 'my dear frodo' exclaimed gandalf 'hobbits really amazing creatures said learn know ways month yet hundred years still surprise pinch hardly expected get answer even bilbo made mistake choosing heir though little thought important would prove afraid right ring able stay hidden shire much longer sake well others go leave name baggins behind name safe outside shire wild give travelling name go go mr underhill
 'but think need go alone know anyone trust would willing go side � would willing take unknown perils look companion careful choosing careful say even closest friends enemy many spies many ways hearing'
 suddenly stopped listening frodo became aware quiet inside outside gandalf crept one side window dart sprang sill thrust long arm downwards squawk came sam gamgee's curly head hauled one ear
 'well well bless beard' said gandalf 'sam gamgee may doing'
 'lor bless mr gandalf sir' said sam 'nothing leastways trimming grassborder window follow me' picked shears exhibited evidence
 'i don't' said gandalf grimly time since last heard sound shears long eavesdropping'
 'eavesdropping sir follow begging pardon ain't eaves bag end that's fact'
 'don't fool heard listen' gandalf's eyes flashed brows stuck like bristles
 'mr frodo sir' cried sam quaking 'don't let hurt sir let turn anything unnatural old dad would take meant harm honour sir'
 'he hurt you' said frodo hardly able keep laughing although startled rather puzzled 'he knows well mean harm answer questions straight away'
 'well sir' said sam dithering little 'i heard deal rightly understand enemy rings mr bilbo sir dragons fiery mountain � elves sir listened help know mean lor bless sir love tales sort believe whatever ted may say elves sir would dearly love see _them_ take see elves sir go'
 suddenly gandalf laughed 'come inside' shouted putting arms lifted astonished sam shears grassclippings right window stood floor 'take see elves eh' said eyeing sam closely smile flickering face 'so heard mr frodo going away'
 'i sir that's choked heard seemingly tried sir burst upset'
 'it can't helped sam' said frodo sadly suddenly realized flying shire would mean painful partings merely saying farewell familiar comforts bag end 'i shall go but' � looked hard sam � 'if really care keep _dead_ secret see even breathe word heard hope gandalf turn spotted toad fill garden full grasssnakes'
 sam fell knees trembling 'get sam' said gandalf thought something better something shut mouth punish properly listening shall go away mr frodo'
 'me sir' cried sam springing like dog invited walk 'me go see elves hooray' shouted burst tears


 _chapter 3_
 three company

 'you ought go quietly ought go soon' said gandalf two three weeks passed still frodo made sign getting ready go
 'i know difficult both' objected vanish like bilbo tale shire time'
 'of course vanish' said gandalf 'that said _soon_ _instantly_ think way slipping shire without generally known worth little delay must delay long'
 'what autumn birthday' asked frodo 'i think could probably make arrangements then'
 tell truth reluctant start come point bag end seemed desirable residence years wanted savour much could last summer shire autumn came knew part least heart would think kindly journeying always season indeed privately made mind leave fiftieth birthday bilbo's one hundred twentyeighth seemed somehow proper day set follow following bilbo uppermost mind one thing made thought leaving bearable thought little possible ring might lead end tell thoughts gandalf wizard guessed always difficult tell
 looked frodo smiled 'very well' said 'i think � must later getting anxious meanwhile take care let hint going see sam gamgee talk really shall turn toad'
 'as _where i_ going' said frodo 'it would difficult give away clear idea yet'
 'don't absurd' said gandalf 'i warning leaving address postoffice leaving shire � known far away must go least set either north south west east � direction certainly known'
 'i taken thoughts leaving bag end saying farewell never even considered direction' said frodo 'for go shall steer quest bilbo went find treasure back go lose one return far see'
 'but cannot see far' said gandalf 'neither may task find cracks doom quest may others know rate ready long road yet'
 'no indeed' said frodo 'but meantime course lake'
 'towards danger rashly straight' answered wizard 'if want advice make rivendell journey prove perilous though road less easy grow worse year fails'
 'rivendell' said frodo 'very good go east make rivendell take sam visit elves delighted' spoke lightly heart moved suddenly desire see house elrond halfelven breathe air deep valley many fair folk still dwelt peace

 one summer's evening astonishing piece news reached _ivy bush_ _green dragon_ giants portents borders shire forgotten important matters mr frodo selling bag end indeed already sold � sackvillebagginses
 'for nice bit loo' said 'at bargain price' said others 'and that's likely mistress lobelia's buyer' otho died years ripe disappointed age 102
 mr frodo selling beautiful hole even debatable price held theory � supported nods hints mr baggins � frodo's money running going leave hobbiton live quiet way proceeds sale buckland among brandybuck relations 'as far sackvillebagginses may be' added firmly fixed notion immeasurable wealth bagginses bag end become found hard believe harder reason unreason fancy could suggest suggested dark yet unrevealed plot gandalf though kept quiet go day well known 'hiding bag end' however removal might fit designs wizardry doubt fact frodo baggins going back buckland
 'yes shall moving autumn' said 'merry brandybuck looking nice little hole perhaps small house'
 matter fact merry's help already chosen bought little house crickhollow country beyond bucklebury sam pretended going settle permanently decision set eastwards suggested idea buckland eastern borders shire lived childhood going back would least seem credible
 gandalf stayed shire two months one evening end june soon frodo's plan finally arranged suddenly announced going next morning 'only short hope' said 'but going beyond southern borders get news idle longer should'
 spoke lightly seemed frodo looked rather worried 'has anything happened' asked
 'well heard something made anxious needs looking think necessary get shall come back immediately least send word meanwhile stick plan careful ever especially ring let impress _don't use it'_
 went dawn 'i may back day' said 'at latest shall come back farewell party think may need company road'
 first frodo good deal disturbed wondered often gandalf could heard uneasiness wore fine weather forgot troubles shire seldom seen fair summer rich autumn trees laden apples honey dripping combs corn tall full
 autumn well way frodo began worry gandalf september passing still news birthday removal drew nearer still come send word bag end began busy frodo's friends came stay help packing fredegar bolger folco boffin course special friends pippin took merry brandybuck turned whole place upsidedown
 september 20th two covered carts went laden buckland conveying furniture goods frodo sold new home way brandywine bridge next day frodo became really anxious kept constant lookout gandalf thursday birthday morning dawned fair clear long ago bilbo's great party still gandalf appear evening frodo gave farewell feast quite small dinner four helpers troubled fell mood thought would soon part young friends weighed heart wondered would break
 four younger hobbits however high spirits party soon became cheerful spite gandalf's absence diningroom bare except table chairs food good good wine frodo's wine included sale sackvillebagginses
 'whatever happens rest stuff sbs get claws rate found good home this' said frodo drained glass last drop old winyards
 sung many songs talked many things done together toasted bilbo's birthday drank health frodo's together according frodo's custom went sniff air glimpse stars went bed frodo's party gandalf come
 next morning busy packing another cart remainder luggage merry took charge drove fatty fredegar bolger 'someone must get warm house arrive' said merry 'well see later � day tomorrow go sleep way'
 folco went home lunch pippin remained behind frodo restless anxious listening vain sound gandalf decided wait nightfall gandalf wanted urgently would go crickhollow might even get first frodo going foot plan � pleasure last look shire much reason � walk hobbiton bucklebury ferry taking fairly easy
 'i shall get bit training too' said looking dusty mirror halfempty hall done strenuous walking long time reflection looked rather flabby thought
 lunch sackvillebagginses lobelia sandyhaired son lotho turned much frodo's annoyance 'ours last' said lobelia stepped inside polite strictly true sale bag end take effect midnight lobelia perhaps forgiven obliged wait seventyseven years longer bag end hoped hundred years old anyway come see nothing paid carried wanted keys took long satisfy brought complete inventory went right end departed lotho spare key promise key would left gamgees' bagshot row snorted showed plainly thought gamgees capable plundering hole night frodo offer tea
 took tea pippin sam gamgee kitchen officially announced sam coming buckland 'to mr frodo look bit garden' arrangement approved gaffer though console prospect lobelia neighbour
 'our last meal bag end' said frodo pushing back chair left washing lobelia pippin sam strapped three packs piled porch pippin went last stroll garden sam disappeared
 sun went bag end seemed sad gloomy dishevelled frodo wandered round familiar rooms saw light sunset fade walls shadows creep corners grew slowly dark indoors went walked gate bottom path short way hill road half expected see gandalf come striding dusk
 sky clear stars growing bright 'it's going fine night' said aloud 'that's good beginning feel like walking can't bear hanging going start gandalf must follow me' turned go back slopped heard voices round corner end bagshot row one voice certainly old gaffer's strange somehow unpleasant could make said heard gaffer's answers rather shrill old man seemed put
 'no mr baggins gone away went morning sam went anyway stuff went yes sold gone tell'ee why's none business ain't secret he's moved bucklebury place away yonder yes � tidy way i've never far they're queer folks buckland can't give message good night you'
 footsteps went away hill frodo wondered vaguely fact come hill seemed great relief 'i sick questions curiosity doings suppose' thought 'what inquisitive lot are' half mind go ask gaffer inquirer thought better worse turned walked quickly back bag end
 pippin sitting pack porch sam frodo stepped inside dark door 'sam' called 'sam time'
 'coming sir' came answer far within followed soon sam wiping mouth saying farewell beerbarrel cellar
 'all aboard sam' said frodo
 'yes sir i'll last bit sir'
 frodo shut locked round door gave key sam 'run home sam' said 'then cut along row meet us quick gate lane beyond meadows going village tonight many ears pricking eyes prying' sam ran full speed
 'well we're last' said frodo shouldered packs took sticks walked round corner west side bag end 'goodbye' said frodo looking dark blank windows waved hand turned following bilbo known hurried peregrin gardenpath jumped low place hedge bottom took fields passing darkness like rustle grasses
 bottom hill western side came gate opening narrow lane halted adjusted straps packs presently sam appeared trotting quickly breathing hard heavy pack hoisted high shoulders put head tall shapeless fell bag called hat gloom looked much like dwarf
 'i sure given heaviest stuff' said frodo 'i pity snails carry homes backs'
 'i could take lot yet sir packet quite light' said sam stoutly untruthfully
 'no sam' said pippin 'it good he's got nothing except ordered us pack he's slack lately he'll feel weight less he's walked own'
 'be kind poor old hobbit' laughed frodo 'i shall thin willowwand i'm sure get buckland talking nonsense suspect taken share sam shall look next packing' picked stick 'well like walking dark' said 'so let's put miles behind us bed'
 short way followed lane westwards leaving turned left took quietly fields went single file along hedgerows borders coppices night fell dark dark cloaks invisible magic rings since hobbits trying silent made noise even hobbits would hear even wild things fields woods hardly noticed passing
 time crossed water west hobbiton narrow plankbridge stream winding black ribbon bordered leaning aldertrees mile two south hastily crossed great road brandywine bridge tookland bending southeastwards made green hill country began climb first slopes looked back saw lamps hobbiton far twinkling gentle valley water soon disappeared folds darkened land followed bywater beside grey pool light last farm far behind peeping among trees frodo turned waved hand farewell
 'i wonder shall ever look valley again' said quietly
 walked three hours rested night clear cool starry smokelike wisps mist creeping hillsides streams deep meadows thinclad birches swaying light wind heads made black net pale sky ate frugal supper hobbits went soon struck narrow road went rolling fading grey darkness ahead road woodhall stock bucklebury ferry climbed away main road watervalley wound skirts green hills towards woodyend wild corner eastfarthing
 plunged deeply cloven track tall trees rustled dry leaves night dark first talked hummed tune softly together far away inquisitive ears marched silence pippin began lag behind last began climb steep slope stopped yawned
 'i sleepy' said 'that soon shall fall road going sleep legs nearly midnight'
 'i thought liked walking dark' said frodo 'but great hurry merry expects us time day tomorrow leaves us nearly two days we'll halt first likely spot'
 'the wind's west' said sam 'if get side hill shall find spot sheltered snug enough sir dry firwood ahead remember rightly' sam knew land well within twenty miles hobbiton limit geography
 top hill came patch firwood leaving road went deep resinscented darkness trees gathered dead sticks cones make fire soon merry crackle flame foot large firtree sat round began nod angle great tree's roots curled cloaks blankets soon fast asleep set watch even frodo feared danger yet still heart shire creatures came looked fire died away fox passing wood business stopped several minutes sniffed
 'hobbits' thought 'well next heard strange doings land seldom heard hobbit sleeping doors tree three there's something mighty queer behind this' quite right never found
 morning came pale clammy frodo woke first found treeroot made hole back neck stiff
 'walking pleasure drive' thought usually beginning expedition 'and beautiful feather beds sold sackvillebagginses treeroots would good' stretched 'wake hobbits' cried beautiful morning'
 'what's beautiful it' said pippin peering edge blanket one eye 'sam gel breakfast ready halfpast nine got bathwater hot'
 sam jumped looking rather bleary 'no sir sir' said
 frodo stripped blankets pippin rolled walked edge wood away eastward sun rising red mists lay thick world touched gold red autumn trees seemed sailing rootless shadowy sea little left road ran steeply hollow disappeared
 returned sam pippin got good fire going 'water' shouted pippin 'where's water'
 'i keep water pockets' said frodo 'we thought gone find some' said pippin busy setting food cups 'you better go now'
 'you come too' said frodo 'and bring waterbottles' stream foot hill filled bottles small camping kettle little fall water fell feet outcrop grey stone icy cold spluttered puffed bathed faces hands
 breakfast packs trussed ten o'clock day beginning turn fine hot went slope across stream dived road next slope another shoulder hills time cloaks blankets water food gear already seemed heavy burden
 day's march promised warm tiring work miles however road ceased roll climbed top steep bank weary zigzagging sort way prepared go last time front saw lower lands dotted small clumps trees melted away distance brown woodland haze looking across woody end towards brandywine river road wound away like piece string
 'the road goes ever' said pippin 'but can't without rest high time lunch' sat bank side road looked away east haze beyond lay river end shire spent life sam stood round eyes wide open � looking across lands never seen new horizon
 'do elves live woods' asked
 'not ever heard' said pippin frodo silent gazing eastward along road never seen suddenly spoke aloud saying slowly

 road goes ever
 door began
 far ahead road gone
 must follow
 pursuing weary feet
 joins larger way
 many paths errands meet
 whither cannot say

 'that sounds like bit old bilbo's rhyming' said pippin 'or one imitations sound altogether encouraging'
 'i know' said frodo came making may heard long ago certainly reminds much bilbo last years went away used often say one road like great river springs every doorstep every path tributary "it's dangerous business frodo going door" used say "you step road keep feet knowing might swept realize path goes mirkwood let might take lonely mountain even worse places" used say path outside front door bag end especially long walk'
 'well road sweep anywhere hour least' said pippin unslinging pack others followed example putting packs bank legs road rest good lunch rest
 sun beginning get low light afternoon land went hill far met soul road way much used hardly fit carts little traffic woody end jogging along hour sam stopped moment listening level ground road much winding lay straight ahead grassland sprinkled tall trees outliers approaching woods
 'i hear pony horse coming along road behind' said sam
 looked back turn road prevented seeing far 'i wonder gandalf coming us' said frodo even said feeling sudden desire hide view rider came
 'it may matter much' said apologetically 'but would rather seen road � anyone sick doings noticed discussed gandalf' added afterthought 'we give little surprise pay late let's get sight'
 two ran quickly left little hollow far road lay flat frodo hesitated second curiosity feeling struggling desire hide sound hoofs drew nearer time threw patch long grass behind tree overshadowed road lifted head peered cautiously one great roots
 round corner came black horse hobbitpony fullsized horse sat large man seemed crouch saddle wrapped great black cloak hood boots high stirrups showed face shadowed invisible
 reached tree level frodo horse stopped riding figure sat quite still head bowed listening inside hood came noise someone sniffing catch elusive scent head turned side side road
 sudden unreasoning fear discovery laid hold frodo thought ring hardly dared breathe yet desire get pocket became strong began slowly move hand felt slip would safe advice gandalf seemed absurd bilbo used ring 'and still shire' thought hand touched chain hung moment rider sat shook reins horse stepped forward walking slowly first breaking quick trot
 frodo crawled edge road watched rider dwindled distance could quite sure seemed suddenly passed sight horse turned aside went trees right
 'well call queer indeed disturbing' said frodo walked towards companions pippin sam remained flat grass seen nothing frodo described rider strange behaviour
 'i can't say felt certain looking _smelling_ also felt certain want discover i've never seen fell anything like shire before'
 'but one big people got us' said pippin 'and part world'
 'there men about' said frodo 'down southfarthing trouble big people believe never heard anything like rider wonder comes from'
 'begging pardon' put sam suddenly 'i know comes hobbiton black rider comes unless there's one know he's going to'
 'what mean' said frodo sharply looking astonishment 'why speak before'
 'i remembered sir like got back hole yesterday evening key dad says _hello sam_ says _i thought away mr frodo morning there's strange customer asking mr baggins bag end he's gone i've sent bucklebury liked sound seemed mighty put told mr baggins left old home good hissed gave quite shudder sort fellow he_ says gaffer _i know_ says _but hobbit tall blacklike stooped aver reckon one big folk foreign parts spoke funny_
 'i stay hear sir since waiting give much heed gaffer getting old bit blind must near dark fellow come hill found taking air end row hope done harm sir me'
 'the gaffer can't blamed anyway' said frodo 'as matter fact heard talking stranger seemed inquiring nearly went asked wish told might careful road'
 'still may connexion rider gaffer's stranger' said pippin 'we left hobbiton secretly enough see could followed us'
 'what _smelling_ sir' said sam 'and gaffer said black chap'
 'i wish waited gandalf' frodo muttered 'but perhaps would made matters worse'
 'then know guess something rider' said pippin caught muttered words
 'i know would rather guess' said frodo 'all right cousin frodo keep secret present want mysterious meanwhile like bite sup somehow think better move talk sniffing riders invisible noses unsettled me'
 'yes think move now' said frodo 'but road case rider comes back another follows ought good step today buckland still miles away'
 shadows trees long thin grass started kept stone's throw left road kept sight much could hindered grass thick tussocky ground uneven trees began draw together thickets
 sun gone red behind hills backs evening coming came back road end long level run straight miles point bent left went lowlands yale making stock lane branched right winding wood ancient oaktrees way woodhall 'that way us' said frodo
 far roadmeeting came huge hulk tree still alive leaves small branches put round broken stumps longfallen limbs hollow could entered great crack side away road hobbits crept inside sat upon floor old leaves decayed wood rested light meal talking quietly listening time time
 twilight crept back lane west wind sighing branches leaves whispering soon road began fall gently steadily dusk star came trees darkening east went abreast step keep spirits time stars grew thicker brighter feeling disquiet left longer listened sound hoofs began hum softly hobbits way walk along especially drawing near home night hobbits suppersong bedsong hobbits hummed walkingsong though course without mention supper bed bilbo baggins made words tune old hills taught frodo walked lanes watervalley talked adventure

 upon hearth fire red
 beneath roof bed
 yet weary feet
 still round corner may meet
 sudden tree standing stone
 none seen alone
 tree flower leaf grass
 let pass let pass
 hill water sky
 pass pass

 still round corner may wait
 new road secret gate
 though pass today
 tomorrow may come way
 take hidden paths run
 towards moon sun
 apple thorn nut sloe
 let go let go
 sand stone pool dell
 fare well fare well

 home behind world ahead
 many paths tread
 shadows edge night
 stars alight
 world behind home ahead
 we'll wander back home bed
 mist twilight cloud shade
 away shall fade away shall fade
 fire lamp meat bread
 bed bed

 song ended 'and _now_ bed _now_ bed' sang pippin high voice
 'hush' said frodo 'i think hear hoofs again'
 slopped suddenly stood silent treeshadows listening sound hoofs lane way behind coming slow clear wind quickly quietly slipped path ran deeper shade oaktrees
 'don't let us go far' said frodo 'i want seen want see another black rider'
 'very well' said pippin 'but forget sniffing'
 hoofs drew nearer time find hidingplace better general darkness trees sam pippin crouched behind large treebole frodo crept back yards towards lane showed grey pale line fading light wood stars thick dim sky moon
 sound hoofs stopped frodo watched saw something dark pass across lighter space two trees halt looked like black shade horse led smaller black shadow black shadow stood close point left path swayed side side frodo thought heard sound snuffling shadow bent ground began crawl towards
 desire slip ring came frodo time stronger strong almost realized hand groping pocket moment came sound like mingled song laughter clear voices rose fell starlit air black shadow straightened retreated climbed shadowy horse seemed vanish across lane darkness side frodo breathed
 'elves' exclaimed sam hoarse whisper 'elves sir' would burst trees dashed towards voices pulled back
 'yes elves' said frodo 'one meet sometimes woody end live shire wander spring autumn lands away beyond tower hills thankful see black rider stopped actually crawling towards us song began soon heard voices slipped away'
 'what elves' said sam excited trouble rider 'can't go see them'
 'listen coming way' said frodo 'we wait' singing drew nearer one clear voice rose others singing fair elventongue frodo knew little others knew nothing yet sound blending melody seemed shape thought words partly understood song frodo heard

 snowwhite snowwhite lady clear
 queen beyond western seas
 light us wander
 amid world woven trees

 gilthoniel elbereth
 clear thy eyes bright thy breath
 snowwhite snowwhite sing thee
 far land beyond sea

 stars sunless year
 shining hand sawn
 windy fields bright clear
 see silver blossom blown

 elbereth gilthoniel
 still remember dwell
 far land beneath trees
 thy starlight western seas

 song ended 'these high elves spoke name elbereth' said frodo amazement 'few fairest folk ever seen shire many remain middleearth east great sea indeed strange chance'
 hobbits sat shadow wayside long elves came lane towards valley passed slowly hobbits could see starlight glimmering hair eyes bore lights yet walked shimmer like light moon rim hills rises seemed fall feet silent last elf passed turned looked towards hobbits laughed
 'hail frodo' cried 'you abroad late perhaps lost' called aloud others company stopped gathered round
 'this indeed wonderful' said 'three hobbits wood night seen thing since bilbo went away meaning it'
 'the meaning fair people' said frodo 'is simply seem going way like walking stars would welcome company'
 'but need company hobbits dull' laughed 'and know go way know whither going'
 'and know name' asked frodo return
 'we know many things' said 'we seen often bilbo though may seen us'
 'who lord' asked frodo
 'i gildor' answered leader elf first hailed 'gildor inglorion house finrod exiles kindred long ago departed tarrying ere return great sea kinsfolk dwell still peace rivendell come frodo tell us see shadow fear upon you'
 'o wise people' interrupted pippin eagerly 'tell us black riders'
 'black riders' said low voices 'why ask black riders'
 'because two black riders overtaken us today one done twice' said pippin 'only little ago slipped away drew near'
 elves answer spoke together softly tongue length gildor turned hobbits 'we speak here' said 'we think best come us custom time lake road shall lodge us tonight will'
 'o fair folk good fortune beyond hope' said pippin sam speechless 'i thank indeed gildor inglorion' said frodo bowing _'elen s�la l�menn' omentielvo_ star shines hour meeting' added highelven speech
 'be careful friends' cried gildor laughing 'speak secrets scholar ancient tongue bilbo good master hail elffriend' said bowing frodo 'come friends join company best walk middle may stray may weary halt'
 'why going' asked frodo
 'for tonight go woods hills woodhall miles shall rest end shorten journey tomorrow'
 marched silence passed like shadows faint lights elves even hobbits could walk wished without sound footfall pippin soon began feel sleepy staggered twice time tall elf side put arm saved fall sam walked along frodo's side dream expression face half fear half astonished joy

 woods either side became denser trees younger thicker lane went lower running fold hills many deep brakes hazel rising slopes either hand last elves turned aside path green ride lay almost unseen thickets right followed wound away back wooded slopes top shoulder hills stood lower land rivervalley suddenly came shadow trees lay wide space grass grey night three sides woods pressed upon eastward ground fell steeply tops dark trees growing bottom slope feet beyond low lands lay dim flat stars nearer hand lights twinkled village woodhall
 elves sat grass spoke together soft voices seemed take notice hobbits frodo companions wrapped cloaks blankets drowsiness stole night grew lights valley went pippin fell asleep pillowed green hillock
 away high east swung remmirath netted stars slowly mists red borgil rose glowing like jewel fire shift airs mist drawn away like veil leaned climbed rim world swordsman sky menelvagor shining belt elves burst song suddenly trees fire sprang red light
 'come' elves called hobbits 'come time speech merriment'
 pippin sat rubbed eyes shivered 'there fire hall food hungry guests' said elf standing
 south end greensward opening green floor ran wood formed wide space like hall roofed boughs trees great trunks ran like pillars side middle woodfire blazing upon treepillars torches lights gold silver burning steadily elves sat round fire upon grass upon sawn rings old trunks went fro bearing cups pouring drink others brought food heaped plates dishes
 'this poor fare' said hobbits 'for lodging greenwood far halls ever guests home treat better'
 'it seems good enough birthdayparty' said frodo
 pippin afterwards recalled little either food drink mind filled light upon elffaces sound voices various beautiful felt waking dream remembered bread surpassing savour fair white loaf one starving fruits sweet wildberries richer tended fruits gardens drained cup filled fragrant draught cool clear fountain golden summer afternoon
 sam could never describe words picture clearly felt thought night though remained memory one chief events life nearest ever got say 'well sir could grow apples like would call gardener singing went heart know mean'
 frodo sat eating drinking talking delight mind chiefly words spoken knew little elfspeech listened eagerly spoke served thanked language smiled said laughing 'here jewel among hobbits'
 pippin fell fast asleep lifted borne away bower trees laid upon soft bed slept rest night away sam refused leave master pippin gone came sat curled frodo's feet last nodded closed eyes frodo remained long awake talking gildor
 spoke many things old new frodo questioned gildor much happenings wide world outside shire tidings mostly sad ominous gathering darkness wars men flight elves last frodo asked question nearest heart
 'tell gildor ever seen bilbo since left us'
 gildor smiled 'yes' answered 'twice said farewell us spot saw far here' would say bilbo frodo fell silent
 'you ask tell much concerns frodo' said gildor 'but already know little read face thought behind questions leaving shire yet doubt find seek accomplish intend ever return so'
 'it is' said frodo 'but thought going secret known gandalf faithful sam' looked sam snoring gently
 'the secret reach enemy us' said gildor
 'the enemy' said frodo 'then know leaving shire'
 'i know reason enemy pursuing you' answered gildor 'but perceive � strange indeed though seems warn peril behind upon either side'
 'you mean riders feared servants enemy _are_ black riders'
 'has gandalf told nothing'
 'nothing creatures'
 'then think say � lest terror keep journey seems set time indeed time must make haste neither stay turn back shire longer protection you'
 'i cannot imagine information could terrifying hints warnings' exclaimed frodo 'i knew danger lay ahead course expect meet shire can't hobbit walk water river peace'
 'but shire' said gildor 'others dwelt hobbits others dwell hobbits wide world fence cannot ever fence out'
 'i know � yet always seemed safe familiar plan leave shire secretly make way rivendell footsteps dogged ever get buckland'
 'i think still follow plan' said gildor 'i think road prove hard courage desire clearer counsel ask gandalf know reason flight therefore know means pursuers assail things gandalf must know suppose see leave shire'
 'i hope another thing makes anxious expecting gandalf many days come hobbiton latest two nights ago never appeared wondering happened wait him'
 gildor silent moment 'i like news' said last 'that gandalf late bode well said _do meddle affairs wizards subtle quick anger_ choice go wait'
 'and also said' answered frodo 'go _not elves counsel say yes'_
 'is indeed' laughed gildor 'elves seldom give unguarded advice advice dangerous gift even wise wise courses may run ill would told concerning shall choose better demand advice friendship's sake give think go without delay gandalf come set also advise go alone take friends trusty willing grateful give counsel gladly elves labours sorrows little concerned ways hobbits creatures upon earth paths cross seldom chance purpose meeting may chance purpose clear fear say much'
 'i deeply grateful' said frodo 'but wish would tell plainly black riders take advice may see gandalf long ought know danger pursues me'
 'is enough know servants enemy' answered gildor 'flee speak words deadly ask heart forbodes ere ended frodo son drogo know fell things gildor inglorion may elbereth protect you'
 'but shall find courage' asked frodo 'that chiefly need'
 'courage found unlikely places' said gildor 'be good hope sleep morning shall gone send messages lands wandering companies shall know journey power good shall watch name elffriend may stars shine upon end road seldom delight strangers fair hear words ancient speech lips wanderers world'
 frodo felt sleep coming upon even gildor finished speaking 'i sleep now' said elf led bower beside pippin threw upon bed fell dreamless slumber

 short cut mushrooms

 morning frodo woke refreshed lying bower made living tree branches laced drooping ground bed fern grass deep soft strangely fragrant sun shining fluttering leaves still green upon tree jumped went
 sam sitting grass near edge wood pippin standing studying sky weather sign elves
 'they left us fruit drink bread' said pippin 'come breakfast bread tastes almost good last night want leave sam insisted'
 frodo sat beside sam began eat 'what plan today' asked pippin
 'to walk bucklebury quickly possible' answered frodo gave attention food
 'do think shall see anything riders' asked pippin cheerfully morning sun prospect seeing whole troop seem alarming
 'yes probably' said frodo liking reminder 'but hope get across river without seeing us'
 'did find anything gildor'
 'not much � hints riddles' said frodo evasively 'did ask sniffing'
 'we discuss it' said frodo mouth full
 'you sure important'
 'in case sure gildor would refused explain it' said frodo sharply 'and leave peace bit want answer string questions eating want think'
 'good heavens' said pippin 'at breakfast' walked away towards edge green
 frodo's mind bright morning � treacherously bright thought � banished fear pursuit pondered words gildor merry voice pippin came running green turf singing
 'no could not' said 'it one thing take young friends walking shire hungry weary food bed sweet take exile hunger weariness may cure quite another � even willing come inheritance mine alone think ought even take sam' looked sam gamgee discovered sam watching
 'well sam' said 'what leaving shire soon ever � fact made mind even wait day crickhollow helped'
 'very good sir'
 'you still mean come me'
 'i do'
 'it going dangerous sam 'it already dangerous likely neither us come back'
 'if come back sir that's certain' said sam _'don't leave him_ said _leave him_ said _i never mean going climbs moon black rulers try stop they'll sam gamgee reckon with_ said laughed'
 'who _they_ talking about'
 'the elves sir talk last night seemed know going away see use denying wonderful folk elves sir wonderful'
 'they are' said frodo 'do like still closer view'
 'they seem bit likes dislikes speak' answered sam slowly 'it seem matter think quite different expected � old young gay sad were'
 frodo looked sam rather startled half expecting see outward sign odd change seemed come sound like voice old sam gamgee thought knew looked like old sam gamgee sitting except face unusually thoughtful
 'do feel need leave shire � wish see come true already' asked
 'yes sir know say last night feel different seem see ahead kind way know going take long road darkness know can't turn back see elves dragons mountains want � rightly know want something end lies ahead shire must see sir understand me'
 'i altogether understand gandalf chose good companion content go together'
 frodo finished breakfast silence standing looked land ahead called pippin
 'all ready start' said pippin ran 'we must getting slept late good many miles go'
 _'you_ slept late mean' said pippin 'i long waiting finish eating thinking'
 'i finished going make bucklebury ferry quickly possible going way back road left last night going cut straight across country here'
 'then going fly' said pippin 'you cut straight foot anywhere country'
 'we cut straighter road anyway' answered frodo 'the ferry east woodhall hard road curves away left see bend away north goes round north end marish strike causeway bridge stock miles way could save quarter distance made line ferry stand'
 _'short cuts make long delays'_ argued pippin 'the country rough round bogs kinds difficulties marish know land parts worrying black riders can't see worse meeting road wood field'
 'it less easy find people woods fields' answered frodo 'and supposed road chance looked road it'
 'all right' said pippin 'i follow every bog ditch hard counted passing _golden perch_ stock sundown best beer eastfarthing used long time since tasted it'
 'that settles it' said frodo 'short cuts make delays inns make longer ones costs must keep away _golden perch_ want get bucklebury dark say sam'
 'i go along mr frodo' said sam spite private misgiving deep regret best beer eastfarthing
 'then going toil bog briar let's go now' said pippin
 already nearly hot day clouds beginning come west looked likely turn rain hobbits scrambled steep green bank plunged thick trees course chosen leave woodhall left cut slanting woods clustered along eastern side hills reached flats beyond could make straight ferry country open except ditches fences frodo reckoned eighteen miles go straight line
 soon found thicket closer tangled appeared paths undergrowth get fast struggled bottom bank found stream running hills behind deeply dug bed steep slippery sides overhung brambles inconveniently cut across line chosen could jump indeed get across without getting wet scratched muddy halted wondering 'first check' said pippin smiling grimly
 sam gamgee looked back opening trees caught glimpse top green bank climbed
 'look' said clutching frodo arm looked edge high saw sky horse standing beside stooped black figure
 gave idea going back frodo led way plunged quickly thick bushes beside stream 'whew' said pippin 'we right short cut gone crooked already got cover time got sharp ears sam hear anything coming'
 stood still almost holding breath listened sound pursuit 'i fancy would try bringing horse bank' said sam 'but guess knows came better going on'
 going altogether easy packs carry bushes brambles reluctant let cut wind ridge behind air still stuffy forced way last open ground hot tired scratched also longer certain direction going banks stream sank reached levels became broader shallower wandering towards marish river
 'why stockbrook' said pippin 'if going try get back course must cross bear right'
 waded stream hurried wide open space rushgrown treeless side beyond came belt trees tall oaks part elm tree ash ground fairly level little undergrowth trees loo close see far ahead leaves blew upwards sudden gusts wind spots rain began fall overcast sky wind died away rain came streaming trudged along fast could patches grass thick drifts old leaves rain pattered trickled talk kept glancing back side side
 half hour pippin said 'i hope turned much towards south walking longwise wood broad belt said mile widest � ought now'
 'it good starting go zigzags' said frodo 'that mend matters let us keep going sure want come open yet'
 went perhaps another couple miles sun gleamed ragged clouds rain lessened past midday felt high time lunch halted elm tree leaves though fast turning yellow still thick ground feel fairly dry sheltered came make meal found elves filled bottles clear drink pale golden colour scent honey made many flowers wonderfully refreshing soon laughing snapping fingers rain black riders last miles felt would soon behind
 frodo propped back treetrunk closed eyes sam pippin sat near began hum sing softly

 ho ho ho bottle go
 heal heart drown woe
 rain may fall wind may blow
 many miles still go
 tall tree lie
 let clouds go sailing

 _ho ho ho_ began louder stopped short suddenly frodo sprang feet longdrawn wail came wind like cry evil lonely creature rose fell ended high piercing note even sat stood suddenly frozen answered another cry fainter less chilling blood silence broken sound wind leaves
 'and think was' pippin asked last trying speak lightly quavering little 'if bird one never heard shire before'
 'it bird beast' said frodo 'it call signal � words cry though could catch hobbit voice'
 said thinking riders one spoke reluctant either stay go sooner later got get across open country ferry best go sooner daylight moments shouldered packs
 long wood came sudden end wide grasslands stretched saw fact turned much south away flats could glimpse low hill bucklebury across river left creeping cautiously edge trees set across open quickly could
 first felt afraid away shelter wood far back behind stood high place breakfasted frodo half expected see small distant figure horseman ridge dark sky sign one sun escaping breaking clouds sank towards hills left shining brightly fear left though still felt uneasy land became steadily tame wellordered soon came welltended fields meadows hedges gates dikes drainage everything seemed quiet peaceful ordinary corner shire spirits rose every step line river grew nearer black riders began seem like phantoms woods left far behind
 passed along edge huge turnipfield came stout gate beyond rutted lane ran low welllaid hedges towards distant clump trees pippin stopped
 'i know fields gate' said 'this bamfurlong old farmer maggot's land that's farm away trees'
 'one trouble another' said frodo looking nearly much alarmed pippin declared lane slot leading dragon's den others looked surprise
 'what's wrong old maggot' asked pippin 'he's good friend brandy bucks course he's terror trespassers keeps ferocious dogs � folk near border guard'
 'i know' said frodo 'but same' added shamefaced laugh 'i terrified dogs avoided farm years years caught several times trespassing mushrooms youngster brandy hall last occasion beat took showed dogs "see lads" said "next time young varmint sets foot land eat see off" chased way ferry never got fright � though daresay beasts knew business would really touched me'
 pippin laughed 'well time made especially coming back live buckland old maggot really stout fellow � leave mushrooms alone let's get lane trespassing meet i'll talking friend merry's used come good deal one time'
 went along lane saw thatched roofs large house farmbuildings peeping among trees ahead maggots puddifoots stock inhabitants marish housedwellers farm stoutly built brick high wall round wide wooden gate opening wall lane
 suddenly drew nearer terrific baying barking broke loud voice heard shouting 'grip fang wolf come lads'
 frodo sam stopped dead pippin walked paces gate opened three huge dogs came pelting lane dashed towards travellers barking fiercely took notice pippin sam shrank wall two wolvishlooking dogs sniffed suspiciously snarled moved largest ferocious three halted front frodo bristling growling
 gate appeared broad thickset hobbit round red face 'hallo hallo may may wanting' asked
 'good afternoon mr maggot' said pippin
 farmer looked closely 'well master pippin � mr peregrin took say' cried changing scowl grin 'it's long time since saw round lucky know going set dogs strangers funny things going today course get queer folk wandering parts times near river' said shaking head 'but fellow outlandish ever set eyes cross land without leave second time stop it'
 'what fellow mean' asked pippin
 'then seen him' said farmer 'he went lane towards causeway long back funny customer asking funny questions perhaps come along inside we'll pass news comfortable i've drop good ale tap friends willing mr took'
 seemed plain farmer would tell allowed time fashion accepted invitation 'what dogs' asked frodo anxiously
 farmer laughed 'they harm � unless tell 'em grip fang heel' cried 'heel wolf' relief frodo sam dogs walked away let go free
 pippin introduced two farmer 'mr frodo baggins' said 'you may remember used live brandy hall' name baggins farmer started gave frodo sharp glance moment frodo thought memory stolen mushrooms aroused dogs would told see farmer maggot took arm
 'well queerer ever' exclaimed 'mr baggins come inside must talk'
 went farmer's kitchen sat wide fireplace mrs maggot brought beer huge jug filled four large mugs good brew pippin found compensated missing _golden perch_ sam sipped beer suspiciously natural mistrust inhabitants parts shire also disposed quick friends anyone beaten master however long ago
 remarks weather agricultural prospects worse usual farmer maggot put mug looked turn
 'now mr peregrin' said 'where might coming might going coming visit' gone past gate without seeing you'
 'well no' answered pippin 'to tell truth since guessed got lane end come fields quite accident lost way woods back near woodhall trying take short cut ferry'
 'if hurry road would served better' said farmer 'but worrying leave walk land mind mr peregrin mr baggins � though daresay still like mushrooms' laughed 'ah yes recognized name recollect time young frodo baggins one worst young rascals buckland mushrooms thinking heard name baggins turned think funny customer asked me'
 waited anxiously go 'well' farmer continued approaching point slow relish 'he came riding big black horse gate happened open right door black cloaked hooded want known "now shire want" thought see many big folk border anyway never heard like black fellow
 ' "goodday you" says going "this lane lead anywhere wherever may going quickest way back road" like looks grip came took one sniff let yelp slung put tail bolted howling black fellow sat quite still

 ' "be off" said "there bagginses wrong part shire better go back west hobbiton � go road time"
 ' "baggins left" answered whisper "he coming far away wish find passes tell come back gold"
 ' "no won't" said "you'll go back belong double quick give one minute call dogs"
 'he gave sort hiss might laughing might spurred great horse right jumped way time called dogs swung rode gate lane towards causeway like bolt thunder think that'
 frodo sat moment looking fire thought earth would reach ferry 'i know think' said last
 'then i'll tell think' said maggot 'you never gone mixing hobbiton folk mr frodo folk queer there' sam stirred chair looked farmer unfriendly eye 'but always reckless lad heard left brandybucks gone old mr bilbo said going find trouble mark words comes strange doings mr bilbo's money got strange fashion foreign parts say maybe want know become gold jewels buried hill hobbiton hear'
 frodo said nothing shrewd guesses farmer rather disconcerting
 'well mr frodo' maggot went 'i'm glad sense come back buckland advice stay get mixed outlandish folk friends parts black fellows come i'll deal i'll say dead left shire anything like might true enough like old mr bilbo want news of'
 'maybe right' said frodo avoiding farmer's eye staring fire
 maggot looked thoughtfully 'well see ideas own' said 'it plain nose accident brought rider afternoon maybe news great news asking tell anything mind keep see kind trouble perhaps thinking easy get ferry without caught'
 'i thinking so' said frodo 'but got try get done sitting thinking afraid must going thank much indeed kindness i've terror dogs thirty years farmer maggot though may laugh hear pity i've missed good friend i'm sorry leave soon i'll come back perhaps one day � get chance'

 'i will' said drove gate breath wind stirring night still quiet chill air went without lights took slowly mile two lane came end crossing deep dike climbing short slope highbanked causeway
 maggot got took good look either way north south nothing could seen darkness sound still air thin strands rivermist hanging dikes crawling fields
 'it's going thick' said maggot 'but i'll light lantern till turn home we'll hear anything road long meet tonight'
 five miles maggot's lane ferry hobbits wrapped ears strained sound creak wheels slow _clop_ ponies' hoofs waggon seemed slower snail frodo beside pippin nodding towards sleep sam staring forwards rising fog
 reached entrance ferry lane last marked two tall white posts suddenly loomed right farmer maggot drew ponies waggon creaked halt beginning lo scramble suddenly heard dreading hoofs road ahead sound coming towards
 maggot jumped stood holding ponies' heads peering forward gloom _clipclop clipclop_ came approaching rider fall hoofs sounded loud still foggy air

 turned ferry lane straight wellkept edged large whitewashed stones hundred yards brought riverbank broad wooden landingstage large flat ferryboat moored beside white bollards near water's edge glimmered light two lamps high posts behind mists flat fields hedges water dark curling wisps like steam among reeds bank seemed less fog side

 merry fatty went kitchen side passage busied final preparations late supper snatches competing songs came bathroom mixed sound splashing wallowing voice pippin suddenly lifted others one bilbo's favourite bathsongs

 supper kitchen table near fire 'i suppose three want mushrooms again' said fredegar without much hope
 'yes shall' cried pippin
 'they're mine' said frodo 'given _me_ mrs maggot queen among farmers' wives take greedy hands away i'll serve them'
 hobbits passion mushrooms surpassing even greediest likings big people fact partly explains young frodo's long expeditions renowned fields marish wrath injured maggot occasion plenty even according hobbit standards also many things follow finished even fatty bolger heaved sigh content pushed back table drew chairs round fire
 'we'll clear later' said merry 'now tell guess adventures quite fair without want full account want know matter old maggot spoke like sounded almost _scared_ possible'
 'we scared' said pippin pause frodo stared fire speak 'you would chased two days black riders'
 'and they'
 'black figures riding black horses' answered pippin 'if frodo talk tell whole tale beginning' gave full account journey time left hobbiton sam gave various supporting nods exclamations frodo remained silent
 'i think making up' said merry 'if seen black shape landingstage � heard queer sound maggot's voice make frodo'
 'cousin frodo close' said pippin 'but time come open far given nothing go farmer maggot's guess something old bilbo's treasure'
 'that guess' said frodo hastily 'maggot _know_anything'
 'old maggot shrewd fellow' said merry 'a lot goes behind round face come talk i've heard used go old forest one time reputation knowing good many strange things least tell us frodo whether think guess good bad'
 'i _think'_ answered frodo slowly 'that good guess far goes _is a_ connexion bilbo's old adventures riders looking perhaps one ought say _searching_ also fear want know joke safe anywhere else' looked round windows walls afraid would suddenly give way others looked silence exchanged meaning glances among
 'it's coming minute' whispered pippin merry merry nodded
 'well' said frodo last sitting straightening back made decision 'i can't keep dark longer got something tell know quite begin'
 'i think could help you' said merry quietly 'by telling myself'
 'what mean' said frodo looking anxiously 'just dear old frodo miserable know say goodbye meant leave shire course danger come sooner expected making mind go want sorry you'
 frodo opened mouth shut look surprise comical laughed 'dear old frodo' said pippin 'did really think thrown dust eyes nearly careful clever enough obviously planning go saying farewell haunts year since april constantly heard muttering "shall ever look valley wonder" things like pretending come end money actually selling beloved bag end sackvillebagginses close talks gandalf'
 'good heavens' said frodo 'i thought careful clever know gandalf would say shire discussing departure then'
 'oh no' said merry 'don't worry secret keep long course present think known us conspirators must remember know well often usually guess thinking knew bilbo tell truth watching rather closely ever since left thought would go sooner later indeed expected go sooner lately anxious terrified might give us slip go suddenly like ever since spring kept eyes open done good deal planning account going escape easily'
 'but must go' said frodo 'it cannot helped dear friends wretched us use trying keep since guessed much please help hinder me'
 'you understand' said pippin 'you must go � therefore must merry coming sam excellent fellow would jump dragon's throat save trip feet need one companion dangerous adventure'
 'my dear beloved hobbits' said frodo deeply moved 'but could allow decided long ago speak danger understand treasurehunt thereandback journey flying deadly peril deadly peril'
 'of course understand' said merry firmly 'that decided come know ring laughingmatter going best help enemy'
 'the ring' said frodo completely amazed
 'yes ring' said merry 'my dear old hobbit allow inquisitiveness friends known existence ring years � bilbo went away fact since obviously regarded secret kept knowledge head formed conspiracy know bilbo course well know young also careful � careful enough want know first found tell you'
 'go on' said frodo faintly
 'it sackvillebagginses downfall might expect one day year party happened walking along road saw bilbo ahead suddenly distance sbs appeared coming towards us bilbo slowed hey presto vanished startled hardly wits hide ordinary fashion got hedge walked along field inside peeping road sbs passed looking straight bilbo suddenly reappeared caught glint gold put something back trouserpocket
 'after kept eyes open fact confess spied must admit intriguing teens must one shire besides frodo ever seen old fellow's secret book'
 'you read book' cried frodo 'good heavens nothing safe'
 'not safe say' said merry 'but one rapid glance difficult get never left book wonder became like another look got frodo'
 'no bag end must taken away'
 'well saying' merry proceeded 'i kept knowledge till spring things got serious formed conspiracy serious meant business scrupulous easy nut crack gandalf worse want introduced chief investigator produce him'
 'where he' said frodo looking round expected masked sinister figure come cupboard
 'step forward sam' said merry sam stood face scarlet ears 'here's collector information collected lot tell finally caught may say seemed regard parole dried up'
 'sam' cried frodo feeling amazement could go quite unable decide whether felt angry amused relieved merely foolish
 'yes sir' said sam 'begging pardon sir meant wrong mr frodo mr gandalf matter _he_ sense mind said _go alone_ said _no lake someone trust'_
 'but seem trust anyone' said frodo sam looked unhappily 'it depends want' put merry 'you trust us stick thick thin � bitter end trust us keep secret � closer keep cannot trust us let face trouble alone go without word friends frodo anyway know gandalf told know good deal ring horribly afraid � coming following like hounds'
 'and sir' added sam 'you ought take elves' advice gildor said take willing can't deny it'
 'i deny it' said frodo looking sam grinning 'i deny i'll never believe sleeping whether snore shall kick hard make sure
 'you set deceitful scoundrels' said turning others 'but bless you' laughed getting waving arms 'i give take gildor's advice danger dark dance joy even cannot help feeling happy happier felt long time dreaded evening'
 'good that's settled three cheers captain frodo company' shouted danced round merry pippin began song apparently got ready occasion
 made model dwarfsong started bilbo adventure long ago went tune

 farewell call hearth hall
 though wind may blow rain may fall
 must away ere break day
 far wood mountain tall

 rivendell elves yet dwell
 glades beneath misty fell
 moor waste ride haste
 whither cannot tell

 foes ahead behind us dread
 beneath sky shall bed
 last toil passed
 journey done errand sped

 must away must away
 ride break day


 'very good' said frodo 'but case lot things go bed � roof tonight rate'
 'oh poetry' said pippin 'do really mean start break day'
 'i know' answered frodo 'i fear black riders sure unsafe stay one place long especially place known going also gildor advised wait much like see gandalf could see even gildor disturbed heard gandalf never appeared really depends two things soon could riders get bucklebury soon could get take good deal preparation'
 'the answer second question' said merry 'is could get hour prepared practically everything six ponies stable across fields stores tackle packed except extra clothes perishable food'
 'it seems efficient conspiracy' said frodo 'but black riders would safe wait one day gandalf'
 'that depends think riders would found here' answered merry 'they _could_ reached course stopped northgate hedge runs riverbank side bridge gateguards would let night though might break even daylight would try keep think rate got message master hall � would like look riders would certainly frightened course buckland cannot resist determined attack long possible morning even black rider rode asked mr baggins would let pretty generally known coming back live crickhollow'
 frodo sat thought 'i made mind' said finally 'i starting tomorrow soon light going road would safer wait go northgate departure buckland known instead secret several days least might bridge east road near borders certainly watched whether rider gets buckland know many least two possibly thing go quite unexpected direction'
 'but mean going old forest' said fredegar horrified 'you can't thinking quite dangerous black riders'
 'not quite' said merry sounds desperate believe frodo right way getting without followed luck might gel considerable start'
 'but luck old forest' objected fredegar 'no one ever luck gel lost people go there'
 'oh yes do' said merry 'the brandybucks go � occasionally fit takes private entrance frodo went long ago several times usually daylight course trees sleepy fairly quiet'
 'well think best' said fredegar 'i afraid old forest anything know stories nightmare vote hardly counts going journey still glad someone stopping behind tell gandalf done turns sure long'
 fond frodo fatty bolger desire leave shire see lay outside family came eastfarthing budgeford bridgefields fact never brandywine bridge task according original plans conspirators stay behind deal inquisitive folk keep long possible pretence mr baggins still living crickhollow even brought along old clothes frodo's help playing part little thought dangerous part might prove
 'excellent' said frodo understood plan 'we could left message behind gandalf otherwise know whether riders read course dared risk written message case got searched house fatty willing hold fort sure gandalf knowing way gone decides going old forest first thing tomorrow'
 'well that's that' said pippin 'on whole would rather job fatty's � waiting till black riders come'
 'you wait till well inside forest' said fredegar 'you'll wish back time tomorrow'
 'it's good arguing more' said merry 'we still got tidy put finishing touches packing get bed shall call break day'
 last got bed frodo could sleep time legs ached glad riding morning eventually fell vague dream seemed looking high window dark sea tangled trees among roots sound creatures crawling snuffling felt sure would smell sooner later
 heard noise distance first thought great wind coming leaves forest knew leaves sound sea faroff sound never heard waking life though often troubled dreams suddenly found open trees dark heath strange salt smell air looking saw tall white tower standing alone high ridge great desire came climb tower see sea started struggle ridge towards tower suddenly light came sky noise thunder


 _chapter 6_
 old forest

 frodo woke suddenly still dark room merry standing candle one hand banging door 'all right it' said frodo still shaken bewildered
 'what it' cried merry 'it time get half past four foggy come sam already getting breakfast ready even pippin going saddle ponies fetch one baggagecarrier wake sluggard fatty least must get see us off'
 soon six o'clock five hobbits ready start fatty bolger still yawning stole quietly house merry went front leading laden pony took way along path went spinney behind house cut across several fields leaves trees glistening every twig dripping grass grey cold dew everything still faraway noises seemed near clear fowls chattering yard someone closing door distant house
 shed found ponies sturdy little beasts kind loved hobbits speedy good long day's work mounted soon riding mist seemed open reluctantly close forbiddingly behind riding hour slowly without talking saw hedge looming suddenly ahead tall netted silver cobwebs 'how going get this' asked fredegar 'follow me' said merry 'and see' turned left along hedge soon came point bent inwards running along lip hollow cutting made distance hedge went sloping gently ground walls brick sides rose steadily suddenly arched formed tunnel dived deep hedge came hollow side
 fatty bolger halted 'goodbye frodo' said 'i wish going forest hope need rescuing day good luck � today every day'
 'if worse things ahead old forest shall lucky' said frodo 'tell gandalf hurry along east road shall soon back going fast can' 'goodbye' cried rode slope disappeared fredegar's sight tunnel
 dark damp far end closed gate thickset iron bars merry got unlocked gate passed pushed shut clang lock clicked sound ominous
 'there' said merry 'you left shire outside edge old forest'
 'are stories true' asked pippin
 'i know stories mean' merry answered 'if mean old bogeystories fatty's nurses used tell goblins wolves things sort say rate believe forest _is_ queer everything much alive aware going speak things shire trees like strangers watch usually content merely watch long daylight lasts much occasionally unfriendly ones may drop branch stick root grasp long trailer night things alarming told twice dark near hedge thought trees whispering passing news plots along unintelligible language branches swayed groped without wind say trees actually move surround strangers hem fact long ago attacked hedge came planted right leaned hobbits came cut hundreds trees made great bonfire forest burned ground long strip east hedge trees gave attack became unfriendly still wide bare space far inside bonfire made'
 'is trees dangerous' asked pippin
 'there various queer things living deep forest far side' said merry 'or least heard never seen something makes paths whenever one comes inside one finds open tracks seem shift change time time queer fashion far tunnel long time beginning quite broad path leading bonfire glade less direction east little north path going try find'
 hobbits left tunnelgate rode across wide hollow far side faint path leading floor forest hundred yards beyond hedge vanished soon brought trees looking back could see dark line hedge stems trees already thick looking ahead could see treetrunks innumerable sizes shapes straight bent twisted leaning squat slender smooth gnarled branched stems green grey moss slimy shaggy growths
 merry alone seemed fairly cheerful 'you better lead find path' frodo said 'don't let us lose one another forget way hedge lies'
 picked way among trees ponies plodded along carefully avoiding many writhing interlacing roots undergrowth ground rising steadily went forward seemed trees became taller darker thicker sound except occasional drip moisture falling still leaves moment whispering movement among branches got uncomfortable feeling watched disapproval deepening dislike even enmity feeling steadily grew found looking quickly glancing back shoulders expected sudden blow
 yet sign path trees seemed constantly bar way pippin suddenly felt could bear longer without warning let shout 'oi oi' cried 'i going anything let pass you'
 others halted startled cry fell muffled heavy curtain echo answer though wood seemed become crowded watchful
 'i shout you' said merry harm good'
 frodo began wonder possible find way right make others come abominable wood merry looking side side seemed already uncertain way go pippin noticed 'it taken long lose us' said moment merry gave whistle relief pointed ahead
 'well well' said 'these trees _do_ shift bonfire glade front us hope path seems moved away'
 light grew clearer went forward suddenly came trees found wide circular space sky blue clear surprise forestroof able see rising morning lifting mist sun however high enough yet shine clearing though light treetops leaves thicker greener edges glade enclosing almost solid wall tree grew rough grass many tall plants stalky faded hemlocks woodparsley fireweed seeding fluffy ashes rampant nettles thistles dreary place seemed charming cheerful garden close forest
 hobbits felt encouraged looked hopefully broadening daylight sky far side glade break wall trees clear path beyond could see running wood wide places open though every trees drew overshadowed dark boughs path rode still climbing gently went much quicker better heart seemed forest relented going let pass unhindered
 air began get hot stuffy trees drew close either side could longer see far ahead stronger ever felt ill wood pressing silent fall ponies' hoofs rustling dead leaves occasionally stumbling hidden roots seemed thud ears frodo tried sing song encourage voice sank murmur

 wanderers shadowed land
 despair though dark stand
 woods must end last
 see open sun go past
 setting sun rising sun
 day's end day begun
 east west woods must fail 


 _fail _ even said word voice faded silence air seemed heavy making words wearisome behind large branch fell old overhanging tree crash path trees seemed close
 'they like ending failing' said merry 'i sing present wait till get edge we'll turn give rousing chorus'
 spoke cheerfully felt great anxiety show others answer depressed heavy weight settling steadily frodo's heart regretted every step forward ever thought challenging menace trees indeed stop propose going back still possible things took new turn path stopped climbing became nearly level dark trees drew aside ahead could see path going almost straight forward distance stood green hilltop treeless rising like bald head encircling wood path seemed making directly
 hurried forward delighted thought climbing roof forest path dipped began climb upwards leading last foot steep hillside left trees faded turf wood stood round hill like thick hair ended sharply circle round shaven crown
 hobbits led ponies winding round round reached top stood gazed air gleaming sunlit hazy could see great distance near hand mist almost gone though lay hollows wood south deep fold cutting right across forest fog still rose like steam wisps white smoke
 'that' said merry pointing hand 'that line withywindle comes downs flows southwest midst forest join brandywine haysend want go _that_ way withywindle valley said queerest part whole wood � centre queerness comes were'
 others looked direction merry pointed could see little mists damp deepcut valley beyond southern half forest faded view
 sun hilllop getting hot must eleven o'clock autumn haze still prevented seeing much directions west could make either line hedge valley brandywine beyond northward looked hopefully could see nothing might line great east road making island sea trees horizon veiled
 southeastern side ground fell steeply slopes hill continued far trees like islandshores really sides mountain rising deep waters sat green edge looked woods ate midday meal sun rose passed noon glimpsed far east greygreen lines downs lay beyond old forest side cheered greatly good see sight anything beyond wood's borders though mean go way could help barrowdowns sinister reputation hobbitlegend forest
 length made minds go path brought hill reappeared northward side followed far became aware bending steadily right soon began descend rapidly guessed must actually heading towards withywindle valley direction wished lo take discussion decided leave misleading path strike northward although able see hilltop road must lie way could many miles also northward left path land seemed lo drier open climbing slopes trees thinner pines firs replaced oaks ashes strange nameless trees denser wood
 first choice seemed good got along fair speed though whenever got glimpse sun open glade seemed unaccountably veered eastwards time trees began close appeared distance thinner less tangled deep folds ground discovered unexpectedly like ruts great giantwheels wide moats sunken roads long disused choked brambles lay usually right across line march could crossed scrambling troublesome difficult ponies time climbed found hollow filled thick bushes matted undergrowth somehow would yield left gave way turned right go distance along bottom could find way bank time clambered trees seemed deeper darker always left upwards difficult find way forced right downwards
 hour two lost clear sense direction though knew well enough long ceased go northward headed simply following course chosen � eastwards southwards heart forest
 afternoon wearing away scrambled stumbled fold wider deeper yet met sleep overhung proved impossible climb either forwards backwards without leaving ponies baggage behind could follow fold � downwards ground grew soft places boggy springs appeared banks soon found following brook trickled babbled weedy bed ground began fall rapidly brook growing strong noisy flowed leaped swiftly downhill deep dimlit gully overarched trees high
 stumbling along way along stream came quite suddenly gloom gate saw sunlight coming opening found made way cleft high sleep bank almost cliff feet wide space grass reeds distance could glimpsed another bank almost steep golden afternoon late sunshine lay warm drowsy upon hidden land midst wound lazily dark river brown water bordered ancient willows arched willows blocked fallen willows flecked thousands faded willowleaves air thick fluttering yellow branches warm gentle breeze blowing softly valley reeds rustling willowboughs creaking
 'well least notion are' said merry 'we come almost opposite direction intended river withywindle go explore'
 passed sunshine disappeared long grasses reappeared reported fairly solid ground clifffoot river places firm turf went water's edge 'what's more' said 'there seems something like footpath winding along side river turn left follow shall bound come east side forest eventually'
 'i dare say' said pippin 'that track goes far simply lead us bog leave us made track suppose sure benefit getting suspicious forest everything begin believe stories idea far eastward go'
 'no' said merry 'i know least far withywindle could possibly come often enough make path along way see think of'
 nothing else filed merry led path discovered everywhere reeds grasses lush tall places far heads found path easy follow turned twisted picking sounder ground among bogs pools passed rills running gullies withywindle higher forestlands points treetrunks bundles brushwood laid carefully across
 hobbits began feel hot armies flies kinds buzzing round ears afternoon sun burning backs last came suddenly thin shade great grey branches reached across path step forward became reluctant last sleepiness seemed creeping ground legs falling softly air upon heads eyes
 frodo felt chin go head nod front pippin fell forward knees frodo halted 'it's good' heard merry saying 'can't go another step without rest must nap cool willows less flies'
 frodo like sound 'come on' cried 'we can't nap yet must get clear forest first' others far gone care beside sam stood yawning blinking stupidly
 suddenly frodo felt sleep overwhelming head swam seemed hardly sound air flies stopped buzzing gentle noise edge hearing soft fluttering song half whispered seemed stir boughs lifted heavy eyes saw leaning huge willowtree old hoary enormous looked sprawling branches going like reaching arms many longfingered hands knotted twisted trunk gaping wide fissures creaked faintly boughs moved leaves fluttering bright sky dazzled toppled lying fell upon grass
 merry pippin dragged forward lay backs willowtrunk behind great cracks gaped wide receive tree swayed creaked looked grey yellow leaves moving softly light singing shut eyes seemed could almost hear words cool words saying something water sleep gave spell fell fast asleep foot great grey willow
 frodo lay fighting sleep overpowering effort struggled feel felt compelling desire cool water 'wait sam' stammered 'must bathe feet minute'
 half dream wandered forward riverward side tree great winding roots grew stream like gnarled dragonets straining drink straddled one paddled hot feel cool brown water suddenly fell asleep back tree
 sam sat scratched head yawned like cavern worried afternoon getting late thought sudden sleepiness uncanny 'there's behind sun warm air' muttered 'i like great big tree trust hark singing sleep all'
 pulled feet staggered see become ponies found two wandered good way along path caught brought back towards others heard two noises one loud soft clear one splash something heavy falling water noise like snick lock door quietly closes fast
 rushed back bank frodo water close edge great treeroot seemed holding struggling sam gripped jacket dragged root difficulty hauled bank almost woke coughed spluttered
 'do know sam' said length 'the beastly tree _threw_ felt big root twisted round tipped in'
 'you dreaming expect mr frodo' said sam 'you sit place feel sleepy'
 'what others' frodo asked 'i wonder sort dreams having'
 went round side tree sam understood click heard pippin vanished crack laid closed together chink could seen merry trapped another crack closed waist legs lay outside rest inside dark opening edges gripped like pair pincers
 frodo sam beat first upon treetrunk pippin lain struggled frantically pull open jaws crack held poor merry quite useless
 'what foul thing happen' cried frodo wildly 'why ever come dreadful forest wish back crickhollow' kicked tree strength heedless feet hardly perceptible shiver ran stem branches leaves rustled whispered sound faint faroff laughter
 'i suppose got axe among luggage mr frodo' asked sam
 'i brought little hatchet chopping firewood' said frodo 'that much use'
 'wait minute' cried sam struck idea suggested firewood 'we might something fire'
 'we might' said frodo doubtfully 'we might succeed roasting pippin alive inside'
 'we might try hurt frighten tree begin with' said sam fiercely 'if let go i'll gnaw it' ran ponies long came back two tinderboxes hatchet
 quickly gathered dry grass leaves bits bark made pile broken twigs chopped sticks heaped trunk far side tree prisoners soon sam struck spark tinder kindled dry grass flurry flame smoke went twigs crackled little fingers fire licked dry scored rind ancient tree scorched tremor ran whole willow leaves seemed hiss heads sound pain anger loud scream came merry far inside tree heard pippin give muffled yell
 'put put out' cried merry 'he'll squeeze two says so'
 'who what' shouted frodo rushing round side tree
 'put put out' begged merry branches willow began sway violently sound wind rising spreading outwards branches trees round though dropped stone quiet slumber rivervalley set ripples anger ran whole forest sam kicked little fire stamped sparks frodo without clear idea hoped ran along path crying _help help help_it seemed could hardly hear sound shrill voice blown away willowwind drowned clamour leaves soon words left mouth felt desperate lost witless
 suddenly slopped answer thought seemed come behind away path back forest turned round listened soon could doubt someone singing song deep glad voice singing carelessly happily singing nonsense

 hey dol merry dol ring dong dillo
 ring dong hop along fal lal willow
 tom bom jolly tom tom bombadillo

 half hopeful half afraid new danger frodo sam stood still suddenly long string nonsensewords seemed voice rose loud clear burst song

 hey come merry dot derry dol darling
 light goes weatherwind feathered starling
 along hill shining sunlight
 waiting doorstep cold starlight
 pretty lady riverwoman's daughter
 slender willowwand clearer water
 old tom bombadil waterlilies bringing

 hey come merry dol deny dol merryo
 goldberry goldberry merry yellow berryo
 poor old willowman tuck roots away
 tom's hurry evening follow day
 tom's going home waterlilies bringing
 hey come derry dol hear singing


 frodo sam stood enchanted wind puffed leaves hung silently stiff branches another burst song suddenly hopping dancing along path appeared reeds old battered hat tall crown long blue feather stuck band another hop bound came view man seemed rate large heavy hobbit quite tall enough one big people though made noise enough one slumping along great yellow boots thick legs charging grass rushes like cow going drink blue coat long brown beard eyes blue bright face red ripe apple creased hundred wrinkles laughter hands carried large leaf tray small pile white waterlilies
 'help' cried frodo sam running towards hands stretched
 'whoa whoa steady there' cried old man holding one hand stopped short struck stiff 'now little fellows agoing puffing like bellows what's matter know i'm tom bombadil tell what's trouble tom's hurry crush lilies'
 'my friends caught willowtree' cried frodo breathlessly
 'master merry's squeezed crack' cried sam
 'what' shouted tom bombadil leaping air 'old man willow naught worse eh soon mended know tune old grey willowman i'll freeze marrow cold behave i'll sing roots i'll sing wind blow leaf branch away old man willow' setting lilies carefully grass ran tree saw merry's feet still sticking � rest already drawn inside tom put mouth crack began singing low voice could catch words evidently merry aroused legs began kick tom sprang away breaking hanging branch smote side willow 'you let old man willow' said 'what athinking waking eat earth dig deep drink water go sleep bombadil talking' seized merry's feet drew suddenly widening crack
 tearing creak crack split open pippin sprang kicked loud snap cracks closed fast shudder ran tree root tip complete silence fell
 'thank you' said hobbits one
 tom bombadil burst laughing 'well little fellows' said stooping peered faces 'you shall come home table laden yellow cream honeycomb white bread butter goldberry waiting time enough questions around supper table follow quick able' picked lilies beckoning wave hand went hopping dancing along path eastward still singing loudly nonsensically
 surprised relieved talk hobbits followed fast could fast enough tom soon disappeared front noise singing got fainter away suddenly voice came floating back loud halloo

 hop along little friends withywindle
 tom's going ahead candles kindle
 west sinks sun soon groping
 nightshadows fall door open
 windowpanes light twinkle yellow
 fear alder black heed hoary willow
 fear neither root bough tom goes
 hey merry dot we'll waiting


 hobbits heard almost sun seemed sink trees behind thought slanting light evening glittering brandywine river windows bucklebury beginning gleam hundreds lights great shadows fell across trunks branches trees hung dark threatening path white mists began rise curl surface river stray roots trees upon borders ground feet shadowy steam arose mingled swiftly falling dusk
 became difficult follow path tired legs seemed leaden strange furtive noises ran among bushes reeds either side looked pale sky caught sight queer gnarled knobbly faces gloomed dark twilight leered high bank edges wood began feel country unreal stumbling ominous dream led awakening
 felt feet slowing standstill noticed ground gently rising water began murmur darkness caught white glimmer foam river flowed short fall suddenly trees came end mists left behind stepped forest found wide sweep grass welling river small swift leaping merrily meet glinting light stars already shining sky
 grass feet smooth short mown shaven eaves forest behind clipped trim hedge path plain welltended bordered stone wound top grassy knoll grey pale starry night still high slope saw twinkling lights house path went long smooth hillside turf towards light suddenly wide yellow beam flowed brightly door opened tom bombadil's house hill behind steep shoulder land lay grey bare beyond dark shapes barrowdowns stalked away eastern night
 hurried forward hobbits ponies already half weariness fears fallen _hey come merry dol_ rolled song greet

 hey come derry dol hop along hearties
 hobbits ponies fond parties
 let fun begin let us sing together

 another clear voice young ancient spring like song glad water flowing night bright morning hills came falling like silver meet

 let song begin let us sing together
 sun stars moon mist rain cloudy weather
 light budding leaf dew feather
 wind open hill bells heather
 reeds shady pool lilies water
 old tom bombadil riverdaughter


 song hobbits stood upon threshold golden light


 _chapter 7_
 house tom bombadil

 four hobbits stepped wide stone threshold stood still blinking long low room filled light lamps swinging beams roof table dark polished wood stood many candles tall yellow burning brightly
 chair far side room facing outer door sat woman long yellow hair rippled shoulders gown green green young reeds shot silver like beads dew belt gold shaped like chain flaglilies set paleblue eyes forgetmenots feel wide vessels green brown earthenware white waterlilies floating seemed enthroned midst pool
 'enter good guests' said spoke knew clear voice heard singing came timid steps room began bow low feeling strangely surprised awkward like folk knocking cottage door beg drink water answered fair young elfqueen clad living flowers could say anything sprang lightly lilybowls ran laughing towards ran gown rustled softly like wind flowering borders river
 'come dear folk' said taking frodo hand 'laugh merry goldberry daughter river' lightly passed closing door turned back white arms spread across 'let us shut night' said 'for still afraid perhaps mist treeshadows deep water untame things fear nothing tonight roof tom bombadil'
 hobbits looked wonder looked smiled 'fair lady goldberry' said frodo last feeling heart moved joy understand stood times stood enchanted fair elvenvoices spell laid upon different less keen lofty delight deeper nearer mortal heart marvellous yet strange 'fair lady goldberry' said 'now joy hidden songs heard made plain

 slender willowwand clearer clear water

 suddenly stopped stammered overcome surprise hear saying things goldberry laughed
 'welcome' said 'i heard folk shire sweettongued see elffriend light eyes ring voice tells merry meeting sit wait master house long tending tired beasts'
 hobbits sat gladly low rushseated chairs goldberry busied table eyes followed slender grace movement filled quiet delight somewhere behind house came sound singing every caught among many _derry dol_ _merry dol_ _ring ding dillo_ repeated words

 old tom bombadil merry fellow
 bright blue jacket boots yellow

 'fair lady' said frodo 'tell asking seem foolish tom bombadil'
 'he is' said goldberry staying swift movements smiling
 frodo looked questioningly 'he seen him' said answer look 'he master wood water hill'
 'then strange land belongs him'
 'no indeed' answered smile faded 'that would indeed burden' added low voice 'the trees grasses things growing living land belong tom bombadil master one ever caught old tom walking forest wading water leaping hilltops light shadow fear tom bombadil master'
 door opened came tom bombadil hat thick brown hair crowned autumn leaves laughed going goldberry took hand
 'here's pretty lady' said bowing hobbits 'here's goldberry clothed silvergreen flowers girdle table laden see yellow cream honeycomb white bread butter milk cheese green herbs ripe berries gathered enough us supper ready'
 'it is' said goldberry 'but guests perhaps not'
 tom clapped hands cried 'tom tom guests tired near forgotten come merry friends tom refresh shall clean grimy hands wash weary faces cast muddy cloaks comb tangles'
 opened door followed short passage round sharp turn came low room sloping roof penthouse seemed built north end house walls clean stone mostly covered green hanging mats yellow curtains floor flagged strewn fresh green rushes four deep mattresses piled white blankets laid floor along one side opposite wall long bench laden wide earthenware basins beside stood brown ewers filled water cold steaming hot soft green slippers set ready beside bed
 long washed refreshed hobbits seated table two side either end sat goldberry master long merry meal though hobbits ate famished hobbits eat lack drink drinkingbowls seemed clear cold water yet went hearts like wine set free voices guests became suddenly aware singing merrily easier natural talking
 last tom goldberry rose cleared table swiftly guests commanded sit quiet set chairs footstool tired feet fire wide hearth burning sweet smell built applewood everything set order lights room put except one lamp pair candles end chimneyshelf goldberry came stood holding candle wished good night deep sleep
 'have peace now' said 'until morning heed nightly noises nothing passes door window save moonlight starlight wind hilltop good night' passed room glimmer rustle sound footsteps like stream falling gently away downhill cool stones quiet night
 tom sat beside silence tried muster courage ask one many questions meant ask supper sleep gathered eyelids last frodo spoke
 'did hear calling master chance brought moment'
 tom stirred like man shaken pleasant dream 'eh what' said 'did hear calling nay hear busy singing chance brought chance call plan mine though waiting heard news learned wandering guessed come ere long water paths lead way withywindle old grey willowman he's mighty singer hard little folk escape cunning mazes tom errand dared hinder' tom nodded sleep taking went soft singing voice

 fell silent frodo could help asking one question one desired answered 'tell us master' said 'about willowman never heard before'
 'no don't' said merry pippin together sitting suddenly upright 'not morning'
 'that right' said old man 'now time resting things ill hear world's shadow sleep till morninglight rest pillow heed nightly noise fear grey willow' took lamp blew grasping candle either hand led room
 mattresses pillows soft blankets white wool hardly laid deep beds drawn light covers asleep
 dead night frodo lay dream without light saw young moon rising thin light loomed black wall rock pierced dark arch like great gate seemed frodo lifted passing saw rockwall circle hills within plain midst plain stood pinnacle stone like vast tower made hands top stood figure man moon rose seemed hang moment head glistened white hair wind stirred dark plain came crying fell voices howling many wolves suddenly shadow like shape great wings passed across moon figure lifted arms light flashed staff wielded mighty eagle swept bore away voices wailed wolves yammered noise like strong wind blowing borne sound hoofs galloping galloping galloping east 'black riders' thought frodo wakened sound hoofs still echoing mind wondered would ever courage leave safety stone walls lay motionless still listening silent last turned fell asleep wandered unremembered dream
 side pippin lay dreaming pleasantly change came dreams turned groaned suddenly woke thought waked yet still heard darkness sound disturbed dream _tiptap squeak_ noise like branches fretting wind twigfingers scraping wall window _creak creak creak_ wondered willowtrees close house suddenly dreadful feeling ordinary house inside willow listening horrible dry creaking voice laughing sat felt soft pillows yield hands lay relieved seemed hear echo words ears 'fear nothing peace morning heed nightly noises' went sleep
 sound water merry heard falling quiet sleep water streaming gently spreading spreading irresistibly round house dark shoreless pool gurgled walls rising slowly surely 'i shall drowned' thought find way shall drown' felt lying soft slimy bog springing set fool corner cold hard flagstone remembered lay seemed hear remember hearing 'nothing passes doors windows save moonlight starlight wind hilltop' little breath sweet air moved curtain breathed deep fell asleep
 far could remember sam slept night deep content logs contented
 woke four morning light tom moving room whistling like starling heard stir clapped hands cried 'hey come merry dol derry dol hearties' drew back yellow curtains hobbits saw covered windows either end room one looking east looking west
 leapt refreshed frodo ran eastern window found looking kitchengarden grey dew half expected see turf right walls turf pocked hoofprints actually view screened tall line beans poles far beyond grey top hill loomed sunrise pale morning east behind long clouds like lines soiled wool stained red edges lay glimmering deeps yellow sky spoke rain come light broadening quickly red flowers beans began glow wet green leaves
 pippin looked western window pool mist forest hidden fog like looking sloping cloudroof fold channel mist broken many plumes billows valley withywindle stream ran hill left vanished white shadows near hand flowergarden clipped hedge silvernetted beyond grey shaven grass pale dewdrops willowtree seen
 'good morning merry friends' cried tom opening eastern window wide cool air flowed rainy smell 'sun show face much today i'm thinking walking wide leaping hilltops since grey dawn began nosing wind weather wet grass underfoot wet sky wakened goldberry singing window nought wakes hobbitfolk early morning night little folk wake darkness sleep light come ring ding dillo wake merry friends forget nightly noises ring ding dillo del derry del hearties come soon find breakfast table come late get grass rainwater'
 needless say � tom's threat sounded serious � hobbits came soon left table late beginning lo look rather empty neither tom goldberry tom could heard house clattering kitchen stairs singing outside room looked westward mistclouded valley window open water dripped thatched eaves finished breakfast clouds joined unbroken roof straight grey rain came softly steadily behind deep curtain forest completely veiled
 looked window came falling gently flowing rain sky clear voice goldberry singing could hear words seemed plain song rainsong sweet showers dry hills told tale river spring highlands sea far hobbits listened delight frodo glad heart blessed kindly weather delayed departing thought going heavy upon moment awoke guessed would go day
 upper wind settled west deeper wetter clouds rolled spill laden rain bare heads downs nothing could seen round house falling water frodo stood near open door watched white chalky path turn little river milk go bubbling away valley tom bombadil came trotting round corner house waving arms warding rain � indeed sprang threshold seemed quite dry except boots took put chimneycorner sat largest chair called hobbits gather round
 'this goldberry's washing day' said 'and autumncleaning wet hobbitfolk � let rest able good day long tales questions answers tom start talking'
 told many remarkable stories sometimes half speaking sometimes looking suddenly bright blue eye deep brows often voice would turn song would get chair dance told tales bees flowers ways trees strange creatures forest evil things good things things friendly things unfriendly cruel things kind things secrets hidden brambles
 listened began understand lives forest apart indeed feel strangers things home moving constantly talk old man willow frodo learned enough content indeed enough comfortable lore tom's words laid bare hearts trees thoughts often dark strange filled hatred things go free upon earth gnawing biting breaking hacking burning destroyers usurpers called old forest without reason indeed ancient survivor vast forgotten woods lived yet ageing quicker hills fathers fathers trees remembering times lords countless years filled pride rooted wisdom malice none dangerous great willow heart rotten strength green cunning master winds song thought ran woods sides river grey thirsty spirit drew power earth spread like fine rootthreads ground invisible twigfingers air till dominion nearly trees forest hedge downs
 suddenly tom's talk left woods went leaping young stream bubbling waterfalls pebbles worn rocks among small flowers close grass wet crannies wandering last downs heard great barrows green mounds stonerings upon hills hollows among hills sheep bleating flocks green walls white walls rose fortresses heights kings little kingdoms fought together young sun shone like fire red metal new greedy swords victory defeat towers fell fortresses burned flames went sky gold piled biers dead kings queens mounds covered stone doors shut grass grew sheep walked biting grass soon hills empty shadow came dark places far away bones stirred mounds barrowwights walked hollow places clink rings cold fingers gold chains wind' stone rings grinned ground like broken teeth moonlight

 night heard noises either dreams could tell frodo heard sweet singing running mind song seemed come like pale light behind grey raincurtain growing stronger turn veil glass silver last rolled back far green country opened swift sunrise
 vision melted waking tom whistling like treefull birds sun already slanting hill open window outside everything green pale gold
 breakfast ate alone made ready say farewell nearly heavy heart possible morning cool bright clean washed autumn sky thin blue air came fresh northwest quiet ponies almost frisky sniffing moving restlessly tom came house waved hat danced upon doorstep bidding hobbits get go good speed
 rode along path wound away behind house went slanting towards north end hillbrow sheltered dismounted lead ponies last steep slope suddenly frodo stopped
 'goldberry' cried 'my fair lady clad silver green never said farewell seen since evening' distressed turned back moment clear call came rippling hillbrow stood beckoning hair flying loose caught sun shone shimmered light like glint water dewy grass flashed feet danced
 hastened last slope stood breathless beside bowed wave arm bade look round looked hilltop lands morning clear farseen veiled misty stood upon knoll forest could seen rising pale green dark trees west direction land rose wooded ridges green yellow russet sun beyond lay hidden valley brandywine south line withywindle distant glint like pale glass brandywine river made great loop lowlands flowed away knowledge hobbits northward beyond dwindling downs land ran away flats swellings grey green pale earthcolours faded featureless shadowy distance eastward barrowdowns rose ridge behind ridge morning vanished eyesight guess guess blue remote white glimmer blending hem sky spoke memory old tales high distant mountains

 goldberry spoke recalled eyes thoughts 'speed fair guests' said 'and hold purpose north wind left eye blessing footsteps make haste sun shines' frodo said 'farewell elffriend merry meeting'
 frodo found words answer bowed low mounted pony followed friends jogged slowly gentle slope behind hill tom bombadil's house valley forest lost view air grew warmer green walls hillside hillside scent turf rose strong sweet breathed turning back reached bottom green hollow saw goldberry small slender like sunlit flower sky standing still watching hands stretched towards looked gave clear call lifting hand turned vanished behind hill
 way wound along floor hollow round green feet steep hill another deeper broader valley shoulder hills long limbs smooth sides new hilltops new valleys tree visible water country grass short springy turf silent except whisper air edges land high lonely cries strange birds journeyed sun mounted grew hot time climbed ridge breeze seemed grown less caught glimpse country westward distant forest seemed smoking fallen rain steaming leaf root mould shadow lay round edge sight dark haze upper sky like blue cap hot heavy
 midday came hill whose top wide flattened like shallow saucer green mounded rim inside air stirring sky seemed near heads rode across looked northwards hearts rose seemed plain come already expected certainly distances become hazy deceptive could doubt downs coming end long valley lay winding away northwards came opening two steep shoulders beyond seemed hills due north faintly glimpsed long dark line line trees' said merry 'and must mark road along many leagues east bridge trees growing say planted old days'
 'splendid' said frodo 'if make good going afternoon done morning shall left downs sun sets jogging search camping place' even spoke turned glance eastwards saw side hills higher looked upon hills crowned green mounds standing stones pointing upwards like jagged teeth green gums
 view somehow disquieting turned sight went hollow circle midst stood single stone standing tall sun hour casting shadow shapeless yet significant like landmark guarding finger like warning hungry sun still fearless noon set backs east side stone cool sun power warm time seemed pleasant took food drink made good noonmeal open sky anyone could wish food came 'down hill' tom provided plenty comfort day ponies unburdened strayed upon grass
 riding hills eating fill warm sun scent turf lying little long stretching legs looking sky noses things perhaps enough explain happened however may woke suddenly uncomfortably sleep never meant take standing stone cold cast long pale shadow stretched eastward sun pale watery yellow gleaming mist west wall hollow lay north south east beyond wall fog thick cold white air silent heavy chill ponies standing crowded together heads
 hobbits sprang feet alarm ran western rim found upon island fog even looked dismay towards setting sun sank eyes white sea cold grey shadow sprang east behind fog rolled walls rose mounted bent heads became roof shut hall mist whose central pillar standing stone
 felt trap closing quite lose heart still remembered hopeful view line road ahead still knew direction lay case great dislike hollow place stone thought remaining minds packed quickly chilled fingers would work
 soon leading ponies single file rim long northward slope hill foggy sea went mist became colder damper hair hung lank dripping foreheads reached bottom cold halted got cloaks hoods soon became bedewed grey drops mounting ponies went slowly feeling way rise fall ground steering well could guess gatelike opening far northward end long valley seen morning gap lo keep anything like straight line bound end strike road thoughts go beyond except vague hope perhaps away beyond downs might fog
 going slow prevent getting separated wandering different directions went file frodo leading sam behind came pippin merry valley seemed stretch endlessly suddenly frodo saw hopeful sign either side ahead darkness began loom mist guessed last approaching gap hills northgate barrowdowns could pass would free
 'come follow me' called back shoulder hurried forward hope soon changed bewilderment alarm dark patches grew darker shrank suddenly saw towering ominous leaning slightly towards one another like pillars headless door two huge standing stones could remember seen sign valley looked hill morning passed almost aware even darkness seemed fall round pony reared snorted fell looked back found alone others followed 'sam' called 'pippin merry come along keep up'

 struggled called kept calling frantically heard answer time seemed faint far ahead high 'frodo hoy' came thin voices mist cry sounded like _help help_ often repeated ending last _help_ trailed long wail suddenly cut short stumbled forward speed could towards cries light gone clinging night closed impossible sure direction seemed time climbing
 change level ground feet told last came top ridge hill weary sweating yet chilled wholly dark
 'where you' cried miserably
 reply stood listening suddenly aware getting cold wind beginning blow icy wind change coming weather mist flowing past shreds tatters breath smoking darkness less near thick looked saw surprise faint stars appearing overhead amid strands hurrying cloud fog wind began hiss grass
 imagined suddenly caught muffled cry made towards even went forward mist rolled thrust aside starry sky unveiled glance showed facing southwards round hilltop must climbed north east biting wind blowing right loomed westward stars dark black shape great barrow stood
 'where you' cried angry afraid
 'here' said voice deep cold seemed come ground 'i waiting you'
 'no' said frodo run away knees gave fell ground nothing happened sound trembling looked time see tall dark figure like shadow stars leaned thought two eyes cold though lit pale light seemed come remote distance grip stronger colder iron seized icy touch froze bones remembered
 came moment could recall nothing except sense dread suddenly knew imprisoned caught hopelessly barrow barrowwight taken probably already dreadful spells barrowwights whispered tales spoke dared move lay found flat back upon cold stone hands breast
 though fear great seemed part darkness round found lay thinking bilbo baggins stories jogging along together lanes shire talking roads adventures seed courage hidden often deeply true heart fattest timid hobbit wailing final desperate danger make grow frodo neither fat timid indeed though know bilbo gandalf thought best hobbit shire thought come end adventure terrible end thought hardened found stiffening final spring longer felt limp like helpless prey
 lay thinking getting hold noticed darkness slowly giving way pale greenish light growing round first show kind place light seemed coming floor beside yet reached roof wall turned cold glow saw lying beside sam pippin merry backs faces looked deathly pale clad white lay many treasures gold maybe though light looked cold unlovely heads circlets gold chains waists fingers many rings swords lay sides shields feet across three necks lay one long naked sword
 suddenly song began cold murmur rising falling voice seemed far away immeasurably dreary sometimes high air thin sometimes like low moan ground formless stream sad horrible sounds strings words would shape grim hard cold words heartless miserable night railing morning bereaved cold cursing warmth hungered frodo chilled marrow song became clearer dread heart perceived changed incantation

 cold hand heart bone
 cold sleep stone
 never mare wake stony bed
 never till sun fails moon dead
 black wind stars shall die
 still gold let lie
 till dark lord lifts hand
 dead sea withered land

 heard behind head creaking scraping sound raising one arm looked saw pale light kind passage behind turned corner round corner long arm groping walking fingers towards sam lying nearest towards hilt sword lay upon
 first frodo felt indeed turned stone incantation wild thought escape came wondered put ring whether barrowwight would miss might find way thought running free grass grieving merry sam pippin free alive gandalf would admit nothing else could
 courage awakened strong could leave friends easily wavered groping pocket fought arm crept nearer suddenly resolve hardened seized short sword lay beside kneeling stooped low bodies companions strength hewed crawling arm near wrist hand broke moment sword splintered hilt shriek light vanished dark snarling noise
 frodo fell forward merry merry's face felt cold back mind disappeared first coming fog came memory house hill tom singing remembered rhyme tom taught small desperate voice began _ho tom bombadil_ name voice seemed grow strong full lively sound dark chamber echoed drum trumpet

 ho tom bombadil tom bombadillo

 sudden deep silence frodo could hear heart beating long slow moment heard plain far away coming ground thick walls answering voice singing

 old tom bombadil merry fellow
 bright blue jacket boots yellow
 none ever caught yet tom master
 songs stronger songs feet faster

 loud rumbling sound stones rolling falling suddenly light streamed real light plain light day low doorlike opening appeared end chamber beyond frodo's feet tom's head hat feather framed light sun rising red behind light fell upon floor upon faces three hobbits lying beside frodo stir sickly hue left looked deeply asleep
 tom stooped removed hat came dark chamber singing

 get old wight vanish sunlight
 shrivel like cold mist like winds go wailing
 barren lands far beyond mountains
 come never leave barrow empty
 lost forgotten darker darkness
 gates stand ever shut till world mended

 words cry part inner end chamber fell crash long trailing shriek fading away unguessable distance silence
 'come friend frodo' said tom 'let us get clean grass must help bear them'
 together carried merry pippin sam frodo left barrow last time thought saw severed hand wriggling still like wounded spider heap fallen earth tom went back sound much thumping stamping came bearing arms great load treasure things gold silver copper bronze many beads chains jewelled ornaments climbed green barrow laid top sunshine
 stood hat hand wind hair looked upon three hobbits laid backs upon grass west side mound raising right hand said clear commanding voice

 wake merry tads wake hear calling
 warm heart limb cold stone fallen
 dark door standing wide dead hand broken
 night night flown gate open

 frodo's great joy hobbits stirred stretched arms rubbed eyes suddenly sprang looked amazement first frodo tom standing large life barrowtop thin white rags crowned belted pale gold jingling trinkets
 'what name wonder' began merry feeling golden circlet slipped one eye stopped shadow came face closed eyes 'of course remember' said 'the men carn d�m came us night worsted ah spear heart' clutched breast 'no no' said opening eyes 'what saying dreaming get frodo'
 'i thought lost' said frodo 'but want speak let us think let us go on'
 'dressed like sir' said sam 'where clothes' flung circlet belt rings grass looked round helplessly expected find cloak jacket breeches hobbitgarments lying somewhere hand
 'you find clothes again' said tom bounding mound laughing danced round sunlight one would thought nothing dangerous dreadful happened indeed horror faded hearts looked saw merry glint eyes
 'what mean' asked pippin looking half puzzled half amused 'why not'
 tom shook head saying 'you've found deep water clothes little loss escape drowning glad merry friends let warm sunlight heal heart limb cast cold rags run naked grass tom goes ahunting'
 sprang away hill whistling calling looking frodo saw running away southwards along green hollow hill next still whistling crying

 hey come hoy whither wander

 sharpears wisenose swishtail bumpkin
 whitesocks little lad old fatty lumpkin

 sang running fast tossing hat catching hidden fold ground time _hey hoy now_came floating back wind shifted round towards south
 air growing warm hobbits ran grass told lay basking sun delight wafted suddenly bitter winter friendly clime people long ill bedridden wake one day find unexpectedly well day full promise
 time tom returned feeling strong hungry reappeared hat first brow hill behind came obedient line _six_ ponies five one last plainly old fatty lumpkin larger stronger fatter older ponies merry others belonged fact given names answered new names tom given rest lives tom called one one climbed brow stood line tom bowed hobbits
 'here ponies now' said 'they've sense ways wandering hobbits � sense noses sniff danger ahead walk right run save run right way must forgive though hearts faithful face fear barrowwights made see come bringing burdens'
 merry sam pippin clothed spare garments packs soon felt hot obliged put thicker warmer things brought oncoming winter
 'where old animal fatty lumpkin come from' asked frodo
 'he's mine' said tom 'my fourlegged friend though seldom ride wanders often far free upon hillsides ponies stayed got know lumpkin smelt night quickly ran meet thought he'd look words wisdom take fear away jolly lumpkin old tom's going ride hey he's coming set road needs pony cannot easily talk hobbits riding legs trying trot beside them'
 hobbits delighted hear thanked tom many times laughed said good losing would feel happy till seen safe borders land 'i've got things do' said 'my making singing talking walking watching country tom can't always near open doors willowcracks tom house mind goldberry waiting'
 still fairly early sun something nine ten hobbits turned minds food last meal lunch beside standing stone day breakfasted remainder tom's provisions meant supper additions tom brought large meal considering hobbits circumstances felt much better eating tom went mound looked treasures made pile glistened sparkled grass bade lie 'free finders birds beasts elves men kindly creatures' spell mound broken scattered wight ever come back chose pile brooch set blue stones manyshaded like flaxflowers wings blue butterflies looked long stirred memory shaking head saying last
 'here pretty toy tom lady fair long ago wore shoulder goldberry shall wear forget her'
 hobbits chose dagger long leafshaped keen marvellous workmanship damasked serpentforms red gold gleamed drew black sheaths wrought strange metal light strong set many fiery stones whether virtue sheaths spell lay mound blades seemed untouched time unrusted sharp glittering sun
 'old knives long enough swords hobbitpeople' said 'sharp blades good shirefolk go walking east south far away dark danger' told blades forged many long years ago men westernesse foes dark lord overcome evil king carn d�m land angmar
 'few remember them' tom murmured 'yet still go wandering sons forgotten kings walking loneliness guarding evil things folk heedless'
 hobbits understand words spoke vision great expanse years behind like vast shadowy plain strode shapes men tall grim bright swords last came one star brow vision faded back sunlit world time start made ready packing bags lading ponies new weapons hung leather belts jackets feeling awkward wondering would use fighting occurred one adventures flight would land
 last set led ponies hill mounting trotted quickly along valley looked back saw top old mound hill sunlight gold went like yellow flame turned shoulder downs hidden view
 though frodo looked every side saw sign great stones standing like gate long came northern gap rode swiftly land fell away merry journey tom bombadil trotting gaily beside fatty lumpkin could move much faster girth promised tom sang time chiefly nonsense else perhaps strange language unknown hobbits ancient language whose words mainly wonder delight
 went forward steadily soon saw road away imagined even without fog sleep midday would prevented reaching nightfall day dark line seen line trees line bushes growing edge deep dike steep wall side tom said boundary kingdom long lime ago seemed remember something sad would say much
 climbed dike gap wall tom turned due north bearing somewhat west land open fairly level quickened pace sun already sinking low last saw line tall trees ahead knew come back road many unexpected adventures galloped ponies last furlongs halted long shadows trees top sloping bank road dim evening drew wound away point ran nearly southwest northeast right fell quickly wide hollow rutted bore many signs recent heavy rain pools potholes full water rode bank looked nothing seen 'well last' said frodo 'i suppose lost two days short cut forest perhaps delay prove useful � may put trail'
 others looked shadow fear black riders came suddenly ever since entered forest thought chiefly getting back road lay beneath feet remember danger pursued likely lying wait upon road looked anxiously back towards setting sun road brown empty
 'do think' asked pippin hesitatingly 'do think may pursued tonight'
 'no hope tonight' answered tom bombadil 'nor perhaps next day trust guess cannot tell certain east knowledge fails tom master riders black land far beyond country'
 hobbits wished coming felt would know deal black riders anyone would soon going forward lands wholly strange beyond vague distant legends shire gathering twilight longed home deep loneliness sense loss stood silent reluctant make final parting slowly became aware tom wishing farewell telling good heart ride till dark without halting
 'tom give good advice till day luck must go guide four miles along road come upon village bree breehill doors looking westward find old inn called _the prancing pony_ barliman butterbur worthy keeper stay night afterwards morning speed upon way bold wary keep merry hearts ride meet fortune'
 begged come least far inn drink laughed refused saying

 'there hobbits bree' said merry 'as well big folk daresay homelike enough _the pony_ good inn accounts people ride again'
 'it may could wish' said frodo 'but outside shire make much home please remember � name baggins must mentioned mr underhill name must given'

 suddenly frodo noticed strangelooking weatherbeaten man sitting shadows near wall also listening intently hobbittalk tall tankard front smoking longstemmed pipe curiously carved legs stretched showing high boots supple leather fitted well seen much wear caked mud travelstained cloak heavy darkgreen cloth drawn close spite heat room wore hood overshadowed face gleam eyes could seen watched hobbits
 'who that' frodo asked got chance whisper mr butterbur 'i think introduced him'
 'him' said landlord answering whisper cocking eye without turning head 'i rightly know one wandering folk rangers call seldom talks tell rare tale mind disappears month year pops pretty often last spring seen lately right name i've never heard he's known round strider goes great pace long shanks though tell nobody cause hurry there's accounting east west say bree meaning rangers shirefolk begging pardon funny ask him' moment mr butterbur called away demand ale last remark remained unexplained
 frodo found strider looking heard guessed said presently wave hand nod invited frodo come sit frodo drew near threw back hood showing shaggy head dark hair necked grey pale stem face pair keen grey eyes
 'i called strider' said low voice 'i pleased meet master � underhill old butterbur got name right'
 'he did' said frodo stiffly felt far comfortable stare keen eyes
 'well master underhill' said strider 'if stop young friends talking much drink__ fire chancemeeting pleasant enough well � shire queer folk though say may think' added wry smile seeing frodo's glance 'and even stranger travellers bree lately' went watching frodo's face
 frodo returned gaze said nothing strider made sign attention seemed suddenly fixed pippin alarm frodo became aware ridiculous young took encouraged success fat mayor michel delving actually giving comic account bilbo's farewell party already giving imitation speech drawing near astonishing disappearance
 frodo annoyed harmless enough tale local hobbits doubt funny story funny people away beyond river old butterbur instance knew thing two probably heard rumours long ago bilbo's vanishing would bring name baggins minds especially inquiries bree name
 frodo fidgeted wondering pippin evidently much enjoying attention getting become quite forgetful danger frodo sudden fear present mood might even mention ring might well disastrous
 'you better something quick' whispered strider ear
 frodo jumped stood table began talk attention pippin's audience disturbed hobbits looked frodo laughed clapped thinking mr underhill taken much ale good
 frodo suddenly felt foolish found habit making speech fingering things pocket felt ring chain quite unaccountably desire came slip vanish silly situation seemed somehow suggestion came outside someone something room resisted temptation firmly clasped ring hand keep hold prevent escaping _any_ mischief rate gave inspiration spoke 'a suitable words' would said shire _we much gratified kindness reception venture hope brief visit help renew old ties friendship shire bree_and hesitated coughed
 everyone room looking 'a song' shouted one hobbits 'a song song' shouted others 'come master sing us something heard before'
 moment frodo stood gaping desperation began ridiculous song bilbo rather fond indeed rather proud made words inn probably came frodo's mind full words rule remembered

 inn merry old inn
 beneath old grey hill
 brew beer brown
 man moon came
 one night drink fill

 ostler tipsy cat
 plays fivestringed fiddle
 runs bow
 squeaking high purring low
 sawing middle

 landlord keeps little dog
 mighty fond jokes
 there's good cheer among guests
 cocks ear jests
 laughs chokes

 also keep horned cow
 proud queen
 music turns head like ale
 makes wave tufted tail
 dance upon green

 rows silver dishes
 store silver spoons
 sunday there's special pair
 polish care
 saturday afternoons

 man moon drinking deep
 cat began wail
 dish spoon table danced
 cow garden madly pranced
 little dog chased tail

 man moon took another mug
 rolled beneath chair
 dozed dreamed ale
 till sky stars pale

 ostler said tipsy cat
 'the white horses moon

 squeaked sawed quickened tune
 landlord shook man moon
 'it's three' said

 rolled man slowly hill
 bundled moon
 horses galloped rear
 cow came capering like deer
 dish ran spoon

 quicker fiddle went deedledumdiddle
 dog began roar
 cow horses stood heads
 guests bounded beds
 danced upon floor

 ping pong fiddlestrings broke
 cow jumped moon
 little dog laughed see fun
 saturday dish went run
 silver sunday spoon

 round moon rolled behind hill
 sun raised head
 hardly believed fiery eyes
 though day surprise
 went back bed

 'ah gandalf know mean wizard say he's good friend mine whether know he'll say see turn ale sour block wood wonder he's bit hasty still what's done can't undone '
 'well done' said frodo getting impatient slow unravelling butterbur's thoughts

 'then would take with' asked strider 'a fat innkeeper remembers name people shout day cannot stay _the pony_ ever cannot go home long road go keep black men off'
 'me leave bree money' said mr butterbur looking really scared 'but can't stay quiet bit mr underhill queer goings black men come i'd like know'
 'i'm sorry can't explain all' answered frodo 'i tired worried long tale mean help ought warn danger long house black riders sure think fear come from���'
 'they come mordor' said strider low voice 'from mordor barliman means anything you'
 'save us' cried mr butterbur turning pale name evidently known 'that worst news come bree time' 'it is' said frodo 'are still willing help me' 'i am' said mr butterbur 'more ever though know likes against���' faltered

 'well' said strider 'when going open letter' frodo looked carefully seal broke seemed certainly gandalf's inside written wizard's strong graceful script following message

 frodo read letter passed pippin sam 'really old butterbur made mess things' said 'he deserves roasting got might safe rivendell happened gandalf writes going great danger'
 'he many years' said strider
 frodo turned looked thoughtfully wondering gandalf's second postscript 'why tell gandalf's friend once' asked 'it would saved time'
 'would would believed till now' said strider 'i knew nothing letter knew persuade trust without proofs help case intend tell study _you_ first make sure enemy set traps soon made mind ready tell whatever asked must admit' added queer laugh 'that hoped would take sake hunted man sometimes wearies distrust longs friendship believe looks me'
 'they � first sight rate' laughed pippin sudden relief reading gandalf's letter 'but handsome handsome say shire daresay shall look much lying days hedges ditches'
 'it would take days weeks years wandering wild make look like strider' answered 'and would die first unless made sterner stuff look be'
 pippin subsided sam daunted still eyed strider dubiously 'how know strider gandalf speaks about' demanded 'you never mentioned gandalf till letter came might playacting spy see trying get us go might done real strider took clothes say that'
 'that stout fellow' answered strider 'but afraid answer sam gamgee killed real strider could kill killed already without much talk ring could � now'

 'but _am_ real strider fortunately' said looking face softened sudden smile 'i aragorn son arathorn life death save will'

 long silence last frodo spoke hesitation 'i believed friend letter came' said 'or least wished frightened several times tonight never way servants enemy would imagine think one spies would � well seem fairer feel fouler understand'
 'i see' laughed strider 'i look foul feel fair _all gold glitter wander lost'_
 'did verses apply then' asked frodo 'i could make know gandalf's letter never seen it'
 'i know' answered 'but aragorn verses go name' drew sword saw blade indeed broken foot hilt 'not much use sam' said strider 'but time near shall forged anew'
 sam said nothing
 'well' said strider 'with sam's permission call settled strider shall guide shall rough road tomorrow even allowed leave bree unhindered hardly hope leave unnoticed shall try get lost soon possible know one two ways breeland main road shake pursuit shall make weathertop'
 'weathertop' said sam 'what's that'
 'it hill north road half way rivendell commands wide view round shall chance look us gandalf make point follows us weathertop journey become difficult shall choose various dangers'
 'when last see gandalf' asked frodo 'do know doing'

 'i troubled first time since known messages even could come returned many days ago heard ill news tidings gone far wide gandalf missing horsemen seen elvenfolk gildor told later told left home news leaving buckland watching east road anxiously'
 'do think black riders anything � gandalf's absence mean' asked frodo
 'i know anything else could hindered except enemy himself' said strider 'but give hope gandalf greater shirefolk know � rule see jokes toys business greatest task'
 pippin yawned 'i sorry' said 'but dead tired spite danger worry must go bed sleep sit silly fellow merry would last straw go dark look him'

 moment heard door slam feet came running along passage merry came rush followed nob shut door hastily leaned breath stared alarm moment gasped 'i seen frodo seen black riders'
 'black riders' cried frodo 'where'
 'here village stayed indoors hour come back went stroll come back standing outside light lamp looking stars suddenly shivered felt something horrible creeping near son deeper shade among shadows across road beyond edge lamplight slid away dark without sound horse'

 'i found sir' put nob 'mr butterbur sent lantern went westgate back towards southgate nigh bill ferny's house thought could see something road swear looked two men stooping something lilting gave shout got spot signs mr brandybuck lying roadside seemed asleep "i thought fallen deep water" says shook queer soon roused got ran back like hare'
 'i afraid that's true' said merry 'though know said ugly dream can't remember went pieces know came me'
 'i do' said strider 'the black breath riders must left horses outside passed back southgate secret know news visited bill ferny probably southerner spy well something may happen night leave bree'

 strider gone frodo gave merry rapid account happened since supper merry still reading pondering gandalf's letter strider nob returned
 'well masters' said nob 'i've ruffled clothes put bolster middle bed made nice imitation head brown woollen mat mr bag � underhill sir' added grin

 early night frodo woke deep sleep suddenly sound presence disturbed saw strider sitting alert chair eyes gleamed light fire tended burning brightly made sign movement
 frodo soon went sleep dreams troubled noise wind galloping hoofs wind seemed curling round house shaking far heard horn blowing wildly opened eyes heard cock crowing lustily innyard strider drawn curtains pushed back shutters clang first grey light day room cold air coming open window
 soon strider roused led way bedrooms saw glad taken advice windows forced open swinging curtains flapping beds tossed bolsters slashed flung upon floor brown mat torn pieces
 strider immediately went fetch landlord poor mr butterbur looked sleepy frightened hardly closed eyes night said never heard sound
 'never thing happened time' cried raising hands horror 'guests unable sleep beds good bolsters ruined coming to'
 'dark times' said strider 'but present may left peace got rid us leave never mind breakfast drink bite standing shall packed minutes'
 mr butterbur hurried see ponies got ready fetch 'bite' soon came back dismay ponies vanished stabledoors opened night gone merry's ponies every horse beast place
 frodo crushed news could hope reach rivendell foot pursued mounted enemies might well set moon strider sat silent looking hobbits weighing strength courage
 'ponies would help us escape horsemen' said last thoughtfully guessed frodo mind 'we go much slower foot roads mean take going walk case food stores trouble cannot count getting anything eat rivendell except take us ought take plenty spare may delayed forced go roundabout far direct way much prepared carry backs'
 'as much must' said pippin sinking heart trying show tougher looked felt
 'i carry enough two' said sam defiantly
 'can't anything done mr butterbur' asked frodo 'can't get couple ponies village even one baggage suppose could hire might able buy them' added doubtfully wondering could afford
 'i doubt it' said landlord unhappily 'the two three ridingponies bree stabled yard they're gone animals horses ponies draught bree sale i'll i'll rout bob send round soon may be'
 'yes' said strider reluctantly 'you better afraid shall try get one pony least ends hope starting early slipping away quietly might well blown horn announce departure part plan doubt'
 'there one crumb comfort' said merry 'and crumb hope breakfast wait � sit let's get hold nob'

 end three hours' delay bob came back report horse pony got love money neighbourhood � except one bill ferny one might possibly sell 'a poor old halfstarved creature is' said bob 'but part less thrice worth seeing placed knows bill ferny'
 'bill ferny' said frodo 'isn't trick beast bolt back stuff help tracking us something'
 'i wonder' said strider 'but cannot imagine animal running home got away fancy afterthought kind master ferny's way increasing profits affair chief danger poor beast probably death's door seem choice want it'
 bill ferny's price twelve silver pennies indeed least three times pony's value pans proved bony underfed dispirited animal look like dying yet mr butterbur paid offered merry another eighteen pence compensation lost animals honest man welloff things reckoned bree thirty silver pennies sore blow cheated bill ferny made harder bear

 tramped anxious downhearted eyes crowd faces friendly words shouted strider seemed held awe breelanders stared shut mouths drew away walked front frodo next came merry pippin last came sam leading pony laden much baggage heart give already looked less dejected approved change fortunes sam chewing apple thoughtfully pocket full parting present nob bob 'apples walking pipe sitting' said 'but reckon i'll miss long'
 hobbits took notice inquisitive heads peeped doors popped walls fences passed drew near gate frodo saw dark illkept house behind thick hedge last house village one windows caught glimpse sallow face sly slanting eyes vanished
 'so that's southerner hiding' thought 'he looks half like goblin'
 hedge another man staring boldly heavy black brows dark scornful eyes large mouth curled sneer smoking short black pipe approached took mouth spat
 'morning longshanks' said 'off early found friends last' strider nodded answer 'morning little friends' said others 'i suppose know taken that's stickatnaught strider though i've heard names pretty watch tonight sammie go illtreating poor old pony pah' spat
 sam turned quickly 'and ferny' said 'put ugly face sight get hurt' sudden flick quick lightning apple left hand hit bill square nose ducked late curses came behind hedge 'waste good apple' said sam regretfully strode

 last left village behind escort children stragglers followed got tired turned back southgate passing kept along road miles bent left curving back eastward line rounded feet breehill began run swiftly downwards wooded country left could see houses hobbitholes staddle gentler southeastern slopes hill deep hollow away north road wisps rising smoke showed combe lay
 archet hidden trees beyond
 road run way left breehill standing tall brown behind came narrow track led towards north 'this leave open take cover' said strider
 'not "short cut" hope' said pippin 'our last short cut woods nearly ended disaster'
 'ah got then' laughed strider 'my cuts short long go wrong' took look road one sight led way quickly towards wooded valley
 plan far could understand without knowing country go towards archet first bear right pass east steer straight could wild lands weathertop hill way would went well cut great loop road bent southwards avoid midgewater marshes course would pass marshes strider's description encouraging
 however meanwhile walking unpleasant indeed disturbing events night would enjoyed pan journey better time sun shining clear hot woods valley still leafy full colour seemed peaceful wholesome strider guided confidently among many crossing paths although left would soon loss taking wandering course many turns doublings put pursuit
 'bill ferny watched left road certain' said 'though think follow us knows land round well enough knows match wood may tell others afraid suppose far away think made archet much better'

 whether strider's skill reason saw sign heard sound living thing day neither twofooted except birds fourfooted except one fox squirrels next day began steer steady course eastwards still quiet peaceful third day bree came chetwood land falling steadily ever since turned aside road entered wide flat expanse country much difficult manage far beyond borders breeland pathless wilderness drawing near midgewater marshes
 ground became damp places boggy came upon pools wide stretches reeds rushes filled warbling little hidden birds pick way carefully keep dryfooted proper course first made fanprogress went passage became slower dangerous marshes bewildering treacherous permanent trail even rangers find shifting quagmires flies began torment air full clouds tiny midges crept sleeves breeches hair
 'i eaten alive' cried pippin 'midgewater midges water'
 'what live can't get hobbit' asked sam scratching neck
 spent miserable day lonely unpleasant country campingplace damp cold uncomfortable biting insects would let sleep also abominable creatures haunting reeds tussocks sound evil relatives cricket thousands squeaked round _neekbreek breekneek_ unceasingly night hobbits nearly frantic
 next day fourth little better night almost comfortless though neekerbreekers sam called left behind midges still pursued
 frodo lay tired unable close eyes seemed far away came light eastern sky flashed faded many times dawn still hours
 'what light' said strider risen standing gazing ahead night
 'i know' strider answered 'it distant make like lightning leaps hilltops'
 frodo lay long could still see white flashes tall dark figure strider standing silent watchful last passed uneasy sleep

 gone far fifth day left last straggling pools reedbeds marshes behind land began steadily rise away distance eastward could see line hills highest right line little separated others conical top slightly flattened summit
 'that weathertop' said strider 'the old road left far away right runs south passes far foot might reach noon tomorrow go straight towards suppose better so'
 'what mean' asked frodo
 'i mean get certain shall find close road'
 'but surely hoping find gandalf there'
 'yes hope faint comes way may pass bree may know anyway unless luck arrive almost together shall miss one another safe us wait long riders fail find us wilderness likely make weathertop commands wide view round indeed many birds beasts country could see us stand hilltop birds trusted spies evil are'
 hobbits looked anxiously distant hills sam looked pale sky fearing see hawks eagles hovering bright unfriendly eyes 'you make feel uncomfortable lonesome strider' said
 'what advise us do' asked frodo
 'i think' answered strider slowly quite sure 'i think best thing go straight eastward make line hills weathertop strike path know runs feet bring us weathertop north less openly shall see shall see'

 day plodded along cold early evening came land became drier barren mists vapours lay behind marshes melancholy birds piping wailing round red sun sank slowly western shadows empty silence fell hobbits thought soft light sunset glancing cheerful windows bag end far away
 day's end came stream wandered hills lose stagnant marshland went along banks light lasted already night last halted made camp stunted aldertrees shores stream ahead loomed dusky sky bleak treeless backs hills night set watch strider seemed sleep moon waxing early nighthours cold grey light lay land
 next morning set soon sunrise frost air sky pale clear blue hobbits felt refreshed night unbroken sleep already getting used much walking short commons � shorter rate shire would thought barely enough keep legs pippin declared frodo looking twice hobbit
 'very odd' said frodo tightening belt 'considering actually good deal less hope thinning process go indefinitely shall become wraith'
 'do speak things' said strider quickly surprising earnestness

 hills drew nearer made undulating ridge often rising almost thousand feet falling low clefts passes leading eastern land beyond along crest ridge hobbits could see looked remains greengrown walls dikes clefts still stood ruins old works stone night reached feet westward slopes camped night fifth october six days bree
 morning found first time since left chetwood track plain see turned right followed southwards ran cunningly taking line seemed chosen keep much hidden possible view hilltops flats west dived dells hugged steep banks passed flatter open ground either side lines large boulders hewn stones screened travellers almost like hedge
 'i wonder made path for' said merry walked along one avenues stones unusually large closely set 'i sure like � well rather barrowwightish look barrow weathertop'
 'no barrow weathertop hills' answered strider 'the men west live though latter days defended hills evil came angmar path made serve forts along walls long first days north kingdom built great watchtower weathertop amon s�l called burned broken nothing remains tumbled ring like rough crown old hill's head yet tall fair told elendil stood watching coming gilgalad west days last alliance'
 hobbits gazed strider seemed learned old lore well ways wild 'who gilgalad' asked merry strider answer seemed lost thought suddenly low voice murmured

 gilgalad elvenking
 harpers sadly sing
 last whose realm fair free
 mountains sea

 sword long lance keen
 shining helm afar seen
 countless stars heaven's field
 mirrored silver shield

 long ago rode away
 dwelleth none say
 darkness fell star
 mordor shadows

 others turned amazement voice sam's
 'don't stop' said merry
 'that's know' stammered sam blushing 'i learned mr bilbo lad used tell tales like knowing always one hearing elves mr bilbo taught letters mighty booklearned dear old mr bilbo wrote _poetry_ wrote said'
 'he make up' said strider 'it pan lay called _the fall gilgalad_ ancient tongue bilbo must translated never knew that'
 'there lot more' said sam 'all mordor learn part gave shivers never thought going way myself'
 'going mordor' cried pippin 'i hope come that'
 'do speak name loudly' said strider

 already midday drew near southern end path saw pale clear light october sun greygreen bank leading like bridge northward slope hill decided make top daylight broad concealment longer possible could hope enemy spy observing nothing seen moving hill gandalf anywhere sign
 western flank weathertop found sheltered hollow bottom bowlshaped dell grassy sides left sam pippin pony packs luggage three went half hour's plodding climb strider reached crown hill frodo merry followed tired breathless last slope steep rocky
 top found strider said wide ring ancient stonework crumbling covered agelong grass centre cairn broken stones piled blackened fire turf burned roots within ring grass scorched shrivelled flames swept hilltop sign living thing
 standing upon rim ruined circle saw round wide prospect pan lands empty featureless except patches woodland away south beyond caught glint distant water beneath southern side ran like ribbon old road coming west winding faded behind ridge dark land east nothing moving following line eastward eyes saw mountains nearer foothills brown sombre
 behind stood taller shapes grey behind high white peaks glimmering among clouds
 'well are' said merry 'and cheerless uninviting looks water shelter sign gandalf blame waiting � ever came here'
 'i wonder' said strider looking round thoughtfully 'even day two behind us bree could arrived first ride swiftly need presses' suddenly stooped looked stone top cairn flatter others whiter escaped fire picked examined turning fingers "this handled recently' said 'what think marks'
 flat underside frodo saw scratches 'there seems stroke dot three strokes' said
 'the stroke left might grune thin branches' said strider 'it might sign left gandalf though one cannot sure scratches fine certainly look fresh marks might mean something quite different nothing us rangers use runes come sometimes'
 'what could mean even gandalf made them' asked merry
 'i say' answered strider 'that stood g3 sign gandalf october third three days ago would also show hurry danger hand time dare write anything longer plainer must wary'
 'i wish could feel sure made marks whatever may mean' said frodo 'it would great comfort know way front us behind us'
 'perhaps' said strider 'for believe danger scorching flames light saw three nights ago eastern sky comes back mind guess attacked hilltop result cannot tell longer must look make way rivendell best '
 'how far rivendell' asked merry gazing round wearily world looked wild wide weathertop
 'i know road ever measured miles beyond _forsaken inn_ day's journey east bree' answered strider 'some say far say otherwise strange road folk glad reach journey's end whether time long short know long would take feet fair weather ill fortune twelve days ford bruinen road crosses loudwater runs rivendell least fortnight's journey us think shall able use road'
 'a fortnight' said frodo 'a lot may happen time'
 'it may' said strider
 stood silent hilltop near southward edge lonely place frodo first time fully realized homelessness danger wished bitterly fortune left quiet beloved shire stared hateful road leading back westward � home suddenly aware two black specks moving slowly along going westward looking saw three others creeping eastward meet gave cry clutched strider's arm
 'look' said pointing downwards
 strider flung ground behind ruined circle pulling frodo beside merry threw alongside
 'what it' whispered
 'i know fear worst' answered strider
 slowly crawled edge ring peered cleft two jagged stones light longer bright clear morning faded clouds creeping east overtaken sun began go could see black specks neither frodo merry could make shapes certain yet something told far black riders assembling road beyond foot hill
 'yes' said strider whose keener sight left doubt 'the enemy here'
 hastily crept away slipped north side hill find companions

 sam peregrin idle explored small dell surrounding slopes far away found spring clear water hillside near footprints day two old dell found recent traces fire signs hasty camp fallen rocks edge dell nearest hill behind sam came upon small store firewood neatly stacked
 'i wonder old gandalf here' said pippin 'whoever put stuff meant come back seems'
 strider greatly interested discoveries 'i wish waited explored ground myself' said hurrying spring examine footprints
 'it feared' said came back 'sam pippin trampled soft ground marks spoilt confused rangers lately left firewood behind also several newer tracks made rangers least one set made day two ago heavy boots least one cannot certain think many booted feet' paused stood anxious thought
 hobbits saw mind vision cloaked booted riders horsemen already found dell sooner strider led somewhere else better sam viewed hollow great dislike heard news enemies road miles away
 'hadn't better clear quick mr strider' asked impatiently 'it getting late like hole makes heart sink somehow'
 'yes certainly must decide once' answered strider looking considering time weather 'well sam' said last 'i like place either cannot think anywhere better could reach nightfall least sight moment moved much likely seen spies could would go right way back north side line hills land much road watched cross tried take cover thickets away south north side road beyond hills country bare flat miles'
 'can riders _see'_ asked merry 'i mean seem usually used noses rather eyes smelling us smelling right word least daylight made us lie flat saw talk seen move'
 'i careless hilltop' answered strider 'i anxious find sign gandalf mistake three us go stand long black horses see riders use men creatures spies found bree see world light shapes cast shadows minds noon sun destroys dark perceive many signs forms hidden us feared times smell blood living things desiring hating senses sight smell feel presence � troubled hearts soon came saw feel keenly also' added voice sank whisper 'the ring draws them'
 'is escape then' said frodo looking round wildly 'if move shall seen hunted stay shall draw me'
 strider laid hand shoulder 'there still hope' said 'you alone let us take wood set ready fire sign little shelter defence fire shall serve sauron put fire evil uses things riders love fear wield fire friend wilderness'
 'maybe' muttered sam 'it also good way saying "here are" think bar shouting'
 lowest sheltered corner dell lit fire prepared meal shades evening began fall grew cold suddenly aware great hunger eaten anything since breakfast dared make frugal supper lands ahead empty save birds beasts unfriendly places deserted races world rangers passed times beyond hills stay wanderers rare evil sort trolls might stray times northern valleys misty mountains road would travellers found often dwarves hurrying along business help words spare strangers
 'i see food made last' said frodo 'we careful enough last days supper feast used ought two weeks still go perhaps more'
 'there food wild' said strider 'berry root herb skill hunter need need afraid starving winter comes gathering catching food long weary work need haste tighten belts think hope tables elrond's house'
 cold increased darkness came peering edge dell could see nothing grey land vanishing quickly shadow sky cleared slowly filled twinkling stars frodo companions huddled round fire wrapped every garment blanket possessed strider content single cloak sat little apart drawing thoughtfully pipe
 night fell light fire began shine brightly began tell tales keep minds fear knew many histories legends long ago elves men good evil deeds elder days wondered old learned lore
 'tell us gilgalad' said merry suddenly paused end story elfkingdoms 'do know old lay spoke of'
 'i indeed' answered strider 'so also frodo concerns us closely' merry pippin looked frodo staring fire
 'i know little gandalf told me' said frodo slowly 'gilgalad last great elfkings middleearth gilgalad _starlight_ tongue elendil elffriend went land of���'
 'no' said strider interrupting 'i think tale told servants enemy hand win house elrond may hear told full'
 'then tell us tale old days' begged sam 'a tale elves fading time would dearly like hear elves dark seems press round close'
 'i tell tale tin�viel' said strider 'in brief � long tale end known none except elrond remember aright told old fair tale though sad tales middleearth yet may lift hearts' silent time began speak chant softly

 leaves long grass green
 hemlockumbels tall fair
 glade light seen
 stars shadow shimmering
 tin�viel dancing
 music pipe unseen
 light stars hair
 raiment glimmering

 beren came mountains cold
 lost wandered leaves
 elvenriver rolled
 walked alone sorrowing
 peered hemlockleaves
 saw wander flowers gold
 upon mantle sleeves
 hair like shadow following

 enchantment healed weary feet
 hills doomed roam
 forth hastened strong fleet
 grasped moonbeams glistening
 woven woods elvenhome
 tightly fled dancing feet
 left lonely still roam
 silent forest listening

 heard oft flying sound
 feet light lindenleaves
 music welling underground
 hidden hollows quavering
 withered lay hemlocksheaves
 one one sighing sound
 whispering fell beechen leaves
 wintry woodland wavering

 sought ever wandering far
 leaves years thickly strewn
 light moon ray star
 frosty heavens shivering
 mantle glinted moon
 hilltop high far
 danced feet strewn
 mist silver quivering

 winter passed came
 song released sudden spring
 like rising lark falling rain
 melting water bubbling
 saw elvenflowers spring
 feet healed
 longed dance sing
 upon grass untroubling

 fled swift came
 tin�viel tin�viel
 called elvish name
 halted listening
 one moment stood spell
 voice laid beren came
 doom fell tin�viel
 arms lay glistening

 beren looked eyes
 within shadows hair
 trembling starlight skies
 saw mirrored shimmering
 tin�viel elvenfair
 immortal maiden elvenwise
 cast shadowy hair
 arms like silver glimmering

 long way fate bore
 o'er stony mountains cold grey
 halls iron darkling door
 woods nightshade morrowless
 sundering seas lay
 yet last met
 long ago passed away
 forest singing sorrowless

 strider sighed paused spoke 'that song' said 'in mode called _annthennath_ among elves hard render common speech rough echo tells meeting beren son barahir l�thien tin�viel beren mortal man l�thien daughter thingol king elves upon middleearth world young fairest maiden ever among children world stars mists northern lands loveliness face shining light days great enemy sauron mordor servant dwelt angband north elves west coming back middleearth made war upon regain silmarils stolen fathers men aided elves enemy victorious barahir slain beren escaping great peril came mountains terror hidden kingdom thingol forest neldoreth beheld l�thien singing dancing glade beside enchanted river esgalduin named tin�viel nightingale language old many sorrows befell afterwards parted long tin�viel rescued beren dungeons sauron together passed great dangers cast even great enemy throne took iron crown one three silmarils brightest jewels brideprice l�thien thingol father yet last beren slain wolf came gates angband died arms tin�viel chose mortality die world might follow sung met beyond sundering seas brief time walking alive green woods together passed long ago beyond confines world l�thien tin�viel alone elfkindred died indeed left world lost loved lineage elflords old descended among men live still l�thien foremother said line shall never fail elrond rivendell kin beren l�thien born dior thingol's heir elwing white e�rendil wedded sailed ship mists world seas heaven silmaril upon brow e�rendil came kings n�menor westernesse'
 strider speaking watched strange eager face dimly lit red glow woodfire eyes shone voice rich deep black starry sky suddenly pale light appeared crown weathertop behind waxing moon climbing slowly hill overshadowed stars hilltop faded
 story ended hobbits moved stretched 'look' said merry 'the moon rising must getting late'
 others looked even saw top hill something small dark glimmer moonrise perhaps large stone jutting rock shown pale light
 sam merry got walked away fire frodo pippin remained seated silence strider watching moonlight hill intently seemed quiet still frodo felt cold dread creeping heart strider longer speaking huddled closer fire moment sam came running back edge dell
 'i know is' said 'but suddenly felt afraid durstn't go outside dell money felt something creeping slope'
 'did _see_ anything' asked frodo springing feet
 'no sir saw nothing stop look'
 'i saw something' said merry 'or thought � away westwards moonlight falling flats beyond shadow hilltops _thought_ two three black shapes seemed moving way'
 'keep close fire faces outward' cried strider 'get longer sticks ready hands'
 breathless time sat silent alert backs turned woodfire gazing shadows encircled nothing happened sound movement night frodo stirred feeling must break silence longed shout aloud
 'hush' whispered strider 'what's that' gasped pippin moment
 lip little dell side away hill felt rather saw shadow rise one shadow one strained eyes shadows seemed grow soon could doubt
 three four tall black figures standing slope looking black seemed like black holes deep shade behind frodo thought heard faint hiss venomous breath felt thin piercing chill shapes slowly advanced
 terror overcame pippin merry threw flat ground sam shrank frodo's side frodo hardly less terrified companions quaking bitter cold terror swallowed sudden temptation put ring desire laid hold could think nothing else forget barrow message gandalf something seemed compelling disregard warnings longed yield hope escape anything either good bad simply felt must take ring put finger could speak felt sam looking knew master great trouble could turn towards shut eyes struggled resistance became unbearable last slowly drew chain slipped ring forefinger left hand

 frodo came still clutching ring desperately lying fire piled high burning brightly three companions bending 'what happened pale king' asked wildly overjoyed hear speak answer understand question length gathered sam seen nothing vague shadowy shapes coming towards suddenly horror sam found master vanished moment black shadow rushed past fell heard frodo's voice seemed come great distance earth crying strange words saw nothing stumbled body frodo lying dead face downwards grass sword beneath strider ordered pick lay near fire disappeared good ago
 sam plainly beginning doubts strider talking returned appearing suddenly shadows started sam drew sword stood frodo strider knelt swiftly side
 'i black rider sam' said gently 'nor league trying discover something movements found nothing cannot think gone attack feeling presence anywhere hand'
 heard frodo tell became full concern shook head sighed ordered pippin merry heat much water could small kettles bathe wound 'keep fire going well keep frodo warm' said got walked away called sam 'i think understand things better now' said low voice 'there seem five enemy know think expected resisted drawn time far fear come another night cannot escape waiting think purpose almost accomplished ring cannot fly much fear sam believe master deadly wound subdue shall see' sam choked tears 'don't despair' said strider 'you must trust frodo made sterner stuff guessed though gandalf hinted might prove slain think resist evil power wound longer enemies expect help heal guard well away' hurried disappeared darkness
 frodo dozed though pain wound slowly growing deadly chill spreading shoulder arm side friends watched warming bathing wound night passed slowly wearily dawn growing sky dell filling grey light strider last returned
 'look' cried stooping lifted ground black cloak lain hidden darkness foot lower hem slash 'this stroke frodo's sword' said 'the hurt enemy fear unharmed blades perish pierce dreadful king deadly name elbereth'
 'and deadly frodo this' stooped lifted long thin knife cold gleam strider raised saw near end edge notched point broken even held growing light gazed astonishment blade seemed melt vanished like smoke air leaving hilt strider's hand 'alas' cried 'it accursed knife gave wound skill healing match evil weapons can'
 sat ground taking daggerhilt laid knees sang slow song strange tongue setting aside turned frodo soft tone spoke words others could catch pouch belt drew long leaves plant
 'these leaves' said 'i walked far find plant grow bare hills thickets away south road found dark scent leaves' crushed leaf fingers gave sweet pungent fragrance 'it fortunate could find healing plant men west brought middleearth _athelas_ named grows sparsely near places dwelt camped old known north except wander wild great virtues wound healing powers may small'

 others discussing question quickly decided leave weathertop soon possible 'i think now' said strider 'that enemy watching place days gandalf ever came must forced ride away return case great peril dark since attack last night hardly meet greater danger wherever go'
 soon daylight full hurried food packed impossible frodo walk divided greater part baggage among four put frodo pony last days poor beast improved wonderfully already seemed fatter stronger begun show affection new masters especially sam bill ferny's treatment must hard journey wild seem much better former life
 started southerly direction would mean crossing road quickest way wooded country needed fuel strider said frodo must kept warm especially night fire would protection also plan shorten journey cutting across another great loop road east beyond weathertop changed course took wide bend northwards
 made way slowly cautiously round southwestern slopes hill came little edge road sign riders even hurrying across heard far away two cries cold voice calling cold voice answering trembling sprang forward made thickets lay ahead land sloped away southwards wild pathless bushes stunted trees grew dense patches wide barren spaces grass scanty coarse grey leaves thickets faded falling cheerless land journey slow gloomy spoke little trudged along frodo's heart grieved watched walking beside heads backs bowed burdens even strider seemed tired heavyhearted
 first day's march frodo's pain began grow speak long time four days passed without ground scene changing much except behind weathertop slowly sank distant mountains loomed little nearer yet since far cry seen heard sign enemy marked flight followed dreaded dark hours kept watch pairs night expecting time see black shapes stalking grey night dimly lit cloudveiled moon saw nothing heard sound sigh withered leaves grass feel sense present evil assailed attack dell seemed much hope riders already lost trail perhaps waiting make ambush narrow place
 end fifth day ground began rise slowly wide shallow valley descended strider turned course northeastwards sixth day reached top long slowclimbing slope saw far ahead huddle wooded hills away could see road sweeping round feet hills right grey river gleamed pale thin sunshine distance glimpsed yet another river stony valley halfveiled mist
 "i afraid must go back road while' said strider 'we come river hoarwell elves call mitheithel flows ettenmoors trollfells north rivendell joins loudwater away south call greyflood great water finds sea way sources ettenmoors except last bridge road crosses'
 'what river see far away there' asked merry
 'that loudwater bruinen rivendell' answered strider 'the road runs along edge hills many miles bridge ford bruinen yet thought shall cross water one river time shall fortunate indeed find last bridge held us'
 next day early morning came borders road sam strider went forward found sign travellers riders shadow hills rain strider judged fallen two days washed away footprints horseman passed since far could see
 hurried along speed could make mile two saw last bridge ahead bottom short steep slope dreaded see black figures waiting saw none strider made take cover thicket side road went forward explore
 long came hurrying back 'i see sign enemy' said 'and wonder much means found something strange'
 held hand showed single palegreen jewel 'i found mud middle bridge' said 'it beryl elfstone whether set let fall chance cannot say brings hope take sign may pass bridge beyond dare keep road without clearer token'
 went crossed bridge safety hearing sound water swirling three great arches mile came narrow ravine led away northwards steep lands left road strider turned aside soon lost sombre country dark trees winding among feet sullen hills
 hobbits glad leave cheerless lands perilous road behind new country seemed threatening unfriendly went forward hills steadily rose upon heights ridges caught glimpses ancient walls stone ruins towers ominous look frodo walking time gaze ahead think recalled bilbo's account journey threatening towers hills north road country near troll's wood first serious adventure happened frodo guessed region wondered chance would pass near spot
 'who lives land' asked 'and built towers trollcountry'
 'no' said strider 'trolls build one lives land men dwelt ages ago none remain became evil people legends tell fell shadow angmar destroyed war brought north kingdom end long ago hills forgotten though shadow still lies land'
 'where learn tales land empty forgetful' asked peregrin 'the birds beasts tell tales son'
 'the heirs elendil forget things past' said strider 'and many things tell remembered rivendell' 'have often rivendell' said frodo 'i have' said strider 'i dwelt still return may
 heart fate sit peace even fair house elrond'
 hills began shut road behind held way river bruinen hidden view travellers came long valley narrow deeply cloven dark silent trees old twisted roots hung cliffs piled behind mounting slopes pinewood
 hobbits grew weary advanced slowly pick way pathless country encumbered fallen trees tumbled rocks long could avoided climbing frodo's sake fact difficult find way narrow dales two days country weather turned wet wind began blow steadily west pour water distant seas dark heads hills fine drenching rain nightfall soaked camp cheerless could get fire burn next day hills rose still higher steeper forced turn away northwards course strider seemed getting anxious nearly ten days weathertop stock provisions beginning run low went raining
 night camped stony shelf rockwall behind shallow cave mere scoop cliff frodo restless cold wet made wound painful ever ache sense deadly chill took away sleep lay tossing turning listening fearfully stealthy nightnoises wind chinks rock water dripping crack sudden rattling fall loosened stone felt black shapes advancing smother sat saw nothing back strider sitting hunched smoking pipe watching lay passed uneasy dream walked grass garden shire seemed faint dim less clear tall black shadows stood looking hedge
 morning woke find rain stopped clouds still thick breaking pale strips blue appeared wind shifting start early immediately cold comfortless breakfast strider went alone telling others remain shelter cliff came back going climb could get look lie land
 returned reassuring 'we come far north' said 'and must find way turn back southwards keep going shall get ettendales far north rivendell trollcountry little known could perhaps find way come round rivendell north would take long know way food would last somehow must find ford bruinen'
 rest day spent scrambling rocky ground found passage two hills led valley running southeast direction wished take towards end day found road barred ridge high land dark edge sky broken many bare points like teeth blunted saw choice going back climbing
 decided attempt climb proved difficult long frodo obliged dismount struggle along foot even often despaired getting pony indeed finding path burdened light nearly gone exhausted last reached top climbed narrow saddle two higher points land fell steeply away short distance ahead frodo threw lay ground shivering left arm lifeless side shoulder felt icy claws laid upon trees rocks seemed shadowy dim
 'we cannot go further' said merry strider 'i afraid much frodo dreadfully anxious think able cure rivendell ever get there'
 'we shall see' answered strider 'there nothing wilderness chiefly wound anxious press agree go tonight'
 'what matter master' asked sam low voice looking appealingly strider 'his wound small already closed there's nothing seen cold white mark shoulder'
 'frodo touched weapons enemy' said strider 'and poison evil work beyond skill drive give hope sam'
 night cold high ridge lit small fire gnarled roots old pine hung shallow pit looked stone quarried sat huddled together wind blew chill pass heard treetops lower moaning sighing frodo lay half dream imagining endless dark wings sweeping wings rode pursuers sought hollows hills
 morning dawned bright fair air clean light pale clear rainwashed sky hearts encouraged hey longed sun warm cold stiff limbs soon light strider took merry went survey country height east pass sun risen shining brightly returned comforting news going less right direction went side ridge would mountains left way ahead strider caught glimpse loudwater knew though hidden view road ford far river lay side nearest
 'we must make road again' said 'we cannot hope find path hills whatever danger may beset road way ford'
 soon eaten set climbed slowly southern side ridge way much easier expected slope far less steep side long frodo able ride bill ferny's poor old pony developing unexpected talent picking path sparing rider many jolts possible spirits party rose even frodo felt better morning light every mist seemed obscure sight passed hands eyes
 pippin little ahead others suddenly turned round called 'there path here' cried
 came saw made mistake
 clearly beginnings path climbed many windings woods faded away hilltop behind places faint overgrown choked fallen stones trees one time seemed much used path made strong arms heavy feet old trees cut broken large rocks cloven heaved aside make way
 followed track offered much easiest way went cautiously anxiety increased came dark woods path grew plainer broader suddenly coming belt firtrees ran steeply slope turned sharply left round comer rocky shoulder hill came comer looked round saw path ran level strip face low cliff overhung trees stony wall door hanging crookedly ajar upon one great hinge
 outside door halted cave rockchamber behind gloom inside nothing could seen strider sam merry pushing strength managed open door little wider strider merry went go far floor lay many old bones nothing else seen near entrance except great empty jars broken pots
 'surely trollhole ever one' said pippin 'come two let us get away know made path better get quick'
 'there need think' said strider coining 'it certainly trollhole seems long forsaken think need afraid let us go warily shall see'
 path went door turning right across level space plunged thick wooded slope pippin liking show strider still afraid went ahead merry sam strider came behind one side frodo's pony path broad enough four five hobbits walk abreast gone far pippin came running back followed merry looked terrified
 'there _are_ trolls' pippin panted 'down clearing woods far got sight treetrunks large'
 'we come look them' said strider picking stick frodo said nothing sam looked scared
 sun high shone halfstripped branches trees lit clearing bright patches light halted suddenly edge peered treetrunks holding breath stood trolls three large trolls one stooping two stood staring
 strider walked forward unconcernedly 'get old stone' said broke stick upon stooping troll
 nothing happened gasp astonishment hobbits even frodo laughed 'well' said 'we forgetting family history must three caught gandalf quarrelling right way cook thirteen dwarves one hobbit'
 'i idea anywhere near place' said pippin knew story well bilbo frodo told often matter fact never half believed even looked stone trolls suspicion wondering magic might suddenly bring life
 'you forgetting family history ever knew trolls' said strider 'it broad daylight bright sun yet come back trying scare tale live trolls waiting us glade case might noticed one old bird's nest behind ear would unusual ornament live troll'
 laughed frodo felt spirits reviving reminder bilbo's first successful adventure heartening sun warm comforting mist eyes seemed lifting little rested time glade took midday meal right shadow trolls' large legs
 'won't somebody give us bit song sun high' said merry finished 'we song tale days'
 'not since weathertop' said frodo others looked 'don't worry me' added 'i feel much better think could sing perhaps sam could dig something memory'
 'come sam' said merry 'there's stored head let about'
 'i know that' said sam 'but would suit ain't call proper poetry understand bit nonsense old images brought mind' standing hands behind back school began sing old tune

 troll sat alone seat stone
 munched mumbled bare old bone
 many year gnawed near

 'for couple o' pins' says troll grins
 'i'll eat thee gnaw thy shins

 'well that's warning us all' laughed merry 'it well used stick hand strider'
 'where come sam' asked pippin 'i've never heard words before'
 sam muttered something inaudible 'it's head course' said frodo 'i learning lot sam gamgee journey first conspirator he's jester he'll end becoming wizard � warrior'
 'i hope not' said sam 'i want neither'

 afternoon went woods probably following track gandalf bilbo dwarves used many years miles came top high bank road point road left hoarwell far behind narrow valley clung close feet hills rolling winding eastward among woods heathercovered slopes towards ford mountains far bank strider pointed stone grass roughly cut much weathered could still seen dwarfrunes secret marks
 'there' said merry 'that must stone marked place trolls' gold hidden much left bilbo's share wonder frodo'
 frodo looked stone wished bilbo brought home treasure perilous less easy pan 'none all' said 'bilbo gave away told feel really came robbers'

 road lay quiet long shadows early evening sign travellers seen possible course take climbed bank turning left went fast could soon shoulder hills cut light fast westering sun cold wind flowed meet mountains ahead
 beginning look place road could camp night heard sound brought sudden fear back hearts noise hoofs behind looked back could see far many windings rollings road quickly could scrambled beaten way deep heather bilberry brushwood slopes came small patch thickgrowing hazels peered among bushes could see road faint grey failing light thirty feel sound hoofs drew nearer going fast light _clippetyclippelyclip_ faintly blown away breeze seemed catch dim ringing small bells tinkling
 'that sound like black rider's horse' said frodo listening intently hobbits agreed hopefully remained full suspicion fear pursuit long sound behind seemed ominous unfriendly strider leaning forward stooped ground hand ear look joy face
 light faded leaves bushes rustled softly clearer nearer bells jingled _clippetyclip_ came quick trotting feet suddenly view came white horse gleaming shadows running swiftly dusk headstall flickered flashed studded gems like living stars rider's cloak streamed behind hood thrown back golden hair flowed shimmering wind speed frodo appeared white light shining form raiment rider thin veil
 strider sprang hiding dashed towards road leaping cry heather even moved called rider reined horse halted looking towards thicket stood saw strider dismounted ran meet calling _ai na vedui d�nadan mae govannen_ speech clear ringing voice left doubt hearts rider elvenfolk others dwelt wide world voices fair hear seemed note haste fear call saw speaking quickly urgently strider
 soon strider beckoned hobbits left bushes hurried road 'this glorfindel dwells house elrond' said strider
 'hail well met last' said elflord frodo 'i sent rivendell look feared danger upon road'
 'then gandalf reached rivendell' cried frodo joyfully
 'no departed nine days ago' answered glorfindel 'elrond received news troubled kindred journeying land beyond baranduin learned things amiss sent messages swiftly could said nine abroad astray bearing great burden without guidance gandalf returned even rivendell ride openly nine elrond sent north west south thought might turn far aside avoid pursuit become lost wilderness
 'it lot take road came bridge mitheithel left token nigh seven days ago three servants sauron upon bridge withdrew pursued westward came also upon two others turned away southward since searched trail two days ago found followed bridge today marked descended hills come time news since must risk peril road go five behind us find trail upon road ride us like wind four may know fear may find ford already held us'
 glorfindel speaking shades evening deepened frodo felt great weariness come ever since sun began sink mist eyes darkened felt shadow coming faces friends pain assailed felt cold swayed clutching sam's arm
 'my master sick wounded' said sam angrily 'he can't go riding nightfall needs rest'
 glorfindel caught frodo sank ground taking gently arms looked face grave anxiety
 briefly strider told attack camp weathertop deadly knife drew hilt kept handed elf glorfindel shuddered took looked intently
 'there evil things written hilt' said 'though maybe eyes cannot see keep aragorn till reach house elrond wary handle little may alas wounds weapon beyond skill heal � urge go without rest'
 searched wound frodo's shoulder fingers face grew graver learned disquieted frodo felt chill lessen side arm little warmth crept shoulder hand pain grew easier dusk evening seemed grow lighter cloud withdrawn saw friends' faces clearly measure new hope strength returned
 'you shall ride horse' said glorfindel 'i shorten stirrups saddleskins must sit tight need fear horse let rider fall command bear pace light smooth danger presses near bear away speed even black steeds enemy cannot rival'
 'no not' said frodo 'i shall ride carried rivendell anywhere else leaving friends behind danger'
 glorfindel smiled 'i doubt much' said 'if friends would danger pursuit would follow leave us peace think frodo bear brings us peril'

 frodo answer persuaded mount glorfindel's white horse pony laden instead great part others' burdens marched lighter time made good speed hobbits began find hard keep swift tireless feet elf led mouth darkness still deep clouded night neither star moon grey dawn allow halt pippin merry sam time nearly asleep stumbling legs even strider seemed sag shoulders weary frodo sat upon horse dark dream
 cast heather yards roadside fell asleep immediately seemed hardly closed eyes glorfindel set watch slept awoke sun climbed far morning clouds mists night gone
 'drink this' said glorfindel pouring turn little liquor silverstudded flask leather clear spring water taste feel either cool warm mouth strength vigour seemed flow limbs drank eaten draught stale bread dried fruit left seemed satisfy hunger better many good breakfast shire done
 rested rather less five hours took road glorfindel still urged allowed two brief halts day's march way covered almost twenty miles nightfall came point road bent right ran towards bottom valley making straight bruinen far sign sound pursuit hobbits could see hear often glorfindel would halt listen moment lagged behind look anxiety clouded face twice spoke strider elftongue
 however anxious guides might plain hobbits could go night stumbling along dizzy weariness unable think anything feet legs frodo's pain redoubled day things faded shadows ghostly grey almost welcomed coming night world seemed less pale empty
 hobbits still weary set early next morning many miles yet go ford hobbled forward best pace could manage
 'our peril greatest ere reach river' said glorfindel 'for heart warns pursuit swift behind us danger may waiting ford'
 road still running steadily downhill places much grass either side hobbits walked could ease tired feet late afternoon came place road went suddenly dark shadow tall pinetrees plunged deep cutting steep moist walls red stone echoes ran along hurried forward seemed sound many footfalls following gate light road ran end tunnel open bottom sharp incline saw long flat mile beyond ford rivendell side steep brown bank threaded winding path behind tall mountains climbed shoulder shoulder peak beyond peak fading sky
 still echo following feet cutting behind rushing noise wind rising pouring branches pines one moment glorfindel turned listened sprang forward loud cry
 'fly' called 'fly enemy upon us'
 white horse leaped forward hobbits ran slope glorfindel strider followed rearguard half way across flat suddenly noise horses galloping gate trees left rode black rider reined horse halted swaying saddle another followed another two
 'ride forward ride' cried glorfindel frodo
 obey strange reluctance seized checking horse walk turned looked back riders seemed sit upon great steeds like threatening statues upon hill dark solid woods land receded mist suddenly knew heart silently commanding wait fear hatred awoke hand left bridle gripped hilt sword red flash drew
 'ride ride on' cried glorfindel loud clear called horse elftongue _noro lim noro lim asfaloth_
 white horse sprang away sped like wind along last lap road moment black horses leaped hill pursuit riders came terrible cry frodo heard filling woods horror eastfarthing far away answered dismay frodo friends trees rocks away left four riders came flying two rode towards frodo two galloped madly towards ford cut escape seemed run like wind grow swiftly larger darker courses converged
 frodo looked back moment shoulder could longer see friends riders behind falling back even great steeds match speed white elfhorse glorfindel looked forward hope faded seemed chance reaching ford cut others lain ambush could see clearly appeared cast aside hoods black cloaks robed white grey swords naked pale hands helms heads cold eyes glittered called fell voices
 fear filled frodo's mind thought longer sword cry came shut eyes clung horse's mane wind whistled ears bells upon harness rang wild shrill breath deadly cold pierced like spear last spurt like flash white fire elfhorse speeding wings passed right face foremost rider
 frodo heard splash water foamed feet felt quick heave surge horse left river struggled stony path climbing steep bank across ford
 pursuers close behind top bank horse halted turned neighing fiercely nine riders water's edge frodo's spirit quailed threat uplifted faces knew nothing would prevent crossing easily done felt useless try escape long uncertain path ford edge rivendell riders crossed case felt commanded urgently halt hatred stirred longer strength refuse
 suddenly foremost rider spurred horse forward checked water reared great effort frodo sat upright brandished sword
 'go back' cried 'go back land mordor follow ' voice sounded thin shrill ears riders halted frodo power bombadil enemies laughed harsh chilling laughter 'come back come back' called 'to mordor take you'
 'go back' whispered
 'the ring ring' cried deadly voices immediately leader urged horse forward water followed closely two others
 'by elbereth l�thien fair' said frodo last effort lifting sword 'you shall neither ring me'
 leader half across ford stood menacing stirrups raised hand frodo stricken dumb felt tongue cleave mouth heart labouring sword broke fell shaking hand elfhorse reared snorted foremost black horses almost set foot upon shore
 moment came roaring rushing noise loud waters rolling many stones dimly frodo saw river rise along course came plumed cavalry waves white flames seemed frodo flicker crests half fancied saw amid water white riders upon white horses frothing manes three riders still midst ford overwhelmed disappeared buried suddenly angry foam behind drew back dismay
 last failing senses frodo heard cries seemed saw beyond riders hesitated shore shining figure white light behind ran small shadowy forms waving flames flared red grey mist falling world
 black horses filled madness leaping forward terror bore riders rushing flood piercing cries drowned roaring river carried away frodo felt falling roaring confusion seemed rise engulf together enemies heard saw

 'i delayed' said gandalf `and nearly proved ruin yet sure may better so'
 'i wish would tell happened'

 'yes fortune fate helped you' said gandalf `not mention courage heart touched shoulder pierced resisted last terribly narrow shave speak gravest peril wore ring half wraithworld might seized could see could see you'
 `i know' said frodo `they terrible behold could see horses'
 `because real horses black robes real robes wear give shape nothingness dealings living'
 `then black horses endure riders animals terrified draw near even elfhorse glorfindel dogs howl geese scream them'
 `because horses born bred service dark lord mordor servants chattels wraiths orcs trolls wargs werewolves still many men warriors kings walk alive sun yet sway number growing daily'

 'i courage keep up' said frodo `but worried moment give news friends tell end affair ford keep asking shall content present shall another sleep think able close eyes finished story me'
 gandalf moved chair bedside took good look frodo colour come back face eyes clear fully awake aware smiling seemed little wrong wizard's eye faint change hint transparency especially left hand lay outside upon coverlet

 `you look splendid' said aloud `i risk brief tale without consulting elrond quite brief mind must sleep happened far gather riders made straight soon fled need guidance horses longer become visible already threshold world also ring drew friends sprang aside road would ridden knew nothing could save white horse could riders swift overtake many oppose foot even glorfindel aragorn together could stand nine
 `when ringwraiths swept friends ran behind close ford small hollow beside road masked stunted trees hastily kindled fire glorfindel knew flood would come riders tried cross would deal left side river moment flood appeared rushed followed aragorn others flaming brands caught fire water seeing elflord revealed wrath dismayed horses stricken madness three carried away first assault flood others hurled water horses overwhelmed'
 'and end black riders' asked frodo
 'no' said gandalf 'their horses must perished without crippled ringwraiths cannot easily destroyed however nothing fear present friends crossed flood passed found lying face top bank broken sword horse standing guard beside pale cold feared dead worse elrond's folk met carrying slowly towards rivendell'

 gl�in looked 'if heard think speak yet either master elrond summon us ere long believe shall hear many things much else may told'
 throughout rest meal talked together frodo listened spoke news shire apart ring seemed small faraway unimportant gl�in much tell events northern regions wilderland frodo learned grimbeorn old son beorn lord many sturdy men land mountains mirkwood neither orc wolf dared go

 length feast came end elrond arwen rose went hall company followed due order doors thrown open went across wide passage doors came hall tables bright fire burning great hearth carven pillars upon either side
 frodo found walking gandalf `this hall fire' said wizard `here hear many songs talesif keep awake except high days usually stands empty quiet people come wish peace thought always fire year round little light'
 elrond entered went towards seat prepared elvish minstrels began make sweet music slowly hall filled frodo looked delight upon many fair faces gathered together golden firelight played upon shimmered hair suddenly noticed far end fire small dark figure seated stool back propped pillar beside ground drinkingcup bread frodo wondered whether ill people ever ill rivendell unable come feast head seemed sunk sleep breast fold dark cloak drawn face
 elrond went forward stood beside silent figure 'awake little master said smile turning frodo beckoned 'now last hour come wished frodo' said `here friend long missed'
 dark figure raised head uncovered face
 `bilbo' cried frodo sudden recognition sprang forward
 `hullo frodo lad' said bilbo `so got last hoped would manage well well feasting honour hear hope enjoyed yourself'
 'why there' cried frodo `and allowed see before'

 elrond laughed `he shall found' said `then two shall go corner finish task hear judge end merrymaking' messengers sent find bilbo's friend though none knew present feast
 meanwhile frodo bilbo sat side side sam came quickly placed near talked together soft voices oblivious mirth music hall bilbo much say left hobbiton wandered aimlessly along road country either side somehow steered time towards rivendell `i got without much adventure' said `and rest went dwarves dale last journey travel old balin gone away came back done written book course make songs sing occasionally please think course really good enough rivendell listen think time seem pass remarkable place altogether
 `i hear kinds news mountains south hardly anything shire heard ring course gandalf often told great deal become closer ever last years d�nadan told fancy ring mine causing disturbance pity gandalf find sooner could brought thing long ago without much trouble thought several times going back hobbiton getting old would let gandalf elrond mean seemed think enemy looking high low would make mincemeat caught tottering wild
 'and gandalf said "the ring passed bilbo would good others tried meddle again" odd sort remark like gandalf said looking let things frightfully glad see safe sound' paused looked frodo doubtfully
 `have got here' asked whisper `i can't help feeling curious know i've heard much like peep again'
 `yes i've got it' answered frodo feeling strange reluctance `it looks ever did'
 `well like see moment' said bilbo
 dressed frodo found slept ring hung neck new chain light strong slowly drew bilbo put hand frodo quickly drew back ring distress amazement found longer looking bilbo shadow seemed fallen found eyeing little wrinkled creature hungry face bony groping hands felt desire strike
 music singing round seemed falter silence fell bilbo looked quickly frodo's face passed hand across eyes `i understand now' said `put away sorry sorry come burden sorry everything adventures ever end suppose someone else always carry story well can't helped wonder good trying finish book let's worry nowlet's real news tell shire'

 frodo hid ring away shadow passed leaving hardly shred memory light music rivendell bilbo smiled laughed happily every item news shire frodo could tellaided corrected samwas greatest interest felling least tree pranks smallest child hobbiton deep doings four farthings notice arrival man clad dark green cloth many minutes stood looking smile
 suddenly bilbo looked 'ah last d�nadan' cried
 `strider' said frodo `you seem lot names'
 `well _strider_ one heard anyway' said bilbo `what call for'
 `they call bree' said strider laughing 'and introduced him'

 `well dear fellow' said bilbo `now heard news can't spare moment want help something urgent elrond says song mine finished end evening stuck let's go corner polish up'
 strider smiled `come then' said `let hear it'

 frodo left sam fallen asleep alone felt rather forlorn` although folk rivendell gathered near silent intent upon music voices instruments gave heed anything else frodo began listen
 first beauty melodies interwoven words elventongues even though understood little` held spell soon began attend almost seemed words took shape visions far lands bright things never yet imagined opened firelit hall became like golden mist seas foam sighed upon margins world enchantment became dreamlike felt endless river swelling gold silver flowing multitudinous pattern comprehended became part throbbing air drenched drowned swiftly sank shining weight deep realm sleep
 wandered long dream music turned running water suddenly voice seemed voice bilbo chanting verses faint first clearer ran words

 bewildered enchanted ways
 beyond days mortal lands

 shadow lies frozen hills
 nether heats burning waste
 turned haste roving still
 starless waters far astray
 last came night naught

 shining shore light sought

 winds wrath came driving

 evernight back borne
 black roaring waves ran
 o'er leagues unlit foundered shores
 drowned days began
 heard strands pearl

 ever foaming billows roll
 yellow gold jewels wan
 saw mountain silent rise

 chanting ceased frodo opened eyes saw bilbo seated stool circle listeners smiling applauding
 `now better again' said elf
 bilbo got bowed `i flattered lindir' said 'but would tiring repeat all'
 'not tiring you' elves answered laughing 'you know never tired reciting verses really cannot answer question one hearing'
 `what' cried bilbo 'you can't tell parts mine d�nadan's'
 'it easy us tell difference two mortals' said elf
 'nonsense lindir' snorted bilbo 'if can't distinguish man hobbit judgement poorer imagined they're different peas apples'
 'maybe sheep sheep doubt appear different' laughed lindir `or shepherds mortals study business'
 'i argue you' said bilbo 'i sleepy much music singing i'll leave guess want to'
 got came towards frodo 'well that's over' said low voice `it went better expected often get asked second hearing think it'
 `i going try guess' said frodo smiling

 'i know' said frodo `it seemed fit somehow though can't explain half asleep began seemed follow something dreaming understand really speaking near end'
 `it _is_ difficult keep awake get used it' said bilbo 'not hobbits would ever acquire quite elvish appetite music poetry tales seem like much food going long time yet say slipping quiet talk'
 `can we' said frodo
 `of course merrymaking business come go like long make noise'

 got withdrew quietly shadows made doors sam left behind fast asleep still smile face spite delight bilbo's company frodo felt tug regret passed hall fire even stepped threshold single clear voice rose song

 frodo halted moment looking back elrond chair fire face like summerlight upon trees near sat lady arwen surprise frodo saw aragorn stood beside dark cloak thrown back seemed clad elvenmail star shone breast spoke together suddenly seemed frodo arwen turned towards light eyes fell afar pierced heart
 stood still enchanted sweet syllables elvish song fell like clear jewels blended word melody `it song elbereth' said bilbo `they sing songs blessed realm many times tonight come on'
 led frodo back little room opened gar dens looked south across ravine bruinen sat looking window bright stars steepclimbing woods talking softly spoke small news shire far away dark shadows perils encompassed fair things seen world together elves stars trees gentle fall bright year woods

 `and begging sam gamgee' replied bilbo `i guess mean time master went bed'

 `quite right sam' laughed bilbo `you trot tell gandalf gone bed good night frodo bless good see folk like hobbits real good talk getting old began wonder ever live see chapters story good night i'll take walk think look stars elbereth garden sleep well'


 _chapter 2_
 council elrond

 next day frodo woke early feeling refreshed well walked along terraces loudflowing bruinen watched pale cool sun rise far mountains shine slanting thin silver mist dew upon yellow leaves glimmering woven nets gossamer twinkled every bush sam walked beside saying nothing sniffing air looking every wonder eyes great heights east snow white upon peaks
 seat cut stone beside turn path came upon gandalf bilbo deep talk `hullo good morning' said bilbo `feel ready great council'
 `i feel ready anything' answered frodo `but like go walking today explore valley like get pinewoods there' pointed away far side rivendell north
 'you may chance later' said gandalf `but cannot make plans yet much hear decide today'
 suddenly talking single clear bell rang `that warning bell council elrond' cried gandalf `come along bilbo wanted'
 frodo bilbo followed wizard quickly along winding path back house behind uninvited moment forgotten trotted sam
 gandalf led porch frodo found friends evening light clear autumn morning glowing valley noise bubbling waters came foaming riverbed birds singing wholesome peace lay land frodo dangerous flight rumours darkness growing world outside already seemed memories troubled dream faces turned meet entered grave
 elrond several others seated silence frodo saw glorfindel gl�in corner alone strider sitting clad old travelworn clothes elrond drew frodo seat side presented company saying
 'here friends hobbit frodo son drogo ever come hither greater peril errand urgent'

 `here' said elrond turning gandalf `is boromir man south arrived grey morning seeks counsel bidden present questions answered'
 spoken debated council need told much said events world outside especially south wide lands east mountains things frodo already heard many rumours tale gl�in new dwarf spoke listened attentively appeared amid splendour works hand hearts dwarves lonely mountain troubled
 `it many years ago' said gl�in `that shadow disquiet fell upon people whence came first perceive words began whispered secret said hemmed narrow place greater wealth splendour would found wider world spoke moria mighty works fathers called tongue khazadd�m declared last power numbers return'
 gl�in sighed `moria moria wonder northern world deep delved woke nameless fear long vast mansions lain empty since children durin fled spoke longing yet dread dwarf dared pass doors khazadd�m many lives kings save thr�r perished last however balin listened whispers resolved go though d�in give leave willingly took ori �in many folk went away south
 "that nigh thirty years ago news seemed good messages reported moria entered great work begun silence word ever come moria since

 boromir looked doubtfully bowed head `so it' said `then gondor must trust weapons least wise ones guard ring fight mayhap swordthatwasbroken may still stem tide � hand wields inherited heirloom sinews kings men'
 `who tell' said aragorn `but put test one day'
 `may day long delayed' said boromir 'for though ask aid need would comfort us know others fought also means have'
 `then comforted' said elrond `for powers realms know hidden anduin great flows past many shores ere comes argonath gates gondor'
 'still might well all' said gl�in dwarf 'if strengths joined powers used league rings may less treacherous might used need seven lost us � balin found ring thr�r last naught heard since thr�r perished moria indeed may reveal partly hope find ring balin went away'
 `balin find ring moria' said gandalf `thr�r gave thr�in son thr�in thorin taken torment thr�in dungeons dol guldur came late'
 'ah alas' cried gl�in 'when day come revenge still three three rings elves mighty rings said elflords keep yet made dark lord long ago idle see elflords say'
 elves returned answer `did hear gl�in' said elrond `the three made sauron ever touch permitted speak much hour doubt may say idle made weapons war conquest power made desire strength domination hoarded wealth understanding making healing preserve things unstained things elves middleearth measure gained though sorrow wrought wield three turn undoing minds hearts become revealed sauron regains one would better three never purpose'
 `but would happen ruling ring destroyed counsel' asked gl�in
 'we know certain' answered elrond sadly `some hope three rings sauron never touched would become free rulers might heal hurts world wrought maybe one gone three fail many fair things fade forgotten belief'
 `yet elves willing endure chance' said glorfindel 'if power sauron may broken fear dominion taken away ever'
 'thus return destroying ring' said erestor `and yet come nearer strength finding fire made path despair folly would say long wisdom elrond forbid me'
 'despair folly' said gandalf `it despair despair see end beyond doubt wisdom recognize necessity courses weighed though folly may appear cling false hope well let folly cloak veil eyes enemy wise weighs things nicety scales malice measure knows desire desire power judges hearts heart thought enter refuse ring may seek destroy seek shall put reckoning'
 'at least while' said elrond `the road must trod hard neither strength wisdom carry us far upon quest may attempted weak much hope strong yet oft course deeds move wheels world small hands must eyes great elsewhere'


 'very well well master elrond' said bilbo suddenly 'say plain enough pointing bilbo silly hobbit started affair bilbo better finish comfortable getting book want know writing ending thought putting _and lived happily ever afterwards end days_ good ending none worse used shall alter look like coming true anyway evidently several chapters live write frightful nuisance ought start
 ' boromir looked surprise bilbo laughter died lips saw others regarded old hobbit grave respect gl�in smiled smile came old memories
 `of course dear bilbo' said gandalf `if really started affair might expected finish know well enough _starting_ great claim small part played great deeds hero need bow though word meant doubt jest making valiant offer one beyond strength bilbo cannot take thing back passed need advice longer say part ended unless recorder finish book leave ending unaltered still hope get ready write sequel come back'
 bilbo laughed `i never known give pleasant advice before' said `as unpleasant advice good wonder advice bad still suppose strength luck left deal ring grown tell mean _they_'
 `the messengers sent ring'
 `exactly seems council decide decide elves may thrive speech alone dwarves endure great weariness old hobbit miss meal noon can't think names put till dinner'


 one answered noonbell rang still one spoke frodo glanced faces turned council sat downcast eyes deep thought great dread fell awaiting pronouncement doom long foreseen vainly hoped might never spoken overwhelming longing rest remain peace bilbo's side rivendell filled heart last effort spoke wondered hear words using small voice
 `i take ring' said `though know way'


 elrond raised eyes looked frodo felt heart pierced sudden keenness glance `if understand aright heard' said `i think task appointed frodo find way one hour shirefolk arise quiet fields shake towers counsels great wise could foreseen wise expect know hour struck
 `but heavy burden heavy none could lay another lay take freely say choice right though mighty elffriends old hador h�rin t�rin beren assembled together seat among them'
 `but send alone surely master' cried sam unable contain longer jumping corner quietly sitting floor
 `no indeed' said elrond turning towards smile `you least shall go hardly possible separate even summoned secret council not'
 sam sat blushing muttering `a nice pickle landed mr frodo' said shaking head


 _chapter 3_
 ring goes south

 later day hobbits held meeting bilbo's room merry pippin indignant heard sam crept council chosen frodo's companion
 `it's unfair' said pippin `instead throwing clapping chains elrond goes rewards cheek'
 `rewards' said frodo 'i can't imagine severe punishment thinking saying condemned go hopeless journey reward yesterday dreamed task done could rest long perhaps good'
 'i wonder' said merry 'and wish could envying sam go punishment us left behind even rivendell come long way stiff times want go on'
 `that's meant' said pippin `we hobbits ought stick together shall go unless chain must someone intelligence party'
 'then certainly chosen peregrin took' said gandalf looking window near ground `but worrying unnecessarily nothing decided yet'
 `nothing decided' cried pippin 'then shut hours'
 "talking' said bilbo `there deal talk everyone eyeopener even old gandalf think legolas's bit news gollum caught even hop though passed off'
 `you wrong' said gandalf 'you inattentive already heard gwaihir want know real eyeopeners put frodo one surprised'
 `well anyway' said bilbo 'nothing decided beyond choosing poor frodo sam afraid time might come let ask elrond send fair number reports come started yet gandalf'
 'yes' said wizard `some scouts sent already go tomorrow elrond sending elves get touch rangers maybe thranduil's folk mirkwood aragorn gone elrond's sons shall scour lands round many long leagues move made cheer frodo probably make quite long stay here'
 'ah' said sam gloomily 'we'll wait long enough winter come'
 'that can't helped' said bilbo 'it's fault partly frodo lad insisting waiting birthday funny way honouring can't help thinking day chosen letting sbs bag end can't wait fill spring can't go till reports come back

 winter first begins bite
 stones crack frosty night
 pools black trees bare
 'tis evil wild fare

 afraid luck'
 'i afraid will' said gandalf 'we can't start found riders'
 `i thought destroyed flood' said merry
 'you cannot destroy ringwraiths like that' said gandalf `the power master stand fall hope unhorsed unmasked made less dangerous must find certain meantime try forget troubles frodo know anything help whisper ears someone said intelligence would needed party right think shall come you'
 great frodo's delight announcement gandalf left windowsill sitting took hat bowed 'i said _i think shall come_ count anything yet matter elrond much say friend strider reminds want see elrond must off'
 `how long think shall here' said frodo bilbo gandalf gone
 `oh know can't count days rivendell' said bilbo 'but quite long think many good talk helping book making start next thought ending'
 'yes several dark unpleasant' said frodo
 'oh do' said bilbo `books ought good endings would _and settled lived together happily ever after_'
 `it well ever comes that' said frodo
 'ah' said sam 'and live that's often wonder'
 hobbits continued talk think past journey perils lay ahead virtue land rivendell soon fear anxiety lifted minds future good ill forgotten ceased power present health hope grew strong content good day came taking pleasure every meal every word song
 days slipped away morning dawned bright fair evening followed cool clear autumn waning fast slowly golden light faded pale silver lingering leaves fell naked trees wind began blow chill misty mountains east hunter's moon waxed round night sky put flight lesser stars low south one star shone red every night moon waned shone brighter brighter frodo could see window deep heavens burning like watchful eye glared trees brink valley

 'eight nine accounted least' said gandalf 'it rash sure yet think may hope ringwraiths scattered obliged return best could master mordor empty shapeless
 `if time begin hunt course enemy servants journey way borders rivendell pick trail careful hard find must delay longer'
 elrond summoned hobbits looked gravely frodo 'the time come' said `if ring set must go soon go must count errand aided war force must pass domain enemy far aid still hold word frodo ringbearer'
 'i do' said frodo `i go sam'
 `then cannot help much even counsel' said elrond `i foresee little road task achieved know shadow crept feet mountains draws nigh even borders greyflood shadow dark meet many foes open disguised may find friends upon way least look send messages contrive know wide world perilous lands become may well miscarry come quicker

 'there remain two found' said elrond "these consider household may find seems good send'
 `but leave place us' cried pippin dismay `we want left behind want go frodo'
 `that understand cannot imagine lies ahead' said elrond
 `neither frodo' said gandalf unexpectedly supporting pippin 'nor us see clearly true hobbits understood danger would dare go would still wish go wish dared shamed unhappy think elrond matter would well trust rather friendship great wisdom even chose us elflord glorfindel could storm dark tower open road fire power him'
 `you speak gravely' said elrond `but doubt shire forebode free peril two thought send back messengers could according fashion country warn people danger case judge younger two peregrin took remain heart going'
 `then master elrond lock prison send home tied sack' said pippin `for otherwise shall follow company'

 last days hobbits sat together evening hall fire among many tales heard told full lay beren l�thien winning great jewel day merry pippin frodo sam found bilbo small room bilbo would read passages book still seemed incomplete scraps verses would take notes frodo's adventures
 morning last day frodo alone bilbo old hobbit pulled bed wooden box lifted lid fumbled inside
 'here sword' said 'but broken know took keep safe i've forgotten ask smiths could mend time thought perhaps would care know'
 took box small sword old shabby leathern scabbard drew polished welltended blade glittered suddenly cold bright 'this sting' said thrust little effort deep wooden beam `take like want expect'

 cold grey day near end december east wind streaming bare branches trees seething dark pines hills ragged clouds hurrying overhead dark low cheerless shadows early evening began fall company made ready set start dusk elrond counselled journey cover night often could far rivendell
 `you fear many eyes servants sauron' said 'i doubt news discomfiture riders already reached filled wrath soon spies foot wing abroad northern lands even sky must beware go way'
 company took little gear war hope secrecy battle aragorn and�ril weapon went forth clad rusty green brown ranger wilderness boromir long sword fashion like and�ril less lineage bore also shield warhorn
 'loud clear sounds valleys hills' said `and let foes gondor flee' putting lips blew blast echoes leapt rock rock heard voice rivendell sprang feet

 `maybe' said boromir 'but always let horn cry setting forth though thereafter may walk shadows go forth thief night'

 `that animal nearly talk' said `and would talk stayed much longer gave look plain mr pippin could speak let go sam i'll follow own' bill going beast burden yet member company seem depressed
 farewells said great hall fire waiting gandalf yet come house gleam firelight came open doors soft lights glowing many windows bilbo huddled cloak stood silent doorstep beside frodo aragorn sat head bowed knees elrond knew fully hour meant others could seen grey shapes darkness
 sam standing pony sucking teeth staring moodily gloom river roared stonily desire adventure lowest ebb
 `bill lad' said `you oughtn't took us could stayed et best hay till new grass comes' bill swished tail said nothing

 'rope' muttered `no rope last night said "sam bit rope want got it" well i'll want can't get now'

 moment elrond came gandalf called company 'this last word' said low voice 'the ringbearer setting quest mount doom alone charge laid neither cast away ring deliver servant enemy indeed let handle save members company council gravest need others go free companions help way may tarry come back turn aside paths chance allows go less easy withdraw yet oath bond laid go yet know strength hearts cannot foresee may meet upon road'
 `faithless says farewell road darkens' said gimli
 'maybe' said elrond `but let vow walk dark seen nightfall'
 'yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart' said gimli
 `or break it' said elrond `look far ahead go good hearts farewell may blessing elves men free folk go may stars shine upon faces'
 'good    good luck' cried bilbo stuttering cold 'i suppose able keep diary frodo lad shall expect full account get back long farewell'
 many others elrond's household stood shadows watched go bidding farewell soft voices laughter song music last turned away faded silently dusk
 crossed bridge wound slowly long steep paths led cloven vale rivendell came length high moor wind hissed heather one glance last homely house twinkling strode away far night

 ford bruinen left road turning southwards went narrow paths among folded lands purpose hold course west mountains many miles days country much rougher barren green vale great river wilderland side range going would slow hoped way escape notice unfriendly eyes spies sauron hitherto seldom seen empty country paths little known except people rivendell
 gandalf walked front went aragorn knew land even dark others file behind legolas whose eyes keen rearguard first part journey hard dreary frodo remembered little save wind many sunless days icy blast came mountains east garment seemed able keep searching fingers though company well clad seldom felt warm either moving rest slept uneasily middle day hollow land hidden tangled thornbushes grew thickets many places late afternoon roused watch took chief meal cold cheerless rule could seldom risk lighting fire evening went always nearly southward could find way
 first seemed hobbits although walked stumbled weary creeping forward like snails getting nowhere day land looked much day yet steadily mountains drawing nearer south rivendell rose ever higher bent westwards feet main range tumbled ever wider land bleak hills deep valleys filled turbulent waters paths winding led often edge sheer fall treacherous swamps

 fortnight way weather changed wind suddenly fell veered round south swiftflowing clouds lifted melted away sun came pale bright came cold clear dawn end long stumbling nightmarch travellers reached low ridge crowned ancient hollytrees whose greygreen trunks seemed built stone hills dark leaves shone berries glowed red light rising sun
 away south frodo could see dim shapes lofty mountains seemed stand across path company taking left high range rose three peaks tallest nearest stood like tooth tipped snow great bare northern precipice still largely shadow sunlight slanted upon glowed red
 gandalf stood frodo's side looked hand `we done well' said `we reached borders country men call hollin many elves lived happier days eregion name fiveandforty leagues crow flies come though many long miles feet walked land weather milder perhaps dangerous'
 `dangerous real sunrise mighty welcome' said frodo throwing back hood letting morning light fall face
 'but mountains ahead us' said pippin `we must turned eastwards night'
 'no' said gandalf 'but see ahead clear light beyond peaks range bends round southwest many maps elrond's house suppose never thought look them'
 `yes sometimes' said pippin `but remember frodo better head sort thing'
 `i need map' said gimli come legolas gazing strange light deep eyes `there land fathers worked old wrought image mountains many works metal stone many songs tales stand tall dreams baraz zirak shath�r
 `only seen afar waking life know names lies khazadd�m dwarrowdelf called black pit moria elvish tongue yonder stands barazinbar redhorn cruel caradhras beyond silvertine cloudyhead celebdil white fanuidhol grey call zirakzigil bundushath�r

 `it dimrill dale making' said gandalf `if climb pass called redhorn gate far side caradhras shall come dimrill stair deep vale dwarves lies mirrormere river silverlode rises icy springs'
 `dark water kheledz�ram' said gimli `and cold springs kibiln�la heart trembles thought may see soon'
 `may joy sight good dwarf l' said gandalf 'but whatever may least cannot stay valley must go silverlode secret woods great river '
 paused
 'yes then' asked merry
 'to end journey � end' said gandalf 'we cannot look far ahead let us glad first stage safely think rest today tonight well wholesome air hollin much evil must befall country wholly forgets elves dwelt there'
 'that true' said legolas `but elves land race strange us silvan folk trees grass remember hear stones lament _deep delved us fair wrought us high builded us gone_ gone sought havens long ago'

 morning lit fire deep hollow shrouded great bushes holly supperbreakfast merrier since set hurry bed afterwards expected night sleep mean go evening next day aragorn silent restless left company wandered ridge stood shadow tree looking southwards westwards head posed listening returned brink dell looked others laughing talking
 `what matter strider' merry called 'what looking miss east wind'
 'no indeed' answered `but miss something country hollin many seasons folk dwell many creatures live times especially birds yet things silent feel sound miles us voices seem make ground echo understand it'
 gandalf looked sudden interest `but guess reason' asked `is surprise seeing four hobbits mention rest us people seldom seen heard'
 `i hope it' answered aragorn `but sense watchfulness fear never before'
 "then must careful' said gandalf 'if bring ranger well pay attention especially ranger aragorn must stop talking aloud rest quietly set watch'

 sam's turn day take first watch aragorn joined others fell asleep silence grew even sam felt breathing sleepers could plainly heard swish pony's tail occasional movements feet became loud noises sam could hear joints creaking stirred dead silence around hung clear blue sky sun rode east away south dark patch appeared grew drove north like flying smoke wind
 `what's strider look like cloud' said sam whisper aragorn made answer gazing intently sky long sam could see approaching flocks birds flying great speed wheeling circling traversing land searching something steadily drawing nearer
 `lie flat still' hissed aragorn pulling sam shade hollybush whole regiment birds broken away suddenly main host came flying low straight towards ridge sam thought kind crow large size passed overhead dense throng shadow followed darkly ground one harsh croak heard
 dwindled distance north west sky clear would aragorn rise sprang went wakened gandalf
 `regiments black crows flying land mountains greyflood' said `and passed hollin natives _crebain_ fangorn dunland know possibly trouble away south fleeing think spying land also glimpsed many hawks flying high sky think ought move evening hollin longer wholesome us watched'
 `and case redhorn gate' said gandalf `and get without seen cannot imagine think must moving soon dark afraid right'
 `luckily fire made little smoke burned low _crebain_ came' said aragorn `it must put lit again'

 `well plague nuisance' said pippin news fire move night broken soon woke late afternoon 'all pack crows looked forward real good meal tonight something hot'
 `well go looking forward' said gandalf `there may many unexpected feasts ahead like pipe smoke comfort warmer feet however certain one thing rate get warmer get south'
 'too warm wonder' muttered sam frodo 'but i'm beginning think time got sight fiery mountain saw end road speak thought first redhorn whatever name might till gimli spoke piece fair jawcracker dwarflanguage must be' maps conveyed nothing sam's mind distances strange lands seemed vast quite reckoning
 day company remained hiding dark birds passed westering sun grew red disappeared southwards dusk company set turning half east steered course towards caradhras far away still glowed faintly red last light vanished sun one one white stars sprang forth sky faded
 guided aragorn struck good path looked frodo like remains ancient road broad well planned hollin mountainpass moon full rose mountains cast pale light shadows stones black many looked worked hands though lay tumbled ruinous bleak barren land
 cold chill hour first stir dawn moon low frodo looked sky suddenly saw felt shadow pass high stars moment faded flashed shivered
 `did see anything pass over' whispered gandalf ahead
 `no felt whatever was' answered `it may nothing wisp thin cloud'
 `it moving fast then' muttered aragorn `and wind'

 nothing happened night next morning dawned even brighter air chill already wind turning back towards east two nights marched climbing steadily ever slowly road wound hills mountains towered nearer nearer third morning caradhras rose mighty peak tipped snow like silver sheer naked sides dull red stained blood
 black look sky sun wan wind gone round northeast gandalf snuffed air looked back
 `winter deepens behind us' said quietly aragorn 'the heights away north whiter snow lying far shoulders tonight shall way high towards redhorn gate may well seen watchers narrow path waylaid evil weather may prove deadly enemy think course aragorn'
 frodo overheard words understood gandalf aragorn continuing debate begun long listened anxiously
 'i think good course beginning end know well gandalf' answered aragorn `and perils known unknown grow go must go good delaying passage mountains south passes till one comes gap rohan trust way since news saruman knows side marshals horselords serve'
 'who knows indeed' said gandalf `but another way pass caradhras dark secret way spoken of'
 'but let us speak yet say nothing others beg plain way'
 'we must decide go further' answered gandalf
 'then let us weigh matter minds others rest sleep' said aragorn

 late afternoon others finishing breakfast gandalf aragorn went aside together stood looking caradhras sides dark sullen head grey cloud frodo watched wondering way debate would go returned company gandalf spoke knew decided face weather high pass relieved could guess dark secret way mention seemed fill aragorn dismay frodo glad abandoned
 `from signs seen lately' said gandalf 'i fear redhorn gate may watched also doubts weather coming behind snow may come must go speed even take us two marches reach top pass dark come early evening must leave soon get ready'
 'i add word advice may' said boromir 'i born shadow white mountains know something journeys high places shall meet bitter cold worse come side help us keep secret frozen death leave still trees bushes us carry faggot wood large bear'
 'and bill could take bit lad' said sam pony looked mournfully
 'very well' said gandalf `but must use wood � unless choice fire death'

 company set good speed first soon way became steep difficult twisting climbing road many places almost disappeared blocked many fallen stones night grew deadly dark great clouds bitter wind swirled among rocks midnight climbed knees great mountains narrow path wound sheer wall cliffs left grim flanks caradhras towered invisible gloom right gulf darkness land fell suddenly deep ravine
 laboriously climbed sharp slope halted moment top frodo felt soft touch face put arm saw dim white flakes snow settling sleeve
 went long snow falling fast filling air swirling frodo's eyes dark bent shapes gandalf aragorn pace two ahead could hardly seen
 'i like all' panted sam behind 'snow's right fine morning like bed falling wish lot would go hobbiton folk might welcome there' except high moors northfarthing heavy fall rare shire regarded pleasant event chance fun living hobbit save bilbo could remember fell winter 1311 white wolves invaded shire frozen brandywine
 gandalf halted snow thick hood shoulders already ankledeep boots
 "this feared' said `what say aragorn'
 'that feared too' aragorn answered `but less things knew risk snow though seldom falls heavily far south save high mountains high yet still far paths usually open winter'
 'i wonder contrivance enemy' said boromir "they say land govern storms mountains shadow stand upon borders mordor strange powers many allies'
 'his arm grown long indeed' said gimli `if draw snow north trouble us three hundred leagues away'
 'his arm grown long' said gandalf

 halted wind died snow slackened almost ceased tramped gone furlong storm returned fresh fury wind whistled snow became blinding blizzard soon even boromir found hard keep going hobbits bent nearly double toiled along behind taller folk plain could go much snow continued frodo's feet felt like lead pippin dragging behind even gimli stout dwarf could grumbling trudged
 company halted suddenly come agreement without words spoken heard eerie noises darkness round may trick wind cracks gullies rocky wall sounds shrill cries wild howls laughter stones began fall mountainside whistling heads crashing path beside every heard dull rumble great boulder rolled hidden heights
 `we cannot go tonight' said boromir `let call wind fell voices air stones aimed us'
 `i call wind' said aragorn `but make say untrue many evil unfriendly things world little love go two legs yet league sauron purposes world longer he'
 'caradhras called cruel ill name said gimli `long years ago rumour sauron heard lands'
 `it matters little enemy cannot beat attack said gandalf
 'but do' cried pippin miserably leaning merry frodo shivering
 `either stop go back' said gandalf 'it good going little higher remember rightly path leaves cliff runs wide shallow trough bottom long hard slope shelter snow stones � anything else'
 `and good going back storm holds' said aragorn `we passed place way offered shelter cliffwall now'
 `shelter' muttered sam `if shelter one wall roof make house'

 company gathered together close cliff could faced southwards near bottom leaned little hoped would give protection northerly wind falling stones eddying blasts swirled round every side snow flowed ever denser clouds
 huddled together backs wall bill pony stood patiently dejectedly front hobbits screened little long drifting snow hocks went mounting larger companions hobbits would soon entirely buried
 great sleepiness came frodo felt sinking fast warm hazy dream thought fire heating toes shadows side hearth heard bilbo's voice speaking_ think much diary_ said _snowstorms january twelfth need come back report that_
 _but wanted rest sleep bilbo_ frodo answered effort felt shaken came back painfully wakefulness boromir lifted ground nest snow
 `this death halflings gandalf' said boromir `it useless sit snow goes heads must something save ourselves'
 `give this' said gandalf searching pack drawing leathern flask `just mouthful � us precious _miruvor_ cordial imladris elrond gave parting pass round'
 soon frodo swallowed little warm fragrant liquor felt new strength heart heavy drowsiness left limbs others also revived found fresh hope vigour snow relent whirled thicker ever wind blew louder
 'what say fire' asked boromir suddenly 'the choice seems near fire death gandalf doubtless shall hidden unfriendly eyes snow covered us help us'
 'you may make fire can' answered gandalf 'if watchers endure storm see us fire no' though brought wood kindlings advice boromir passed skill elf even dwarf strike flame would hold amid swirling wind catch wet fuel last reluctantly gandalf took hand picking faggot held aloft moment word command_ naur edraith ammen_ thrust end staff midst great spout green blue flame sprang wood flared sputtered
 `if see least revealed them' said 'i written _gandalf here_ signs read rivendell mouths anduin'
 company cared longer watchers unfriendly eyes hearts rejoiced see light fire wood burned merrily though round snow hissed pools slush crept feet warmed hands gladly blaze stood stooping circle round little dancing blowing flames red light tired anxious faces behind night like black wall
 wood burning fast snow still fell

 fire burned low last faggot thrown
 night getting old' said aragorn "the dawn far off'
 `if dawn pierce clouds' said gimli
 boromir stepped circle stared blackness 'the snow growing less' said `and wind quieter'
 frodo gazed wearily flakes still falling dark revealed white moment light dying fire long time could see sign slackening suddenly sleep beginning creep aware wind indeed fallen flakes becoming larger fewer slowly dim light began grow last snow stopped altogether
 light grew stronger showed silent shrouded world refuge white humps domes shapeless deeps beneath path trodden altogether lost heights hidden great clouds still heavy threat snow
 gimli looked shook head `caradhras forgiven us' said `he snow yet fling us go sooner go back better'
 agreed retreat difficult might well prove impossible paces ashes fire snow lay many feet deep higher heads hobbits places scooped piled wind great drifts cliff
 `if gandalf would go us bright flame might melt path you' said legolas storm troubled little alone company remained still light heart
 `if elves could fly mountains might fetch sun save us' answered gandalf `but must something work cannot burn snow'
 `well' said boromir `when heads loss bodies must serve say country strongest us must seek way see though snowclad path came turned shoulder rock yonder snow first began burden us could reach point maybe would prove easier beyond furlong guess'
 `then let us force path thither i' said aragorn
 aragorn tallest company boromir little less height broader heavier build led way aragorn followed slowly moved soon toiling heavily places snow breasthigh often boromir seemed bc swimming burrowing great arms rather walking
 legolas watched smile upon lips turned others `the strongest must seek way say say let ploughman plough choose otter swimming running light grass leaf snowan elf'
 sprang forth nimbly frodo noticed first time though long known elf boots wore light shoes always feet made little imprint snow
 'farewell' said gandalf `i go find sun' swift runner firm sand shot away quickly overtaking toiling men wave hand passed sped distance vanished round rocky turn

 others waited huddled together watching boromir aragorn dwindled black specks whiteness length passed sight time dragged clouds lowered flakes snow came curling
 hour maybe went though seemed far longer last saw legolas coming back time boromir aragorn reappeared round bend far behind came labouring slope
 `well' cried legolas ran `i brought sun walking blue fields south little wreath snow redhorn hillock troubles brought back gleam good hope doomed go feet greatest winddrift beyond turn strong men almost buried despaired returned told drift little wider wall side snow suddenly grows less white coverlet cool hobbit's toes'
 `ah said' growled gimli 'it ordinary storm ill caradhras love elves dwarves drift laid cut escape'
 'but happily caradhras forgotten men you' said boromir came moment `and doughty men may say though lesser men spades might served better still thrust lane drift may grateful cannot run light elves'
 `but get even cut drift' said pippin voicing thought hobbits
 'have hope' said boromir 'i weary still strength left aragorn bear little folk others doubt make shift tread path behind us come master peregrin begin you'
 lifted hobbit 'cling back shall need arms' said strode forward aragorn merry came behind pippin marvelled strength seeing passage already forced tool great limbs even burdened widening track followed thrusting snow aside went
 came length great drift flung across mountainpath like sheer sudden wall crest sharp shaped knives reared twice height boromir middle passage beaten rising falling like bridge far side merry pippin set waited legolas rest company arrive
 boromir returned carrying sam behind narrow welltrodden track came gandalf leading bill gimli perched among baggage last came aragorn carrying frodo passed lane hardly frodo touched ground deep rumble rolled fall stones slithering snow spray half blinded company crouched cliff air cleared saw path blocked behind

 _chapter 4_
 journey dark

 evening grey light waning fast halted night weary mountains veiled deepening dusk wind cold gandalf spared one mouthful miruvor rivendell eaten food called council
 'we cannot course go tonight' said `the attack redhorn gate tired us must rest while'
 `and go ' asked frodo
 'we still journey errand us' answered gandalf `we choice go return rivendell'
 pippin's face brightened visibly mere mention return rivendell merry sam looked hopefully aragorn boromir made sign frodo looked troubled
 `i wish back there' said `but return without shame � unless indeed way already defeated '
 `you right frodo' said gandalf `to go back admit defeat face worse defeat come go back ring must remain shall able set sooner later rivendell besieged brief bitter time destroyed ringwraiths deadly enemies shadows yet power terror would possess ruling ring master's hand again'
 'then must go way' said frodo sigh sam sank back gloom
 `there way may attempt' said gandalf `i thought beginning first considered journey try pleasant way spoken company aragorn pass mountains least tried'
 `if worse road redhorn gate must evil indeed' said merry `but better tell us let us know worst once'
 'the road speak leads mines moria' said gandalf gimli lifted head smouldering fire eyes others dread fell mention name even hobbits legend vague fear
 `the road may lead moria hope lead moria ' said aragorn darkly
 `it name ill omen' said boromir `nor see need go cannot cross mountains let us journey southwards come gap rohan men friendly people taking road followed way hither might pass cross isen langstrand lebennin come gondor regions nigh sea'
 'things changed since came north boromir' answered gandalf 'did hear told saruman may business ere ring must come near isengard means prevented gap rohan closed us go bearer
 'as longer road cannot afford time might spend year journey pass many lands empty harbourless yet would safe watchful eyes saruman enemy came north boromir enemy's eyes one stray wanderer south matter small concern mind busy pursuit ring return member ring's company peril long remain us danger increase every league go south naked sky
 `since open attempt mountainpass plight become desperate fear see little hope soon vanish sight cover trail therefore advise go neither mountains round road rate enemy least expect us take'
 `we know expects' said boromir `he may watch roads likely unlikely case enter moria would walk trap hardly better knocking gates dark tower name moria black'
 `you speak know liken moria stronghold sauron' answered gandalf `i alone ever dungeons dark lord older lesser dwelling dol guldur pass gates baradd�r return would lead moria hope coming orcs may prove ill us true orcs misty mountains scattered destroyed battle five armies eagles report orcs gathering afar hope moria still free
 `there even chance dwarves deep hall fathers balin son fundin may found however may prove one must tread path need chooses'
 'i tread path gandalf ' said gimli 'i go look halls durin whatever may wait thereif find doors shut'
 'good gimli ' said gandalf `you encourage seek hidden doors together come ruins dwarves dwarf's head less easy bewilder elves men hobbits yet first time moria sought long thr�in son thr�r lost passed came alive '
 `i passed dimrill gate' said aragorn quietly 'but though also came memory evil wish enter moria second time'
 'and wish enter even once' said pippin
 'nor me' muttered sam
 `of course ' said gandalf 'who would question follow lead '
 'i will' said gimli eagerly
 'i will' said aragorn heavily `you followed lead almost disaster snow said word blame follow lead � last warning move ring us others thinking gandalf say pass doors moria beware '
 `i _not_ go' said boromir 'not unless vote whole company legolas little folk say ringbearer's voice surely heard '
 'i wish go moria' said legolas
 hobbits said nothing sam looked frodo last frodo spoke `i wish go' said `but neither wish refuse advice gandalf beg vote slept gandalf get votes easier light morning cold gloom wind howls '
 words fell silent thought heard wind hissing among rocks trees howling wailing round empty spaces night
 suddenly aragorn leapt feet 'how wind howls ' cried 'it howling wolfvoices wargs come west mountains '
 'need wait morning ' said gandalf `it said hunt even live see dawn wish journey south night wild wolves trail '
 'how far moria ' asked boromir
 `there door southwest caradhras fifteen miles crow flies maybe twenty wolf runs' answered gandalf grimly
 'then let us start soon light tomorrow can' said boromir 'the wolf one hears worse orc one fears'
 `true' said aragorn loosening sword sheath `but warg howls also orc prowls'
 `i wish taken elrond's advice' muttered pippin sam `i good enough breed bandobras bullroarer howls freeze blood ever remember feeling wretched'
 'my heart's right toes mr pippin' said sam 'but etten yet stout folk us whatever may store old gandalf i'll wager wolf's belly'
 defence night company climbed top small hill sheltering crowned knot old twisted trees lay broken circle boulder stones midst lit fire hope darkness silence would keep trail discovery hunting packs
 round fire sat guard dozed uneasily poor bill pony trembled sweated stood howling wolves round sometimes nearer sometimes dead night many shining eyes seen peering brow hill advanced almost ring stones gap circle great dark wolfshape could seen halted gazing shuddering howl broke captain summoning pack assault
 gandalf stood strode forward holding staff aloft 'listen hound sauron ' cried `gandalf fly value foul skin shrivel tail snout come within ring'
 wolf snarled sprang towards great leap moment sharp twang legolas loosed bow hideous yell leaping shape thudded ground elvish arrow pierced throat watching eyes suddenly extinguished gandalf aragorn strode forward hill deserted hunting packs fled darkness grew silent cry came sighing wind
 night old westward waning moon setting gleaming fitfully breaking clouds suddenly frodo started sleep without warning storm howls broke fierce wild camp great host wargs gathered silently attacking every side
 `fling fuel fire' cried gandalf hobbits `draw blades stand back back'
 leaping light fresh wood blazed frodo saw many grey shapes spring ring stones followed throat one huge leader aragorn passed sword thrust great sweep boromir hewed head another beside gimli stood stout legs apart wielding dwarfaxe bow legolas singing
 wavering firelight gandalf seemed suddenly grow rose great menacing shape like monument ancient king stone set upon hill stooping like cloud lifted burning branch strode meet wolves gave back high air tossed blazing brand flared sudden white radiance like lightning voice rolled like thunder
 `_naur edraith ammen naur dan ngaurhoth_' cried
 roar crackle tree burst leaf bloom blinding flame fire leapt treetop treetop whole hill crowned dazzling light swords knives defenders shone flickered last arrow legolas kindled air flew plunged burning heart great wolfchieftain others fled
 slowly fire died till nothing left falling ash sparks bitter smoke curled burned treestumps blew darkly hill first light dawn came dimly sky enemies routed return
 `what tell mr pippin ' said sam she/thing sword `wolves get eyeopener mistake nearly singed hair head'
 full light morning came signs wolves found looked vain bodies dead trace fight remained charred trees arrows legolas lying hilltop undamaged save one point left
 `it feared' said gandalf `these ordinary wolves hunting food wilderness let us eat quickly go'
 day weather changed almost command power longer use snow since retreated pass power wished clear light things moved wild could seen far away wind turning north northwest night failed clouds vanished southwards sky opened high blue stood upon hillside ready depart pale sunlight gleamed mountaintops
 `we must reach doors sunset' said gandalf 'or fear shall reach far path may winding aragorn cannot guide us seldom walked country west wall moria long ago
 `there lies' said pointing away southeastwards mountains' sides fell sheer shadows feet distance could dimly seen line bare cliffs midst taller rest one great grey wall `when left pass led southwards back starting point may noticed well several miles less cross haste needed let us go '
 `i know hope' said boromir grimly `that gandalf find seeks coming cliff shall find gates lost ever choices seem ill caught wolves wall likeliest chance lead on'
 gimli walked ahead wizard's side eager come moria together led company back towards mountains road old moria west lain along course stream sirannon ran feet cliffs near doors stood either gandalf astray else land changed recent years strike stream looked find miles southwards start
 morning passing towards noon still company wandered scrambled barren country red stones nowhere could see gleam water hear sound bleak dry hearts sank saw living thing bird sky night would bring caught lost land none cared think
 suddenly gimli pressed ahead called back standing knoll pointing right hurrying saw deep narrow channel empty silent hardly trickle water flowed among brown redstained stones bed near side path much broken decayed wound way among ruined walls pavingstones ancient highroad
 'ah last ' said gandalf `this stream ran sirannon gatestream used call happened water cannot guess used swift noisy come must hurry late'
 company footsore tired trudged doggedly along rough winding track many miles sun turned noon began go west brief halt hasty meal went mountains frowned path lay deep trough land could see higher shoulders far eastward peaks
 length came sharp bend road veering southwards brink channel steep fall land left turned went due east rounding corner saw low cliff five fathoms high broken jagged top trickling water dripped wide cleft seemed carved fall strong full
 `indeed things changed ' said gandalf `but mistaking place remains stair falls remember right flight steps cut rock side main road wound away left climbed several loops level ground top used shallow valley beyond falls right walls moria sirannon flowed road beside let us go see things like '
 found stone steps without difficulty gimli sprang swiftly followed gandalf frodo reached top saw could go way reason drying gatestream revealed behind sinking sun filled cool western sky glimmering gold stretched dark still lake neither sky sunset reflected sullen surface sirannon dammed filled valley beyond ominous water reared vast cliffs stern faces pallid fading light final impassable sign gate entrance fissure crack could frodo see frowning stone
 `there walls moria' said gandalf pointing across water `and gate stood upon time elven door end road hollin come way blocked none company guess wish swim gloomy water end day unwholesome look'
 `we must find way round northern edge' said gimli `the first thing company climb main path see lead us even lake could get baggagepony stair'
 `but case cannot take poor beast mines' said gandalf `the road mountains dark road places narrow steep cannot tread even can'
 `poor old bill ' said frodo `i thought poor sam wonder say '
 `i sorry' said gandalf `poor bill useful companion goes heart turn adrift would travelled lighter brought animal least one sam fond way feared along obliged take road'
 day drawing end cold stars glinting sky high sunset company speed could climbed slopes reached side lake breadth looked two three furlongs widest point far stretched away southward could see failing light northern end half mile stood stony ridges enclosed valley water's edge rim open ground hurried forward still mile two go could reach point far shore gandalf making still find doors
 came northernmost corner lake found narrow creek barred way green stagnant thrust like slimy arm towards enclosing hills gimli strode forward undeterred found water shallow ankledeep edge behind walked file threading way care weedy pools sliding greasy stones footing treacherous frodo shuddered disgust touch dark unclean water feet
 sam last company led bill dry ground far side came soft sound swish followed plop fish disturbed still surface water turning quickly saw ripples blackedged shadow waning light great rings widening outwards point far lake bubbling noise silence dusk deepened last gleams sunset veiled cloud
 gandalf pressed great pace others followed quickly could reached strip dry land lake cliffs narrow often hardly dozen yards across encumbered fallen rock stones found way hugging cliff keeping far dark water might mile southwards along shore came upon holly trees stumps dead boughs rotting shallows remains seemed old thickets hedge lined road across drowned valley close cliff stood still strong living  two tall trees larger trees holly frodo ever seen imagined great roots spread wall water looming cliffs looked like mere bushes seen far top stair towered overhead stiff dark silent throwing deep nightshadows feet standing like sentinel pillars end road
 `well last ' said gandalf 'here elvenway hollin ended holly token people land planted mark end domain westdoor made chiefly use traffic lords moria happier days still close friendship times folk different race even dwarves elves'
 'it fault dwarves friendship waned' said gimli
 'i heard fault elves' said legolas
 'i heard both' said gandalf 'and give judgement beg two legolas gimli least friends help need doors shut hidden sooner find better night hand '
 turning others said 'while searching make ready enter mines fear must say farewell good beast burden must lay aside much stuff brought bitter weather need inside hope come journey south instead us must take share pony carried especially food waterskins'
 'but can't leave poor old bill behind forsaken place mr gandalf ' cried sam angry distressed `i that's flat come far '
 'i sorry sam' said wizard `but door opens think able drag bill inside long dark moria choose bill master'
 'he'd follow mr frodo dragon's den led him' protested sam `it'd nothing short murder turn loose wolves about'
 'it short murder hope' said gandalf laid hand pony's head spoke low voice `go words guard guiding you' said `you wise beast learned much rivendell make ways places find grass come time elrond's house wherever wish go
 `there sam quite much chance escaping wolves getting home have'
 sam stood sullenly pony returned answer bill seeming understand well going nuzzled putting nose sam's ear sam burst tears fumbled straps unlading pony's packs throwing ground others sorted goods making pile could left behind dividing rest
 done turned watch gandalf appeared done nothing standing two trees gazing blank wall cliff would bore hole eyes gimli wandering tapping stone axe legolas pressed rock listening
 'well ready' said merry `but doors can't see sign them'
 'dwarfdoors made seen shut' said gimli `they invisible masters cannot find open secret forgotten'
 'but door made secret known dwarves' said gandalf coming suddenly life turning round `unless things altogether changed eyes know look may discover signs'
 walked forward wall right shadow trees smooth space passed hands fro muttering words breath stepped back
 'look' said `can see anything now'
 moon shone upon grey face rock could see nothing else slowly surface wizard's hands passed faint lines appeared like slender veins silver running stone first pale gossamerthreads fine twinkled fitfully moon caught steadily grew broader clearer design could guessed


 top high gandalf could reach arch interlacing letters elvish character though threads places blurred broken outline could seen anvil hammer surmounted crown seven stars beneath two trees bearing crescent moons clearly else shone forth middle door single star many rays
 `there emblems durin' cried gimli
 `and tree high elves' said legolas
 `and star house f�anor' said gandalf `they wrought _ithildin_ mirrors starlight moonlight sleeps touched one speaks words long forgotten middleearth long since heard thought deeply could recall mind'
 'what writing say' asked frodo trying decipher inscription arch 'i thought knew elfletters cannot read these'
 `the words elventongue west middleearth elder days' answered gandalf 'but say anything importance us say _the doors durin lord moria speak friend enter_ underneath small faint written _i narvi made celebrimbor hollin drew signs_'
 `what mean _speak friend enter_' asked merry
 'that plain enough' said gimli `if friend speak password doors open enter'
 'yes' said gandalf 'these doors probably governed words dwarfgates open special times particular persons locks keys still needed necessary times words known doors key days durin secret usually stood open doorwards sat shut knew opening word could speak pass least recorded gimli '
 'it is' said dwarf `but word remembered narvi craft kindred vanished earth'
 'but _you_ know word gandalf ' asked boromir surprise
 `no ' said wizard
 others looked dismayed aragorn knew gandalf well remained silent unmoved
 'then use bringing us accursed spot' cried boromir glancing back shudder dark water `you told us passed mines could know enter '
 `the answer first question boromir' said wizard `is know wordyet shall soon see and' added glint eyes bristling brows 'you may ask use deeds proved useless question doubt tale wits left enter way came east
 `if wish know tell doors open outwards inside may thrust open hands outside nothing move save spell command cannot forced inwards'
 `what going ' asked pippin undaunted wizard's bristling brows
 `knock doors head peregrin took' said gandalf `but shatter allowed little peace foolish questions seek opening words
 `i knew every spell tongues elves men orcs ever used purpose still remember ten score without searching mind trials think needed shall call gimli words secret dwarftongue teach none opening words elvish like writing arch seems certain'
 stepped rock lightly touched staff silver star middle beneath sign anvil

 annon edhellen edro hi ammen
 fennas nogothrim lasto beth lammen

 said commanding voice silver lines faded blank grey stone stir
 many times repeated words different order varied tried spells one another speaking faster louder soft slow spoke many single words elvish speech nothing happened cliff towered night countless stars kindled wind blew cold doors stood fast
 gandalf approached wall lifting arms spoke tones command rising wrath _edro edro_ cried struck rock staff _open open_ shouted followed command every language ever spoken west middleearth threw staff ground sat silence
 moment far wind bore listening ears howling wolves bill pony started fear sam sprang side whispered softly
 'do let run away ' said boromir 'it seems shall need still wolves find us hate foul pool ' stooped picking large stone cast far dark water
 stone vanished soft slap instant swish bubble great rippling rings formed surface beyond stone fallen moved slowly towards foot cliff
 'why boromir ' said frodo `i hate place afraid know wolves dark behind doors something else afraid pool disturb '
 'l wish could get away ' said merry
 'why gandalf something quick ' said pippin
 gandalf took notice sat head bowed either despair anxious thought mournful howling wolves heard ripples water grew came closer already lapping shore
 suddenness startled wizard sprang feet laughing `i ' cried 'of course course absurdly simple like riddles see answer'
 picking staff stood rock said clear voice _mellon_
 star shone briefly faded silently great doorway outlined though crack joint visible slowly divided middle swung outwards inch inch doors lay back wall opening shadowy stair could seen climbing steeply beyond lower steps darkness deeper night company stared wonder
 `i wrong all' said gandalf 'and gimli merry people right track opening word inscribed archway time translation _say "friend" enter_ speak elvish word _friend_ doors opened quite simple simple learned loremaster suspicious days happier times let us go'
 strode forward set foot lowest step moment several things happened frodo felt something seize ankle fell cry bill pony gave wild neigh fear turned tail dashed away along lakeside darkness sam leaped hearing frodo's cry ran back weeping cursing others swung round saw waters lake seething host snakes swimming southern end
 water long sinuous tentacle crawled palegreen luminous wet fingered end hold frodo's foot dragging water sam knees slashing knife
 arm let go frodo sam pulled away crying help twenty others arms came rippling dark water boiled hideous stench
 `into gateway stairs quick ' shouted gandalf leaping back rousing horror seemed rooted sam ground stood drove forward
 time sam frodo steps gandalf begun climb groping tentacles writhed across narrow shore fingered cliffwall doors one came wriggling threshold glistening starlight gandalf turned paused considering word would close gate within need many coiling arms seized doors either side horrible strength swung round shattering echo slammed light lost noise rending crashing came dully ponderous stone
 sam clinging frodo's arm collapsed step black darkness `poor old bill ' said choking voice `poor old bill wolves snakes snakes much choose mr frodo come you'
 heard gandalf go back steps thrust staff doors quiver stone stairs trembled doors open `well well ' said wizard `the passage blocked behind us one way out�on side mountains fear sounds boulders piled trees uprooted thrown across gate sorry trees beautiful stood long'
 `i felt something horrible near moment foot first touched water' said frodo 'what thing many '
 'i know' answered gandalf 'but arms guided one purpose something crept driven dark waters mountains older fouler things orcs deep places world' speak aloud thought whatever dwelt lake seized frodo first among company
 boromir muttered breath echoing stone magnified sound hoarse whisper could hear `in deep places world thither going wish lead us deadly dark '
 'i will' said gandalf 'and gimli shall walk follow staff '
 wizard passed ahead great steps held staff aloft tip came faint radiance wide stairway sound undamaged two hundred steps counted broad shallow top found arched passage level floor leading dark
 `let us sit rest something eat landing since can't find diningroom ' said frodo begun shake terror clutching arm suddenly felt extremely hungry
 proposal welcomed sat upper steps dim figures gloom eaten gandalf gave third sip miruvor rivendell
 `it last much longer afraid' said 'but think need horror gate unless great luck shall need left see side go carefully water many streams wells mines touched may chance filling skins bottles till come dimrill dale'
 'how long going take us ' asked frodo
 'i cannot say' answered gandalf 'it depends many chances going straight without mishap losing way shall take three four marches expect cannot less forty miles westdoor eastgate direct line road may wind much'
 brief rest started way eager get journey quickly possible willing tired go marching still several hours gandalf walked front left hand held glimmering staff light showed ground feet right held sword glamdring behind came gimli eyes glinting dim light turned head side side behind dwarf walked frodo drawn short sword sting gleam came blades sting glamdring comfort work elvish smiths elder days swords shone cold light orcs near hand behind frodo went sam legolas young hobbits boromir dark rear grim silent walked aragorn
 passage twisted round turns began descend went steadily long became level air grew hot stifling foul times felt currents cooler air upon faces issuing halfguessed openings walls many pale ray wizard's staff frodo caught glimpses stairs arches passages tunnels sloping running steeply opening blankly dark either side bewildering beyond hope remembering
 gimli aided gandalf little except stout courage least others troubled mere darkness often wizard consulted points choice way doubtful always gandalf final word mines moria vast intricate beyond imagination gimli gl�in's son dwarf mountainrace though gandalf faroff memories journey long little help even gloom despite windings road knew whither wished go falter long path led towards goal
 `do afraid ' said aragorn pause longer usual gandalf gimli whispering together others crowded behind waiting anxiously `do afraid many journey never one dark tales rivendell greater deeds seen go astrayif path find led us fears lead us whatever cost surer finding way home blind night cats queen ber�thiel'
 well company guide fuel means making torches desperate scramble doors many things left behind without light would soon come grief many roads choose also many places holes pitfalls dark wells beside path passing feet echoed fissures chasms walls floor every crack would open right feet widest seven feet across long pippin could summon enough courage leap dreadful gap noise churning water came far great millwheel turning depths
 `rope ' muttered sam `i knew i'd want got '
 dangers became frequent march became slower already seemed tramping endlessly mountains' roots weary yet seemed comfort thought halting anywhere frodo's spirits risen escape food draught cordial deep uneasiness growing dread crept though healed rivendell knifestroke grim wound without effect senses sharper aware things could seen one sign change soon noticed could see dark companions save perhaps gandalf case bearer ring hung upon chain breast whiles seemed heavy weight felt certainty evil ahead evil following said nothing gripped tighter hilt sword went doggedly
 company behind spoke seldom hurried whispers sound sound feet dull stump gimli's dwarfboots heavy tread boromir light step legolas soft scarceheard patter hobbitfeet rear slow firm footfalls aragorn long stride halted moment heard nothing unless occasionally faint trickle drip unseen water yet frodo began hear imagine heard something else like faint fall soft bare feet never loud enough near enough feel certain heard started never stopped company moving echo halted pattered little grew still
 nightfall entered mines going several hours brief halts gandalf came first serious check stood wide dark arch opening three passages led general direction eastwards lefthand passage plunged righthand climbed middle way seemed run smooth level narrow
 'i memory place ' said gandalf standing uncertainly arch held staff hope finding marks inscription might help choice nothing kind seen `i weary decide' said shaking head `and expect weary wearier better halt left night know mean ever dark outside late moon riding westward middlenight passed'
 `poor old bill ' said sam 'i wonder hope wolves got yet'
 left great arch found stone door half closed swung back easily gentle thrust beyond seemed lie wide chamber cut rock
 `steady steady ' cried gandalf merry pippin pushed forward glad find place could rest least feeling shelter open passage `steady know inside yet go first'
 went cautiously others filed behind `there ' said pointing staff middle floor feet saw large round hole like mouth well broken rusty chains lay edge trailed black pit fragments stone lay near
 'one might fallen still wondering going strike bottom' said aragorn merry 'let guide go first one'
 'this seems guardroom made watching three passages' said gimli `that hole plainly well guards' use covered stone lid lid broken must take care dark'
 pippin felt curiously attracted well others unrolling blankets making beds walls chamber far possible hole floor crept edge peered chill air seemed strike face rising invisible depths moved sudden impulse groped loose stone let drop felt heart beat many times sound far stone fallen deep water cavernous place came _plunk_ distant magnified repeated hollow shaft
 `what's ' cried gandalf relieved pippin confessed done angry pippin could see eye glinting 'fool took ' growled 'this serious journey hobbit walkingparty throw next time nuisance quiet '
 nothing heard several minutes came depths faint knocks _tomtap taptom_ stopped echoes died away repeated _taptom tomtap taptap tom_ sounded disquietingly like signals sort knocking died away heard
 'that sound hammer never heard one' said gimli
 `yes' said gandalf 'and like may nothing peregrin's foolish stone probably something disturbed would better left quiet pray nothing kind let us hope shall get rest without trouble pippin go first watch reward' growled rolled blanket
 pippin sat miserably door pitch dark kept turning round fearing unknown thing would crawl well wished could cover hole blanket dared move go near even though gandalf seemed asleep
 actually gandalf awake though lying still silent deep thought trying recall every memory former journey mines considering anxiously next course take false turn might disastrous hour rose came pippin
 `get corner sleep lad' said kindly tone 'you want sleep expect cannot get wink may well watching'
 'i know matter me' muttered sat door 'i need smoke tasted since morning snowstorm'
 last thing pippin saw sleep took dark glimpse old wizard huddled floor shielding glowing chip gnarled hands knees flicker moment showed sharp nose puff smoke
 gandalf roused sleep sat watched alone six hours let others rest `and watches made mind' said `i like feel middle way like smell lefthand way foul air guide shall take righthand passage time began climb again'
 eight dark hours counting two brief halts marched met danger heard nothing saw nothing faint gleam wizard's light bobbing like willo'thewisp front passage chosen wound steadily upwards far could judge went great mounting curves rose grew loftier wider openings galleries tunnels either side floor level sound without pits cracks evidently struck important road went forward quicker done first march
 way advanced fifteen miles measured direct line east though must actually walked twenty miles road climbed upwards` frodo's spirits rose little still felt oppressed still times heard thought heard away behind company beyond fall patter feet following footstep echo
 marched far hobbits could endure without rest thinking place could sleep suddenly walls right left vanished seemed passed arched doorway black empty space great draught warmer air behind darkness cold faces halted crowded anxiously together
 gandalf seemed pleased `i chose right way' said `at last coming habitable parts guess far eastern side high good deal higher dimrill gate unless mistaken feeling air must wide hall risk little real light'
 raised staff brief instant blaze like flash lightning great shadows sprang fled second saw vast roof far heads upheld many mighty pillars hewn stone either side stretched huge empty hall black walls polished smooth glass flashed glittered three entrances saw dark black arches one straight eastwards one either side light went
 `that shall venture present' said gandalf 'there used great windows mountainside shafts leading light upper reaches mines think reached night outside cannot tell morning right tomorrow may actually see morning peeping meanwhile better go let us rest things gone well far greater part dark road yet long way gates open world'
 company spent night great cavernous hall huddled close together corner escape draught seemed steady inflow chill air eastern archway lay hung darkness hollow immense oppressed loneliness vastness dolven halls endlessly branching stairs passages wildest imaginings dark rumour ever suggested hobbits fell altogether short actual dread wonder moria
 `there must mighty crowd dwarves one time ' said sam `and every one busier badgers five hundred years make hard rock live darksome holes surely '
 `these holes' said gimli `this great realm city dwarrowdelf old darksome full light splendour still remembered songs'

 `i like ' said sam `i like learn _in moria khazadd�m_ makes darkness seem heavier thinking lamps piles jewels gold lying still '
 gimli silent sung song would say
 `piles jewels ' said gandalf `no orcs often plundered moria nothing left upper halls since dwarves fled one dares seek shafts treasuries deep places drowned water�or shadow fear'
 `then dwarves want come back ' asked sam
 'for _mithril_' answered gandalf `the wealth moria gold jewels toys dwarves iron servant things found true especially iron need delve things desired could obtain traffic alone world found moriasilver truesilver called _mithril_ elvish name dwarves name tell worth ten times gold beyond price little left ground even orcs dare delve lodes lead away north towards caradhras darkness dwarves tell tale even _mithril_ foundation wealth also destruction delved greedily deep disturbed fled durin's bane brought light orcs gathered nearly given tribute sauron covets

 `what ' cried gimli startled silence `a corslet moriasilver kingly gift '
 'yes' said gandalf `i never told worth greater value whole shire everything it'
 frodo said nothing put hand tunic touched rings mailshirt felt staggered think walking price shire jacket bilbo known felt doubt bilbo knew quite well indeed kingly gift thoughts carried away dark mines rivendell bilbo bag end days bilbo still wished heart back days mowing lawn pottering among flowers never heard moria _mithril _or ring
 deep silence fell one one others fell asleep frodo guard breath came unseen doors deep places dread came hands cold brow damp listened mind given listening nothing else two slow hours heard sound even imagined echo footfall
 watch nearly far guessed western archway stood fancied could see two pale points light almost like luminous eyes started head nodded `i must nearly fallen asleep guard' thought `i edge dream' stood rubbed eyes remained standing peering dark relieved legolas
 lay quickly went sleep seemed dream went heard whispers saw two pale points light approaching slowly woke found others speaking softly near dim light falling face high eastern archway shaft near roof came long pale gleam across hall northern arch light also glimmered faint distantly
 frodo sat `good morning ' said gandalf `for morning last right see high east side moria today ought find great gates see waters mirrormere lying dimrill dale us'
 'i shall glad' said gimli `i looked moria great become dark dreadful found sign kindred doubt balin ever came here'
 breakfasted gandalf decided go `we tired shall rest better outside' said `i think none us wish spend another night moria'
 `no indeed ' said boromir `which way shall take yonder eastward arch '
 'maybe' said gandalf `but du know yet exactly unless quite astray guess north great gates may easy find right road eastern arch probably prove way must take make minds ought look us let us go towards light north door could find window would help fear light comes deep shafts'
 following lead company passed northern arch found wide corridor went along glimmer grew stronger saw came doorway right high flattopped stone door still upon hinges standing half open beyond large square chamber dimly lit eyes long time dark seemed dazzlingly bright blinked entered
 feet disturbed deep dust upon floor stumbled among things lying doorway whose shapes could first make chamber lit wide shaft high eastern wall slanted upwards far small square patch blue sky could seen light shaft fell directly table middle room single oblong block two feet high upon laid great slab white stone
 `it looks like tomb' muttered frodo bent forwards curious sense foreboding look closely gandalf came quickly side slab runes deeply graven

 'these daeron's runes used old moria' said gandalf 'here written tongues men dwarves
 balin son fundin
 lord moria'

 'he dead then' said frodo `i feared so' gimli cast hood face

 company ring stood silent beside tomb balin frodo thought bilbo long friendship dwarf balin's visit shire long ago dusty chamber mountains seemed thousand years ago side world
 length stirred looked began search anything would give tidings balin's fate show become folk another smaller door side chamber shaft doors could see many bones lying among broken swords axeheads cloven shields helms swords crooked orcscimitars blackened blades
 many recesses cut rock walls large ironbound chests wood broken plundered beside shattered lid one lay remains book slashed stabbed partly burned stained black dark marks like old blood little could read gandalf lifted carefully leaves crackled broke laid slab pored time without speaking frodo gimli standing side could see gingerly turned leaves written many different hands runes moria dale elvish script
 last gandalf looked 'it seems record fortunes balin's folk' said `i guess began coming dimrill dale nigh thirty years ago pages seem numbers referring years arrival top page marked _one � three_ least two missing beginning listen

 sudden dread horror chamber fell company `_we cannot get out_' muttered gimli 'it well us pool sunk little watcher sleeping southern end'
 gandalf raised head looked round `they seem made last stand doors' said 'but many left time ended attempt retake moria valiant foolish time come yet fear must say farewell balin son fundin must lie halls fathers take book book mazarbul look closely later better keep gimli take back d�in get chance interest though grieve deeply come let us go morning passing'
 'which way shall go ' asked boromir
 'back hall' answered gandalf 'but visit room vain know must gimli says chamber mazarbul hall must twentyfirst northend therefore leave eastern arch hall bear right south go downwards twentyfirst hall seventh level six level gates come back hall '

 gandalf hardly spoken words came great noise rolling _boom_ seemed come depths far tremble stone feet sprang towards door alarm _doom doom_ rolled huge hands turning caverns moria vast drum came echoing blast great horn blown hall answering horns harsh cries heard hurrying sound many feet
 `they coming ' cried legolas
 'we cannot get out' said gimli
 `trapped ' cried gandalf `why delay caught see ���'
 _doom doom_ came drumbeat walls shook
 'slam doors wedge ' shouted aragorn 'and keep packs long may get chance cut way yet'
 `no ' said gandalf 'we must get shut keep east door ajar go way get chance'
 another harsh horncall shrill cries rang feet coming corridor ring clatter company drew swords glamdring shone pale light sting glinted edges boromir set shoulder western door
 `wait moment close yet ' said gandalf sprang forward boromir's side drew full height
 'who comes hither disturb rest balin lord moria ' cried loud voice
 rush hoarse laughter like fall sliding stones pit amid clamour deep voice raised command doom boom doom went drums deep
 quick movement gandalf stepped narrow opening door thrust forward staff dazzling flash lit chamber passage outside instant wizard looked arrows whined whistled corridor sprang back
 'there orcs many them' said `and large evil black uruks mordor moment hanging back something else great cavetroll think one hope escape way'
 'and hope come door well' said boromir
 'there sound outside yet' said aragorn standing eastern door listening `the passage side plunges straight stair plainly lead back towards hall good flying blindly way pursuit behind cannot block door key gone lock broken opens inwards must something delay enemy first make fear chamber mazarbul' said grimly feeling edge sword and�ril

 many company could count affray sharp orcs dismayed fierceness defence legolas shot two throat gimli hewed legs another sprung balin's tomb boromir aragorn slew many thirteen fallen rest fled shrieking leaving defenders unharmed except sam scratch along scalp quick duck saved felled orc sturdy thrust barrowblade fire smouldering brown eyes would made ted sandyman step backwards seen

 aragorn picked frodo lay wall made stair pushing merry pippin front others followed gimli dragged away legolas spite peril lingered balin's tomb head bowed boromir hauled eastern door grinding upon hinges great iron rings either side could fastened
 'i right' gasped frodo `i walk put '
 aragorn nearly dropped amazement 'i thought dead ' cried
 'not yet ' said gandalf 'but time wonder go stairs wait minutes bottom come soon go go quickly choose paths leading right downwards'
 'we cannot leave hold door alone ' said aragorn
 `do say ' said gandalf fiercely `swords use go'
 passage lit shaft utterly dark groped way long flight steps looked back could see nothing except high faint glimmer wizard's staff seemed still standing guard closed door frodo breathed heavily leaned sam put arms stood peering stairs darkness frodo thought could hear voice gandalf muttering words ran sloping roof sighing echo could catch said walls seemed trembling every drumbeats throbbed rolled _doom doom_
 suddenly top stair stab white light dull rumble heavy thud drumbeats broke wildly _doomboom doomboom_ stopped gandalf came flying steps fell ground midst company
 `well well that's ' said wizard struggling feet `i done could met match nearly destroyed stand go without light rather shaken go go gimli come ahead keep close behind you'

 stumbled wondering happened _doom doom_ went drumbeats sounded muffled far away following sound pursuit neither tramp feet voice gandalf took turns right left passage seemed going direction desired every descended flight steps fifty lower level moment chief danger dark could see descent came put feet emptiness gandalf felt ground staff like blind man
 end hour gone mile maybe little descended many flights stairs still sound pursuit almost began hope would escape bottom seventh flight gandalf halted
 `it getting hot ' gasped `we ought least level gates soon think look lefthand turn take us east hope far weary must rest moment even orcs ever spawned us'
 gimli took arm helped seat step `what happened away door ' asked `did meet beater drums '
 'i know' answered gandalf `but found suddenly faced something met could think nothing try put shuttingspell door know many things kind rightly requires time even door broken strength

 `well' said aragorn `i say hobbits made stuff tough never met like known would spoken softer inn bree spearthrust would skewered wild boar '
 'well skewer glad say' said frodo `though feel caught hammer anvil' said found breathing painful
 'you take bilbo' said gandalf `there meets eye said long ago' frodo wondered remark meant said

 went long gimli spoke keen eyes dark `i think' said `that light ahead daylight red '
 `_gh�sh_' muttered gandalf `i wonder meant lower levels fire still go on'
 soon light became unmistakable could seen flickering glowing walls away passage could see way front road sloped swiftly way ahead stood low archway glowing light came air became hot
 came arch gandalf went signing wait stood beyond opening saw face lit red glow quickly stepped back
 `there new devilry here' said 'devised welcome doubt know reached first deep level immediately gates second hall old moria gates near away beyond eastern end left quarter mile across bridge broad stair along wide road first hall come look '
 peered another cavernous hall loftier far longer one slept near eastern end westward ran away darkness centre stalked double line towering pillars carved like boles mighty trees whose boughs upheld roof branching tracery stone stems smooth black red glow darkly mirrored sides right across floor close feet two huge pillars great fissure opened fierce red light came flames licked brink curled bases columns wisps dark smoke wavered hot air
 'if come main road upper halls trapped here' said gandalf `let us hope fire lies us pursuit come time lose'
 even spoke heard pursuing drumbeat _doom doom doom_ away beyond shadows western end hall came cries horncalls _doom doom_ pillars seemed tremble flames quiver
 `now last race ' said gandalf 'if sun shining outside may still escape '
 turned left sped across smooth floor hall distance greater looked ran heard beat echo many hurrying feet behind shrill yell went seen ring clash steel arrow whistled frodo's head
 boromir laughed `they expect this' said `the fire cut wrong side '
 `look ahead ' called gandalf `the bridge near dangerous narrow'
 suddenly frodo saw black chasm end hall floor vanished fell unknown depth outer door could reached slender bridge stone without kerb rail spanned chasm one curving spring fifty feet ancient defence dwarves enemy might capture first hall outer passages could pass across single file brink gandalf halted others came pack behind
 'lead way gimli ' said 'pippin merry next straight stair beyond door '
 arrows fell among one struck frodo sprang back another pierced gandalf's hat stuck like black feather frodo looked behind beyond fire saw swarming black figures seemed hundreds orcs brandished spears scimitars shone red blood firelight _doom doom_ rolled drumbeats growing louder louder _doom doom_
 legolas turned set arrow string though long shot small bow drew hand fell arrow slipped ground gave cry dismay fear two great trolls appeared bore great slabs stone flung serve gangways fire trolls filled elf terror ranks orcs opened crowded away afraid something coming behind could seen like great shadow middle dark form manshape maybe yet greater power terror seemed go
 came edge fire light faded cloud bent rush leaped across fissure flames roared greet wreathed black smoke swirled air streaming mane kindled blazed behind right hand blade like stabbing tongue fire left held whip many thongs
 'ai ai ' wailed legolas 'a balrog balrog come '
 gimli stared wide eyes `durin's bane ' cried letting axe fall covered face
 'a balrog' muttered gandalf `now understand' faltered leaned heavily staff `what evil fortune already weary'

 dark figure streaming fire raced towards orcs yelled poured stone gangways boromir raised horn blew loud challenge rang bellowed like shout many throats cavernous roof moment orcs quailed fiery shadow halted echoes died suddenly flame blown dark wind enemy advanced
 'over bridge' cried gandalf recalling strength `fly foe beyond must hold narrow way fly ' aragorn boromir heed command still held ground side side behind gandalf far end bridge others halted within doorway hall's end turned unable leave leader face enemy alone
 balrog reached bridge gandalf stood middle span leaning staff left hand hand glamdring gleamed cold white enemy halted facing shadow reached like two vast wings raised whip thongs whined cracked fire came nostrils gandalf stood firm
 `you cannot pass' said orcs stood still dead silence fell `i servant secret fire wielder flame anor cannot pass dark fire avail flame ud�n go back shadow cannot pass'
 balrog made answer fire seemed die darkness grew stepped forward slowly bridge suddenly drew great height wings spread wall wall still gandalf could seen glimmering gloom seemed small altogether alone grey bent like wizened tree onset storm
 shadow red sword leaped flaming
 glamdring glittered white answer
 ringing clash stab white fire balrog fell back sword flew molten fragments wizard swayed bridge stepped back pace stood still
 'you cannot pass ' said
 bound balrog leaped full upon bridge whip whirled hissed
 'he cannot stand alone ' cried aragorn suddenly ran back along bridge '_elendil_' shouted 'i gandalf '
 `gondor ' cried boromir leaped
 moment gandalf lifted staff crying aloud smote bridge staff broke asunder fell hand blinding sheet white flame sprang bridge cracked right balrog's feet broke stone upon stood crashed gulf rest remained poised quivering like tongue rock thrust emptiness
 terrible cry balrog fell forward shadow plunged vanished even fell swung whip thongs lashed curled wizard's knees dragging brink staggered fell grasped vainly stone slid abyss 'fly fools ' cried gone

 fires went blank darkness fell company stood rooted horror staring pit even aragorn boromir came flying back rest bridge cracked fell cry aragorn roused
 'come lead ' called 'we must obey last command follow '
 stumbled wildly great stairs beyond door aragorn leading boromir rear top wide echoing passage along fled frodo heard sam side weeping found weeping ran _doom doom doom_ drumbeats rolled behind mournful slow _doom_
 ran light grew great shafts pierced roof ran swifter passed hall bright daylight high windows east fled across huge broken doors passed suddenly great gates opened arch blazing light
 guard orcs crouching shadows behind great door posts towering either side gates shattered cast aragorn smote ground captain stood path rest fled terror wrath company swept past took heed gates ran sprang huge ageworn steps threshold moria
 thus last came beyond hope sky felt wind faces
 halt bowshot walls dimrill dale lay shadow misty mountains lay upon eastwards golden light land one hour noon sun shining clouds white high
 looked back dark yawned archway gates mountainshadow faint far beneath earth rolled slow drumbeats _doom_ thin black smoke trailed nothing else seen dale around empty _doom_ grief last wholly overcame wept long standing silent cast upon ground _doom doom_ drumbeats faded


 _chapter 6_
 lothl�rien

 'alas fear cannot stay longer' said aragorn looked towards mountains held sword `farewell gandalf ' cried 'did say _if pass doors moria beware_ alas spoke true hope without '
 turned company `we must without hope' said `at least may yet avenged let us gird weep come long road much do'
 rose looked northward dale ran glen shadows two great arms mountains three white peaks shining celebdil fanuidhol caradhras mountains moria head glen torrent flowed like white lace endless ladder short falls mist foam hung air mountains' feet
 `yonder dimrill stair' said aragorn pointing falls 'down deepcloven way climbs beside torrent come fortune kinder'
 `or caradhras less cruel' said gimli `there stands smiling sun ' shook fist furthest snowcapped peaks turned away
 east outflung arm mountains marched sudden end far lands could descried beyond wide vague south misty mountains receded endlessly far sight could reach less mile away little still stood high west side dale lay mere long oval shaped like great spearhead thrust deep northern glen southern end beyond shadows sunlit sky yet waters dark deep blue like clear evening sky seen lamplit room face still unruffled lay smooth sward shelving sides bare unbroken rim
 `there lies mirrormere deep kheledz�ram ' said gimli sadly `i remember said "may joy sight cannot linger there" long shall journey ere joy must hasten away must remain'
 company went road gates rough broken fading winding track heather whin thrust amid cracking stones still could seen long ago great paved way wound upwards lowlands dwarfkingdom places ruined works stone beside path mounds green topped slender birches firtrees sighing wind eastward bend led hard sward mirrormere far roadside stood single column broken top
 'that durin's stone ' cried gimli `i cannot pass without turning aside moment look wonder dale '
 `be swift ' said aragorn looking back towards gates `the sun sinks early orcs maybe come till dusk must far away nightfall moon almost spent dark tonight'
 'come frodo ' cried dwarf springing road `i would go without seeing kheledz�ram' ran long green slope frodo followed slowly drawn still blue water spite hurt weariness sam came behind
 beside standing stone gimli halted looked cracked weatherworn faint runes upon side could read `this pillar marks spot durin first looked mirrormere' said dwarf 'let us look ere go'
 stooped dark water first could see nothing slowly saw forms encircling mountains mirrored profound blue peaks like plumes white flame beyond space sky like jewels sunk deep shone glinting stars though sunlight sky stooping forms shadow could seen
 'o kheledz�ram fair wonderful ' said gimli `there lies crown durin till wakes farewell ' bowed turned away hastened back greensward road
 `what see ' said pippin sam sam deep thought answer
 road turned south went quickly downwards running arms dale way mere came deep well water clear crystal freshet fell stone lip ran glistening gurgling steep rocky channel
 'here spring silverlode rises' said gimli `do drink icy cold'
 'soon becomes swift river gathers water many mountainstreams' said aragorn `our road leads beside many miles shall take road gandalf chose first hope come woods silverlode flows great riverout yonder' looked pointed could see stream leaping trough valley running away lower lands lost golden haze
 `there lie woods lothl�rien ' said legolas `that fairest dwellings people trees like trees land autumn leaves fall turn gold till spring comes new green opens fall boughs laden yellow flowers floor wood golden golden roof pillars silver bark trees smooth grey still songs mirkwood say heart would glad beneath eaves wood springtime '
 `my heart glad even winter' said aragorn 'but lies many miles away let us hasten '
 time frodo sam managed keep others aragorn leading great pace lagged behind eaten nothing since early morning sam's cut burning like fire head felt light spite shining sun wind seemed chill warm darkness moria shivered frodo felt every step painful gasped breath
 last legolas turned seeing far behind spoke aragorn others halted aragorn ran back calling boromir come
 'i sorry frodo ' cried full concern `so much happened day need haste forgotten hurt sam spoken done nothing ease ought though orcs moria us come little place rest little come boromir carry them'
 soon afterwards came upon another stream ran west joined bubbling water hurrying silverlode together plunged fall greenhued stone foamed dell stood firtrees short bent sides steep clothed hartstongue shrubs whortleberry bottom level space stream flowed noisily shining pebbles rested nearly three hours noon come miles gates already sun westering
 gimli two younger hobbits kindled fire brush firwood drew water aragorn tended sam frodo sam's wound deep looked ugly aragorn's face grave examined moment looked relief
 'good luck sam ' said 'many received worse payment slaying first orc cut poisoned wounds orcblades often heal well tended bathe gimli heated water'
 opened pouch drew withered leaves `they dry virtue one said still leaves _athelas_ gathered near weathertop crush one water wash wound clean bind turn frodo '
 'i right' said frodo reluctant garments touched `aii needed food little rest'
 `no ' said aragorn `we must look see hammer anvil done still marvel alive all' gently stripped frodo's old jacket worn tunic gave gasp wonder laughed silver corslet shimmered eyes like light upon rippling sea carefully took held gems glittered like stars sound shaken rings like tinkle rain pool
 `look friends' called `here's pretty hobbitskin wrap elvenprinceling known hobbits hides hunters middleearth would riding shire'
 `and arrows hunters world would vain' said gimli gazing mail wonder `it mithrilcoat mithril never seen heard tell one fair coat gandalf spoke undervalued well given '
 `i often wondered bilbo close little room' said merry 'bless old hobbit love ever hope get chance telling '
 dark blackened bruise frodo's right side breast mail shirt soft leather one point rings driven flesh frodo's left side also scored bruised hurled wall others set food ready aragorn bathed hurts water athelas steeped pungent fragrance filled dell stooped steaming water felt refreshed strengthened soon frodo felt pain leave breath grew easy though stiff sore touch many days aragorn bound soft pads cloth side
 `the mail marvellously light' said `put bear heart glad know coat lay aside even sleep unless fortune brings safe seldom chance quest lasts'
 eaten company got ready go put fire hid traces climbing dell took road gone far sun sank behind westward heights great shadows crept mountainsides dusk veiled feet mist rose hollows away east evening light lay pale upon dim lands distant plain wood sam frodo feeling eased greatly refreshed able go fair pace one brief halt aragorn led company nearly three hours
 dark deep night fallen many clear stars hut fastwaning moon would seen till late gimli frodo rear walking softly speaking listening sound upon road behind length gimli broke silence
 'not sound wind' said `there goblins near ears made wood hoped orcs content driving us moria maybe purpose nothing else uswith ring though orcs often pursue foes many leagues plain fallen captain avenge'
 frodo answer looked sting blade dull yet heard something thought soon shadows fallen road behind dim heard quick patter feet even heard turned swiftly two tiny gleams light behind moment thought saw slipped aside vanished
 `what ' said dwarf
 `i know' answered frodo 'i thought heard feet thought saw lightlike eyes thought often since first entered moria'
 gimli halted stooped ground 'i hear nothing nightspeech plant stone' said 'come let us hurry others sight'
 nightwind blew chill valley meet wide grey shadow loomed heard endless rustle leaves like poplars breeze
 `lothl�rien ' cried legolas 'lothl�rien come eaves golden wood alas winter '
 night trees stood tall arched road stream ran suddenly beneath spreading boughs dim light stars stems grey quivering leaves hint fallow gold
 'lothl�rien ' said aragorn 'glad hear wind trees still little five leagues gates go let us hope virtue elves keep us tonight peril comes behind'
 `if elves indeed still dwell darkening world' said gimli
 'it long since folk journeyed hither back land whence wandered ages long ago' said legolas 'but hear l�rien yet deserted secret power holds evil land nevertheless folk seldom seen maybe dwell deep woods far northern border'
 'indeed deep wood dwell' said aragorn sighed memory stirred `we must fend tonight go forward short way trees us turn aside path seek place rest in'
 stepped forward boromir stood irresolute follow 'is way ' said
 `what fairer way would desire ' said aragorn
 `a plain road though led hedge swords' said boromir `by strange paths company led far evil fortune passed shades moria loss must enter golden wood say perilous land heard gondor said come go none escaped unscathed'
 `say _unscathed_ say _unchanged_ maybe speak truth said aragorn lore wanes gondor boromir city wise speak evil lothl�rien believe way us � unless would go back moriagate scale pathless mountains swim great river alone'
 `then lead ' said boromir `but perilous'
 `perilous indeed' said aragorn 'fair perilous evil need fear bring evil follow '
 gone little mile forest came upon another stream flowing swiftly treeclad slopes climbed back westward towards mountains heard splashing fall away among shadows right dark hurrying waters ran across path joined silverlode swirl dim pools among roots trees
 `here nimrodel ' said legolas 'of stream silvan elves made many songs long ago still sing north remembering rainbow falls golden flowers floated foam dark bridge nimrodel broken bathe feet said water healing weary' went forward climbed deepcloven bank stepped stream
 `follow me' cried 'the water deep let us wade across bank rest sound falling water may bring us sleep forgetfulness grief'
 one one climbed followed legolas moment frodo stood near brink let water flow tired feet cold touch clean went mounted knees felt stain travel weariness washed limbs
 company crossed sat rested ate little food legolas told tales lothl�rien elves mirkwood still kept hearts sunlight starlight upon meadows great river world grey
 length silence fell heard music waterfall running sweetly shadows almost frodo fancied could hear voice singing mingled sound water
 `do hear voice nimrodel ' asked legolas 'i sing song maiden nimrodel bore name stream beside lived lung ago fair song woodland tongue runs westron speech rivendell sing it' soft voice hardly heard amid rustle leaves began

 voice legolas faltered song ceased 'i cannot sing more' said 'that part forgotten much long sad tells sorrow came upon lothl�rien l�rien blossom dwarves awakened evil mountains'
 `but dwarves make evil' said gimli
 `i said yet evil came' answered legolas sadly `then many elves nimrodel's kindred left dwellings departed lost far south passes white mountains came ship amroth lover waited spring wind new leaves echo voice may still heard falls bear name wind south voice amroth comes sea nimrodel flows silverlode elves call celebrant celebrant anduin great anduin flows bay belfalas whence elves l�rien set sail neither nimrodel amroth ever came back
 'it told house built branches tree grew near falls custom elves l�rien dwell trees maybe still therefore called galadhrim treepeople deep forest trees great people woods delve ground like dwarves build strong places stone shadow came'
 `and even latter days dwelling trees might thought safer sitting ground' said gimli looked across stream road led back dimrill dale roof dark boughs
 `your words bring good counsel gimli' said aragorn `we cannot build house tonight galadhrim seek refuge treetops sat beside road already longer wise'
 company turned aside path went shadow deeper woods westward along mountainstream away silverlode far falls nimrodel found cluster trees overhung stream great grey trunks mighty girth height could guessed
 `i climb up' said legolas `i home among trees root bough though trees kind strange save name song _mellyrn_ called bear yellow blossom never climbed one see shape way growth'
 `whatever may be' said pippin `they marvellous trees indeed offer rest night except birds cannot sleep perch '
 'then dig hole ground' said legolas `if fashion kind must dig swift deep wish hide orcs' sprang lightly ground caught branch grew trunk high head even swung moment voice spoke suddenly treeshadows
 `_daro_' said commanding tone legolas dropped back earth surprise fear shrank bole tree
 'stand still ' whispered others `do move speak '
 sound soft laughter heads another clear voice spoke elventongue frodo could understand little said speech silvan folk east mountains used among unlike west legolas looked answered language
 `who say ' asked merry
 `they're elves' said sam `can't hear voices '
 `yes elves' said legolas `and say breathe loud could shoot dark' sam hastily put hand mouth 'but say also need fear aware us long heard voice across nimrodel knew one northern kindred therefore hinder crossing afterwards heard song bid climb frodo seem tidings journey others ask wait little keep watch foot tree decided done'

 shadows ladder let made rope silvergrey glimmering dark though looked slender proved strong enough bear many men legolas ran lightly frodo followed slowly behind came sam trying breathe loudly branches mallorntree grew nearly straight trunk swept upward near top main stem divided crown many boughs among found built wooden platform _flet_ things called days elves called _talan_ reached round hole centre ladder passed
 frodo came last flet found legolas seated three elves clad shadowygrey could seen among treestems unless moved suddenly stood one uncovered small lamp gave slender silver beam held looking frodo's face sam's shut light spoke words welcome elventongue frodo spoke haltingly return
 `welcome' elf said common language speaking slowly 'we seldom use tongue dwell heart forest willingly dealings folk even kindred north sundered us us still go abroad gathering news watching enemies speak languages lands one haldir name brothers r�mil orophin speak little tongue
 `but heard rumours coming messengers elrond passed l�rien way home dimrill stair heard hobbits halflings many long year know yet dwelt middleearth look evil since come elf kindred willing befriend elrond asked though custom lead strangers land must stay tonight many '
 `eight' said legolas `myself four hobbits two men one aragorn elffriend folk westernesse'
 `the name aragorn son arathorn known l�rien' said haldir `and favour lady well yet spoken seven'
 `the eighth dwarf' said legolas
 `a dwarf ' said haldir `that well dealings dwarves since dark days permitted land cannot allow pass'
 `but lonely mountain one d�in's trusty people friendly elrond' said frodo `elrond chose one companions brave faithful'
 elves spoke together soft voices questioned legolas tongue 'very good' said haldir last `we though liking aragorn legolas guard answer shall pass must go blindfold lothl�rien
 `but must debate longer folk must remain ground keeping watch rivers ever since saw great troop orcs going north toward moria along skirts mountains many days ago wolves howling wood's borders indeed come moria peril cannot far behind tomorrow early must go
 'the four hobbits shall climb stay uswe fear another _talan_ next tree others must take refuge legolas must answer us call us anything amiss eye dwarf'

 legolas went ladder take haldir's message soon afterwards merry pippin clambered high flet breath seemed rather scared
 `there' said merry panting `we lugged blankets well strider hidden rest baggage deep drift leaves'
 `you need burdens' said haldir `it cold treetops winter though wind tonight south food drink give drive away nightchill skins cloaks spare'
 hobbits accepted second far better supper gladly wrapped warmly furcloaks elves blankets well tried go sleep weary sam found easy hobbits like heights sleep upstairs even stairs flet liking bedroom walls even rail one side light plaited screen could moved fixed different places according wind
 pippin went talking `i hope go sleep bedloft roll off' said
 `once get sleep' said sam 'i shall go sleeping whether roll less said sooner i'll drop take meaning'
 frodo lay time awake looked stars glinting pale roof quivering leaves sam snoring side long closed eyes could dimly see grey forms two elves sitting motionless arms knees speaking whispers gone take watch one lower branches last lulled wind boughs sweet murmur falls nimrodel frodo fell asleep song legolas running mind
 late night awoke hobbits asleep elves gone sickle moon gleaming dimly among leaves wind still little way heard harsh laugh tread many feet ground ring metal sounds died slowly away seemed go southward wood
 head appeared suddenly hole flet frodo sat alarm saw greyhooded elf looked towards hobbits
 `what ' said frodo
 `_yrch_' said elf hissing whisper cast flet ropeladder rolled
 'orcs ' said frodo `what ' elf gone
 sounds even leaves silent falls seemed hushed frodo sat shivered wraps thankful caught ground felt trees offered little protection except concealment orcs keen hounds scent said could also climb drew sting flashed glittered like blue flame slowly faded grew dull spite fading sword feeling immediate danger leave frodo rather grew stronger got crawled opening peered almost certain could hear stealthy movements tree's foot far
 elves woodland folk altogether noiseless movements heard faintly sound like sniffing something seemed scrabbling bark treetrunk stared dark holding breath
 something climbing slowly breath came like soft hissing closed teeth coming close stem frodo saw two pale eyes stopped gazed upward unwinking suddenly turned away shadowy figure slipped round trunk tree vanished
 immediately afterwards haldir came climbing swiftly branches `there something tree never seen before' said `it orc fled soon touched treestem seemed wary skill trees might thought one hobbits
 'i shoot dared arouse cries cannot risk battle strong company orcs passed crossed nimrodelcurse foul feet clean waterand went old road beside river seemed pick scent searched ground near place halted three us could challenge hundred went ahead spoke feigned voices leading wood
 `orophin gone haste back dwellings warn people none orcs ever return l�rien many elves hidden northern border another night falls must take road south soon fully light'

 day came pale east light grew filtered yellow leaves mallorn seemed hobbits early sun cool summer's morning shining paleblue sky peeped among moving branches looking opening south side flet frodo saw valley silverlode lying like sea fallow gold tossing gently breeze
 morning still young cold company set guided haldir brother r�mil `farewell sweet nimrodel ' cried legolas frodo looked back caught gleam white foam among grey treestems `farewell' said seemed would never hear running water beautiful ever blending innumerable notes endless changeful music
 went back path still went along west side silverlode way followed southward prints orcfeet earth soon haldir turned aside trees halted bank river shadows
 `there one people yonder across stream' said `though may see him' gave call like low whistle bird thicket young trees elf stepped clad grey hood thrown back hair glinted like gold morning sun haldir skilfully cast stream coil grey rope caught bound end tree near bank
 `celebrant already strong stream see' said haldir 'and runs swift deep cold set foot far north unless must days watchfulness make bridges cross follow me' made end rope fast another tree ran lightly along river back road
 `i walk path' said legolas `but others skill must swim'
 `no' said haldir `we two ropes fasten one shoulderhigh another halfhigh holding strangers able cross care'
 slender bridge made company passed cautiously slowly others easily hobbits pippin proved best surefooted walked quickly holding one hand kept eyes bank ahead look sam shuffled along clutching hard looking pale eddying water chasm mountains
 breathed relief safely across `live learn gaffer used say though thinking gardening roosting like bird trying walk like spider even uncle andy ever trick like '
 length company gathered east bank silverlode elves untied ropes coiled two r�mil remained side drew back last one slung shoulder wave hand went away back nimrodel keep watch
 `now friends' said haldir `you entered naith l�rien gore would say land lies like spearhead arms silverlode anduin great allow strangers spy secrets naith indeed permitted even set foot
 `as agreed shall blindfold eyes gimli dwarf may walk free come nearer dwellings egladil angle waters'
 liking gimli `the agreement made without consent' said `i walk blindfold like beggar prisoner spy folk never dealings servants enemy neither done harm elves likely betray legolas companions'
 'i doubt you' said haldir 'yet law master law cannot set aside done much letting set foot celebrant'
 gimli obstinate planted feet firmly apart laid hand upon haft axe 'i go forward free' said 'or go back seek land known true word though perish alone wilderness'
 `you cannot go back' said haldir sternly 'now come thus far must brought lord lady shall judge hold give leave cannot cross rivers behind secret sentinels cannot pass would slain saw them'
 gimli drew axe belt haldir companion bent bows 'a plague dwarves stiff necks ' said legolas
 'come' said aragorn `if still lead company must bid hard upon dwarf thus singled blindfold even legolas best though make journey slow dull'
 gimli laughed suddenly `a merry troop fools shall look haldir lead us string like many blind beggars one dog content legolas shares blindness'
 `i elf kinsman here' said legolas becoming angry turn
 `now let us cry "a plague stiff necks elves"' said aragorn `but company shall fare alike come bind eyes haldir '
 `i shall claim full amends every fall stubbed toe lead us well' said gimli bound cloth eyes
 'you claim' said haldir `i shall lead well paths smooth straight'
 `alas folly days ' said legolas 'here enemies one enemy yet must walk blind sun merry woodland leaves gold '
 `folly may seem' said haldir 'indeed nothing power dark lord clearly shown estrangement divides still oppose yet little faith trust find world beyond lothl�rien unless maybe rivendell dare trust endanger land live upon island amid many perils hands often upon bowstring upon harp
 `the rivers long defended us sure guard shadow crept northward us speak departing yet already seems late mountains west growing evil east lands waste full sauron's creatures rumoured cannot safely pass southward rohan mouths great river watched enemy even could come shores sea find longer shelter said still havens high elves far north west beyond land halflings may though lord lady may know not'
 `you ought least guess since seen us' said merry `there elfhavens west land shire hobbits live'
 `happy folk hobbits dwell near shores sea ' said haldir 'it long indeed since folk looked yet still remember song tell havens walk'
 `i cannot' said merry `i never seen never land known world outside like think heart leave it'
 `not even see fair lothl�rien ' said haldir 'the world indeed full peril many dark places still much fair though lands love mingled grief grows perhaps greater
 `some among us sing shadow draw back peace shall come yet believe world us ever old light sun aforetime elves fear prove best truce may pass sea unhindered leave middleearth ever alas lothl�rien love would poor life land mallorn grew mallorntrees beyond great sea none reported it'
 spoke thus company filed slowly along paths wood led haldir elf walked behind felt ground beneath feet smooth soft walked freely without fear hurt fall deprived sight frodo found hearing senses sharpened could smell trees trodden grass could hear many different notes rustle leaves overhead river murmuring away right thin clear voices birds sky felt sun upon face hands passed open glade
 soon set foot upon far bank silverlode strange feeling come upon deepened walked naith seemed stepped bridge time corner elder days walking world rivendell memory ancient things l�rien ancient things still lived waking world evil seen heard sorrow known elves feared distrusted world outside wolves howling wood's borders land l�rien shadow lay
 day company marched felt cool evening come heard early nightwind whispering among many leaves rested slept without fear upon ground guides would permit unbind eyes could climb morning went walking without haste noon halted frodo aware passed shining sun suddenly heard sound many voices around
 marching host elves come silently hastening toward northern borders guard attack moria brought news haldir reported marauding orcs waylaid almost destroyed remnant fled westward towards mountains pursued strange creature also seen running bent back hands near ground like beast yet beastshape eluded capture shot knowing whether good ill vanished silverlode southward
 `also' said haldir `they bring message lord lady galadhrim walk free even dwarf gimli seems lady knows member company new messages come rivendell perhaps'
 removed bandage first gimli's eyes 'your pardon ' said bowing low `look us friendly eyes look glad first dwarf behold trees naith l�rien since durin's day '
 eyes turn uncovered frodo looked caught breath standing open space left stood great mound covered sward grass green springtime elder days upon double crown grew two circles trees outer bark snowy white leafless beautiful shapely nakedness inner mallorntrees great height still arrayed pale gold high amid branches towering tree stood centre gleamed white flet feet trees green hillsides grass studded small golden flowers shaped like stars among nodding slender stalks flowers white palest green glimmered mist amid rich hue grass sky blue sun afternoon glowed upon hill cast long green shadows beneath trees
 'behold come cerin amroth' said haldir `for heart ancient realm long ago mound amroth happier days high house built ever bloom winter flowers unfading grass yellow _elanor_ pale _niphredil_ stay awhile come city galadhrim dusk'

 others cast upon fragrant grass frodo stood awhile still lost wonder seemed stepped high window looked vanished world light upon language name saw shapely shapes seemed clear cut first conceived drawn uncovering eyes ancient endured ever saw colour knew gold white blue green fresh poignant moment first perceived made names new wonderful winter heart could mourn summer spring blemish sickness deformity could seen anything grew upon earth land l�rien stain
 turned saw sam standing beside looking round puzzled expression rubbing eyes sure awake `it's sunlight bright day right enough' said `i thought elves moon stars elvish anything ever heard tell feel _inside_ song take meaning'
 haldir looked seemed indeed take meaning thought word smiled `you feel power lady galadhrim' said `would please climb cerin amroth '
 followed stepped lightly grassclad slopes though walked breathed living leaves flowers stirred cool wind fanned face frodo felt timeless land fade change fall forgetfulness gone passed outer world still frodo wanderer shire would walk upon grass among _elanor_ _niphredil_ fair lothl�rien

 stepped last upon lofty platform haldir took hand turned toward south `look way first ' said
 frodo looked saw still distance hill many mighty trees city green towers could tell seemed power light came held land sway longed suddenly fly like bird rest green city looked eastward saw land l�rien running pale gleam anduin great river lifted eyes across river light went back world knew beyond river land appeared flat empty formless vague far away rose like wall dark drear sun lay lothl�rien power enlighten shadow distant height
 `there lies fastness southern mirkwood' said haldir `it clad forest dark fir trees strive one another branches rot wither midst upon stony height stands dol guldur long hidden enemy dwelling fear inhabited power sevenfold black cloud lies often late high place may see two powers opposed one another ever strive thought whereas light perceives heart darkness secret discovered yet' turned climbed swiftly followed
 hill's foot frodo found aragorn standing still silent tree hand small golden bloom elanor light eyes wrapped fair memory frodo looked knew beheld things place grim years removed face aragorn seemed clothed white young lord tall fair spoke words elvish tongue one frodo could see_ arwen vanimelda nam�ri�_ said drew breath returning thought looked frodo smiled

 _chapter 7_
 mirror galadriel

 sun sinking behind mountains shadows deepening woods went paths went thickets dusk already gathered night came beneath trees walked elves uncovered silver lamps
 suddenly came open found pale evening sky pricked early stars wide treeless space running great circle bending away either hand beyond deep fosse lost soft shadow grass upon brink green glowed still memory sun gone upon side rose great height green wall encircling green hill thronged mallorntrees taller yet seen land height could guessed stood twilight like living towers manytiered branches amid evermoving leaves countless lights gleaming green gold silver haldir turned towards company
 `welcome caras galadhon ' said 'here city galadhrim dwell lord celeborn galadriel lady l�rien cannot enter gates look northward must go round southern side way short city great'

 road paved white stone running outer brink fosse along went westward city ever climbing like green cloud upon left night deepened lights sprang forth hill seemed afire stars came last white bridge crossing found great gates city faced southwest set ends encircling wall overlapped tall strong hung many lamps
 haldir knocked spoke gates opened soundlessly guards frodo could see sign travellers passed within gates shut behind deep lane ends wall passing quickly entered city trees folk could see hear feet upon paths many voices air far away hill could hear sound singing falling high like soft rain upon leaves
 went along many paths climbed many stairs came high places saw amid wide lawn fountain shimmering lit silver lamps swung boughs trees fell basin silver white stream spilled upon south side lawn stood mightiest trees great smooth bole gleamed like grey silk towered first branches far opened huge limbs shadowy clouds leaves beside broad white ladder stood foot three elves seated sprang travellers approached frodo saw tall clad grey mail shoulders hung long white cloaks
 'here dwell celeborn galadriel' said haldir `it wish ascend speak them'
 one elfwardens blew clear note small horn answered three times far `i go first' said haldir 'let frodo come next legolas others may follow wish long climb accustomed stairs may rest upon way'

 climbed slowly frodo passed many flets one side another set bole tree ladder passed great height ground came wide _talan_ like deck great ship built house large almost would served hall men upon earth entered behind haldir found chamber oval shape midst grew trunk great mallorn tapering towards crown yet making still pillar wide girth
 chamber filled soft light walls green silver roof gold many elves seated two chairs beneath bole tree canopied living bough sat side side celeborn galadriel stood greet guests manner elves even accounted mighty kings tall lady less tall lord grave beautiful clad wholly white hair lady deep gold hair lord celeborn silver long bright sign age upon unless depths eyes keen lances starlight yet profound wells deep memory
 haldir led frodo lord welcomed tongue lady galadriel said word looked long upon face
 `sit beside chair frodo shire ' said celeborn `when come speak together'
 companions greeted courteously name entered `welcome aragorn son arathorn ' said `it eight thirty years world outside since came land years lie heavy end near good ill lay aside burden '
 'welcome son thranduil seldom kindred journey hither north'
 `welcome gimli son gl�in long indeed since saw one durin's folk caras galadhon today broken long law may sign though world dark better days hand friendship shall renewed peoples' gimli bowed low
 guests seated chair lord looked 'here eight' said `nine set said messages maybe change counsel heard elrond far away darkness gathers us year shadows grown longer'
 `nay change counsel' said lady galadriel speaking first time voice clear musical deeper woman's wont `gandalf grey set company pass borders land tell us much desired speak cannot see afar unless comes within fences lothl�rien grey mist ways feet mind hidden me'
 'alas ' said aragorn `gandalf grey fell shadow remained moria escape'
 words elves hall cried aloud grief amazement `these evil tidings' said celeborn `the evil spoken long years full grievous deeds' turned haldir `why nothing told ' asked elventongue
 'we spoken haldir deeds purpose' said legolas `at first weary danger close behind afterwards almost forgot grief time walked gladness fair paths l�rien'
 `yet grief great loss cannot mended' said frodo 'gandalf guide led us moria escape seemed beyond hope saved us fell'
 'tell us full tale ' said celeborn
 aragorn recounted happened upon pass caradhras days followed spoke balin book fight chamber mazarbul fire narrow bridge coming terror 'an evil ancient world seemed never seen before' said aragorn `it shadow flame strong terrible'
 'it balrog morgoth' said legolas `of elfbanes deadly save one sits dark tower'
 `indeed saw upon bridge haunts darkest dreams saw durin's bane' said gimli low voice dread eyes
 'alas ' said celeborn `we long feared caradhras terror slept known dwarves stirred evil moria would forbidden pass northern borders went possible one would say last gandalf fell wisdom folly going needlessly net moria'
 `he would rash indeed said thing' said galadriel gravely `needless none deeds gandalf life followed knew mind cannot report full purpose however may guide followers blameless repent welcome dwarf folk exiled long far lothl�rien galadhrim even celeborn wise would pass nigh would wish look upon ancient home though become abode dragons
 'dark water kheledz�ram cold springs kibiln�la fair manypillared halls khazadd�m elder days fall mighty kings beneath stone' looked upon gimli sat glowering sad smiled dwarf hearing names given ancient tongue looked met eyes seemed looked suddenly heart enemy saw love understanding wonder came face smiled answer
 rose clumsily bowed dwarffashion saying `yet fair living land l�rien lady galadriel jewels lie beneath earth '
 silence length celeborn spoke `i know plight evil' said `let gimli forget harsh words spoke trouble heart aid according wish need especially one little folk bears burden'
 'your quest known us' said galadriel looking frodo `but speak openly yet vain prove maybe came land seeking aid gandalf plainly purposed lord galadhrim accounted wisest elves middleearth giver gifts beyond power kings dwelt west since days dawn dwelt years uncounted ere fall nargothrond gondolin passed mountains together ages world fought long defeat
 'i first summoned white council designs gone amiss would governed gandalf grey mayhap things would gone otherwise even hope left give counsel saying contriving choosing course another avail knowing part also shall say quest stands upon edge knife stray little fail ruin yet hope remains company true'
 word held eyes silence looked searchingly turn none save legolas aragorn could long endure glance sam quickly blushed hung head
 length lady galadriel released eyes smiled `do let hearts troubled' said 'tonight shall sleep peace' sighed felt suddenly weary questioned long deeply though words spoken openly
 `go ' said celeborn `you worn sorrow much toil even quest concern us closely refuge city healed refreshed shall rest speak road while'
 night company slept upon ground much satisfaction hobbits elves spread pavilion among trees near fountain laid soft couches speaking words peace fair elvish voices left little travellers talked night treetops day's journey lord lady yet heart look back
 `what blush sam ' said pippin `you soon broke anyone would thought guilty conscience hope nothing worse wicked plot steal one blankets'
 `i never thought thing' answered sam mood jest 'if want know felt got nothing like seemed looking inside asking would gave chance flying back home shire nice little hole withwith bit garden own'
 `that's funny' said merry 'almost exactly felt well think i'ii say more' ended lamely
 seemed fared alike felt offered choice shadow full fear lay ahead something greatly desired clear mind lay get turn aside road leave quest war sauron others
 `and seemed too' said gimli `that choice would remain secret known myself'
 'to seemed exceedingly strange' said boromir `maybe test thought read thoughts good purpose almost said tempting us offering pretended power give need said refused listen men minas tirith true word' thought lady offered boromir tell
 frodo would speak though boromir pressed questions `she held long gaze ringbearer' said
 `yes' said frodo `but whatever came mind keep there'
 `well care ' said boromir `i feel sure elvish lady purposes'
 `speak evil lady galadriel ' said aragorn sternly 'you know say land evil unless man bring hither let beware tonight shall sleep without fear first time since left rivendell may sleep deep forget grief weary body heart' cast upon couch fell long sleep
 others soon sound dream disturbed slumber woke found light day broad upon lawn pavilion fountain rose fell glittering sun
 remained days lothl�rien far could tell remember dwelt sun shone clear save gentle rain fell times passed away leaving things fresh clean air cool soft early spring yet felt deep thoughtful quiet winter seemed little eat drink rest walk among trees enough
 seen lord lady little speech elvenfolk knew would use westron tongue haldir bidden farewell gone back fences north great watch kept since tidings moria company brought legolas away much among galadhrim first night sleep companions though returned eat talk often took gimli went abroad land others wondered change
 companions sat walked together spoke gandalf known seen came clear minds healed hurt weariness body grief loss grew keen often heard nearby elvish voices singing knew making songs lamentation fall caught name among sweet sad words could understand
 _mithrandir mithrandir_ sang elves _o pilgrim grey_for loved call legolas company would interpret songs saying skill grief still near matter tears yet song
 frodo first put something sorrow halting words seldom moved make song rhyme even rivendell listened sung though memory stored many things others made sat beside fountain l�rien heard voices elves thought took shape song seemed fair yet tried repeat sam snatches remained faded handful withered leaves

 evening shire grey
 footsteps hill heard
 dawn went away
 journey long without word

 wilderland western shore
 northern waste southern hill
 dragonlair hidden door
 darkling woods walked

 dwarf hobbit elves men
 mortal immortal folk
 bird bough beast den
 secret tongues spoke

 deadly sword healing hand
 back bent beneath load
 trumpetvoice burning brand
 weary pilgrim road

 lord wisdom throned sat
 swift anger quick laugh
 old man battered hat
 leaned upon thorny staff

 stood upon bridge alone
 fire shadow defied
 staff broken stone
 khazadd�m wisdom died

 `why beating mr bilbo next ' said sam
 'no afraid not' said frodo 'but best yet'
 'well mr frodo another go hope say word fireworks' said sam `something like

 finest rockets ever seen
 burst stars blue green
 thunder golden showers
 came falling like rain flowers

 though justice long road'
 `no i'll leave sam perhaps bilbo butwell can't talk can't bear think bringing news him'
 one evening frodo sam walking together cool twilight felt restless frodo suddenly shadow parting fallen knew somehow time near must leave lothl�rien
 `what think elves sam ' said `i asked question beforeit seems long ago seen since then'
 'i indeed ' said sam 'and reckon there's elves elves they're elvish enough they're folk wanderers homeless seem bit nearer likes us seem belong even hobbits shire whether they've made land land's made hard say take meaning wonderfully quiet nothing seems going nobody seems want there's magic right deep can't lay hands manner speaking'
 'you see feel everywhere' said frodo
 'well' said sam 'you can't see nobody working fireworks like poor gandalf used show wonder see nothing lord lady days fancy _she_ could wonderful things mind i'd dearly love see elfmagic mr frodo '
 'i wouldn't' said frodo `i content miss gandalf's fireworks bushy eyebrows quick temper voice'
 `you're right' said sam `and think i'm finding fault i've often wanted see bit magic like tells old tales i've never heard better land like home holiday time understand want leave i'm beginning feel we've got go we'd best get
 '_it's job that's never started takes longest finish_ old gaffer used say reckon folk much help us magic leave land shall miss gandalf worse i'm thinking'
 'i afraid that's true sam' said frodo `yet hope much leave shall see lady elves again'
 even spoke saw came answer words lady galadriel approaching tall white fair walked beneath trees spoke word beckoned
 turning aside led toward southern slopes hill caras galadhon passing high green hedge came enclosed garden trees grew lay open sky evening star risen shining white fire western woods long flight steps lady went deep green hollow ran murmuring silver stream issued fountain hill bottom upon low pedestal carved like branching tree stood basin silver wide shallow beside stood silver ewer
 water stream galadriel filled basin brim breathed water still spoke `here mirror galadriel' said 'i brought may look will'
 air still dell dark elflady beside tall pale 'what shall look shall see ' asked frodo filled awe
 `many things command mirror reveal' answered `and show desire see mirror also show things unbidden often stranger profitable things wish behold see leave mirror free work cannot tell shows things things things yet may sees even wisest cannot always tell wish look '
 frodo answer
 `and ' said turning sam 'for folk would call magic believe though understand clearly mean seem also use word deceits enemy magic galadriel say wished see elfmagic '
 'i did' said sam trembling little fear curiosity `i'll peep lady willing'
 `and i'd mind glimpse what's going home' said aside frodo 'it seems terrible long time i've away like i'll see stars something understand'
 'like not' said lady gentle laugh `but come shall look see may touch water '
 sam climbed foot pedestal leaned basin water looked hard dark stars reflected
 `there's stars thought' said gave low gasp stars went dark veil withdrawn mirror grew grey clear sun shining branches trees waving tossing wind sam could make mind saw light faded thought saw frodo pale face lying fast asleep great dark cliff seemed see going along dim passage climbing endless winding stair came suddenly looking urgently something know like dream vision shifted went back saw trees time close could see going waving wind falling crashing ground
 `hi' cried sam outraged voice 'there's ted sandyman acutting trees ought felled avenue beyond mill shades road bywater wish could get ted i'd fell _him_'
 sam noticed old mill vanished large redbrick building put stood lots folk busily work tall red chimney nearby black smoke seemed cloud surface mirror
 'there's devilry work shire' said 'elrond knew wanted send mr merry back' suddenly sam gave cry sprang away 'i can't stay here' said wildly `i must go home they've dug bagshot row there's poor old gaffer going hill bits things barrow must go home '
 'you cannot go home alone' said lady 'you wish go home without master looked mirror yet knew evil things might well happening shire remember mirror shows many things yet come pass never come unless behold visions turn aside path prevent mirror dangerous guide deeds'
 sam sat ground put head hands `i wish never come want see magic' said fell silent moment spoke thickly struggling tears `no i'll go home long road mr frodo all' said `but hope get back day i've seen turns true somebody's going catch hot '
 `do wish look frodo ' said lady galadriel `you wish see elfmagic content'
 `do advise look ' asked frodo
 'no' said `i counsel one way counsellor may learn something whether see fair evil may profitable yet may seeing good perilous yet think frodo courage wisdom enough venture would brought '
 `i look' said frodo climbed pedestal bent dark water mirror cleared saw twilit land mountains loomed dark distance pale sky long grey road wound back sight far away figure came slowly road faint small first growing larger clearer approached suddenly frodo realized reminded gandalf almost called aloud wizard's name saw figure clothed grey white white shone faintly dusk hand white staff head bowed could see face presently figure turned aside round bend road went mirror's view doubt came frodo's mind vision gandalf one many lonely journeys long ago saruman
 vision changed brief small vivid caught glimpse bilbo walking restlessly room table littered disordered papers rain beating windows
 pause many swift scenes followed frodo way knew parts great history become involved mist cleared saw sight never seen knew sea darkness fell sea rose raged great storm saw sun sinking bloodred wrack clouds black outline tall ship torn sails riding west wide river flowing populous city white fortress seven towers ship black sails morning water rippled light banner bearing emblem white tree shone sun smoke fire battle arose sun went burning red faded grey mist mist small ship passed away twinkling lights vanished frodo sighed prepared draw away
 suddenly mirror went altogether dark dark hole opened world sight frodo looked emptiness black abyss appeared single eye slowly grew filled nearly mirror terrible frodo stood rooted unable cry withdraw gaze eye rimmed fire glazed yellow cat's watchful intent black slit pupil opened pit window nothing
 eye began rove searching way frodo knew certainty horror among many things sought one also knew could see himnot yet unless willed ring hung upon chain neck grew heavy heavier great stone head dragged downwards mirror seemed growing hot curls steam rising water slipping forward
 `do touch water' said lady galadriel softly vision faded frodo found looking cool stars twinkling silver basin stepped back shaking looked lady
 `i know last saw' said `for also mind afraid think singing amid trees even slender arrows elvenbows land lothl�rien maintained defended enemy say frodo even speak perceive dark lord know mind mind concerns elves gropes ever see thought still door closed '
 lifted white arms spread hands towards east gesture rejection denial e�rendil evening star beloved elves shone clear bright figure elvenlady cast dim shadow ground rays glanced upon ring finger glittered like polished gold overlaid silver light white stone twinkled evenstar come rest upon hand frodo gazed ring awe suddenly seemed understood
 `yes' said divining thought `it permitted speak elrond could cannot hidden ringbearer one seen eye verily land l�rien upon finger galadriel one three remains nenya ring adamant keeper
 `he suspects know � yet see wherefore coming us footstep doom fail laid bare enemy yet succeed power diminished lothl�rien fade tides time sweep away must depart west dwindle rustic folk dell cave slowly forget forgotten'
 frodo bent head `and wish ' said last
 `that shall be' answered `the love elves land works deeper deeps sea regret undying cannot ever wholly assuaged yet cast away rather submit sauron know fate lothl�rien answerable task yet could wish avail one ring never wrought remained ever lost'
 'you wise fearless fair lady galadriel' said frodo `i give one ring ask great matter me'
 galadriel laughed sudden clear laugh `wise lady galadriel may be' said `yet met match courtesy gently revenged testing heart first meeting begin see keen eye deny heart greatly desired ask offer many long years pondered might great ring come hands behold brought within grasp evil devised long ago works many ways whether sauron stands falls would noble deed set credit ring taken force fear guest
 `and last comes give ring freely place dark lord set queen shall dark beautiful terrible morning night fair sea sun snow upon mountain dreadful storm lightning stronger foundations earth shall love despair '
 lifted hand ring wore issued great light illuminated alone left else dark stood frodo seeming tall beyond measurement beautiful beyond enduring terrible worshipful let hand fall light faded suddenly laughed lo shrunken slender elfwoman clad simple white whose gentle voice soft sad
 'i pass test' said `i diminish go west remain galadriel'
 stood long silence length lady spoke `let us return ' said `in morning must depart chosen tides fate flowing'
 `i would ask one thing go' said frodo `a thing often meant ask gandalf rivendell permitted wear one ring cannot see others know thoughts wear '
 `you tried' said `only thrice set ring upon finger since knew possessed try would destroy gandalf tell rings give power according measure possessor could use power would need become far stronger train domination others yet even ringbearer one borne finger seen hidden sight grown keener perceived thought clearly many accounted wise saw eye holds seven nine see recognize ring upon finger see ring ' asked turning sam
 'no lady' answered `to tell truth wondered talking saw star finger pardon speaking think master right wish take ring put things rights stop digging gaffer turning adrift make folk pay dirty work'
 `i would' said `that would begin would stop alas speak let us go'

 `now time' said `when wish continue quest must harden hearts leave land longer wish go forward may remain whether stay go none sure peace come edge doom wish may await oncoming hour till either ways world lie open summon last need l�rien may return lands else go long home fall battle'
 silence `they resolved go forward' said galadriel looking eyes
 `as me' said boromir `my way home lies onward back'
 `that true' said celeborn `but company going minas tirith '
 `we decided course' said aragorn 'beyond lothl�rien know gandalf intended indeed think even clear purpose'
 `maybe not' said celeborn `yet leave land longer forget great river know well cannot crossed travellers baggage l�rien gondor save boat bridges osgiliath broken landings held enemy
 `on side journey way minas tirith lies upon side upon west straight road quest lies east river upon darker shore shore take '
 `if advice heeded western shore way minas tirith' answered boromir `but leader company' others said nothing aragorn looked doubtful troubled

 aragorn thanked celeborn many times gift boats comforted much least would need decide course days others looked hopeful whatever perils lay ahead seemed better float broad tide anduin meet plod forward bent backs sam doubtful rate still thought boats bad wild horses worse dangers survived made think better
 `all shall prepared await noon tomorrow' said celeborn 'i send people morning help make ready journey wish fair night untroubled sleep'
 'good night friends ' said galadriel 'sleep peace trouble hearts overmuch thought road tonight maybe paths shall tread already laid feet though see good night '
 company took leave returned pavilion legolas went last night lothl�rien spite words galadriel wished take counsel together

 `i shall go minas tirith alone need duty' said boromir silent sitting eyes fixed frodo trying read halfling's thoughts length spoke softly debating `if wish destroy ring' said `then little use war weapons men minas tirith cannot help wish destroy armed might dark lord folly go without force domain folly throw away' paused suddenly become aware speaking thoughts aloud `it would folly throw lives away mean' ended `it choice defending strong place walking openly arms death least see it'
 frodo caught something new strange boromir's glance looked hard plainly boromir's thought different final words would folly throw away ring power said something like council accepted correction elrond frodo looked aragorn seemed deep thought made sign heeded boromir's words debate ended merry pippin already asleep sam nodding night growing old

 `what ' asked sam handling one lay upon greensward
 `ropes indeed ' answered elf boats 'never travel far without rope one long strong light may help many needs'
 'you need tell ' said sam `i came without i've worried ever since wondering made knowing bit ropemaking family might say'
 `they made _hithlain_' said elf `but time instruct art making known craft delighted could taught much alas unless time return hither must content gift may serve well '

 fading crown twined golden elanor
 ships sing ship would come
 ship would bear ever back across wide sea

 aragorn stayed boat swanship drew alongside lady ended song greeted `we come bid last farewell' said `and speed blessings land'
 `though guests' said celeborn `you yet eaten us bid therefore parting feast flowing waters bear far l�rien'
 swan passed slowly hythe turned boats followed last end egladil upon green grass parting feast held frodo ate drank little heeding beauty lady voice seemed longer perilous terrible filled hidden power already seemed men later days elves still times seen present yet remote living vision already left far behind flowing streams time

 `then need say more' said celeborn 'but despise lore come distant years oft may chance old wives keep memory word things needful wise know'
 galadriel rose grass taking cup one maidens filled white mead gave celeborn
 'now time drink cup farewell' said `drink lord galadhrim let heart sad though night must follow noon already evening draweth nigh'

 aragorn answered 'lady know desire long held keeping treasure seek yet give even would darkness shall come it'

 suddenly river swept round bend banks rose upon either side light l�rien hidden fair land frodo never came
 travellers turned faces journey sun eyes dazzled filled tears gimli wept openly
 `i looked last upon fairest' said legolas companion `henceforward call nothing fair unless gift' put hand breast
 `tell legolas come quest little know chief peril lay truly elrond spoke saying could foresee might meet upon road torment dark danger feared hold back would come known danger light joy taken worst wound parting even go night straight dark lord alas gimli son gl�in '

 'but let us talk look boat low water baggage great river swift wish drown grief cold water' took paddle steered towards western bank following aragorn's boat ahead already moved middle stream
 company went long way wide hurrying waters borne ever southwards bare woods stalked along either bank could see glimpse lands behind breeze died away river flowed without sound voice bird broke silence sun grew misty day grew old gleamed pale sky like high white pearl faded west dusk came early followed grey starless night far dark quiet hours floated guiding boats overhanging shadows western woods great trees passed like ghosts thrusting twisted thirsty roots mist water dreary cold frodo sat listened faint lap gurgle river fretting among treeroots driftwood near shore head nodded fell uneasy sleep


 _chapter 9_
 great river

 frodo roused sam found lying well wrapped tall greyskinned trees quiet corner woodlands west bank great river anduin slept night away grey morning dim among bare branches gimli busy small fire near hand
 started day broad company eager hurry southwards content decision must make latest came rauros tindrock isle still lay days ahead let river bear pace desire hasten towards perils lay beyond whichever course took end aragorn let drift stream wished husbanding strength weariness come insisted least start early day journey far evening felt heart time pressing feared dark lord idle lingered l�rien
 nonetheless saw sign enemy day next dull grey hours passed without event third day voyage wore lands changed slowly trees thinned failed altogether eastern bank left saw long formless slopes stretching away toward sky brown withered looked fire passed leaving living blade green unfriendly waste without even broken tree bold stone relieve emptiness come brown lands lay vast desolate southern mirkwood hills emyn muil pestilence war evil deed enemy blasted region even aragorn could tell
 upon west right land treeless also flat many places green wide plains grass side river passed forests great reeds tall shut view west little boats went rustling along fluttering borders dark withered plumes bent tossed light cold airs hissing softly sadly openings frodo could catch sudden glimpses rolling meads far beyond hills sunset away edge sight dark line marched southernmost ranks misty mountains
 sign living moving things save birds many small fowl whistling piping reeds seldom seen twice travellers heard rush whine swanwings looking saw great phalanx streaming along sky
 `swans ' said sam `and mighty big ones '
 `yes' said aragorn 'and black swans'
 `how wide empty mournful country looks ' said frodo `i always imagined one journeyed south got warmer merrier winter left behind ever'
 'but journeyed far south yet' answered aragorn `it still winter far sea world cold sudden spring may yet snow far away bay belfalas anduin runs warm merry maybe would enemy sixty leagues guess south southfarthing away shire hundreds long miles yonder looking southwest across north plains riddermark rohan land horselords ere long shall come mouth limlight runs fangorn join great river north boundary rohan old lay limlight white mountains belonged rohirrim rich pleasant land grass rival evil days folk dwell river ride often shores anduin wide yet orcs shoot arrows far across stream late said dared cross water raid herds studs rohan'
 sam looked bank bank uneasily trees seemed hostile harboured secret eyes lurking dangers wished trees still felt company naked afloat little open boats midst shelterless lands river frontier war
 next day two went borne steadily southwards feeling insecurity grew company whole day took paddles hastened forward banks slid soon river broadened grew shallow long stony beaches lay upon east gravelshoals water careful steering needed brown lands rose bleak wolds flowed chill air east side meads become rolling downs withered grass amidst land fen tussock frodo shivered thinking lawns fountains clear sun gentle rains lothl�rien little speech laughter boats member company busy thoughts
 heart legolas running stars summer night northern glade amid beechwoods gimli fingering gold mind wondering fit wrought housing lady's gift merry pippin middle boat ill ease boromir sat muttering sometimes biting nails restlessness doubt consumed sometimes seizing paddle driving boat close behind aragorn's pippin sat bow looking back caught queer gleam eye peered forward gazing frodo sam long ago made mind though boats maybe dangerous brought believe far uncomfortable even imagined cramped miserable nothing stare winterlands crawling grey water either side even paddles use trust sam one
 dusk drew fourth day looking back bowed heads frodo aragorn following boats drowsy longed camp feel earth toes suddenly something caught sight first stared listlessly sat rubbed eyes looked could see

 night camped small eyot close western bank sam lay rolled blankets beside frodo `i funny dream hour two stopped mr frodo' said `or maybe dream funny anyway'
 `well ' said frodo knowing sam would settle told tale whatever 'i seen thought anything make smile since left lothl�rien'
 `it funny way mr frodo queer wrong dream best hear like saw log eyes '
 `the log's right' said frodo `there many river leave eyes '
 `that won't' said sam ` 'twas eyes made sit speak saw took log floating along halflight behind gimli's boat give much heed seemed log slowly catching us peculiar might say seeing floating stream together saw eyes two pale sort points shinylike hump near end log what's log paddlefeet like swan's almost seemed bigger kept dipping water
 'that's sat right rubbed eyes meaning give shout still rubbed drowse head whateveritwas coming along fast getting close behind gimli whether two lamps spotted moving staring whether came senses know looked yet think caught glimpse tail ofmy eye saying something dark shooting shadow bank see eyes though
 `i said "dreaming sam gamgee" said said i've thinking since i'm sure make mr frodo '
 'i make nothing log dusk sleep eyes sam said frodo first time eyes seen saw away back north reached l�rien saw strange creature eyes climbing flet night haldir saw remember report elves went orcband '
 `ah' said sam `i remember like thoughts thinking one thing another mr bilbo's stories fancy could put name creature guess nasty name gollum maybe '
 `yes feared time' said frodo `ever since night flet suppose lurking moria picked trail hoped stay l�rien would throw scent miserable creature must hiding woods silverlode watching us start '
 `that's it' said sam `and we'd better bit watchful we'll feel nasty fingers round necks one nights ever wake feel anything that's leading need trouble strider others tonight i'll keep watch sleep tomorrow luggage boat might say'
 `i might' said frodo `and might say "luggage eyes" shall watch promise wake halfway towards morning nothing happens then'
 dead hours frodo came deep dark sleep find sam shaking `it's shame wake you' whispered sam `but that's said there's nothing tell much thought heard soft plashing sniffing noise back hear lot queer sounds river night'
 lay frodo sat huddled blankets fought sleep minutes hours passed slowly nothing happened frodo yielding temptation lie dark shape hardly visible floated close one moored boats long whitish hand could dimly seen shot grabbed gunwale two pale lamplike eyes shone coldly peered inside lifted gazed frodo eyot yard two away frodo heard soft hiss intaken breath stood drawing sting sheath faced eyes immediately light shut another hiss splash dark logshape shot away downstream night aragorn stirred sleep turned sat up`
 'what ' whispered springing coming frodo `i felt something sleep drawn sword '
 `gollum' answered frodo 'or least guess'
 `ah ' said aragorn `so know little footpad padded us moria right nimrodel since took boats lying log paddling hands feet tried catch twice night slier fox slippery fish hoped rivervoyage would beat clever waterman
 `we shall try going faster tomorrow lie keep watch left night wish could lay hands wretch might make useful cannot shall try lose dangerous quite apart murder night account may put enemy track'
 night passed without gollum showing much shadow company kept sharp lookout saw gollum voyage lasted still following wary cunning aragorn's bidding paddled long spells banks went swiftly saw little country journeyed mostly night twilight resting day lying hidden land allowed way time passed without event seventh day
 weather still grey overcast wind east evening drew night sky away westward cleared pools faint light yellow pale green opened grey shores cloud white rind new moon could seen glimmering remote lakes sam looked puckered brows
 next day country either side began change rapidly banks began rise grow stony soon passing hilly rocky land shores steep slopes buried deep brakes thorn sloe tangled brambles creepers behind stood low crumbling cliffs chimneys grey weathered stone dark ivy beyond rose high ridges crowned windwrithen firs drawing near grey hillcountry emyn muil southern march wilderland
 many birds cliffs rockchimneys day high air flocks birds circling black pale sky lay camp day aragorn watched flights doubtfully wondering gollum mischief news voyage moving wilderness later sun setting company stirring getting ready start descried dark spot fading light great bird high far wheeling flying slowly southwards
 'what legolas ' asked pointing northern sky 'is think eagle '
 'yes' said legolas `it eagle hunting eagle wonder forebodes far mountains'
 `we start fully dark' said aragorn

 eighth night journey came silent windless grey east wind passed away thin crescent moon fallen early pale sunset sky clear though far away south great ranges cloud still shone faintly west stars glinted bright
 `come ' said aragorn `we venture one journey night coming reaches river know well never journeyed water parts rapids sarn gebir right reckoning still many miles ahead still dangerous places even come rocks stony eyots stream must keep sharp watch try paddle swiftly'
 sam leading boat given task watchman lay forward peering gloom night grew dark stars strangely bright glimmer face river close midnight drifting hardly using paddles suddenly sam cried yards ahead dark shapes loomed stream heard swirl racing water swift current swung left towards eastern shore channel clear swept aside travellers could see close pale foam river lashing sharp rocks thrust far stream like ridge teeth boats huddled together
 `hoy aragorn ' shouted boromir boat bumped leader `this madness cannot dare rapids night boat live sarn gebir night day'
 `back back ' cried aragorn 'turn turn ' drove paddle water trying hold boat bring round
 'i reckoning' said frodo 'i know come far anduin flows faster thought sarn gebir must close hand already'
 great efforts checked boats slowly brought first could make small headway current time carried nearer nearer eastern bank dark ominous loomed night
 'all together paddle ' shouted boromir 'paddle shall driven shoals' even spoke frodo felt keel beneath grate upon stone
 moment twang bowstrings several arrows whistled fell among one smote frodo shoulders lurched forward cry letting go paddle arrow fell back foiled hidden coat mail another passed aragorn's hood third stood fast gunwale second boat close merry's hand sam thought could glimpse black figures running fro upon long shinglebanks lay eastern shore seemed near
 `_yrch_' said legolas falling tongue
 `orcs ' cried gimli
 `gollum's i'll bound' said sam frodo `and nice place choose river seems set taking us right arms '
 leaned forward straining paddles even sam took hand every moment expected feel bite blackfeathered arrows many whined overhead struck water nearby hits dark dark nighteyes orcs starglimmer must offered cunning foes mark unless grey cloaks l�rien grey timber elfwrought boats defeated malice archers mordor
 stroke stroke laboured darkness hard sure indeed moving slowly swirl water grew less shadow eastern bank faded back night last far could judge reached middle stream driven boats back distance jutting rocks half turning thrust strength towards western shore shadow bushes leaning water halted drew breath
 legolas laid paddle took bow brought l�rien sprang ashore climbed paces bank stringing bow fitting arrow turned peering back river darkness across water shrill cries nothing could seen
 frodo looked elf standing tall gazed night seeking mark shoot head dark crowned sharp white stars glittered black pools sky behind rising sailing south great clouds advanced sending dark outriders starry fields sudden dread fell company
 `_elbereth gilthoniel_' sighed legolas looked even dark shape like cloud yet cloud moved far swiftly came blackness south sped towards company blotting light approached soon appeared great winged creature blacker pits night fierce voices rose greet across water frodo felt sudden chill running clutching heart deadly cold like memory old wound shoulder crouched hide
 suddenly great bow l�rien sang shrill went arrow elvenstring frodo looked almost winged shape swerved harsh croaking scream fell air vanishing gloom eastern shore sky clean tumult many voices far away cursing wailing darkness silence neither shaft cry came east night
 aragorn led boats back upstream felt way along water's edge distance found small shallow bay low trees grew close water behind rose steep rocky bank company decided stay await dawn useless attempt move night made camp lit fire lay huddled boats moored close together
 'praised bow galadriel hand eye legolas ' said gimli munched wafer _lembas_ 'that mighty shot dark friend'
 'but say hit' said legolas
 'i cannot' said gimli `but glad shadow came nearer liked much reminded shadow moria � shadow balrog' ended whisper
 'it balrog' said frodo still shivering chill come upon 'it something colder think ' paused fell silent
 'what think ' asked boromir eagerly leaning boat trying catch glimpse frodo's face
 `i think � say' answered frodo `whatever fall dismayed enemies'
 `so seems' said aragorn `yet many next know night must sleepless dark hides us day show tell weapons close hand '
 sam sat tapping hilt sword counting fingers looking sky `it's strange' murmured `the moon's shire wilderland ought either running i'm wrong reckoning remember mr frodo moon waning lay flet tree week full reckon we'd week way last night pops new moon thin nailparing never stayed time elvish country
 `well remember three nights certain seem remember several would take oath never whole month anyone would think time count '
 `and perhaps way it' said frodo `in land maybe time elsewhere long gone think silverlode bore us back anduin returned time flows mortal lands great sea remember moon either new old caras galadhon stars night sun day'
 legolas stirred boat `nay time tarry ever' said `but change growth things places alike elves world moves moves swift slow swift change little else fleets grief slow count running years passing seasons ripples ever repeated long long stream yet beneath sun things must wear end last'
 `but wearing slow l�rien' said frodo `the power lady rich hours though short seem caras galadhon galadriel wields elvenring'
 'that said outside l�rien even me' said aragorn `speak sam land lost count time flowed swiftly us elves old moon passed new moon waxed waned world outside tarried yestereve new moon came winter nearly gone time flows spring little hope'
 night passed silently voice call heard across water travellers huddled boats felt changing weather air grew warm still great moist clouds floated south distant seas rushing river rocks rapids seemed grow louder closer twigs trees began drip
 day came mood world become soft sad slowly dawn grew pale light diffused shadowless mist river white fog swathed shore far bank could seen
 `i can't abide fog' said sam `but seems lucky one perhaps get away without cursed goblins seeing us'
 `perhaps so' said aragorn `but hard find path unless fog lifts little later must find path pass sarn gebir come emyn muil'
 'i see pass rapids follow river further' said boromir `if emyn muil lie us abandon cockleboats strike westward southward come entwash cross land'
 `we making minas tirith' said aragorn `but yet agreed course may perilous sounds vale entwash flat fenny fog deadly peril foot laden would abandon boats must river least path cannot missed'
 `but enemy holds eastern bank' objected boromir `and even pass gates argonath come unmolested tindrock leap falls land marshes '
 `no ' answered aragorn `say rather bear boats ancient way raurosfoot take water know boromir choose forget north stair high seat upon amon hen made days great kings least mind stand high place decide course maybe shall see sign guide us'
 boromir held long choice became plain frodo would follow aragorn wherever went gave 'it way men minas tirith desert friends need' said `and need strength ever reach tindrock tall isle go shall turn home alone help earned reward companionship'
 day growing fog lifted little decided aragorn legolas go forward along shore others remained boats aragorn hoped find way could carry boats baggage smoother water beyond rapids
 `boats elves would sink maybe' said `but say come sarn gebir alive none ever done yet road made men gondor region even great days realm reach anduin beyond emyn muil portageway somewhere western shore find cannot yet perished light boats used journey wilderland osgiliath still years ago orcs mordor began multiply'
 'seldom life boat come north orcs prowl eastshore' said boromir `if go forward peril grow every mile even find path'
 `peril lies ahead every southward road' answered aragorn `wait us one day return time know evil indeed befallen us must take new leader follow best can'
 heavy heart frodo saw aragorn legolas climb steep bank vanish mists fears proved groundless two three hours passed barely midday shadowy shapes explorers appeared
 `all well' said aragorn clambered bank 'there track leads good landing still serviceable distance great head rapids half mile us little mile long far beyond stream becomes clear smooth though runs swiftly hardest task get boats baggage old portageway found lies well back waterside runs lee rockwall furlong shore find northward landing lies still remains must passed yesterday night might labour far upstream yet miss fog fear must leave river make portageway best here'
 `that would easy even men' said boromir
 `yet try it' said aragorn
 'aye will' said gimli `the legs men lag rough road dwarf goes burden twice weight master boromir '
 task proved hard indeed yet end done goods taken boats brought top bank level space boats drawn water carried far less heavy expected tree growing elvish country made even legolas knew wood tough yet strangely light merry pippin alone could carry boat ease along flat nonetheless needed strength two men lift haul ground company cross sloped away river tumbled waste grey limestoneboulders many hidden holes shrouded weeds bushes thickets brambles sheer dells boggy pools fed waters trickling terraces inland
 one one boromir aragorn carried boats others toiled scrambled baggage last removed laid portageway little hindrance save sprawling briars many fallen stones moved forward together fog still hung veils upon crumbling rockwall left mist shrouded river could hear rushing foaming sharp shelves stony teeth sarn gebir could see twice made journey brought safe southern landing
 portageway turning back waterside ran gently shallow edge little pool seemed scooped riverside hand water swirling sarn gebir low pier rock jutted way stream beyond shore rose sheer grey cliff passage foot
 already short afternoon past dim cloudy dusk closing sat beside water listening confused rush roar rapids hidden mist tired sleepy hearts gloomy dying day
 'well must pass another night' said boromir `we need sleep even aragorn mind pass gates argonath night tiredexcept doubt sturdy dwarf'
 gimli made reply nodding sat
 `let us rest much now' said aragorn `tomorrow must journey day unless weather changes cheats us shall good chance slipping unseen eyes eastern shore tonight two must watch together turns three hours one guard'
 nothing happened night worse brief drizzle rain hour dawn soon fully light started already fog thinning kept close could western side could see dim shapes low cliffs rising ever higher shadowy walls feet hurrying river midmorning clouds drew lower began rain heavily drew skincovers boats prevent flooded drifted little could seen grey falling curtains
 rain however last long slowly sky grew lighter suddenly clouds broke draggled fringes trailed away northward river fogs mists gone travellers lay wide ravine great rocky sides clung upon shelves narrow crevices thrawn trees channel grew narrower river swifter speeding along little hope stopping turning whatever might meet ahead lane paleblue sky around dark overshadowed river black shutting sun hills emyn muil opening could seen
 frodo peering forward saw distance two great rocks approaching like great pinnacles pillars stone seemed tall sheer ominous stood upon either side stream narrow gap appeared river swept boats towards
 `behold argonath pillars kings ' cried aragorn `we shall pass soon keep boats line far apart hold middle stream '
 frodo borne towards great pillars rose like towers meet giants seemed vast grey figures silent threatening saw indeed shaped fashioned craft power old wrought upon still preserved suns rains forgotten years mighty likenesses hewn upon great pedestals founded deep waters stood two great kings stone still blurred eyes crannied brows frowned upon north left hand raised palm outwards gesture warning right hand axe upon head crumbling helm crown great power majesty still wore silent wardens longvanished kingdom awe fear fell upon frodo cowered shutting eyes daring look boat drew near even boromir bowed head boats whirled frail fleeting little leaves enduring shadow sentinels n�menor passed dark chasm gates
 sheer rose dreadful cliffs unguessed heights either side far dim sky black waters roared echoed wind screamed frodo crouching knees heard sam front muttering groaning `what place horrible place let get boat i'll never wet toes puddle let alone river '
 `fear ' said strange voice behind frodo turned saw strider yet strider weatherworn ranger longer stern sat aragorn son arathorn proud erect guiding boat skilful strokes hood cast back dark hair blowing wind light eyes king returning exile land
 'fear ' said `long desired look upon likenesses isildur an�rion sires old shadow elessar elfstone son arathorn house valandil isildur's son heir elendil nought dread '
 light eyes faded spoke `would gandalf heart yearns minas anor walls city whither shall go '
 chasm long dark filled noise wind rushing water echoing stone bent somewhat towards west first dark ahead soon frodo saw tall gap light ever growing swiftly drew near suddenly boats shot wide clear light
 sun already long fallen noon shining windy sky pent waters spread long oval lake pale nen hithoel fenced steep grey hills whose sides clad trees heads bare coldgleaming sunlight far southern end rose three peaks midmost stood somewhat forward others sundered island waters flowing river flung pale shimmering arms distant deep came wind roaring sound like roll thunder heard far away
 `behold tol brandir ' said aragorn pointing south tall peak 'upon left stands amon lhaw upon right amon hen hills hearing sight days great kings high seats upon watch kept said foot man beast ever set upon tol brandir ere shade night falls shall come hear endless voice rauros calling'
 company rested drifting south current flowed middle lake ate food took paddles hastened way sides westward hills fell shadow sun grew round red misty star peered three peaks loomed darkling twilight rauros roaring great voice already night laid flowing waters travellers came last shadow hills
 tenth day journey wilderland behind could go without choice eastway west last stage quest


 _chapter 10_
 breaking fellowship

 aragorn led right arm river upon western side shadow tol brandir green lawn ran water feet amon hen behind rose first gentle slopes hill clad trees trees marched away westward along curving shores lake little spring fell tumbling fed grass
 'here rest tonight' said aragorn `this lawn parth galen fair place summer days old let us hope evil yet come here'
 drew boats green banks beside made camp set watch sight sound enemies gollum contrived follow remained unseen unheard nonetheless night wore aragorn grew uneasy tossing often sleep waking small hours got came frodo whose turn watch
 `why waking ' asked frodo `it watch'
 `i know' answered aragorn `but shadow threat growing sleep would well draw sword'
 `why ' said frodo `are enemies hand '
 `let us see sting may show' answered aragorn
 frodo drew elfblade sheath dismay edges gleamed dimly night `orcs ' said `not near yet near seems'
 `i feared much' said aragorn `but maybe side river light sting faint may point spies mordor roaming slopes amon lhaw never heard orcs upon amon hen yet knows may happen evil days minas tirith longer holds secure passages anduin must go warily tomorrow'
 day came like fire smoke low east black bars cloud like fumes great burning rising sun lit beneath flames murky red soon climbed clear sky summit tol brandir tipped gold frodo looked eastward gazed tall island sides sprang sheer running water high tall cliffs steep slopes upon trees climbed mounting one head another grey faces inaccessible rock crowned great spire stone many birds circling sign living things could seen
 eaten aragorn called company together `the day come last' said 'the day choice long delayed shall become company travelled far fellowship shall turn west boromir go wars gondor turn east fear shadow shall break fellowship go way may choose whatever must done soon cannot long halt enemy eastern shore know fear orcs may already side water'
 long silence one spoke moved
 'well frodo' said aragorn last `i fear burden laid upon bearer appointed council way alone choose matter cannot advise gandalf though tried bear part know design hope hour indeed likely seems choice would still wait fate'
 frodo answer spoke slowly `i know haste needed yet cannot choose burden heavy give hour longer speak let alone '
 aragorn looked kindly pity `very well frodo son drogo' said `you shall hour shall alone stay stray far call'
 frodo sat moment head bowed sam watching master great concern shook head muttered 'plain pikestaff good sam gamgee putting spoke now' 
 presently frodo got walked away sam saw others restrained stare eyes boromir followed frodo intently passed sight trees foot amon hen
 wandering aimlessly first wood frodo found feet leading towards slopes hill came path dwindling ruins road long ago steep places stairs stone hewn cracked worn split roots trees climbed caring way went came grassy place rowantrees grew midst wide flat stone little upland lawn open upon east filled early sunlight frodo halted looked river far tol brandir birds wheeling great gulf air untrodden isle voice rauros mighty roaring mingled deep throbbing boom
 sat upon stone cupped chin hands staring eastwards seeing little eyes happened since bilbo left shire passing mind recalled pondered everything could remember gandalf's words time went still nearer choice
 suddenly awoke thoughts strange feeling came something behind unfriendly eyes upon sprang turned saw surprise boromir face smiling kind
 `i afraid frodo' said coming forward `if aragorn right orcs near none us wander alone least much depends heart heavy may stay talk since found would comfort many speech becomes debate without end two together may perhaps find wisdom'
 `you kind' answered frodo 'but think speech help know afraid boromir afraid'
 boromir stood silent rauros roared endlessly wind murmured branches trees frodo shivered
 suddenly boromir came sat beside `are sure suffer needlessly ' said `i wish help need counsel hard choice take mine '
 'i think know already counsel would give boromir' said frodo 'and would seem like wisdom warning heart'
 `warning warning ' said boromir sharply
 'against delay way seems easier refusal burden laid againstwell must said trust strength truth men'
 `yet strength long protected far away little country though knew not'
 'i doubt valour people world changing walls minas tirith may strong strong enough fail '
 'we shall fall battle valiantly yet still hope fail'
 'no hope ring lasts' said frodo
 'ah ring ' said boromir eyes lighting 'the ring strange fate suffer much fear doubt small thing small thing seen instant house elrond could sight '
 frodo looked heart went suddenly cold caught strange gleam boromir's eyes yet face still kind friendly 'it best lie hidden' answered
 'as wish care not' said boromir 'yet may even speak seem ever think power hands enemy evil uses good world changing say minas tirith fall ring lasts certainly ring enemy us '
 'were council ' answered frodo `because cannot use done turns evil'
 boromir got walked impatiently 'so go on' cried 'gandalf elrond � folk taught say may right elves halfelves wizards would come grief perhaps yet often doubt wise merely timid kind truehearted men corrupted minas tirith staunch long years trial desire power wizardlords strength defend strength cause behold need chance brings light ring power gift say gift foes mordor mad use use power enemy fearless ruthless alone achieve victory could warrior hour great leader could aragorn refuses boromir ring would give power command would drive hosts mordor men would flock banner'
 boromir strode speaking ever loudly almost seemed forgotten frodo talk dwelt walls weapons mustering men drew plans great alliances glorious victories cast mordor became mighty king benevolent wise suddenly stopped waved arms
 'and tell us throw away' cried `i say _destroy_ might well reason could show hope plan proposed us halfling walk blindly mordor offer enemy every chance recapturing folly
 'surely see friend' said turning suddenly frodo `you say afraid boldest pardon really good sense revolts'
 'no afraid' said frodo 'simply afraid glad heard speak fully mind clearer now'
 `then come minas tirith ' cried boromir eyes shining face eager
 `you misunderstand me' said frodo
 'but come least ' boromir persisted 'my city far little mordor long wilderness need news enemy make move come frodo' said `you need rest venture go must' laid hand hobbit's shoulder friendly fashion frodo felt hand trembling suppressed excitement stepped quickly away eyed alarm tall man nearly twice height many times match strength
 `why unfriendly ' said boromir `i true man neither thief tracker need ring know give word desire keep least let make trial plan lend ring '
 `no ' cried frodo 'the council laid upon bear it'
 `it folly enemy defeat us' cried boromir `how angers fool obstinate fool running wilfully death ruining cause mortals claim ring men n�menor halflings save unhappy chance might mine mine give '
 frodo answer moved away till great flat stone stood `come come friend ' said boromir softer voice 'why get rid free doubt fear lay blame say strong took force strong halfling' cried suddenly sprang stone leaped frodo fair pleasant face hideously changed raging fire eyes
 frodo dodged aside put stone one thing could trembling pulled ring upon chain quickly slipped finger even boromir sprang man gasped stared moment amazed ran wildly seeking among rocks trees
 'miserable trickster' shouted `let get hands see mind take ring sauron sell us waited chance leave us lurch curse halflings death darkness ' catching foot stone fell sprawling lay upon face still curse struck suddenly wept
 rose passed hand eyes dashing away tears 'what said ' cried `what done frodo frodo ' called 'come back madness took passed come back '
 answer frodo even hear cries already far away leaping blindly path hilltop terror grief shook seeing thought mad fierce face boromir burning eyes
 soon came alone summit amon hen halted gasping breath saw mist wide flat circle paved mighty flags surrounded crumbling battlement middle set upon four carven pillars high seat reached stair many steps went sat upon ancient chair feeling like lost child clambered upon throne mountainkings
 first could see little seemed world mist shadows ring upon mist gave way saw many visions small clear eyes upon table yet remote sound bright living images world seemed shrunk fallen silent sitting upon seat seeing amon hen hill eye men n�menor eastward looked wide uncharted lands nameless plains forests unexplored northward looked great river lay like ribbon beneath misty mountains stood small hard broken teeth westward looked saw broad pastures rohan orthanc pinnacle isengard like black spike southward looked feet great river curled like toppling wave plunged falls rauros foaming pit glimmering rainbow played upon fume ethir anduin saw mighty delta river myriads seabirds whirling like white dust sun beneath green silver sea rippling endless lines
 everywhere looked saw signs war misty mountains crawling like anthills orcs issuing thousand holes boughs mirkwood deadly strife elves men fell beasts land beornings aflame cloud moria smoke rose borders l�rien
 horsemen galloping grass rohan wolves poured isengard havens harad ships war put sea east men moving endlessly swordsmen spearmen bowmen upon horses chariots chieftains laden wains power dark lord motion turning south beheld minas tirith far away seemed beautiful whitewalled manytowered proud fair upon mountainseat battlements glittered steel turrets bright many banners hope leaped heart minas tirith set another fortress greater strong thither eastward unwilling eye drawn passed ruined bridges osgiliath grinning gates minas morgul haunted mountains looked upon gorgoroth valley terror land mordor darkness lay sun fire glowed amid smoke mount doom burning great reek rising last gaze held wall upon wall battlement upon battlement black immeasurably strong mountain iron gate steel tower adamant saw baradd�r fortress sauron hope left
 suddenly felt eye eye dark tower sleep knew become aware gaze fierce eager leaped towards almost like finger felt searching soon would nail know exactly amon lhaw touched glanced upon tol brandir threw seat crouching covering head grey hood
 heard crying _never never_or _verily come come you_ could tell flash point power came mind another thought _take take fool take take ring_
 two powers strove moment perfectly balanced piercing points writhed tormented suddenly aware frodo neither voice eye free choose one remaining instant took ring finger kneeling clear sunlight high seat black shadow seemed pass like arm missed amon hen groped west faded sky clean blue birds sang every tree
 frodo rose feet great weariness firm heart lighter spoke aloud `i must' said 'this least plain evil ring already work even company ring must leave harm go alone cannot trust trust dear poor old sam merry pippin strider heart yearns minas tirith needed boromir fallen evil go alone once'
 went quickly path came back lawn boromir found halted listening thought could hear cries calls woods near shore
 'they'll hunting me' said `i wonder long away hours think' hesitated 'what ' muttered 'i must go shall never go get chance hate leaving like without explanation surely understand sam else do'
 slowly drew ring put vanished passed hill less rustle wind
 others remained long riverside time silent moving restlessly sitting circle talking every made efforts speak things long road many adventures questioned aragorn concerning realm gondor ancient history remnants great works could still seen strange borderland emyn muil stone kings seats lhaw hen great stair beside falls rauros always thoughts words strayed back frodo ring would frodo choose hesitating
 `he debating course desperate think' said aragorn 'and well may hopeless ever company go east since tracked gollum must fear secret journey already betrayed minas tirith nearer fire destruction burden
 `we may remain make brave stand lord denethor men cannot hope even elrond said beyond power either keep burden secret hold full might enemy comes take way would us choose frodo's place know indeed miss gandalf most'
 'grievous loss' said legolas 'yet must needs make minds without aid cannot decide help frodo let us call back vote vote minas tirith'
 `and i' said gimli 'we course sent help bearer along road go wished none us oath command seek mount doom hard parting lothl�rien yet come far say reached last choice clear cannot leave frodo would choose minas tirith follow him'
 `and go him' said legolas `it would faithless say farewell'
 'it would indeed betrayal left him' said aragorn 'but goes east need go think venture desperate much eight three two one alone would let choose appoint three companions sam could bear otherwise gimli boromir return city father people need others go least meriadoc peregrin legolas willing leave us'
 `that ' cried merry 'we can't leave frodo pippin always intended go wherever went still realize would mean seemed different far away shire rivendell would mad cruel let frodo go mordor can't stop him'
 'we must stop him' said pippin `and worrying sure knows agree going east like ask anyone go poor old fellow imagine going mordor alone ' pippin shuddered 'but dear silly old hobbit ought know got ask ought know can't stop leave him'
 'begging pardon' said sam 'i think understand master hesitating way go course what's good minas tirith anyway mean begging pardon master boromir' added turned discovered boromir first sitting silent outside circle longer
 `now where's got ' cried sam looking worried 'he's bit queer lately mind anyway he's business he's home always said blame mr frodo knows he's got find cracks doom he's _afraid_ come point he's plain terrified that's trouble course he's bit schooling speakwe havesince left home he'd terrified he'd fling ring river bolt he's still frightened start worrying us either whether we'll go along knows mean that's another thing that's bothering screws go he'll want go alone mark words we're going trouble comes back he'll screw right sure name's baggins'
 'i believe speak wisely us sam' said aragorn `and shall prove right '
 'stop let go ' cried pippin
 'i wonder ' said aragorn `he bearer fate burden think part drive one way think succeed tried powers work far stronger'
 `well wish frodo would "screw up" come back let us get over' said pippin `this waiting horrible surely time '
 `yes' said aragorn 'the hour long passed morning wearing away must call him'
 moment boromir reappeared came trees walked towards without speaking face looked grim sad paused counting present sat aloof eyes ground
 `where boromir ' asked aragorn `have seen frodo '
 boromir hesitated second `yes no' answered slowly `yes found way hill spoke urged come minas tirith go east grew angry left vanished never seen thing happen though heard tales must put ring could find thought would return you'
 'is say ' said aragorn looking hard kindly boromir
 `yes' answered `i say yet'
 `this bad' cried sam jumping `i know man mr frodo put thing ought goodness knows may happened'
 'but keep on`' said merry `not escaped unwelcome visitor like bilbo used to'
 `but go ' cried pippin 'he's away ages now'
 `how long since saw frodo last boromir ' asked aragorn
 `half hour maybe' answered `or might hour wandered time since know know ' put head hands sat bowed grief
 `an hour since vanished ' shouted sam `we must try find come '
 `wait moment ' cried aragorn `we must divide pairs arrangehere hold wait '
 good took notice sam dashed first merry pippin followed already disappearing westward trees shore shouting _frodo frodo_ clear high hobbitvoices legolas gimli running sudden panic madness seemed fallen company
 `we shall scattered lost' groaned aragorn `boromir know part played mischief help go two young hobbits guard least even cannot find frodo come back spot find traces shall return soon'

 aragorn sprang swiftly away went pursuit sam reached little lawn among rowans overtook toiling uphill panting calling _frodo_
 `come sam ' said `none us alone mischief feel going top seat amon hen see may seen look heart guessed frodo went way follow keep eyes open ' sped path
 sam best could keep strider ranger soon fell behind gone far aragorn sight ahead sam stopped puffed suddenly clapped hand head
 `whoa sam gamgee ' said aloud `your legs short use head let see boromir lying that's way told us everything something scared mr frodo badly screwed point sudden made mind last go east without sam yes without even sam that's hard cruel hard'
 sam passed hand eyes brushing away tears 'steady gamgee ' said `think can't fly across rivers can't jump waterfalls he's got gear he's got get back boats back boats back boats sam like lightning '
 sam turned bolted back path fell cut knees got ran came edge lawn parth galen shore boats drawn water one seemed cries woods behind heed stood gazing moment stockstill gaping boat sliding bank shout sam raced across grass boat slipped water
 `coming mr frodo coming ' called sam flung bank clutching departing boat missed yard cry splash fell face downward deep swift water gurgling went river closed curly head
 exclamation dismay came empty boat paddle swirled boat put frodo time grasp sam hair came bubbling struggling fear staring round brown eyes
 `up come sam lad ' said frodo `now take hand '
 `save mr frodo ' gasped sam `i'm drownded can't see hand'
 `here pinch lad let go tread water flounder upset boat get hold side let use paddle '
 strokes frodo brought boat back bank sam able scramble wet waterrat frodo took ring stepped ashore
 `of confounded nuisances worst sam ' said
 'oh mr frodo that's hard ' said sam shivering `that's hard trying go without guessed right would '
 `safely way'
 `safely ' said sam `all alone without help borne it'd death me'
 'it would death come sam' said frodo could borne that'
 `not certain left behind' said sam
 `but going mordor'
 `i know well enough mr frodo course i'm coming you'
 `now sam' said frodo `don't hinder others coming back minute catch shall argue explain shall never heart chance get must go way'
 `of course is' answered sam 'but alone i'm coming neither us going i'll knock holes boats first'
 frodo actually laughed sudden warmth gladness touched heart `leave one 'he said `we'll need can't come like without gear food anything'
 'just hold moment i'll get stuff' cried sam eagerly 'it's ready thought today' rushed camping place fished pack pile frodo laid emptied boat companions' goods grabbed spare blanket extra packages food ran back
 `so plan spoilt ' said frodo `it good trying escape i'm glad sam cannot tell glad come along plain meant go together go may others find safe road strider look suppose shall see again'
 `yet may mr frodo may' said sam

 frodo sam set last stage quest together frodo paddled away shore river bore swiftly away western arm past frowning cliffs tol brandir roar great falls drew nearer even help sam could give hard work pass across current southward end island drive boat eastward towards far shore
 length came land upon southern slopes amon lhaw found shelving shore drew boat high water hid well could behind great boulder shouldering burdens set seeking path would bring grey hills emyn muil land shadow

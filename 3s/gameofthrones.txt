 “she blood old enough khal” illyrio told first time “look silvergold hair purple eyes… blood old valyria doubt doubt… highborn daughter old king sister new cannot fail entrance drogo” released hand daenerys found trembling

 “i suppose” brother said doubtfully “the savages queer tastes boys horses sheep…”

 “best suggest khal drogo” illyrio said

 anger flashed brother’s lilac eyes “do take fool”

 magister bowed slightly “i take king kings lack caution common men apologies given offense” turned away clapped hands bearers

 streets pentos pitchdark set illyrio’s elaborately carved palanquin two servants went ahead light way carrying ornate oil lanterns panes pale blue glass dozen strong men hoisted poles shoulders warm close inside behind curtains dany could smell stench illyrio’s pallid flesh heavy perfumes

 brother sprawled pillows beside never noticed mind away across narrow sea “we won’t need whole khalasar” viserys said fingers toyed hilt borrowed blade though dany knew never used sword earnest “ten thousand would enough could sweep seven kingdoms ten thousand dothraki screamers realm rise rightful king tyrell redwyne darry greyjoy love usurper dornishmen burn avenge elia children smallfolk us cry king” looked illyrio anxiously “they don’t they”

 “they people love well” magister illyrio said amiably “in holdfasts across realm men lift secret toasts health women sew dragon banners hide day return across water” gave massive shrug “or agents tell me”

 dany agents way knowing anyone thinking across narrow sea mistrusted illyrio’s sweet words mistrusted everything illyrio brother nodding eagerly however “i shall kill usurper myself” promised never killed anyone “as killed brother rhaegar lannister kingslayer father”

 “that would fitting” magister illyrio said dany saw smallest hint smile playing around full lips brother notice nodding pushed back curtain stared night dany knew fighting battle trident

 ninetowered manse khal drogo sat beside waters bay high brick walls overgrown pale ivy given khal magisters pentos illyrio told free cities always generous horselords “it fear barbarians” illyrio would explain smile “the lord light would hold city walls million dothraki red priests promise… yet take chances friendship comes cheap”

 palanquin stopped gate curtains pulled roughly back one house guards copper skin dark almond eyes dothraki face hairless wore spiked bronze cap unsullied looked coldly magister illyrio growled something rough dothraki tongue guardsman replied voice waved gates

 dany noticed brother’s hand clenched tightly around hilt borrowed sword looked almost frightened felt “insolent eunuch” viserys muttered palanquin lurched toward manse

 magister illyrio’s words honey “many important men feast tonight men enemies khal must protect guests chief among grace doubt usurper would pay well head”

 “oh yes” viserys said darkly “he tried illyrio promise hired knives follow us everywhere last dragon sleep easy live”

 palanquin slowed stopped curtains thrown back slave offered hand help daenerys collar noted ordinary bronze brother followed one hand still clenched hard around sword hilt took two strong men get magister illyrio back feet

 inside manse air heavy scent spices pinchfire sweet lemon cinnamon escorted across entry hall mosaic colored glass depicted doom valyria oil burned black iron lanterns along walls beneath arch twining stone leaves eunuch sang coming “viserys house targaryen third name” called high sweet voice “king andals rhoynar first men lord seven kingdoms protector realm sister daenerys stormborn princess dragonstone honorable host illyrio mopatis magister free city pentos”

 stepped past eunuch pillared courtyard overgrown pale ivy moonlight painted leaves shades bone silver guests drifted among many dothraki horselords big men redbrown skin drooping mustachios bound metal rings black hair oiled braided hung bells yet among moved bravos sellswords pentos myr tyrosh red priest even fatter illyrio hairy men port ibben lords summer isles skin black ebony daenerys looked wonder… realized sudden start fear woman

 illyrio whispered “those three drogo’s bloodriders there” said “by pillar khal moro son rhogoro man green beard brother archon tyrosh man behind ser jorah mormont”

 last name caught daenerys “a knight”

 “no less” illyrio smiled beard “anointed seven oils high septon himself”

 “what here” blurted

 “the usurper wanted head” illyrio told “some trifling affront sold poachers tyroshi slaver instead giving night’s watch absurd law man able likes chattel”

 “i shall wish speak ser jorah night done” brother said dany found looking knight curiously older man past forty balding still strong fit instead silks cottons wore wool leather tunic dark green embroidered likeness black bear standing two legs

 still looking strange man homeland never known magister illyrio placed moist hand bare shoulder “over sweet princess” whispered “there khal himself”

 dany wanted run hide brother looking displeased knew would wake dragon anxiously turned looked man viserys hoped would ask wed night done

 slave girl far wrong thought khal drogo head taller tallest man room yet somehow light feet graceful panther illyrio’s menagerie younger she’d thought thirty skin color polished copper thick mustachios bound gold bronze rings

 “i must go make submissions” magister illyrio said “wait shall bring you”

 brother took arm illyrio waddled khal fingers squeezing hard hurt “do see braid sweet sister”

 drogo’s braid black midnight heavy scented oil hung tiny bells rang softly moved swung well past belt even buttocks end brushing back thighs

 “you see long is” viserys said “when dothraki defeated combat cut braids disgrace world know shame khal drogo never lost fight aegon dragonlord come queen”

 dany looked khal drogo face hard cruel eyes cold dark onyx brother hurt sometimes woke dragon frighten way man frightened “i don’t want queen” heard say small thin voice “please please viserys don’t want want go home”

 “home” kept voice low could hear fury tone “how go home sweet sister took home us” drew shadows sight fingers digging skin “how go home” repeated meaning king’s landing dragonstone realm lost

 dany meant rooms illyrio’s estate true home surely though brother want hear home even big house red door home fingers dug hard arm demanding answer “i don’t know…”she said last voice breaking tears welled eyes

 “i do” said sharply “we go home army sweet sister khal drogo’s army go home must wed bed will” smiled “i’d let whole khalasar fuck need sweet sister forty thousand men horses took get army grateful drogo time may even learn like dry eyes illyrio bringing see crying”

 dany turned saw true magister illyrio smiles bows escorting khal drogo stood brushed away unfallen tears back hand

 “smile” viserys whispered nervously hand failing hilt sword “and stand straight let see breasts gods know little enough is”

 daenerys smiled stood straight

 king touched cheek fingers brushing across rough stone gently living flesh “i vowed kill rhaegar her”

 “you did” ned reminded

 “only once” robert said bitterly

 “in dreams kill every night” robert admitted “a thousand deaths still less deserves”

 nothing ned could say quiet said “we return grace wife waiting”

 “the others take wife” robert muttered sourly started back way come footsteps falling heavily “and hear ‘your grace’ i’ll head spike that”

 “i forgotten” ned replied quietly king answer said “tell jon”

 robert shook head “i never seen man sicken quickly gave tourney son’s name day seen jon would sworn would live forever fortnight later dead sickness like fire gut burned right him” paused beside pillar tomb longdead stark “i loved old man”

 “we did” ned paused moment “catelyn fears sister lysa bear grief”

 robert’s mouth gave bitter twist “not well truth” admitted “i think losing jon driven woman mad ned taken boy back eyrie wishes hoped foster tywin lannister casterly rock jon brothers sons supposed leave raised women”

 ned would sooner entrust child pit viper lord tywin left doubts unspoken old wounds never truly heal bleed slightest word “the wife lost husband” said carefully “perhaps mother feared lose son boy young”

 “six sickly lord eyrie gods mercy” king swore “lord tywin never taken ward lysa ought honored lannisters great noble house refused even hear left dead night without much byyourleave cersei furious” sighed deeply “the boy namesake know robert arryn sworn protect mother steals away”

 “i take ward wish” ned said “lysa consent catelyn close girls would welcome well”

 “a generous offer friend” king said “but late lord tywin already given consent fostering boy elsewhere would grievous affront him”

 “i concern nephew’s welfare lannister pride” ned declared

 “that sleep lannister” robert laughed sound rattling among tombs bouncing vaulted ceiling smile flash white teeth thicket huge black beard “ah ned” said “you still serious” put massive arm around ned’s shoulders “i planned wait days speak see there’s need come walk me”

 started back pillars blind stone eyes seemed follow passed king kept arm around ned’s shoulder “you must wondered finally came north winterfell long”

 ned suspicions give voice “for joy company surely” said lightly “and wall need see grace walk along battlements talk man night’s watch shadow benjen says—”

 “no doubt hear brother says soon enough” robert said “the wall stood eight thousand years keep days pressing concerns difficult times need good men men like jon arryn served lord eyrie warden east hand king easy replace”

 “his son…” ned began

 “his son succeed eyrie incomes” robert said brusquely “no more”

 took ned surprise stopped startled turned look king words came unbidden “the arryns always wardens east title goes domain”

 “perhaps comes age honor restored him” robert said “i year think next sixyearold boy war leader ned”

 “in peace title honor let boy keep father’s sake surely owe jon much service”

 king pleased took arm around ned’s shoulders “jon’s service duty owed liege lord ungrateful ned men ought know son father mere boy cannot hold east” tone softened “enough important office discuss would argue you” robert grasped ned elbow “i need ned”

 “i command grace always” words say said apprehensive might come next

 robert scarcely seemed hear “those years spent eyrie… gods good years want side ned want king’s landing end world damned use anybody” robert looked darkness moment melancholy stark “i swear sitting throne thousand times harder winning one laws tedious business counting coppers worse people… end sit damnable iron chair listen complain mind numb ass raw want something money land justice lies tell… lords ladies better surrounded flatterers fools drive man madness ned half don’t dare tell truth half can’t find nights wish lost trident ah truly but…

 “i understand” ned said softly

 robert looked “i think one old friend” smiled “lord eddard stark would name hand king”

 ned dropped one knee offer surprise reason could robert coming far hand king secondmost powerful man seven kingdoms spoke king’s voice commanded king’s armies drafted king’s laws times even sat upon iron throne dispense king’s justice king absent sick otherwise indisposed robert offering responsibility large realm

 last thing world wanted

 “your grace” said “i worthy honor”

 robert groaned goodhumored impatience “if wanted honor i’d let retire planning make run kingdom fight wars eat drink wench early grave” slapped gut grinned “you know saying king hand”

 ned knew saying “what king dreams” said “the hand builds”

 “i bedded fishmaid told lowborn choicer way put king eats say hand takes shit” threw back head roared laughter echoes rang darkness around dead winterfell seemed watch cold disapproving eyes

 finally laughter dwindled stopped ned still one knee eyes upraised “damn ned” king complained “you might least humor smile”

 “they say grows cold winter man’s laughter freezes throat chokes death” ned said evenly “perhaps starks little humor”

 “come south i’ll teach laugh again” king promised “you helped win damnable throne help hold meant rule together lyanna lived brothers bound blood well affection well late son daughter joff sansa shall join houses lyanna might done”

 offer surprise “sansa eleven”

 robert waved impatient hand “old enough betrothal marriage wait years” king smiled “now stand say yes curse you”

 “nothing would give greater pleasure grace” ned answered hesitated “these honors unexpected may time consider need tell wife…”

 “yes yes course tell catelyn sleep must” king reached clasped ned hand pulled roughly feet “just don’t keep waiting long patient men”

 moment eddard stark filled terrible sense foreboding place north looked stone figures around breathed deep chill silence crypt could feel eyes dead listening knew winter coming





 jon

 times—not many few—when jon snow glad bastard filled wine cup passing flagon struck might one

 settled back place bench among younger squires drank sweet fruity taste summerwine filled mouth brought smile lips

 great hall winterfell hazy smoke heavy smell roasted meat freshbaked bread grey stone walls draped banners white gold crimson direwolf stark baratheon’s crowned stag lion lannister singer playing high harp reciting ballad end hall voice could scarcely heard roar fire clangor pewter plates cups low mutter hundred drunken conversations

 fourth hour welcoming feast laid king jon’s brothers sisters seated royal children beneath raised platform lord lady stark hosted king queen honor occasion lord father would doubtless permit child glass wine benches one stop jon drinking much thirst

 finding man’s thirst raucous delight youths around urged every time drained glass fine company jon relished stories telling tales battle bedding hunt certain companions entertaining king’s offspring sated curiosity visitors made entrance procession passed foot place given bench jon gotten good long look

 lord father come first escorting queen beautiful men said jeweled tiara gleamed amidst long golden hair emeralds perfect match green eyes father helped steps dais led seat queen never much looked even fourteen jon could see smile

 next come king robert lady stark arm king great disappointment jon father talked often peerless robert baratheon demon trident fiercest warrior realm giant among princes jon saw fat man redfaced beard sweating silks walked like man half cups

 interested pair came behind queen’s brothers lannisters casterly rock lion imp mistaking ser jaime lannister twin queen cersei tall golden flashing green eyes smile cut like knife wore crimson silk high black boots black satin cloak breast tunic lion house embroidered gold thread roaring defiance called lion lannister face whispered “kingslayer” behind back

 jon found hard look away king look like thought man passed

 last high lords enter uncle benjen stark night’s watch father’s ward young theon greyjoy benjen gave jon warm smile went theon ignored utterly nothing new seated toasts made thanks given returned feasting began

 jon started drinking stopped

 something rubbed leg beneath table jon saw red eyes staring “hungry again” asked still half honeyed chicken center table jon reached tear leg better idea knifed bird whole let carcass slide floor legs ghost ripped savage silence brothers sisters permitted bring wolves banquet curs jon could count end hall one said word pup told fortunate

 eyes stung jon rubbed savagely cursing smoke swallowed another gulp wine watched direwolf devour chicken

 dogs moved tables trailing serving girls one black mongrel bitch long yellow eyes caught scent chicken stopped edged bench get share jon watched confrontation bitch growled low throat moved closer ghost looked silent fixed dog hot red eyes bitch snapped angry challenge three times size direwolf pup ghost move stood prize opened mouth baring fangs bitch tensed barked thought better fight turned slunk away one last defiant snap save pride ghost went back meal

 jon grinned reached table ruffle shaggy white fur direwolf looked nipped gently hand went back eating

 “is one direwolves i’ve heard much of” familiar voice asked close hand

 jon looked happily uncle ben put hand head ruffled hair much jon ruffled wolf’s “yes” said “his name ghost”

 one squires interrupted bawdy story he’d telling make room table lord’s brother benjen stark straddled bench long legs took wine cup jon’s hand “summerwine” said taste “nothing sweet many cups jon”

 jon smiled

 ben stark laughed “as feared ah well believe younger first time got truly sincerely drunk” snagged roasted onion dripping brown gravy nearby trencher bit crunched

 uncle sharpfeatured gaunt mountain crag always hint laughter bluegrey eyes dressed black befitted man night’s watch tonight rich black velvet high leather boots wide belt silver buckle heavy silver chain looped round neck benjen watched ghost amusement ate onion “a quiet wolf” observed

 “he’s like others” jon said “he never makes sound that’s named ghost he’s white others dark grey black”

 “there still direwolves beyond wall hear rangings” benjen stark gave jon long look “don’t usually eat table brothers”

 “most times” jon answered flat voice “but tonight lady stark thought might give insult royal family seat bastard among them”

 “i see” uncle glanced shoulder raised table far end hall “my brother seem festive tonight”

 jon noticed bastard learn notice things read truth people hid behind eyes father observing courtesies tightness jon seldom seen said little looking hall hooded eyes seeing nothing two seats away king drinking heavily night broad face flushed behind great black beard made many toast laughed loudly every jest attacked dish like starving man beside queen seemed cold ice sculpture “the queen angry too” jon told uncle low quiet voice “father took king crypts afternoon queen didn’t want go”

 benjen gave jon careful measuring look “you don’t miss much jon could use man like wall”

 jon swelled pride “robb stronger lance i’m better sword hullen says sit horse well anyone castle”

 “notable achievements”

 “take go back wall” jon said sudden rush “father give leave go ask know will”

 uncle benjen studied face carefully “the wall hard place boy jon”

 “i almost man grown” jon protested “i turn fifteen next name day maester luwin says bastards grow faster children”

 “that’s true enough” benjen said downward twist mouth took jon’s cup table filled fresh nearby pitcher drank long swallow

 “daeren targaryen fourteen conquered dorne” jon said young dragon one heroes

 “a conquest lasted summer” uncle pointed “your boy king lost ten thousand men taking place another fifty trying hold someone told war isn’t game” took another sip wine “also” said wiping mouth “daeren targaryen eighteen died forgotten part”

 “i forget nothing” jon boasted wine making bold tried sit straight make seem taller “i want serve night’s watch uncle”

 thought long hard lying abed night brothers slept around robb would someday inherit winterfell would command great armies warden north bran rickon would robb’s bannermen rule holdfasts name sisters arya sansa would marry heirs great houses go south mistress castles place could bastard hope earn

 “you don’t know you’re asking jon night’s watch sworn brotherhood families none us ever father sons wife duty mistress honor”

 “a bastard honor too” jon said “i ready swear oath”

 “you boy fourteen” benjen said “not man yet known woman cannot understand would giving up”

 “i don’t care that” jon said hotly

 “you might knew meant” benjen said “if knew oath would cost might less eager pay price son”

 jon felt anger rise inside “i’m son”

 benjen stark stood “more’s pity” put hand jon’s shoulder “come back you’ve fathered bastards we’ll see feel”

 jon trembled “i never father bastard” said carefully “never” spat like venom

 suddenly realized table fallen silent looking felt tears begin well behind eyes pushed feet

 “i must excused” said last dignity whirled bolted could see cry must drunk wine realized feet got tangled tried leave lurched sideways serving girl sent flagon spiced wine crashing floor laughter boomed around jon felt hot tears cheeks someone tried steady wrenched free grip ran halfblind door ghost followed close heels night

 yard quiet empty lone sentry stood high battlements inner wall cloak pulled tight around cold looked bored miserable huddled alone jon would traded places instant otherwise castle dark deserted jon seen abandoned holdfast drear place nothing moved wind stones kept silent whatever people lived winterfell reminded tonight

 sounds music song spilled open windows behind last things jon wanted hear wiped away tears sleeve shirt furious let fall turned go

 “boy” voice called jon turned

 tyrion lannister sitting ledge door great hall looking world like gargoyle dwarf grinned “is animal wolf”

 “a direwolf” jon said “his name ghost” stared little man disappointment suddenly forgotten “what aren’t feast”

 “too hot noisy i’d drunk much wine” dwarf told “i learned long ago considered rude vomit brother might closer look wolf”

 jon hesitated nodded slowly “can climb shall bring ladder”

 “oh bleed that” little man said pushed ledge empty air jon gasped watched awe tyrion lannister spun around tight ball landed lightly hands vaulted backward onto legs

 ghost backed away uncertainly

 dwarf dusted laughed “i believe i’ve frightened wolf apologies”

 “he’s scared” jon said knelt called “ghost come come that’s it”

 wolf pup padded closer nuzzled jon’s face kept wary eye tyrion lannister dwarf reached pet drew back bared fangs silent snarl “shy isn’t he” lannister observed

 “sit ghost” jon commanded “that’s keep still” looked dwarf “you touch won’t move tell i’ve training him”

 “i see” lannister said ruffled snowwhite fur ghost’s ears said “nice wolf”

 “if wasn’t he’d tear throat” jon said wasn’t actually true yet would

 “in case best stay close” dwarf said cocked oversized head one side looked jon mismatched eyes “i tyrion lannister”

 “i know” jon said rose standing taller dwarf made feel strange

 “you’re ned stark’s bastard aren’t you”

 jon felt coldness pass right pressed lips together said nothing

 “did offend you” lannister said “sorry dwarfs don’t tactful generations capering fools motley right dress badly say damn thing comes head” grinned “you bastard though”

 “lord eddard stark father” jon admitted stiffly

 lannister studied face “yes” said “i see north brothers”

 “half brothers” jon corrected pleased dwarf’s comment tried let show

 “let give counsel bastard” lannister said “never forget surely world make strength never weakness armor never used hurt you”

 jon mood anyone’s counsel “what know bastard”

 “all dwarfs bastards father’s eyes”

 “you mother’s trueborn son lannister”

 “am i” dwarf replied sardonic “do tell lord father mother died birthing he’s never sure”

 “i don’t even know mother was” jon said

 “some woman doubt are” favored jon rueful grin “remember boy dwarfs may bastards yet bastards need dwarfs” turned sauntered back feast whistling tune opened door light within threw shadow clear across yard moment tyrion lannister stood tall king





 catelyn

 rooms winterfell’s great keep catelyn’s bedchambers hottest seldom light fire castle built natural hot springs scalding waters rushed walls chambers like blood man’s body driving chill stone halls filling glass gardens moist warmth keeping earth freezing open pools smoked day night dozen small courtyards little thing summer winter difference life death

 catelyn’s bath always hot steaming walls warm touch warmth reminded riverrun days sun lysa edmure ned could never abide heat starks made cold would tell would laugh tell case certainly built castle wrong place

 finished ned rolled climbed bed thousand times crossed room pulled back heavy tapestries threw open high narrow windows one one letting night air chamber

 wind swirled around stood facing dark naked emptyhanded catelyn pulled furs chin watched looked somehow smaller vulnerable like youth wed sept riverrun fifteen long years gone loins still ached urgency lovemaking good ache could feel seed within prayed might quicken three years since rickon old could give another son

 “i refuse him” ned said turned back eyes haunted voice thick doubt

 catelyn sat bed “you cannot must not”

 “my duties north wish robert’s hand”

 “he understand king kings like men refuse serve wonder sooner later begin suspect oppose can’t see danger would put us in”

 ned shook head refusing believe “robert would never harm mine closer brothers loves refuse roar curse bluster week laugh together know man”

 “you knew man” said “the king stranger you” catelyn remembered direwolf dead snow broken antler lodged deep throat make see “pride everything king lord robert came way see bring great honors cannot throw back face”

 “honors” ned laughed bitterly

 “in eyes yes” said

 “and yours”

 “and mine” blazed angry couldn’t see “he offers son marriage daughter else would call sansa might someday queen sons could rule wall mountains dorne wrong that”

 “gods catelyn sansa eleven” ned said “and joffrey… joffrey is…”

 finished “…crown prince heir iron throne twelve father promised brother brandon”

 brought bitter twist ned’s mouth “brandon yes brandon would know always meant brandon winterfell everything born king’s hand father queens never asked cup pass me”

 “perhaps not” catelyn said “but brandon dead cup passed must drink like not”

 ned turned away back night stood staring darkness watching moon stars perhaps perhaps sentries wall

 catelyn softened see pain eddard stark married brandon’s place custom decreed shadow dead brother still lay shadow woman would name woman borne bastard son

 go knock came door loud unexpected ned turned frowning “what it”

 desmond’s voice came door “my lord maester luwin without begs urgent audience”

 “you told left orders disturbed”

 “yes lord insists”

 “very well send in”

 ned crossed wardrobe slipped heavy robe catelyn realized suddenly cold become sat bed pulled furs chin “perhaps close windows” suggested

 ned nodded absently maester luwin shown

 maester small grey man eyes grey quick saw much hair grey little years left robe grey wool trimmed white fur stark colors great floppy sleeves pockets hidden inside luwin always tucking things sleeves producing things books messages strange artifacts toys children kept hidden sleeves catelyn surprised maester luwin could lift arms

 maester waited door closed behind spoke “my lord” said ned “pardon disturbing rest left message”

 ned looked irritated “been left rider told”

 “there rider lord carved wooden box left table observatory napped servants saw one must brought someone king’s party visitors south”

 “a wooden box say” catelyn said

 “inside fine new lens observatory myr look lenscrafters myr without equal”

 ned frowned little patience sort thing catelyn knew “a lens” said “what me”

 “i asked question” maester luwin said “clearly seeming”

 heavy weight furs catelyn shivered “a lens instrument help us see”

 “indeed is” fingered collar order heavy chain worn tight around neck beneath robe link forged different metal

 catelyn could feel dread stirring inside “what would us see clearly”

 “the thing asked myself” maester luwin drew tightly rolled paper sleeve “i found true message concealed within false bottom dismantled box lens come eyes”

 ned held hand “let then”

 luwin stir “pardons lord message either marked eyes lady catelyn alone may approach”

 catelyn nodded trusting speak maester placed paper table beside bed sealed small blob blue wax luwin bowed began retreat

 “stay” ned commanded voice grave looked catelyn “what lady you’re shaking”

 “i’m afraid” admitted reached took letter trembling hands furs dropped away nakedness forgotten blue wax moonandfalcon seal house arryn “it’s lysa” catelyn looked husband “it make us glad” told “there grief message ned feel it”

 ned frowned face darkening “open it”

 catelyn broke seal

 eyes moved words first made sense remembered “lysa took chances girls together private language i”

 “can read it”

 “yes” catelyn admitted

 “then tell us”

 “perhaps withdraw” maester luwin said

 “no” catelyn said “we need counsel” threw back furs climbed bed night air cold grave bare skin padded across room

 maester luwin averted eyes even ned looked shocked “what doing” asked

 “lighting fire” catelyn told found dressing gown shrugged knelt cold hearth

 “maester luwin—” ned began

 “maester luwin delivered children” catelyn said “this time false modesty” slid paper among kindling placed heavier logs top

 ned crossed room took arm pulled feet held face inches “my lady tell message”

 catelyn stiffened grasp “a warning” said softly “if wits hear”

 eyes searched face “go on”

 “lysa says jon arryn murdered”

 fingers tightened arm “by whom”

 “the lannisters” told “the queen”

 ned released hold arm deep red marks skin “gods” whispered voice hoarse “your sister sick grief cannot know saying”

 “she knows” catelyn said “lysa impulsive yes message carefully planned cleverly hidden knew meant death letter fell wrong hands risk much must mere suspicion” catelyn looked husband “now truly choice must robert’s hand must go south learn truth”

 saw ned reached different conclusion “the truths know south nest adders would better avoid”

 luwin plucked chain collar chafed soft skin throat “the hand king great power lord power find truth lord arryn’s death bring killers king’s justice power protect lady arryn son worst true”

 ned glanced helplessly around bedchamber catelyn’s heart went knew could take arms first victory must children’s sake “you say love robert like brother would leave brother surrounded lannisters”

 “the others take you” ned muttered darkly turned away went window speak maester waited quiet eddard stark said silent farewell home loved turned away window last voice tired full melancholy moisture glittered faintly corners eyes “my father went south answer summons king never came home again”

 “a different time” maester luwin said “a different king”

 “yes” ned said dully seated chair hearth “catelyn shall stay winterfell”

 words like icy draft heart “no” said suddenly afraid punishment never see face feel arms around

 “yes” ned said words would brook argument “you must govern north stead run robert’s errands must always stark winterfell robb fourteen soon enough man grown must learn rule make part councils must ready time comes”

 “gods many years” maester luwin murmured

 “maester luwin trust would blood give wife voice things great small teach son things needs know winter coming”

 maester luwin nodded gravely silence fell catelyn found courage asked question whose answer dreaded “what children”

 ned stood took arms held face close “rickon young” said gently “he stay robb others would take me”

 “i could bear it” catelyn said trembling

 “you must” said “sansa must wed joffrey clear must give grounds suspect devotion past time arya learned ways southron court years age marry too”

 sansa would shine south catelyn thought gods knew arya needed refinement reluctantly let go heart bran never bran “yes” said “but please ned love bear let bran remain winterfell seven”

 “i eight father sent foster eyrie” ned said “ser rodrik tells bad feeling robb prince joffrey healthy bran bridge distance sweet boy quick laugh easy love let grow young princes let become friend robert became mine house safer it”

 right catelyn knew make pain easier bear would lose four ned girls sweet loving bran robb little rickon would left felt lonely already winterfell vast place “keep walls then” said bravely “you know bran loves climb”

 ned kissed tears eyes could fall “thank lady” whispered “this hard know”

 “what jon snow lord” maester luwin asked

 catelyn tensed mention name ned felt anger pulled away

 many men fathered bastards catelyn grown knowledge came surprise first year marriage learn ned fathered child girl chance met campaign man’s needs spent year apart ned war south remained safe father’s castle riverrun thoughts robb infant breast husband scarcely knew welcome whatever solace might find battles seed quickened expected would see child’s needs

 starks like men ned brought bastard home called “son” north see wars last catelyn rode winterfell jon wet nurse already taken residence

 cut deep ned would speak mother much word castle secrets catelyn heard maids repeating tales heard lips husband’s soldiers whispered ser arthur dayne sword morning deadliest seven knights aerys’s kingsguard young lord slain single combat told afterward ned carried ser arthur’s sword back beautiful young sister awaited castle called starfall shores summer sea lady ashara dayne tall fair haunting violet eyes taken fortnight marshal courage finally bed one night catelyn asked husband truth asked face

 time years ned ever frightened “never ask jon” said cold ice “he blood need know learn heard name lady” pledged obey told day whispering stopped ashara dayne’s name never heard winterfell

 whoever jon’s mother ned must loved fiercely nothing catelyn said would persuade send boy away one thing could never forgive come love husband heart never found love jon might overlooked dozen bastards ned’s sake long sight jon never sight grew looked like ned trueborn sons bore somehow made worse “jon must go” said

 “he robb close” ned said “i hoped…”

 “he cannot stay here” catelyn said cutting “he son mine him” hard knew less truth ned would boy kindness leaving winterfell

 look ned gave anguished “you know cannot take south place court boy bastard’s name… know say shunned”

 catelyn armored heart mute appeal husband’s eyes “they say friend robert fathered dozen bastards himself”

 “and none ever seen court” ned blazed “the lannister woman seen damnably cruel catelyn boy he—”

 fury might said worse maester luwin cut “another solution presents itself” said voice quiet “your brother benjen came jon days ago seems boy aspires take black”

 ned looked shocked “he asked join night’s watch”

 catelyn said nothing let ned work mind voice would welcome yet gladly would kissed maester perfect solution benjen stark sworn brother jon would son child would never time boy would take oath well would father sons might someday contest catelyn’s grandchildren winterfell

 maester luwin said “there great honor service wall lord”

 “and even bastard may rise high night’s watch” ned reflected still voice troubled “jon young asked man grown would one thing boy fourteen…”

 “a hard sacrifice” maester luwin agreed “yet hard times lord road crueler lady’s”

 catelyn thought three children must lose easy keeping silent

 ned turned away gaze window long face silent thoughtful finally sighed turned back “very well” said maester luwin “i suppose best speak ben”

 “when shall tell jon” maester asked

 “when must preparations must made fortnight ready depart would sooner let jon enjoy last days summer end soon enough childhood well time comes tell myself”

 bran hung listening suddenly afraid go might glimpse feet tried swing

 “don’t see danger puts us in” woman said “robert loves man like brother”

 “robert barely stomach brothers blame stannis would enough give anyone indigestion”

 “don’t play fool stannis renly one thing eddard stark quite another robert listen stark damn insisted name certain stark would refuse him”

 tyrion

 somewhere great stone maze winterfell wolf howled sound hung castle like flag mourning

 tyrion lannister looked books shivered though library snug warm something howling wolf took man right left dark forest mind running naked pack

 direwolf howled tyrion shut heavy leatherbound cover book reading hundredyearold discourse changing seasons longdead maester covered yawn back hand reading lamp flickering oil gone dawn light leaked high windows night nothing new tyrion lannister much one sleeping

 legs stiff sore eased bench massaged life back limped heavily table septon snoring softly head pillowed open book front tyrion glanced title life grand maester aethelmure wonder “chayle” said softly young man jerked blinking confused crystal order swinging wildly silver chain “i’m break fast see return books shelves gentle valyrian scrolls parchment dry ayrmidon’s engines war quite rare complete copy i’ve ever seen” chayle gaped still halfasleep patiently tyrion repeated instructions clapped septon shoulder left tasks

 outside tyrion swallowed lungful cold morning air began laborious descent steep stone steps corkscrewed around exterior library tower slow going steps cut high narrow legs short twisted rising sun yet cleared walls winterfell men already hard yard sandor clegane’s rasping voice drifted “the boy long time dying wish would quicker it”

 tyrion glanced saw hound standing young joffrey squires swarmed around “at least dies quietly” prince replied “it’s wolf makes noise could scarce sleep last night”

 clegane cast long shadow across hardpacked earth squire lowered black helm head “i could silence creature please you” said open visor boy placed longsword hand tested weight slicing cold morning air behind yard rang clangor steel steel

 notion seemed delight prince “send dog kill dog” exclaimed “winterfell infested wolves starks would never miss one”

 tyrion hopped last step onto yard “i beg differ nephew” said “the starks count past six unlike princes might name”

 joffrey grace least blush

 “a voice nowhere” sandor said peered helm looking way “spirits air”

 prince laughed always laughed bodyguard mummer’s farce tyrion used “down here”

 tall man peered ground pretended notice “the little lord tyrion” said “my pardons see standing there”

 “i mood insolence today” tyrion turned nephew “joffrey past time called lord eddard lady offer comfort”

 joffrey looked petulant boy prince look “what good comfort them”

 “none” tyrion said “yet expected absence noted”

 “the stark boy nothing me” joffrey said “i cannot abide wailing women”

 tyrion lannister reached slapped nephew hard across face boy’s cheek began redden

 “one word” tyrion said “and hit again”

 “i’m going tell mother” joffrey exclaimed

 tyrion hit cheeks flamed

 “you tell mother” tyrion told “but first get lord lady stark fall knees front tell sorry service slightest thing desperate hour prayers go understand you”

 boy looked though going cry instead managed weak nod turned fled headlong yard holding cheek tyrion watched run

 shadow fell across face turned find clegane looming overhead like cliff sootdark armor seemed blot sun lowered visor helm fashioned likeness snarling black hound fearsome behold tyrion always thought great improvement clegane’s hideously burned face

 “the prince remember little lord” hound warned helm turned laugh hollow rumble

 “i pray does” tyrion lannister replied “if forgets good dog remind him” glanced around courtyard “do know might find brother”

 “breaking fast queen”

 “ah” tyrion said gave sandor clegane perfunctory nod walked away briskly stunted legs would carry whistling pitied first knight try hound today man temper

 cold cheerless meal laid morning room guest house jaime sat table cersei children talking low hushed voices

 “is robert still abed” tyrion asked seated uninvited table

 sister peered expression faint distaste worn since day born “the king slept all” told “he lord eddard taken sorrow deeply heart”

 “he large heart robert” jaime said lazy smile little jaime took seriously tyrion knew brother forgave terrible long years childhood jaime ever shown smallest measure affection respect tyrion willing forgive anything

 servant approached “bread” tyrion told “and two little fish mug good dark beer wash oh bacon burn turns black” man bowed moved tyrion turned back siblings twins male female looked much part morning chosen deep green matched eyes blond curls fashionable tumble gold ornaments shone wrists fingers throats

 tyrion wondered would like twin decided would rather know bad enough face looking glass every day another thought dreadful contemplate

 prince tommen spoke “do news bran uncle”

 “i stopped sickroom last night” tyrion announced “there change maester thought hopeful sign”

 “i don’t want brandon die” tommen said timorously sweet boy like brother jaime tyrion somewhat less peas pod

 “lord eddard brother named brandon well” jaime mused “one hostages murdered targaryen seems unlucky name”

 “oh unlucky surely” tyrion said servant brought plate ripped chunk black bread

 cersei studying warily “what mean”

 tyrion gave crooked smile “why tommen may get wish maester thinks boy may yet live” took sip beer

 myrcella gave happy gasp tommen smiled nervously children tyrion watching glance passed jaime cersei lasted second miss sister dropped gaze table “that mercy northern gods cruel let child linger pain”

 “what maester’s words” jaime asked

 bacon crunched bit tyrion chewed thoughtfully moment said “he thinks boy going die would done already four days change”

 “will bran get better uncle” little myrcella asked mother’s beauty none nature

 “his back broken little one” tyrion told “the fall shattered legs well keep alive honey water would starve death perhaps wakes able eat real food never walk again”

 “if wakes” cersei repeated “is likely”

 “the gods alone know” tyrion told “the maester hopes” chewed bread “i would swear wolf keeping boy alive creature outside window day night howling every time chase away returns maester said closed window shut noise bran seemed weaken opened heart beat stronger”

 queen shuddered “there something unnatural animals” said “they dangerous coming south us”

 jaime said “you’ll hard time stopping sister follow girls everywhere”

 tyrion started fish “are leaving soon then”

 “not near soon enough” cersei said frowned “are leaving” echoed “what gods don’t tell staying here”

 tyrion shrugged “benjen stark returning night’s watch brother’s bastard mind go see wall heard much of”

 jaime smiled “i hope you’re thinking taking black us sweet brother”

 tyrion laughed “what celibate whores would go begging dorne casterly rock want stand top wall piss edge world”

 cersei stood abruptly “the children don’t need hear filth tommen myrcella come” strode briskly morning room train pups trailing behind

 jaime lannister regarded brother thoughtfully cool green eyes “stark never consent leave winterfell son lingering shadow death”

 “he robert commands it” tyrion said “and robert command nothing lord eddard boy case”

 “he could end torment” jaime said “i would son would mercy”

 “i advise putting suggestion lord eddard sweet brother” tyrion said “he would take kindly”

 “even boy live cripple worse cripple grotesque give good clean death”

 tyrion replied shrug accentuated twist shoulders “speaking grotesques” said “i beg differ death terribly final life full possibilities”

 jaime smiled “you perverse little imp aren’t you”

 “oh yes” tyrion admitted “i hope boy wake would interested hear might say”

 brother’s smile curdled like sour milk “tyrion sweet brother” said darkly “there times give cause wonder whose side on”

 tyrion’s mouth full bread fish took swallow strong black beer wash grinned wolfishly jaime “why jaime sweet brother” said “you wound know much love family”

 daenerys

 daenerys targaryen wed khal drogo fear barbaric splendor field beyond walls pentos dothraki believed things importance man’s life must done beneath open sky

 drogo called khalasar attend come forty thousand dothraki warriors uncounted numbers women children slaves outside city walls camped vast herds raising palaces woven grass eating everything sight making good folk pentos anxious every passing day

 “my fellow magisters doubled size city guard” illyrio told platters honey duck orange snap peppers one night manse drogo’s khal joined khalasar estate given daenerys brother wedding

 “best get princess daenerys wedded quickly hand half wealth pentos away sellswords bravos” ser jorah mormont jested exile offered brother sword night dany sold kbal drogo viserys accepted eagerly mormont constant companion ever since

 magister illyrio laughed lightly forked beard viserys much smile “he tomorrow likes” brother said glanced dany lowered eyes “so long pays price”

 illyrio waved languid hand air rings glittering fat fingers “i told settled trust khal promised crown shall it”

 “yes when”

 “when khal chooses” illyrio said “he girl first wed must make procession across plains present dosh khaleen vaes dothrak perhaps omens favor war”

 viserys seethed impatience “i piss dothraki omens usurper sits father’s throne long must wait”

 illyrio gave massive shrug “you waited life great king another months another years”

 ser jorah traveled far east vaes dothrak nodded agreement “i counsel patient grace dothraki true word things time lesser man may beg favor khal must never presume berate him”

 viserys bristled “guard tongue mormont i’ll lesser man rightful lord seven kingdoms dragon beg”

 ser jorah lowered eyes respectfully illyrio smiled enigmatically tore wing duck honey grease ran fingers dripped beard nibbled tender meat dragons dany thought staring brother though dare say aloud

 yet night dreamt one viserys hitting hurting naked clumsy fear ran body seemed thick ungainly struck stumbled fell “you woke dragon” screamed kicked “you woke dragon woke dragon” thighs slick blood closed eyes whimpered answer hideous ripping sound crackling great fire looked viserys gone great columns flame rose around midst dragon turned great head slowly molten eyes found woke shaking covered fine sheen sweat never afraid…

 … day wedding came last

 ceremony began dawn continued dusk endless day drinking feasting fighting mighty earthen ramp raised amid grass palaces dany seated beside khal drogo seething sea dothraki never seen many people one place people strange frightening horselords might put rich fabrics sweet perfumes visited free cities open sky kept old ways men women alike wore painted leather vests bare chests horsehair leggings cinched bronze medallion belts warriors greased long braids fat rendering pits gorged horseflesh roasted honey peppers drank blind fermented mare’s milk illyrio’s fine wines spat jests across fires voices harsh alien dany’s ears

 viserys seated splendid new black wool tunic scarlet dragon chest illyrio ser jorah sat beside place high honor khal’s bloodriders dany could see anger brother’s lilac eyes like sitting beneath fumed slaves offered dish first khal bride served portions refused could nothing nurse resentment nurse mood growing blacker hour insult person

 dany never felt alone seated midst vast horde brother told smile smiled face ached tears came unbidden eyes best hide knowing angry viserys would saw crying terrified khal drogo might react food brought steaming joints meat thick black sausages dothraki blood pies later fruits sweetgrass stews delicate pastries kitchens pentos waved away stomach roil knew could keep none

 one talk khal drogo shouted commands jests bloodriders laughed replies scarcely glanced dany beside common language dothraki incomprehensible khal knew words bastard valyrian free cities none common tongue seven kingdoms would even welcomed conversation illyrio brother far hear

 sat wedding silks nursing cup honeyed wine afraid eat talking silently blood dragon told daenerys stormborn princess dragonstone blood seed aegon conqueror

 sun quarter way sky saw first man die drums beating women danced khal drogo watched without expression eyes followed movements time time would toss bronze medallion women fight

 warriors watching one finally stepped circle grabbed dancer arm pushed ground mounted right stallion mounts mare illyrio told might happen “the dothraki mate like animals herds privacy khalasar understand sin shame do”

 dany looked away coupling frightened realized happening second warrior stepped forward third soon way avert eyes two men seized woman heard shout saw shove blink eye arakhs long razorsharp blades half sword half scythe dance death began warriors circled slashed leaping toward whirling blades around heads shrieking insults clash one made move interfere

 ended quickly began arakhs shivered together faster dany could follow one man missed step swung blade flat arc steel bit flesh dothraki’s waist opened backbone belly button spilling entrails dust loser died winner took hold nearest woman—not even one quarreling over—and slaves carried body dancing resumed

 magister illyrio warned dany “a dothraki wedding without least three deaths deemed dull affair” said wedding must especially blessed day dozen men died

 hours passed terror grew dany could scream afraid dothraki whose ways seemed alien monstrous beasts human skins true men afraid brother might failed afraid would happen tonight stars brother gave hulking giant sat drinking beside face still cruel bronze mask

 blood dragon told

 last sun low sky khal drogo clapped hands together drums shouting feasting came sudden halt drogo stood pulled dany feet beside time bride gifts

 gifts knew sun gone would time first ride consummation marriage dany tried put thought aside would leave hugged try keep shaking

 brother viserys gifted three handmaids dany knew cost nothing illyrio doubt provided girls irri jhiqui copperskinned dothraki black hair almondshaped eyes doreah fairhaired blueeyed lysene girl “these common servants sweet sister” brother told brought forward one one “illyrio selected personally irri teach riding jhiqui dothraki tongue doreah instruct womanly arts love” smiled thinly “she’s good illyrio swear that”

 ser jorah mormont apologized gift “it small thing princess poor exile could afford” said laid small stack old books histories songs seven kingdoms saw written common tongue thanked heart

 magister illyrio murmured command four burly slaves hurried forward bearing great cedar chest bound bronze opened found piles finest velvets damasks free cities could produce… resting top nestled soft cloth three huge eggs dany gasped beautiful things ever seen different others patterned rich colors first thought crusted jewels large took hands hold one lifted delicately expecting would made fine porcelain delicate enamel even blown glass much heavier solid stone surface shell covered tiny scales turned egg fingers shimmered like polished metal light setting sun one egg deep green burnished bronze flecks came went depending dany turned another pale cream streaked gold last black black midnight sea yet alive scarlet ripples swirls “what they” asked voice hushed full wonder

 “dragon’s eggs shadow lands beyond asshai” said magister illyrio “the eons turned stone yet still burn bright beauty”

 “i shall treasure always” dany heard tales eggs never seen one thought see one truly magnificent gift though knew illyrio could afford lavish collected fortune horses slaves part selling khal drogo

 khal’s bloodriders offered traditional three weapons splendid weapons haggo gave great leather whip silver handle cohollo magnificent arakh chased gold qotho doublecurved dragonbone bow taller magister illyrio ser jorah taught traditional refusals offerings “this gift worthy great warrior blood blood woman let lord husband bear stead” khal drogo received “bride gifts”

 gifts given plenty dothraki slippers jewels silver rings hair medallion belts painted vests soft furs sandsilks jars scent needles feathers tiny bottles purple glass gown made skin thousand mice “a handsome gift khaleesi” magister illyrio said last told “most lucky” gifts mounted around great piles gifts could possibly imagine gifts could want use

 last khal drogo brought forth bride gift expectant hush rippled center camp left side growing swallowed whole khalasar returned dense press dothraki giftgivers parted led horse

 young filly spirited splendid dany knew enough horses know ordinary animal something took breath away grey winter sea mane like silver smoke

 hesitantly reached stroked horse’s neck ran fingers silver mane khal drogo said something dothraki magister illyrio translated “silver silver hair khal says”

 “she’s beautiful” dany murmured

 “she pride khalasar” illyrio said “custom decrees khaleesi must ride mount worthy place side khal”

 drogo stepped forward put hands waist lifted easily child set thin dothraki saddle much smaller ones used dany sat uncertain moment one told part “what do” asked illyrio

 ser jorah mormont answered “take reins ride need go far”

 nervously dany gathered reins hands slid feet short stirrups fair rider spent far time traveling ship wagon palanquin horseback praying would fall disgrace gave filly lightest timid touch knees

 first time hours forgot afraid perhaps first time ever

 silvergrey filly moved smooth silken gait crowd parted every eye upon dany found moving faster intended yet somehow exciting rather terrifying horse broke trot smiled dothraki scrambled clear path slightest pressure legs lightest touch reins filly responded sent gallop dothraki hooting laughing shouting jumped way turned ride back firepit loomed ahead directly path hemmed either side room stop daring never known filled daenerys gave filly head

 silver horse leapt flames wings

 pulled magister illyrio said “tell khal drogo given wind” fat pentoshi stroked yellow beard repeated words dothraki dany saw new husband smile first time

 last sliver sun vanished behind high walls pentos west dany lost track time khal drogo commanded bloodriders bring forth horse lean red stallion khal saddling horse viserys slid close dany silver dug fingers leg said “please sweet sister swear see dragon wake never woken before”

 fear came back brother’s words felt like child thirteen alone ready happen

 rode together stars came leaving khalasar grass palaces behind khal drogo spoke word drove stallion hard trot gathering dusk tiny silver bells long braid rang softly rode “i blood dragon” whispered aloud followed trying keep courage “i blood dragon blood dragon” dragon never afraid

 afterward could say far long ridden full dark stopped grassy place beside small stream drogo swung horse lifted felt fragile glass hands limbs weak water stood helpless trembling wedding silks secured horses turned look began cry

 khal drogo stared tears face strangely empty expression “no” said lifted hand rubbed away tears roughly callused thumb

 “you speak common tongue” dany said wonder

 “no” said

 perhaps word thought one word known somehow made feel little better drogo touched hair lightly sliding silverblond strands fingers murmuring softly dothraki dany understand words yet warmth tone tenderness never expected man

 put finger chin lifted head looking eyes drogo towered towered everyone taking lightly arms lifted seated rounded rock beside stream sat ground facing legs crossed beneath faces finally height “no” said

 “is word know” asked

 drogo reply long heavy braid coiled dirt beside pulled right shoulder began remove bells hair one one moment dany leaned forward help done drogo gestured understood slowly carefully began undo braid

 took long time sat silently watching done shook head hair spread behind like river darkness oiled gleaming never seen hair long black thick

 turn began undress

 fingers deft strangely tender removed silks one one carefully dany sat unmoving silent looking eyes bared small breasts could help averted eyes covered hands “no” drogo said pulled hands away breasts gently firmly lifted face make look “no” repeated

 “no” echoed back

 stood pulled close remove last silks night air chilly bare skin shivered gooseflesh covered arms legs afraid would come next nothing happened khal drogo sat legs crossed looking drinking body eyes

 began touch lightly first harder could sense fierce strength hands never hurt held hand brushed fingers one one ran hand gently leg stroked face tracing curve ears running finger gently around mouth put hands hair combed fingers turned around massaged shoulders slid knuckle path spine

 seemed hours passed hands finally went breasts stroked soft skin underneath tingled circled nipples thumbs pinched thumb forefinger began pull lightly first insistently nipples stiffened began ache

 stopped drew onto lap dany flushed breathless heart fluttering chest cupped face huge hands looked eyes “no” said knew question

 took hand moved wetness thighs “yes” whispered put finger inside





 eddard

 summons came hour dawn world still grey

 alyn shook roughly dreams ned stumbled predawn chill groggy sleep find horse saddled king already mounted robert wore thick brown gloves heavy fur cloak hood covered ears looked world like bear sitting horse “up stark” roared “up matters state discuss”

 “by means” ned said “come inside grace” alyn lifted flap tent

 “no no” robert said breath steamed every word “the camp full ears besides want ride taste country yours” ser boros ser meryn waited behind dozen guardsmen ned saw nothing rub sleep eyes dress mount

 robert set pace driving huge black destrier hard ned galloped along beside trying keep called question rode wind blew words away king hear ned rode silence soon left kingsroad took across rolling plains dark mist guard fallen back small distance safely earshot still robert would slow

 dawn broke crested low ridge finally king pulled miles south main party robert flushed exhilarated ned reined beside “gods” swore laughing “it feels good get ride way man meant ride swear ned creeping along enough drive man mad” never patient man robert baratheon “that damnable wheelhouse way creaks groans climbing every bump road mountain… promise wretched thing breaks another axle i’m going burn cersei walk”

 ned laughed “i gladly light torch you”

 “good man” king clapped shoulder “i’ve half mind leave behind keep going”

 smile touched ned’s lips “i believe mean it”

 “i do” king said “what say ned two vagabond knights kingsroad swords sides gods know front us maybe farmer’s daughter tavern wench warm beds tonight”

 “would could” ned said “but duties liege… realm children lady wife queen boys were”

 “you never boy were” robert grumbled “more’s pity yet one time… name common girl becca one mine gods love black hair sweet big eyes could drown was… aleena told merryl know one mean bastard’s mother”

 “her name wylla” ned replied cool courtesy “and would sooner speak her”

 “wylla yes” king grinned “she must rare wench could make lord eddard stark forget honor even hour never told looked like…”

 ned’s mouth tightened anger “nor leave robert love say bear dishonored dishonored catelyn sight gods men”

 “gods mercy scarcely knew catelyn”

 “i taken wife carrying child”

 “you hard ned always damn woman wants baelor blessed bed” slapped hand knee “well i’ll press feel strong though swear times you’re prickly ought take hedgehog sigil”

 rising sun sent fingers light pale white mists dawn wide plain spread beneath bare brown flatness relieved long low hummocks ned pointed king “the barrows first men”

 robert frowned “have ridden onto graveyard”

 “there barrows everywhere north grace” ned told “this land old”

 “and cold” robert grumbled pulling cloak tightly around guard reined well behind bottom ridge “well bring talk graves bicker bastard rider night lord varys king’s landing here” king pulled paper belt handed ned

 varys eunuch king’s master whisperers served robert served aerys targaryen ned unrolled paper trepidation thinking lysa terrible accusation message concern lady arryn “what source information”

 “do remember ser jorah mormont”

 “would might forget him” ned said bluntly mormonts bear island old house proud honorable lands cold distant poor ser jorah tried swell family coffers selling poachers tyroshi slaver mormonts bannermen starks crime dishonored north ned made long journey west bear island find arrived jorah taken ship beyond reach ice king’s justice five years passed since

 “ser jorah pentos anxious earn royal pardon would allow return exile” robert explained “lord varys makes good use him”

 “so slaver become spy” ned said distaste handed letter back “i would rather become corpse”

 “varys tells spies useful corpses” robert said “jorah aside make report”

 “daenerys targaryen wed dothraki horselord shall send wedding gift”

 king frowned “a knife perhaps good sharp one bold man wield it”

 ned feign surprise robert’s hatred targaryens madness remembered angry words exchanged tywin lannister presented robert corpses rhaegar’s wife children token fealty ned named murder robert called war protested young prince princess babes newmade king replied “i see babes dragonspawn” even jon arryn able calm storm eddard stark ridden day cold rage fight last battles war alone south taken another death reconcile lyanna’s death grief shared passing

 time ned resolved keep temper “your grace girl scarcely child tywin lannister slaughter innocents” said rhaegar’s little girl cried dragged beneath bed face swords boy babe arms yet lord tywin’s soldiers torn mother’s breast dashed head wall

 “and long one remain innocent” robert’s mouth grew hard “this child soon enough spread legs start breeding dragonspawn plague me”

 “nonetheless” ned said “the murder children… would vile… unspeakable…”

 “unspeakable” king roared “what aerys brother brandon unspeakable way lord father died unspeakable rhaegar… many times think raped sister many hundreds times” voice grown loud horse whinnied nervously beneath king jerked reins hard quieting animal pointed angry finger ned “i kill every targaryen get hands dead dragons piss graves”

 ned knew better defy wrath years quenched robert’s thirst revenge words would help “you can’t get hands one you” said quietly

 king’s mouth twisted bitter grimace “no gods cursed poxridden pentoshi cheesemonger brother walled estate pointyhatted eunuchs around he’s handed dothraki killed years ago easy get jon bad fool listened him”

 “jon arryn wise man good hand”

 robert snorted anger leaving suddenly come “this khal drogo said hundred thousand men horde would jon say that”

 “he would say even million dothraki threat realm long remain side narrow sea” ned replied calmly “the barbarians ships hate fear open sea”

 king shifted uncomfortably saddle “perhaps ships free cities though tell ned like marriage still seven kingdoms call usurper forget many houses fought targaryen war bide time give half chance murder bed sons beggar king crosses dothraki horde back traitors join him”

 “he cross” ned promised “and mischance throw back sea choose new warden east—”

 king groaned “for last time name arryn boy warden know boy nephew targaryens climbing bed dothraki would mad rest one quarter realm shoulders sickly child”

 ned ready “yet still must warden east robert arryn name one brothers stannis proved siege storm’s end surely”

 let name hang moment king frowned said nothing looked uncomfortable

 “that is” ned finished quietly watching “unless already promised honor another”

 moment robert grace look startled quickly look became annoyance “what have”

 “it’s jaime lannister not”

 robert kicked horse back motion started ridge toward barrows ned kept pace king rode eyes straight ahead “yes” said last single hard word end matter

 “kingslayer” ned said rumors true rode dangerous ground knew “an able courageous man doubt” said carefully “but father warden west robert time ser jaime succeed honor one man hold east west” left unsaid real concern appointment would put half armies realm hands lannisters

 “i fight battle enemy appears field” king said stubbornly “at moment lord tywin looms eternal casterly rock doubt jaime succeeding anytime soon don’t vex ned stone set”

 “your grace may speak frankly”

 “i seem unable stop you” robert grumbled rode tall brown grasses

 “can trust jaime lannister”

 “he wife’s twin sworn brother kingsguard life fortune honor bound mine”

 “as bound aerys targaryen’s” ned pointed

 “why mistrust done everything ever asked sword helped win throne sit on”

 sword helped taint throne sit ned thought permit words pass lips “he swore vow protect king’s life opened king’s throat sword”

 “seven hells someone kill aerys” robert said reining mount sudden halt beside ancient barrow “if jaime hadn’t done would left me”

 “we sworn brothers kingsguard” ned said time come robert hear whole truth decided “do remember trident grace”

 “i crown forget it”

 “you took wound rhaegar” ned reminded “so targaryen host broke ran gave pursuit hands remnants rhaegar’s army fled back king’s landing followed aerys red keep several thousand loyalists expected find gates closed us”

 robert gave impatient shake head “instead found men already taken city it”

 “not men” ned said patiently “lannister men lion lannister flew ramparts crowned stag taken city treachery”

 war raged close year lords great small flocked robert’s banners others remained loyal targaryen mighty lannisters casterly rock wardens west remained aloof struggle ignoring calls arms rebels royalists aerys targaryen must thought gods answered prayers lord tywin lannister appeared gates king’s landing army twelve thousand strong professing loyalty mad king ordered last mad act opened city lions gate

 “treachery coin targaryens knew well” robert said anger building “lannister paid back kind less deserved shall trouble sleep it”

 “you there” ned said bitterness voice troubled sleep stranger lived lies fourteen years yet still haunted night “there honor conquest”

 “the others take honor” robert swore “what targaryen ever know honor go crypt ask lyanna dragon’s honor”

 “you avenged lyanna trident” ned said halting beside king promise ned whispered

 “that bring back” robert looked away grey distance “the gods damned hollow victory gave crown… girl prayed sister safe… mine meant ask ned good wear crown gods mock prayers kings cowherds alike”

 “i cannot answer gods grace… found rode throne room day” ned said “aerys dead floor drowned blood dragon skulls stared walls lannister’s men everywhere jaime wore white cloak kingsguard golden armor see still even sword gilded seated iron throne high knights wearing helm fashioned shape lion’s head glittered”

 “this well known” king complained

 “i still mounted rode length hall silence long rows dragon skulls felt though watching somehow stopped front throne looking golden sword across legs edge red king’s blood men filling room behind lannister’s men drew back never said word looked seated throne waited last jaime laughed got took helm said ‘have fear stark keeping warm friend robert it’s comfortable seat i’m afraid’”

 king threw back head roared laughter startled flight crows tall brown grass took air wild beating wings “you think mistrust lannister sat throne moments” shook laughter “jaime seventeen ned scarce boy”

 “boy man right throne”

 “perhaps tired” robert suggested “killing kings weary work gods know there’s place else rest ass damnable room spoke truly monstrous uncomfortable chair ways one” king shook head “well know jaime’s dark sin matter forgotten heartily sick secrets squabbles matters state ned it’s tedious counting coppers come let’s ride used know want feel wind hair again” kicked horse back motion galloped barrow raining earth behind

 moment ned follow run words filled vast sense helplessness first time wondered come jon arryn curb wildness king teach wisdom robert would pleased always nothing ned could say would change belonged winterfell belonged catelyn grief bran

 man could always belonged though resigned eddard stark put boots horse set king





 tyrion

 north went forever

 tyrion lannister knew maps well anyone fortnight wild track passed kingsroad brought home lesson map one thing land quite another

 left winterfell day king amidst commotion royal departure riding sound men shouting horses snorting rattle wagons groaning queen’s huge wheelhouse light snow flurried kingsroad beyond sprawl castle town banners wagons columns knights freeriders turned south taking tumult tyrion turned north benjen stark nephew

 grown colder far quiet

 west road flint hills grey rugged tall watchtowers stony summits east land lower ground flattening rolling plain stretched away far eye could see stone bridges spanned swift narrow rivers small farms spread rings around holdfasts walled wood stone road well trafficked night comfort rude inns found

 three days ride winterfell however farmland gave way dense wood kingsroad grew lonely flint hills rose higher wilder passing mile fifth day turned mountains cold bluegrey giants jagged promontories snow shoulders wind blew north long plumes ice crystals flew high peaks like banners

 mountains wall west road veered north northeast wood forest oak evergreen black brier seemed older darker tyrion ever seen “the wolfswood” benjen stark called indeed nights came alive howls distant packs distant jon snow’s albino direwolf pricked ears nightly howling never raised voice reply something unsettling animal tyrion thought

 eight party counting wolf tyrion traveled two men befit lannister benjen stark bastard nephew fresh mounts night’s watch edge wolfswood stayed night behind wooden walls forest holdfast joined another black brothers one yoren yoren stooped sinister features hidden behind beard black clothing seemed tough old root hard stone pair ragged peasant boys fingers “rapers” yoren said cold look charges tyrion understood life wall said hard doubt preferable castration

 five men three boys direwolf twenty horses cage ravens given benjen stark maester luwin doubt made curious fellowship kingsroad road

 tyrion noticed jon snow watching yoren sullen companions odd cast face looked uncomfortably like dismay yoren twisted shoulder sour smell hair beard matted greasy full lice clothing old patched seldom washed two young recruits smelled even worse seemed stupid cruel

 doubt boy made mistake thinking night’s watch made men like uncle yoren companions rude awakening tyrion felt sorry boy chosen hard life… perhaps say hard life chosen

 rather less sympathy uncle benjen stark seemed share brother’s distaste lannisters pleased tyrion told intentions “i warn lannister you’ll find inns wall” said looking

 “no doubt you’ll find place put me” tyrion replied “as might noticed i’m small”

 one say queen’s brother course settled matter stark happy “you like ride promise that” he’d said curtly since moment set done could live promise

 end first week tyrion’s thighs raw hard riding legs cramping badly chilled bone complain damned would give benjen stark satisfaction

 took small revenge matter riding fur tattered bearskin old mustysmelling stark offered excess night’s watch gallantry doubt expecting graciously decline tyrion accepted smile brought warmest clothing rode winterfell soon discovered nowhere near warm enough cold growing colder nights well freezing wind blew like knife cutting right warmest woolens stark doubt regretting chivalrous impulse perhaps learned lesson lannisters never declined graciously otherwise lannisters took offered

 farms holdfasts grew scarcer smaller pressed northward ever deeper darkness wolfswood finally roofs shelter thrown back resources

 tyrion never much use making camp breaking one small hobbled intheway stark yoren men erected rude shelters tended horses built fire became custom take fur wineskin go read

 eighteenth night journey wine rare sweet amber summer isles brought way north casterly rock book rumination history properties dragons lord eddard stark’s permission tyrion borrowed rare volumes winterfell library packed ride north

 tyrion morbid fascination dragons first come king’s landing sister’s wedding robert baratheon made point seek dragon skulls hung walls targaryen’s throne room king robert replaced banners tapestries tyrion persisted found skulls dank cellar stored

 “why read much”

 tyrion looked sound voice jon snow standing feet away regarding curiously closed book finger said “look tell see”

 boy looked suspiciously “is kind trick see tyrion lannister”

 tyrion sighed “you remarkably polite bastard snow see dwarf twelve”

 “fourteen” boy said

 “fourteen you’re taller ever legs short twisted walk difficulty require special saddle keep falling horse saddle design may interested know either ride pony arms strong enough short never make swordsman born peasant might left die sold slaver’s grotesquerie alas born lannister casterly rock grotesqueries poorer things expected father hand king twenty years brother later killed king turns life full little ironies sister married new king repulsive nephew king must part honor house wouldn’t agree yet well legs may small body head large although prefer think large enough mind realistic grasp strengths weaknesses mind weapon brother sword king robert warhammer mind… mind needs books sword needs whetstone keep edge” tyrion tapped leather cover book “that’s read much jon snow”

 boy absorbed silence stark face name long solemn guarded face gave nothing away whoever mother left little son “what reading about” asked

 “dragons” tyrion told

 “what good dragons” boy said easy certainty youth

 “so say” tyrion replied “sad isn’t age used dream dragon own”

 “you did” boy said suspiciously perhaps thought tyrion making fun

 “oh yes even stunted twisted ugly little boy look world he’s seated dragon’s back” tyrion pushed bearskin aside climbed feet “i used start fires bowels casterly rock stare flames hours pretending dragonfire sometimes i’d imagine father burning times sister” jon snow staring look equal parts horror fascination tyrion guffawed “don’t look way bastard know secret you’ve dreamt kind dreams”

 “no” jon snow said horrified “i wouldn’t…”

 “no never” tyrion raised eyebrow “well doubt starks terribly good i’m certain lady stark treats one brother robb he’s always kind gets winterfell get wall father… must good reasons packing night’s watch…”

 “stop it” jon snow said face dark anger “the night’s watch noble calling”

 tyrion laughed “you’re smart believe night’s watch midden heap misfits realm i’ve seen looking yoren boys new brothers jon snow like sullen peasants debtors poachers rapers thieves bastards like wind wall watching grumkins snarks monsters wet nurse warned good part grumkins snarks it’s scarcely dangerous work bad part freeze balls since you’re allowed breed anyway don’t suppose matters”

 “stop it” boy screamed took step forward hands coiling fists close tears

 suddenly absurdly tyrion felt guilty took step forward intending give boy reassuring pat shoulder mutter word apology

 never saw wolf came one moment walking toward snow next flat back hard rocky ground book spinning away fell breath going sudden impact mouth full dirt blood rotting leaves tried get back spasmed painfully must wrenched fall ground teeth frustration grabbed root pulled back sitting position “help me” said boy reaching hand

 suddenly wolf growl damned thing never made sound looked bright red eyes showed teeth enough tyrion sagged back ground grunt “don’t help i’ll sit right leave”

 jon snow stroked ghost’s thick white fur smiling “ask nicely”

 tyrion lannister felt anger coiling inside crushed first time life humiliated would last perhaps even deserved “i grateful kind assistance jon” said mildly

 “down ghost” boy said direwolf sat haunches red eyes never left tyrion jon came around behind slid hands arms lifted easily feet picked book handed back

 catelyn saw shadow slip open door behind low rumble less snarl merest whisper threat must heard something started turn wolf made leap went together half sprawled catelyn she’d fallen wolf jaw man’s shriek lasted less second beast wrenched back head taking half throat

 blood felt like warm rain sprayed across face

 “i’ve never seen aurochs” sansa said feeding piece bacon lady table direwolf took hand delicate queen

 septa mordane sniffed disapproval “a noble lady feed dogs table” said breaking another piece comb letting honey drip onto bread

 “she’s dog she’s direwolf” sansa pointed lady licked fingers rough tongue “anyway father said could keep us want”

 septa appeased “you’re good girl sansa vow comes creature you’re willful sister arya” scowled “and arya morning”

 “she wasn’t hungry” sansa said knowing full well sister probably stolen kitchen hours ago wheedled breakfast cook’s boy

 “do remind dress nicely today grey velvet perhaps invited ride queen princess myrcella royal wheelhouse must look best”

 sansa already looked best brushed long auburn hair shone picked nicest blue silks looking forward today week great honor ride queen besides prince joffrey might betrothed thinking made feel strange fluttering inside even though marry years years sansa really know joffrey yet already love ever dreamt prince tall handsome strong hair like gold treasured every chance spend time thing scared today arya arya way ruining everything never knew would “i’ll tell her” sansa said uncertainly “but she’ll dress way always does” hoped wouldn’t embarrassing “may excused”

 “you may” septa mordane helped bread honey sansa slid bench lady followed heels ran inn’s common room

 outside stood moment amidst shouts curses creak wooden wheels men broke tents pavilions loaded wagons another day’s march inn sprawling threestory structure pale stone biggest sansa ever seen even accommodations less third king’s party swollen four hundred addition father’s household freeriders joined road

 found arya banks trident trying hold nymeria still brushed dried mud fur direwolf enjoying process arya wearing riding leathers worn yesterday day

 “you better put something pretty” sansa told “septa mordane said we’re traveling queen’s wheelhouse princess myrcella today”

 “i’m not” arya said trying brush tangle nymeria’s matted grey fur “mycah going ride upstream look rubies ford”

 “rubies” sansa said lost “what rubies”

 arya gave look like stupid “rhaegar’s rubies king robert killed crown”

 sansa regarded scrawny little sister disbelief “you can’t look rubies princess expecting us queen invited us both”

 “i don’t care” arya said “the wheelhouse doesn’t even windows can’t see thing”

 “what could want see” sansa said annoyed thrilled invitation stupid sister going ruin everything she’d feared “it’s fields farms holdfasts”

 “it not” arya said stubbornly “if came us sometimes you’d see”

 “i hate riding” sansa said fervently “all get soiled dusty sore”

 arya shrugged “hold still” snapped nymeria “i’m hurting you” sansa said “when crossing neck counted thirtysix flowers never saw mycah showed lizardlion”

 sansa shuddered twelve days crossing neck rumbling crooked causeway endless black bog hated every moment air damp clammy causeway narrow could even make proper camp night stop right kingsroad dense thickets halfdrowned trees pressed close around branches dripping curtains pale fungus huge flowers bloomed mud floated pools stagnant water stupid enough leave causeway pluck quicksands waiting suck snakes watching trees lizardlions floating halfsubmerged water like black logs eyes teeth

 none stopped arya course one day came back grinning horsey grin hair tangled clothes covered mud clutching raggedy bunch purple green flowers father sansa kept hoping would tell arya behave act like highborn lady supposed never hugged thanked flowers made worse

 turned purple flowers called poison kisses arya got rash arms sansa would thought might taught lesson arya laughed next day rubbed mud arms like ignorant bog woman friend mycah told would stop itching bruises arms shoulders dark purple welts faded greenandyellow splotches sansa seen sister undressed sleep gotten seven gods knew

 arya still going brushing nymeria’s tangles chattering things she’d seen trek south “last week found haunted watchtower day chased herd wild horses seen run caught scent nymeria” wolf wriggled grasp arya scolded “stop side you’re muddy”

 “you’re supposed leave column” sansa reminded “father said so”

 arya shrugged “i didn’t go far anyway nymeria whole time don’t always go either sometimes it’s fun ride along wagons talk people”

 sansa knew sorts people arya liked talk squires grooms serving girls old men naked children roughspoken freeriders uncertain birth arya would make friends anybody mycah worst butcher’s boy thirteen wild slept meat wagon smelled slaughtering block sight enough make sansa feel sick arya seemed prefer company

 sansa running patience “you come me” told sister firmly “you can’t refuse queen septa mordane expect you”

 arya ignored gave hard yank brush nymeria growled spun away affronted “come back here”

 “there’s going lemon cakes tea” sansa went adult reasonable lady brushed leg sansa scratched ears way liked lady sat beside haunches watching arya chase nymeria “why would want ride smelly old horse get sore sweaty could recline feather pillows eat cakes queen”

 “i don’t like queen” arya said casually sansa sucked breath shocked even arya would say thing sister prattled heedless “she won’t even let bring nymeria” thrust brush belt stalked wolf nymeria watched approach warily

 “a royal wheelhouse place wolf” sansa said “and princess myrcella afraid know that”

 “myrcella little baby” arya grabbed nymeria around neck moment pulled brush direwolf wriggled free bounded frustrated arya threw brush “bad wolf” shouted

 sansa couldn’t help smile little kennelmaster told animal takes master gave lady quick little hug lady licked cheek sansa giggled arya heard whirled around glaring “i don’t care say i’m going riding” long horsey face got stubborn look meant going something willful

 “gods true arya sometimes act like child” sansa said “i’ll go ever much nicer way lady eat lemon cakes best time without you”

 turned walk arya shouted “they won’t let bring lady either” gone sansa could think reply chasing nymeria along river

 alone humiliated sansa took long way back inn knew septa mordane would waiting lady padded quietly side almost tears wanted things nice pretty way songs couldn’t arya sweet delicate kind like princess myrcella would liked sister like

 sansa could never understand two sisters born two years apart could different would easier arya bastard like half brother jon even looked like jon long face brown hair starks nothing lady mother face coloring jon’s mother common people whispered littler sansa even asked mother perhaps hadn’t mistake perhaps grumkins stolen real sister mother laughed said arya daughter sansa’s trueborn sister blood blood sansa could think mother would want lie supposed true

 neared center camp distress quickly forgotten crowd gathered around queen’s wheelhouse sansa heard excited voices buzzing like hive bees doors thrown open saw queen stood top wooden steps smiling someone heard saying “the council us great honor good lords”

 “what’s happening” asked squire knew

 “the council sent riders king’s landing escort us rest way” told “an honor guard king”

 anxious see sansa let lady clear path crowd people moved aside hastily direwolf got closer saw two knights kneeling queen armor fine gorgeous made blink

 strong hands grasped shoulders moment sansa thought father turned burned face sandor clegane looking mouth twisted terrible mockery smile “you shaking girl” said voice rasping “do frighten much”

 since first laid eyes ruin fire made face though seemed half terrifying still sansa wrenched away hound laughed lady moved rumbling warning sansa dropped knees wrap arms around wolf gathered around gaping could feel eyes heard muttered comments titters laughter

 “a wolf” man said someone else said “seven hells that’s direwolf” first man said “what’s camp” hound’s rasping voice replied “the starks use wet nurses” sansa realized two stranger knights looking lady swords hands frightened ashamed tears filled eyes

 heard queen say “joffrey go her”

 “leave alone” joffrey said stood beautiful blue wool black leather golden curls shining sun like crown gave hand drew feet “what sweet lady afraid one hurt put away swords wolf little pet that’s all” looked sandor clegane “and dog away you’re scaring betrothed”

 hound ever faithful bowed slid away quietly press sansa struggled steady felt like fool stark winterfell noble lady someday would queen “it sweet prince” tried explain “it one”

 two stranger knights exchanged look “payne” chuckled young man green armor

 older man white spoke sansa gently “ofttimes ser ilyn frightens well sweet lady fearsome aspect”

 “as well should” queen descended wheelhouse spectators parted make way “if wicked fear mng’s justice put wrong man office”

 sansa finally found words “then surely chosen right one grace” said gale laughter erupted around

 general laughter led lord renly tension moments ago gone sansa beginning feel comfortable… ser ilyn payne shouldered two men aside stood unsmiling say word lady bared teeth began growl low rumble full menace time sansa silenced wolf gentle hand head “i sorry offended ser ilyn” said

 waited answer none came headsman looked pale colorless eyes seemed strip clothes away skin leaving soul naked still silent turned walked away

 sansa understand looked prince “did say something wrong grace speak me”

 “ser ilyn feeling talkative past fourteen years” lord renly commented sly smile

 joffrey gave uncle look pure loathing took sansa’s hands “aerys targaryen tongue ripped hot pincers”

 “he speaks eloquently sword however” queen said “and devotion realm unquestioned” smiled graciously said “sansa good councillors must speak together king returns father fear shall postpone day myrcella please give sweet sister apologies joffrey perhaps would kind entertain guest today”

 “it would pleasure mother” joffrey said formally took arm led away wheelhouse sansa’s spirits took flight whole day prince gazed joffrey worshipfully gallant thought way rescued ser ilyn hound almost like songs like time serwyn mirror shield saved princess daeryssa giants prince aemon dragonknight championing queen naerys’s honor evil ser morgil’s slanders

 touch joffrey’s hand sleeve made heart beat faster “what would like do”

 sansa thought said “whatever you’d like prince”

 bran

 seemed though falling years

 fly voice whispered darkness bran know fly could fall

 maester luwin made little boy clay baked till hard brittle dressed bran’s clothes flung roof bran remembered way shattered “but never fall” said falling

 ground far could barely make grey mists whirled around could feel fast falling knew waiting even dreams could fall forever would wake instant hit ground knew always woke instant hit ground

 bran felt along shoulders groping feathers

 different kinds wings crow said

 bran staring arms legs skinny skin stretched taut bones always thin tried remember face swam grey mist shining light golden “the things love” said

 bran screamed

 crow took air cawing shrieked forget need put aside put away landed bran’s shoulder pecked shining golden face gone

 bran falling faster ever grey mists howled around plunged toward earth “what me” asked crow tearful

 teaching fly

 “i can’t fly”

 you’re flying tight

 “i’m falling”

 every flight begins fall crow said look

 “i’m afraid…”

 look

 bran looked felt insides turn water ground rushing whole world spread tapestry white brown green could see everything clearly moment forgot afraid could see whole realm everyone

 saw winterfell eagles see tall towers looking squat stubby castle walls lines dirt saw maester luwin balcony studying sky polished bronze tube frowning made notes book saw brother robb taller stronger remembered practicing swordplay yard real steel hand saw hodor simple giant stables carrying anvil mikken’s forge hefting onto shoulder easily another man might heft bale hay heart godswood great white weirwood brooded reflection black pool leaves rustling chill wind felt bran watching lifted eyes still waters stared back knowingly

 looked east saw galley racing across waters bite saw mother sitting alone cabin looking bloodstained knife table front rowers pulled oars ser rodrik leaned across rail shaking heaving storm gathering ahead vast dark roaring lashed lightning somehow could see

 looked south saw great bluegreen rush trident saw father pleading king face etched grief saw sansa crying sleep night saw arya watching silence holding secrets hard heart shadows around one shadow dark ash terrible face hound another armored like sun golden beautiful loomed giant armor made stone opened visor nothing inside darkness thick black blood

 lifted eyes saw clear across narrow sea free cities green dothraki sea beyond vaes dothrak mountain fabled lands jade sea asshai shadow dragons stirred beneath sunrise

 finally looked north saw wall shining like blue crystal bastard brother jon sleeping alone cold bed skin growing pale hard memory warmth fled looked past wall past endless forests cloaked snow past frozen shore great bluewhite rivers ice dead plains nothing grew lived north north north looked curtain light end world beyond curtain looked deep heart winter cried afraid heat tears burned cheeks

 know crow whispered sat shoulder know must live

 “why” bran said understanding falling falling

 winter coming

 bran looked crow shoulder crow looked back three eyes third eye full terrible knowledge bran looked nothing snow cold death frozen wasteland jagged bluewhite spires ice waited embrace flew like spears saw bones thousand dreamers impaled upon points desperately afraid

 “can man still brave he’s afraid” heard voice saying small far away

 father’s voice replied “that time man brave”

 bran crow urged choose fly die

 death reached screaming

 bran spread arms flew

 wings unseen drank wind filled pulled upward terrible needles ice receded sky opened bran soared better climbing better anything world grew small beneath

 “i’m flying” cried delight

 i’ve noticed said threeeyed crow took air flapping wings face slowing blinding faltered air pinions beat cheeks beak stabbed fiercely bran felt sudden blinding pain middle forehead eyes

 “what doing” shrieked

 crow opened beak cawed shrill scream fear grey mists shuddered swirled around ripped away like veil saw crow really woman serving woman long black hair knew somewhere winterfell yes remembered realized winterfell bed high chilly tower room blackhaired woman dropped basin water shatter floor ran steps shouting “he’s awake he’s awake he’s awake”

 bran touched forehead eyes place crow pecked still burning nothing blood wound felt weak dizzy tried get bed nothing happened

 movement beside bed something landed lightly legs felt nothing pair yellow eyes looked shining like sun window open cold room warmth came wolf enfolded like hot bath pup bran realized… big reached pet hand trembling like leaf

 brother robb burst room breathless dash tower steps direwolf licking bran’s face bran looked calmly “his name summer” said





 catelyn

 “we make king’s landing within hour”

 catelyn turned away rail forced smile “your oarmen done well us captain one shall silver stag token gratitude”

 captain moreo turnitis favored half bow “you far generous lady stark honor carrying great lady like reward need”

 “but they’ll take silver anyway”

 moreo smiled “as say” spoke common tongue fluently slightest hint tyroshi accent he’d plying narrow sea thirty years he’d told oarman quartermaster finally captain trading galleys storm dancer fourth ship fastest twomasted galley sixty oars

 certainly fastest ships available white harbor catelyn ser rodrik cassel arrived headlong gallop downriver tyroshi notorious avarice ser rodrik argued hiring fishing sloop three sisters catelyn insisted galley good winds much voyage without galley’s oars they’d still beating way past fingers instead skimming toward king’s landing journey’s end

 close thought beneath linen bandages fingers still throbbed dagger bitten pain scourge catelyn felt lest forget could bend last two fingers left hand others would never dexterous yet small enough price pay bran’s life

 ser rodrik chose moment appear deck “my good friend” said moreo forked green beard tyroshi loved bright colors even facial hair “it fine see looking better”

 “yes” ser rodrik agreed “i haven’t wanted die almost two days now” bowed catelyn “my lady”

 looking better shade thinner set white harbor almost strong winds bite roughness narrow sea agreed he’d almost gone side storm seized unexpectedly dragonstone yet somehow clung rope three moreo’s men could rescue carry safely decks

 “the captain telling voyage almost end” said

 ser rodrik managed wry smile “so soon” looked odd without great white side whiskers smaller somehow less fierce ten years older yet back bite seemed prudent submit crewman’s razor whiskers become hopelessly befouled third time leaned rail retched swirling winds

 “i leave discuss business” captain moreo said bowed took leave

 galley skimmed water like dragonfly oars rising falling perfect time ser rodrik held rail looked passing shore “i valiant protectors”

 catelyn touched arm “we ser rodrik safely truly matters” hand groped beneath cloak fingers stiff fumbling dagger still side found touch reassure “now must reach king’s masteratarms pray trusted”

 “ser aron santagar vain man honest one” ser rodrik’s hand went face stroke whiskers discovered gone looked nonplussed “he may know blade yes… lady moment go ashore risk court know sight”

 catelyn’s mouth grew tight “littlefinger” murmured face swam boy’s face though boy longer father died several years lord baelish yet still called littlefinger brother edmure given name long ago riverrun family’s modest holdings smallest fingers petyr slight short age

 ser rodrik cleared throat “lord baelish ah…” thought trailed uncertainly search polite word

 catelyn past delicacy “he father’s ward grew together riverrun thought brother feelings were… brotherly announced wed brandon stark petyr challenged right hand madness brandon twenty petyr scarcely fifteen beg brandon spare petyr’s life let scar afterward father sent away seen since” lifted face spray brisk wind could blow memories away “he wrote riverrun brandon killed burned letter unread knew ned would marry brother’s place”

 ser rodrik’s fingers fumbled nonexistent whiskers “littlefinger sits small council now”

 “i knew would rise high” catelyn said “he always clever even boy one thing clever another wise wonder years done him”

 high overhead fareyes sang rigging captain moreo came scrambling across deck giving orders around storm dancer burst frenetic activity king’s landing slid view atop three high hills

 three hundred years ago catelyn knew heights covered forest handful fisherfolk lived north shore blackwater rush deep swift river flowed sea aegon conqueror sailed dragonstone army put ashore highest hill built first crude redoubt wood earth

 city covered shore far catelyn could see manses arbors granaries brick storehouses timbered inns merchant’s stalls taverns graveyards brothels piled one another could hear clamor fish market even distance buildings broad roads lined trees wandering crookback streets alleys narrow two men could walk abreast visenya’s hill crowned great sept baelor seven crystal towers across city hill rhaenys stood blackened walls dragonpit huge dome collapsing ruin bronze doors closed century street sisters ran straight arrow city walls rose distance high strong

 hundred quays lined waterfront harbor crowded ships deepwater fishing boats river runners came went ferrymen poled back forth across blackwater rush trading galleys unloaded goods braavos pentos lys catelyn spied queen’s ornate barge tied beside fatbellied whaler port ibben hull black tar upriver dozen lean golden warships rested cribs sails furled cruel iron rams lapping water

 frowning aegon’s high hill red keep seven huge drumtowers crowned iron ramparts immense grim barbican vaulted halls covered bridges barracks dungeons granaries massive curtain walls studded archers’ nests fashioned pale red stone aegon conqueror commanded built son maegor cruel seen completed afterward taken heads every stonemason woodworker builder labored blood dragon would ever know secrets fortress dragonlords built vowed

 yet banners flew battlements golden black threeheaded dragon breathed fire pranced crowned stag house baratheon

 highmasted swan ship summer isles beating port white sails huge wind storm dancer moved past pulling steadily shore

 “my lady” ser rodrik said “i thought best proceed lay abed must enter castle go stead bring ser aron safe place”

 studied old knight galley drew near pier moreo shouting vulgar valyrian free cities “you would much risk would”

 ser rodrik smiled “i think looked reflection water earlier scarcely recognized mother last person see without whiskers forty years dead believe safe enough lady”

 moreo bellowed command one sixty oars lifted river reversed backed water galley slowed another shout oars slid back inside hull thumped dock tyroshi seamen leapt tie moreo came bustling smiles “king’s landing lady command never ship made swifter surer passage needing assistance carry things castle”

 “we shall going castle perhaps suggest inn someplace clean comfortable far river”

 tyroshi fingered forked green beard “just know several establishments might suit needs yet first may bold matter second half payment agreed upon course extra silver kind promise sixty stags believe was”

 “for oarmen” catelyn reminded

 “oh certainty” said moreo “though perhaps hold return tyrosh sake wives children give silver lady dice away spend night’s pleasure”

 “there worse things spend money on” ser rodrik put “winter coming”

 “a man must make choices” catelyn said “they earned silver spend concern mine”

 “as say lady” moreo replied bowing smiling

 sure catelyn paid oarmen stag man copper two men carried chests halfway visenya’s hill inn moreo suggested rambling old place eel alley woman owned sour crone wandering eye looked suspiciously bit coin catelyn offered make sure real rooms large airy though moreo swore fish stew savory seven kingdoms best interest names

 “i think best stay away common room” ser rodrik said settled “even place like one never knows may watching” wore ringmail dagger longsword dark cloak hood could pull head “i back nightfall ser aron” promised “rest lady”

 catelyn tired voyage long fatiguing longer young windows opened alley rooftops view blackwater beyond watched ser rodrik set striding briskly busy streets lost crowds decided take advice bedding stuffed straw instead feathers trouble falling asleep

 woke pounding door

 catelyn sat sharply outside window rooftops king’s landing red light setting sun slept longer intended fist hammered door voice called “open name king”

 “a moment” called wrapped cloak dagger bedside table snatched unlatched heavy wooden door

 men pushed room wore black ringmail golden cloaks city watch leader smiled dagger hand said “no need m’lady we’re escort castle”

 “by whose authority” said

 showed ribbon catelyn felt breath catch throat seal mockingbird grey wax “petyr” said soon something must happened ser rodrik looked head guardsman “do know am”

 “no m’lady” said “m’lord littlefinger said bring see mistreated”

 catelyn nodded “you may wait outside dress”

 bathed hands basin wrapped clean linen fingers thick awkward struggled lace bodice knot drab brown cloak neck could littlefinger known ser rodrik would never told old might stubborn loyal fault late lannisters reached king’s landing true ned would surely would come how…

 thought moreo tyroshi knew damn hoped he’d gotten good price information

 brought horse lamps lit along streets set catelyn felt eyes city rode surrounded guard golden cloaks reached red keep portcullis great gates sealed night castle windows alive flickering lights guardsmen left mounts outside walls escorted narrow postern door endless steps tower

 alone room seated heavy wooden table oil lamp beside wrote ushered inside set pen looked “cat” said quietly

 “why brought fashion”

 rose gestured brusquely guards “leave us” men departed “you mistreated trust” said gone “i gave firm instructions” noticed bandages “your hands…”

 catelyn ignored implied question “i accustomed summoned like serving wench” said icily “as boy still knew meaning courtesy”

 “i’ve angered lady never intent” looked contrite look brought back vivid memories catelyn sly child mischiefs always looked contrite gift years changed much petyr small boy grown small man inch two shorter catelyn slender quick sharp features remembered laughing greygreen eyes little pointed chin beard threads silver dark hair though still shy thirty went well silver mockingbird fastened cloak even child always loved silver

 “how know city” asked

 “lord varys knows all” petyr said sly smile “he joining us shortly wanted see alone first long cat many years”

 catelyn ignored familiarity important questions “so king’s spider found me”

 littlefinger winced “you don’t want call he’s sensitive comes eunuch imagine nothing happens city without varys knowing oftimes knows happens informants everywhere little birds calls one little birds heard visit thankfully varys came first”

 “why you”

 shrugged “why master coin king’s councillor selmy lord renly rode north meet robert lord stannis gone dragonstone leaving maester pycelle obvious choice ever friend sister lysa varys knows that”

 “does varys know about…”

 “lord varys knows everything… except here” lifted eyebrow “why here”

 “a wife allowed yearn husband mother needs daughters close tell no”

 littlefinger laughed “oh good lady please don’t expect believe know well tully words again”

 throat dry “family duty honor” recited stiffly know well

 “family duty honor” echoed “all required remain winterfell hand left lady something happened sudden trip bespeaks certain urgency beg let help old sweet friends never hesitate rely upon other” soft knock door “enter” littlefinger called

 man stepped door plump perfumed powdered hairless egg wore vest woven gold thread loose gown purple silk feet pointed slippers soft velvet “lady stark” said taking hand “to see many years joy” flesh soft moist breath smelled lilacs “oh poor hands burned sweet lady fingers delicate… good maester pycelle makes marvelous salve shall send jar”

 catelyn slid fingers grasp “i thank lord maester luwin already seen hurts”

 varys bobbed head “i grievous sad hear son young gods cruel”

 “on agree lord varys” said title courtesy due council member varys lord nothing spiderweb master none whisperers

 eunuch spread soft hands “on hope sweet lady great esteem husband new hand know love king robert”

 “yes” forced say “for certainty”

 “never king beloved robert” quipped littlefinger smiled slyly “at least lord varys’s hearing”

 “good lady” varys said great solicitude “there men free cities wondrous healing powers say word send one dear bran”

 “maester luwin done bran” told would speak bran men trusted littlefinger little varys would let see grief “lord baelish tells thank bringing here”

 varys giggled like little girl “oh yes suppose guilty hope forgive kind lady” eased seat put hands together “i wonder might trouble show us dagger”

 catelyn stark stared eunuch stunned disbelief spider thought wildly enchanter worse knew things one could possibly know unless…“what done ser rodrik” demanded

 littlefinger lost “i feel rather like knight arrives battle without lance dagger talking ser rodrik”

 “ser rodrik cassel masteratarms winterfell” varys informed “i assure lady stark nothing done good knight call early afternoon visited ser aron santagar armory talked certain dagger sunset left castle together walked dreadful hovel staying still drinking common room waiting return ser rodrik distressed find gone”

 “how could know that”

 “the whisperings little birds” varys said smiling “i know things sweet lady nature service” shrugged “you dagger yes”

 catelyn pulled beneath cloak threw table front “here perhaps little birds whisper name man belongs to”

 varys lifted knife exaggerated delicacy ran thumb along edge blood welled let squeal dropped dagger back table

 “careful” catelyn told “it’s sharp”

 “nothing holds edge like valyrian steel” littlefinger said varys sucked bleeding thumb looked catelyn sullen admonition littlefinger hefted knife lightly hand testing grip flipped air caught hand “such sweet balance want find owner reason visit need ser aron lady come me”

 “and had” said “what would told me”

 “i would told one knife like king’s landing” grasped blade thumb forefinger drew back shoulder threw across room practiced flick wrist struck door buried deep oak quivering “it’s mine”

 “yours” made sense petyr winterfell

 “until tourney prince joffrey’s name day” said crossing room wrench dagger wood “i backed ser jaime jousting along half court” petyr’s sheepish grin made look half boy “when loras tyrell unhorsed many us became trifle poorer ser jaime lost hundred golden dragons queen lost emerald pendant lost knife grace got emerald back winner kept rest”

 “who” catelyn demanded mouth dry fear fingers ached remembered pain

 “the imp” said littlefinger lord varys watched face “tyrion lannister”





 jon

 courtyard rang song swords

 black wool boiled leather mail sweat trickled icily jon’s chest pressed attack grenn stumbled backward defending clumsily raised sword jon went underneath sweeping blow crunched back boy’s leg sent staggering grenn’s downcut answered overhand dented helm tried sideswing jon swept aside blade slammed mailed forearm chest grenn lost footing sat hard snow jon knocked sword fingers slash wrist brought cry pain

 “enough” ser alliser thorne voice edge like valyrian steel

 grenn cradled hand “the bastard broke wrist”

 “the bastard hamstrung opened empty skull cut hand would blades edge it’s fortunate watch needs stableboys well rangers” ser alliser gestured jeren toad “get aurochs feet funeral arrangements make”

 jon took helm boys pulling grenn feet frosty morning air felt good face leaned sword drew deep breath allowed moment savor victory

 “that longsword old man’s cane” ser alliser said sharply “are legs hurting lord snow”

 jon hated name mockery ser alliser hung first day came practice boys picked heard everywhere slid longsword back scabbard “no” replied

 thorne strode toward crisp black leathers whispering faintly moved compact man fifty years spare hard grey black hair eyes like chips onyx “the truth now” commanded

 “i’m tired” jon admitted arm burned weight longsword starting feel bruises fight done

 “what weak”

 “i won”

 “no aurochs lost”

 one boys sniggered jon knew better reply beaten everyone ser alliser sent yet gained nothing masteratarms served derision thorne hated jon decided course hated boys even worse

 “that all” thorne told “i stomach much ineptitude one day others ever come us pray archers lot fit nothing arrow fodder”

 jon followed rest back armory walking alone often walked alone almost twenty group trained yet one could call friend two three years senior yet one half fighter robb fourteen dareon quick afraid hit pyp used sword like dagger jeren weak girl grenn slow clumsy halder’s blows brutally hard ran right attacks time spent jon despised

 inside jon hung sword scabbard hook stone wall ignoring others around methodically began strip mail leather sweatsoaked woolens chunks coal burned iron braziers either end long room jon found shivering chill always years would forget felt like warm

 weariness came suddenly donned roughspun blacks everyday wear sat bench fingers fumbling fastenings cloak cold thought remembering warm halls winterfell hot waters ran walls like blood man’s body scant warmth found castle black walls cold people colder

 one told night’s watch would like one except tyrion lannister dwarf given truth road north late jon wondered father known wall would like must thought made hurt worse

 even uncle abandoned cold place end world genial benjen stark known became different person first ranger spent days nights lord commander mormont maester aemon high officers jon given less tender charge ser alliser thorne

 three days arrival jon heard benjen stark lead halfdozen men ranging haunted forest night sought uncle great timbered common hall pleaded go benjen refused curtly “this winterfell” told cut meat fork dagger “on wall man gets earns you’re ranger jon green boy smell summer still you”

 stupidly jon argued “i’ll fifteen name day” said “almost man grown”

 benjen stark frowned “a boy boy you’ll remain ser alliser says fit man night’s watch thought stark blood would win easy favors wrong put aside old families swear vows father always place heart brothers now” gestured dagger men around hard cold men black

 jon rose dawn next day watch uncle leave one rangers big ugly man sang bawdy song saddled garron breath steaming cold morning air ben stark smiled smile nephew “how often must tell jon we’ll speak return”

 watched uncle lead horse tunnel jon remembered things tyrion lannister told kingsroad mind’s eye saw ben stark lying dead blood red snow thought made sick becoming

 afterward sought ghost loneliness cell buried face thick white fur

 must alone would make solitude armor castle black godswood small sept drunken septon jon could find pray gods old new real thought cruel implacable winter

 missed true brothers little rickon bright eyes shining begged sweet robb rival best friend constant companion bran stubborn curious always wanting follow join whatever jon robb missed girls even sansa never called anything “my half brother” since old enough understand bastard meant arya… missed even robb skinny little thing scraped knees tangled hair torn clothes fierce willful arya never seemed fit had… yet could always make jon smile would give anything muss hair watch make face hear finish sentence

 “you broke wrist bastard boy”

 jon lifted eyes sullen voice grenn loomed thick neck red face three friends behind knew todder short ugly boy unpleasant voice recruits called toad two ones yoren brought north jon remembered rapers taken fingers he’d forgotten names hardly ever spoke could help brutes bullies without thimble honor

 jon stood “i’ll break one ask nicely” grenn sixteen head taller jon four bigger scare he’d beaten every one yard

 “maybe we’ll break you” one rapers said

 “try” jon reached back sword one grabbed arm twisted behind back

 “you make us look bad” complained toad

 “you looked bad ever met you” jon told boy arm jerked upward hard pain lanced jon would cry

 toad stepped close “the little lordling mouth him” said pig eyes small shiny “is mommy’s mouth bastard whore tell us name maybe time two” laughed

 jon twisted like eel slammed heel across instep boy holding sudden cry pain free flew toad knocked backward bench landed chest hands throat slamming head packed earth

 two fingers pulled throwing roughly ground grenn began kick jon rolling away blows booming voice cut gloom armory “stop now”

 jon pulled feet donal noye stood glowering “the yard fighting” armorer said “keep quarrels armory i’ll make quarrels won’t like that”

 toad sat floor gingerly feeling back head fingers came away bloody “he tried kill me”

 “’s true saw it” one rapers put

 “he broke wrist” grenn said holding noye inspection

 armorer gave offered wrist briefest glances “a bruise perhaps sprain maester aemon give salve go todder head wants looking rest return cells snow stay”

 jon sat heavily long wooden bench others left oblivious looks gave silent promises future retribution arm throbbing

 “the watch need every man get” donal noye said alone “even men like toad won’t win honors killing him”

 jon’s anger flared “he said mother was—”

 “—a whore heard it”

 “lord eddard stark man sleep whores” jon said icily “his honor—”

 “—did prevent fathering bastard it”

 jon cold rage “can go”

 “you go tell go”

 jon stared sullenly smoke rising brazier noye took chin thick fingers twisting head around “look i’m talking boy”

 jon looked armorer chest like keg ale gut match nose flat broad always seemed need shave left sleeve black wool tunic fastened shoulder silver pin shape longsword “words won’t make mother whore nothing toad says change know men wall whose mothers whores”

 mother jon thought stubbornly knew nothing mother eddard stark would talk yet dreamed times often could almost see face dreams beautiful highborn eyes kind

 “you think hard high lord’s bastard” armorer went “that boy jeren septon’s get cotter pyke baseborn son tavern wench commands eastwatch sea”

 “i don’t care” jon said “i don’t care don’t care thorne benjen stark hate it’s too… it’s cold”

 “yes cold hard mean that’s wall men walk like stories wet nurse told well piss stories piss wet nurse way you’re life rest us”

 “life” jon repeated bitterly armorer could talk life he’d one he’d taken black he’d lost arm siege storm’s end he’d smithed stannis baratheon king’s brother he’d seen seven kingdoms one end he’d feasted wenched fought hundred battles said donal noye who’d forged king robert’s warhammer one crushed life rhaegar targaryen trident he’d done things jon would never old well past thirty he’d taken glancing blow axe wound festered whole arm come crippled donal noye come wall life

 “yes life” noye said “a long life short one it’s snow road you’re walking one brothers slit throat one night”

 “they’re brothers” jon snapped “they hate i’m better are”

 “no hate act like you’re better look see castlebred bastard thinks he’s lordling” armorer leaned close “you’re lordling remember you’re snow stark you’re bastard bully”

 “a bully” jon almost choked word accusation unjust took breath away “they ones came four them”

 “four you’ve humiliated yard four probably afraid i’ve watched fight it’s training put good edge sword they’d dead meat know know know leave nothing shame make proud”

 jon hesitated feel proud shouldn’t armorer taking away making sound something wrong “they’re older me” said defensively

 “older bigger stronger that’s truth i’ll wager masteratarms taught fight bigger men winterfell though old knight”

 “ser rodrik cassel” jon said warily trap felt closing around

 donal noye leaned forward jon’s face “now think boy none others ever masteratarms ser alliser fathers farmers wagonmen poachers smiths miners oars trading galley know fighting learned decks alleys oldtown lannisport wayside brothels taverns kingsroad may clacked sticks together came promise one twenty ever rich enough real sword” look grim “so like taste victories lord snow”

 “don’t call that” jon said sharply force gone anger suddenly felt ashamed guilty “i never… didn’t think…”

 “best start thinking” noye warned “that sleep dagger bed go”

 time jon left armory almost midday sun broken clouds turned back lifted eyes wall blazing blue crystalline sunlight even weeks sight still gave shivers centuries windblown dirt pocked scoured covering like film often seemed pale grey color overcast sky… sun caught fair bright day shone alive light colossal bluewhite cliff filled half sky

 largest structure ever built hands man benjen stark told jon kingsroad first caught sight wall distance “and beyond doubt useless” tyrion lannister added grin even imp grew silent rode closer could see miles pale blue line across northern horizon stretching away east west vanishing far distance immense unbroken end world seemed say

 finally spied castle black timbered keeps stone towers looked like nothing handful toy blocks scattered snow beneath vast wall ice ancient stronghold black brothers winterfell true castle lacking walls could defended south east west north concerned night’s watch north loomed wall almost seven hundred feet high stood three times height tallest tower stronghold sheltered uncle said top wide enough dozen armored knights ride abreast gaunt outlines huge catapults monstrous wooden cranes stood sentry like skeletons great birds among walked men black small ants

 stood outside armory looking jon felt almost overwhelmed day kingsroad he’d seen first time wall like sometimes could almost forget way forgot sky earth underfoot times seemed nothing else world older seven kingdoms stood beneath looked made jon dizzy could feel great weight ice pressing topple somehow jon knew fell world fell

 “makes wonder lies beyond” familiar voice said

 jon looked around “lannister didn’t see—i mean thought alone”

 tyrion lannister bundled furs thickly looked like small bear “there’s much said taking people unawares never know might learn”

 “you won’t learn anything me” jon told seen little dwarf since journey ended queen’s brother tyrion lannister honored guest night’s watch lord commander given rooms king’s tower—socalled though king visited hundred years—and lannister dined mormont’s table spent days riding wall nights dicing drinking ser alliser bowen marsh high officers

 “oh learn things everywhere go” little man gestured wall gnarled black walking stick “as saying… one man builds wall next man immediately needs know what’s side” cocked head looked jon curious mismatched eyes “you want know what’s side don’t you”

 “it’s nothing special” jon said wanted ride benjen stark rangings deep mysteries haunted forest wanted fight mance rayder’s wildlings ward realm others better speak things wanted “the rangers say it’s woods mountains frozen lakes lots snow ice”

 “and grumkins snarks” tyrion said “let us forget lord snow else what’s big thing for”

 “don’t call lord snow”

 dwarf lifted eyebrow “would rather called imp let see words cut you’ll never free mockery want give name take make can’t hurt anymore” gestured stick “come walk they’ll serving vile stew common hall could bowl something hot”

 jon hungry fell beside lannister slowed pace match dwarf’s awkward waddling steps wind rising could hear old wooden buildings creaking around distance heavy shutter banging forgotten muffled thump blanket snow slid roof landed near

 “i don’t see wolf” lannister said walked

 “i chain old stables we’re training board horses east stables one bothers rest time stays sleeping cell hardin’s tower”

 “that’s one broken battlement shattered stone yard lean like noble king robert long night’s drinking thought buildings abandoned”

 jon shrugged “no one cares sleep old keeps empty pick cell want” castle black housed five thousand fighting men horses servants weapons home tenth number parts falling ruin

 tyrion lannister’s laughter steamed cold air “i’ll sure tell father arrest stonemasons tower collapses”

 jon could taste mockery denying truth watch built nineteen great strongholds along wall three still occupied eastwatch grey windswept shore shadow tower hard mountains wall ended castle black end kingsroad keeps long deserted lonely haunted places cold winds whistled black windows spirits dead manned parapets

 “it’s better i’m myself” jon said stubbornly “the rest scared ghost”

 “wise boys” lannister said changed subject “the talk uncle long away”

 jon remembered wish he’d wished anger vision benjen stark dead snow looked away quickly dwarf way sensing things jon want see guilt eyes “he said he’d back name day” admitted name day come gone unremarked fortnight past “they looking ser waymar royce father bannerman lord arryn uncle benjen said might search far shadow tower that’s way mountains”

 “i hear good many rangers vanished late” lannister said mounted steps common hall grinned pulled open door “perhaps grumkins hungry year”

 inside hall immense drafty even fire roaring great hearth crows nested timbers lofty ceiling jon heard cries overhead accepted bowl stew heel black bread day’s cooks grenn toad others seated bench nearest warmth laughing cursing rough voices jon eyed thoughtfully moment chose spot far end hall well away diners

 tyrion lannister sat across sniffing stew suspiciously “barley onion carrot” muttered “someone tell cooks turnip isn’t meat”

 “it’s mutton stew” jon pulled gloves warmed hands steam rising bowl smell made mouth water

 “snow”

 jon knew alliser thorne’s voice curious note heard turned

 “the lord commander wants see now”

 moment jon frightened move would lord commander want see heard something benjen thought wildly dead vision come true “is uncle” blurted “is returned safe”

 “the lord commander accustomed waiting” ser alliser’s reply “and accustomed commands questioned bastards”

 tyrion lannister swung bench rose “stop thorne you’re frightening boy”

 “keep matters don’t concern lannister place here”

 “i place court though” dwarf said smiling “a word right ear you’ll die sour old man get another boy train tell snow old bear needs see news uncle”

 “no” ser alliser said “this another matter entirely bird arrived morning winterfell message concerns brother” corrected “his half brother”

 “bran” jon breathed scrambling feet “something’s happened bran”

 tyrion lannister laid hand arm “jon” said “i truly sorry”

 jon scarcely heard brushed tyrion’s hand strode across hall running time hit doors raced commander’s keep dashing drifts old snow guards passed took tower steps two time time burst presence lord commander boots soaked jon wildeyed panting “bran” said “what say bran”

 jeor mormont lord commander night’s watch gruff old man immense bald head shaggy grey beard raven arm feeding kernels corn “i told read” shook raven flapped wings flew window sat watching mormont drew roll paper belt handed jon “corn” muttered raucous voice “corn corn”

 jon’s finger traced outline direwolf white wax broken seat recognized robb’s hand letters seemed blur run tried read realized crying tears found sense words raised head “he woke up” said “the gods gave back”

 “crippled” mormont said “i’m sorry boy read rest letter”

 looked words didn’t matter nothing mattered bran going live “my brother going live” told mormont lord commander shook head gathered fistful corn whistled raven flew shoulder crying “live live”

 jon ran stairs smile face robb’s letter hand “my brother going live” told guards exchanged look ran back common hall found tyrion lannister finishing meal grabbed little man arms hoisted air spun around circle “bran going live” whooped lannister looked startled jon put thrust paper hands “here read it” said

 others gathering around looking curiously jon noticed grenn feet away thick woolen bandage wrapped around one hand looked anxious uncomfortable menacing jon went grenn edged backward put hands “stay away bastard”

 jon smiled “i’m sorry wrist robb used move wooden blade hurt like seven hells must worse look want show defend that”

 alliser thorne overheard “lord snow wants take place now” sneered “i’d easier time teaching wolf juggle training aurochs”

 “i’ll take wager ser alliser” jon said “i’d love see ghost juggle”

 jon heard grenn suck breath shocked silence fell

 tyrion lannister guffawed three black brothers joined nearby table laughter spread benches even cooks joined birds stirred rafters finally even grenn began chuckle

 ser alliser never took eyes jon laughter rolled around face darkened sword hand curled fist “that grievous error lord snow” said last acid tones enemy





 eddard

 eddard stark rode towering bronze doors red keep sore tired hungry irritable still ahorse dreaming long hot soak roast fowl featherbed king’s steward told grand maester pycelle convened urgent meeting small council honor hand’s presence requested soon convenient “it convenient morrow” ned snapped dismounted

 steward bowed low “i shall give councillors regrets lord”

 “no damn it” ned said would offend council even begun “i see pray give moments change something presentable”

 “yes lord” steward said “we given lord arryn’s former chambers tower hand please shall things taken there”

 “my thanks” ned said ripped riding gloves tucked belt rest household coming gate behind ned saw vayon poole steward called “it seems council urgent need see daughters find bedchambers tell jory keep arya go exploring” poole bowed ned turned back royal steward “my wagons still straggling city shall need appropriate garments”

 “it great pleasure” steward said

 ned come striding council chambers bonetired dressed borrowed clothing find four members small council waiting

 chamber richly furnished myrish carpets covered floor instead rushes one corner hundred fabulous beasts cavorted bright paints carved screen summer isles walls hung tapestries norvos qohor lys pair valyrian sphinxes flanked door eyes polished garnet smoldering black marble faces

 councillor ned liked least eunuch varys accosted moment entered “lord stark grievous sad hear troubles kingsroad visiting sept light candles prince joffrey pray recovery” hand left powder stains ned’s sleeve smelled foul sweet flowers grave

 “your gods heard you” ned replied cool yet polite “the prince grows stronger every day” disentangled eunuch’s grip crossed room lord renly stood screen talking quietly short man could littlefinger renly boy eight robert throne grown man like brother ned found disconcerting whenever saw years slipped away robert stood fresh victory trident

 “i see arrived safely lord stark” renly said

 “and well” ned replied “you must forgive sometimes look image brother robert”

 “a poor copy” renly said shrug

 “though much better dressed” littlefinger quipped “lord renly spends clothing half ladies court”

 true enough lord renly dark green velvet dozen golden stags embroidered doublet clothofgold half cape draped casually across one shoulder fastened emerald brooch “there worse crimes” renly said laugh “the way dress one”

 littlefinger ignored jibe eyed ned smile lips bordered insolence “i hoped meet years lord stark doubt lady catelyn mentioned you”

 “she has” ned replied chill voice sly arrogance comment rankled “i understand knew brother brandon well”

 renly baratheon laughed varys shuffled listen

 “rather well” littlefinger said “i still carry token esteem brandon speak too”

 “often heat” ned said hoping would end patience game played dueling words

 “i thought heat ill suits starks” littlefinger said “here south say made ice melt ride neck”

 “i plan melting soon lord baelish may count it” ned moved council table said “maester pycelle trust well”

 grand maester smiled gently tall chair foot table “well enough man years lord” replied “yet tire easily fear” wispy strands white hair fringed broad bald dome forehead kindly face maester’s collar simple metal choker luwin wore two dozen heavy chains wound together ponderous metal necklace covered throat breast links forged every metal known man black iron red gold bright copper dull lead steel tin pale silver brass bronze platinum garnets amethysts black pearls adorned metalwork emerald ruby “perhaps might begin soon” grand maester said hands knitting together atop broad stomach “i fear shall fall asleep wait much longer”

 “as will” king’s seat sat empty head table crowned stag baratheon embroidered gold thread pillows ned took chair beside right hand king “my lords” said formally “i sorry kept waiting”

 “you king’s hand” varys said “we serve pleasure lord stark”

 others took accustomed seats struck eddard stark forcefully belong room men remembered robert told crypts winterfell surrounded flatterers fools king insisted ned looked council table wondered flatterers fools thought knew already “we five” pointed

 “lord stannis took dragonstone long king went north” varys said “and gallant ser barristan doubt rides beside king makes way city befits lord commander kingsguard”

 “perhaps best wait ser barristan king join us” ned suggested

 renly baratheon laughed aloud “if wait brother grace us royal presence could long sit”

 “our good king robert many cares” varys said “he entrusts small matters us lighten load”

 “what lord varys means business coin crops justice bores royal brother tears” lord renly said “so falls us govern realm send us command time time” drew tightly rolled paper sleeve laid table “this morning commanded ride ahead haste ask grand maester pycelle convene council urgent task us”

 littlefinger smiled handed paper ned bore royal seal ned broke wax thumb flattened letter consider king’s urgent command reading words mounting disbelief end robert’s folly name salt wound “gods good” swore

 “what lord eddard means say” lord renly announced “is grace instructs us stage great tournament honor appointment hand king”

 “how much” asked littlefinger mildly

 ned read answer letter “forty thousand golden dragons champion twenty thousand man comes second another twenty winner melee ten thousand victor archery competition”

 “ninety thousand gold pieces” littlefinger sighed “and must neglect costs robert want prodigious feast means cooks carpenters serving girls singers jugglers fools…”

 “fools plenty” lord renly said

 grand maester pycelle looked littlefinger asked “will treasury bear expense”

 “what treasury that” littlefinger replied twist mouth “spare foolishness maester know well treasury empty years shall borrow money doubt lannisters accommodating owe lord tywin three million dragons present matter another hundred thousand”

 ned stunned “are claiming crown three million gold pieces debt”

 “the crown six million gold pieces debt lord stark lannisters biggest part also borrowed lord tyrell iron bank braavos several tyroshi trading cartels late i’ve turn faith high septon haggles worse dornish fishmonger”

 ned aghast “aerys targaryen left treasury flowing gold could let happen”

 littlefinger gave shrug “the master coin finds money king hand spend it”

 “i believe jon arryn allowed robert beggar realm” ned said hotly

 grand maester pycelle shook great bald head chains clinking softly “lord arryn prudent man fear grace always listen wise counsel”

 “my royal brother loves tournaments feasts” renly baratheon said “and loathes calls ‘counting coppers’”

 “i speak grace” ned said “this tourney extravagance realm cannot afford”

 “speak will” lord renly said “we still best make plans”

 “another day” ned said perhaps sharply looks gave would remember longer winterfell king stood higher first among equals “forgive lords” said softer tone “i tired let us call halt today resume fresher” ask consent stood abruptly nodded made door

 outside wagons riders still pouring castle gates yard chaos mud horseflesh shouting men king yet arrived told since ugliness trident starks household ridden well ahead main column better separate lannisters growing tension robert hardly seen talk traveling huge wheelhouse drunk often might hours behind would still soon ned’s liking look sansa’s face feel rage twisting inside last fortnight journey misery sansa blamed arya told nymeria died arya lost heard happened butcher’s boy sansa cried sleep arya brooded silently day long eddard stark dreamed frozen hell reserved starks winterfell

 crossed outer yard passed portcullis inner bailey walking toward thought tower hand littlefinger appeared front “you’re going wrong way stark come me”

 hesitantly ned followed littlefinger led tower stair across small sunken courtyard along deserted corridor empty suits armor stood sentinel along walls relics targaryens black steel dragon scales cresting helms dusty forgotten “this way chambers” ned said

 “did say i’m leading dungeons slit throat seal corpse behind wall” littlefinger replied voice dripping sarcasm “we time stark wife awaits”

 “what game playing littlefinger catelyn winterfell hundreds leagues here”

 “oh” littlefinger’s greygreen eyes glittered amusement “then appears someone managed astonishing impersonation last time come don’t come i’ll keep myself” hurried steps

 ned followed warily wondering day would ever end taste intrigues beginning realize meat mead man like littlefinger

 foot steps heavy door oak iron petyr baelish lifted crossbar gestured ned stepped ruddy glow dusk rocky bluff high river “we’re outside castle” ned said

 “you hard man fool stark” littlefinger said smirk “was sun gave away sky follow niches cut rock try fall death catelyn would never understand” side cliff descending quick monkey

 ned studied rocky face bluff moment followed slowly niches littlefinger promised shallow cuts would invisible unless knew look river long dizzying distance ned kept face pressed rock tried look often

 last reached bottom narrow muddy trail along water’s edge littlefinger lazing rock eating apple almost core “you growing old slow stark” said flipping apple casually rushing water “no matter ride rest way” two horses waiting ned mounted trotted behind trail city

 finally baelish drew rein front ramshackle building three stories timbered windows bright lamplight gathering dusk sounds music raucous laughter drifted floated water beside door swung ornate oil lamp heavy chain globe leaded red glass

 ned stark dismounted fury “a brothel” said seized littlefinger shoulder spun around “you’ve brought way take brothel”

 “your wife inside” littlefinger said

 final insult “brandon kind you” ned said slammed small man back wall shoved dagger little pointed chin beard

 “my lord no” urgent voice called “he speaks truth” footsteps behind

 ned spun knife hand old whitehaired man hurried toward dressed brown roughspun soft flesh chin wobbled ran “this business yours” ned began suddenly recognition came lowered dagger astonished “ser rodrik”

 rodrik cassel nodded “your lady awaits upstairs”

 ned lost “catelyn truly strange jape littlefinger’s” sheathed blade

 “would stark” littlefinger said “follow try look shade lecherous shade less like king’s hand would recognized perhaps could fondle breast two passing”

 went inside crowded common room fat woman singing bawdy songs pretty young girls linen shifts wisps colored silk pressed lovers dandled laps one paid ned least bit attention ser rodrik waited littlefinger led third floor along corridor door

 inside catelyn waiting cried saw ran embraced fiercely

 “my lady” ned whispered wonderment

 “oh good” said littlefinger closing door “you recognized her”

 “i feared you’d never come lord” whispered chest “petyr bringing reports told troubles arya young prince girls”

 “both mourning full anger” told “cat understand king’s landing what’s happened” ned asked wife “is bran he…”dead word came lips could say

 “it bran think” catelyn said

 ned lost “then love place”

 “just appears” littlefinger said easing onto window seat “a brothel think less likely place find catelyn tully” smiled “as chances particular establishment arrangements easily made anxious keep lannisters learning cat king’s landing”

 “why” ned asked saw hands awkward way held raw red scars stiffness last two fingers left “you’ve hurt” took hands turned “gods deep cuts… gash sword or… happen lady”

 catelyn slid dagger cloak placed hand “this blade sent open bran’s throat spill life’s blood”

 ned’s head jerked “but… who… would…”

 put finger lips “let tell love go faster way listen”

 listened told fire library tower varys guardsmen littlefinger done eddard stark sat dazed beside table dagger hand bran’s wolf saved boy’s life thought dully jon said found pups snow children meant pups lord killed sansa’s guilt feeling fear gods sent wolves folly done

 painfully ned forced thoughts back dagger meant “the imp’s dagger” repeated made sense hand curled around smooth dragonbone hilt slammed blade table felt bite wood stood mocking “why tyrion lannister want bran dead boy never done harm”

 “do starks nought snow ears” littlefinger asked “the imp would never acted alone”

 ned rose paced length room “if queen role gods forbid king himself… believe that” yet even said words remembered chill morning barrowlands robert’s talk sending hired knives targaryen princess remembered rhaegar’s infant son red ruin skull way king turned away turned away darry’s audience hall long ago could still hear sansa pleading lyanna pleaded

 “most likely king know” littlefinger said “it would first time good robert practiced closing eyes things would rather see”

 ned reply face butcher’s boy swam eyes cloven almost two afterward king said word head pounding

 littlefinger sauntered table wrenched knife wood “the accusation treason either way accuse king dance ilyn payne words mouth queen… find proof make robert listen perhaps…”

 “we proof” ned said “we dagger”

 “this” littlefinger flipped knife casually end end “a sweet piece steel cuts two ways lord imp doubt swear blade lost stolen winterfell hireling dead give lie” tossed knife lightly ned “my counsel drop river forget ever forged”

 ned regarded coldly “lord baelish stark winterfell son lies crippled perhaps dying would dead catelyn wolf pup found snow truly believe could forget big fool took sword brother”

 “a fool may stark… yet i’m still brother moldering frozen grave fourteen years eager molder beside far dissuade would rather included party thank much”

 “you would last man would willingly include party lord baelish”

 “you wound deeply” littlefinger placed hand heart “for part always found starks tiresome lot cat seems become attached reasons cannot comprehend shall try keep alive sake fool’s task admittedly could never refuse wife anything”

 “i told petyr suspicions jon arryn’s death” catelyn said “he promised help find truth”

 news eddard stark welcomed true enough needed help littlefinger almost brother cat would first time ned forced make common cause man despised “very well” said thrusting dagger belt “you spoke varys eunuch know it”

 “not lips” catelyn said “you wed fool eddard stark varys ways learning things man could know dark art ned swear it”

 “he spies well known” ned said dismissive

 “it that” catelyn insisted “ser rodrik spoke ser aron santagar secrecy yet somehow spider knew conversation fear man”

 littlefinger smiled “leave lord varys sweet lady permit small obscenity—and better it—i hold man’s balls palm hand” cupped fingers smiling “or would man balls see pie opened birds begin sing varys would like would worry lannisters less eunuch”

 ned need littlefinger tell thinking back day arya found look queen’s face said wolf soft quiet thinking boy mycah jon arryn’s sudden death bran’s fall old mad aerys targaryen dying floor throne room life’s blood dried golden blade “my lady” said turning catelyn “there nothing want return winterfell one assassin could others whoever ordered bran’s death learn soon enough boy still lives”

 “i hoped see girls…” catelyn said

 “that would unwise” littlefinger put “the red keep full curious eyes children talk”

 “he speaks truly love” ned told embraced “take ser rodrik ride winterfell watch girls go home sons keep safe”

 “as say lord” catelyn lifted face ned kissed maimed fingers clutched back desperate strength hold safe forever shelter arms

 “would lord lady like use bedchamber” asked littlefinger “i warn stark usually charge sort thing around here”

 “a moment alone that’s ask” catelyn said

 “very well” littlefinger strolled door “don’t long past time hand returned castle absence noted”

 catelyn went took hands “i forget help gave petyr men came know whether taking friend enemy found friend found brother i’d thought lost”

 petyr baelish smiled “i desperately sentimental sweet lady best tell anyone spent years convincing court wicked cruel hate see hard work go naught”

 ned believed word kept voice polite said “you thanks well lord baelish”

 “oh there’s treasure” littlefinger said exiting

 door closed behind ned turned back wife “once home send word helman tallhart galbart glover seal raise hundred bowmen fortify moat cailin two hundred determined archers hold neck army instruct lord manderly strengthen repair defenses white harbor see well manned day want careful watch kept theon greyjoy war shall sore need father’s fleet”

 “war” fear plain catelyn’s face

 “it come that” ned promised praying true took arms “the lannisters merciless face weakness aerys targaryen learned sorrow would dare attack north without power realm behind shall must play fool’s masquerade nothing amiss remember came love find proof lannisters murdered jon arryn…”

 felt catelyn tremble arms scarred hands clung “if” said “what love”

 dangerous part ned knew “all justice flows king” told “when know truth must go robert” pray man think finished silently man fear become





 tyrion

 “are certain must leave us soon” lord commander asked

 “past certain lord mormont” tyrion replied “my brother jaime wondering become may decide convinced take black”

 “would could” mormont picked crab claw cracked fist old lord commander still strength bear “you’re cunning man tyrion need men sort wall”

 tyrion grinned “then shall scour seven kingdoms dwarfs ship lord mormont” laughed sucked meat crab leg reached another crabs arrived eastwatch morning packed barrel snow succulent

 ser alliser thorne man table much crack smile “lannister mocks us”

 “only ser alliser” tyrion said time laughter round table nervous uncertain quality

 thorne’s black eyes fixed tyrion loathing “you bold tongue someone less half man perhaps visit yard together”

 “why” asked tyrion “the crabs here”

 remark brought guffaws others ser alliser stood mouth tight line “come make japes steel hand”

 tyrion looked pointedly right hand “why steel hand ser alliser although appears crab fork shall duel” hopped chair began poking thorne’s chest tiny fork roars laughter filled tower room bits crab flew lord commander’s mouth began gasp choke even raven joined cawing loudly window “duel duel duel”

 ser alliser thorne walked room stiffly looked though dagger butt

 mormont still gasping breath tyrion pounded back “to victor goes spoils” called “i claim thorne’s share crabs”

 finally lord commander recovered “you wicked man provoke ser alliser so” scolded

 tyrion seated took sip wine “if man paints target chest expect sooner later someone loose arrow seen dead men humor ser alliser”

 “not so” objected lord steward bowen marsh man round red pomegranate “you ought hear droll names gives lads trains”

 tyrion heard droll names “i’ll wager lads names well” said “chip ice eyes good lords ser alliser thorne mucking stables drilling young warriors”

 “the watch shortage stableboys” lord mormont grumbled “that seems send us days stableboys sneak thieves rapers ser alliser anointed knight one take black since lord commander fought bravely king’s landing”

 “on wrong side” ser jaremy rykker commented dryly “i ought know battlements beside tywin lannister gave us splendid choice take black see heads spikes evenfall offense intended tyrion”

 “none taken ser jaremy father fond spiked heads especially people annoyed fashion face noble well doubt saw decorating city wall king’s gate think would looked striking there”

 “thank you” ser jaremy replied sardonic smile

 lord commander mormont cleared throat “sometimes fear ser alliser saw true tyrion mock us noble purpose here”

 tyrion shrugged “we need mocked time time lord mormont lest start take seriously wine please” held cup

 rykker filled bowen marsh said “you great thirst small man”

 “oh think lord tyrion quite large man” maester aemon said far end table spoke softly yet high officers night’s watch fell quiet better hear ancient say “i think giant come among us end world”

 tyrion answered gently “i’ve called many things lord giant seldom one them”

 “nonetheless” maester aemon said clouded milkwhite eyes moved tyrion’s face “i think true”

 tyrion lannister found loss words could bow head politely say “you kind maester aemon”

 blind man smiled tiny thing wrinkled hairless shrunken beneath weight hundred years maester’s collar links many metals hung loose throat “i called many things lord” said “but kind seldom one them” time tyrion led laughter

 much later serious business eating done others left mormont offered tyrion chair beside fire cup mulled spirits strong brought tears eyes “the kingsroad perilous far north” lord commander told drank

 “i jyck morrec” tyrion said “and yoren riding south again”

 “yoren one man watch shall escort far winterfell” mormont announced tone brooked argument “three men sufficient”

 “if insist lord” tyrion said “you might send young snow would glad chance see brothers”

 mormont frowned thick grey beard “snow oh stark bastard think young ones need forget lives left behind brothers mothers visit home would stir feelings best left alone know things blood kin… sister maege rules bear island since son’s dishonor nieces never seen” took swallow “besides jon snow boy shall three strong swords keep safe”

 “i touched concern lord mormont” strong drink making tyrion lightheaded drunk realize old bear wanted something “i hope repay kindness”

 “you can” mormont said bluntly “your sister sits beside king brother great knight father powerful lord seven kingdoms speak us tell need seen lord night’s watch dying strength less thousand six hundred two hundred shadow tower even fewer eastwatch scant third fighting men wall hundred leagues long think attack come three men defend mile wall”

 “three third” tyrion said yawn

 mormont scarcely seemed hear old man warmed hands fire “i sent benjen stark search yohn royce’s son lost first ranging royce boy green summer grass yet insisted honor command saying due knight wish offend lord father yielded sent two men deemed good watch fool i”

 “fool” raven agreed tyrion glanced bird peered beady black eyes ruffling wings “fool” called doubtless old mormont would take amiss throttled creature pity

 lord commander took notice irritating bird “gared near old longer wall” went “yet would seem forswore fled never believed lord eddard sent head winterfell royce word one deserter two men lost ben stark gone missing” sighed deeply “who send searching two years seventy old weary burden bear yet set pick alliser thorne bowen marsh would blind maester aemon see night’s watch become army sullen boys tired old men apart men table tonight perhaps twenty read even fewer think plan lead watch spent summers building lord commander raised wall higher found stay alive”

 deadly earnest tyrion realized felt faintly embarrassed old man lord mormont spent good part life wall needed believe years meaning “i promise king hear need” tyrion said gravely “and speak father brother jaime well” would tyrion lannister good word left rest unsaid king robert would ignore lord tywin would ask taken leave senses jaime would laugh

 “you young man tyrion” mormont said “how many winters seen”

 shrugged “eight nine misremember”

 “and short”

 “as say lord” born dead winter terrible cruel one maesters said lasted near three years tyrion’s earliest memories spring

 “when boy said long summer always meant long winter come summer lasted nine years tyrion tenth soon upon us think that”

 “when boy” tyrion replied “my wet nurse told one day men good gods would give world summer without ending perhaps we’ve better thought great summer finally hand” grinned

 lord commander seem amused “you fool enough believe lord already days grow shorter mistake aemon letters citadel findings accord end summer stares us face” mormont reached clutched tyrion tightly hand “you must make understand tell lord darkness coming wild things woods direwolves mammoths snow bears size aurochs seen darker shapes dreams”

 “in dreams” tyrion echoed thinking badly needed another strong drink

 mormont deaf edge voice “the fisherfolk near eastwatch glimpsed white walkers shore”

 time tyrion could hold tongue “the fisherfolk lannisport often glimpse merlings”

 “denys mallister writes mountain people moving south slipping past shadow tower numbers greater ever running lord… running what” lord mormont moved window stared night “these old bones lannister never felt chill like tell king say pray winter coming long night falls night’s watch stand realm darkness sweeps north gods help us ready”

 “the gods help get sleep tonight yoren determined ride first light” tyrion got feet sleepy wine tired doom “i thank courtesies done lord mormont”

 “tell tyrion tell make believe thanks need” whistled raven flew perched shoulder mormont smiled gave bird corn pocket tyrion left

 bitter cold outside bundled thickly furs tyrion lannister pulled gloves nodded poor frozen wretches standing sentry outside commander’s keep set across yard chambers king’s tower walking briskly legs could manage patches snow crunched beneath feet boots broke night’s crust breath steamed like banner shoved hands armpits walked faster praying morrec remembered warm bed hot bricks fire

 behind king’s tower wall glimmered light moon immense mysterious tyrion stopped moment look legs ached cold haste

 suddenly strange madness took hold yearning look end world would last chance thought tomorrow would ride south could imagine would ever want return frozen desolation king’s tower promise warmth soft bed yet tyrion found walking past toward vast pale palisade wall

 wooden stair ascended south face anchored huge roughhewn beams sunk deep ice frozen place back forth switched clawing way upward crooked bolt lightning black brothers assured much stronger looked tyrion’s legs cramping badly even contemplate ascent went instead iron cage beside well clambered inside yanked hard bell rope three quick pulls

 wait seemed eternity standing inside bars wall back long enough tyrion begin wonder decided forget sudden whim go bed cage gave jerk began ascend

 moved upward slowly fits starts first smoothly ground fell away beneath cage swung tyrion wrapped hands around iron bars could feel cold metal even gloves morrec fire burning room noted approval lord commander’s tower dark old bear sense seemed

 towers still inching way upward castle black lay etched moonlight could see stark empty windowless keeps crumbling walls courtyards choked broken stone farther could see lights mole’s town little village half league south along kingsroad bright glitter moonlight water icy streams descended mountain heights cut across plains rest world bleak emptiness windswept hills rocky fields spotted snow

 finally thick voice behind said “seven hells it’s dwarf” cage jerked sudden stop hung swinging slowly back forth ropes creaking

 “bring damn it” grunt loud groaning wood cage slid sideways wall beneath tyrion waited swinging stopped pushed open cage door hopped onto ice heavy figure black leaning winch second held cage gloved hand faces muffled woolen scarves eyes showed plump layers wool leather black black “and wanting time night” one winch asked

 “a last look”

 men exchanged sour glances “look want” one said “just care don’t fall little man old bear would hides” small wooden shack stood great crane tyrion saw dull glow brazier felt brief gust warmth winch men opened door went back inside alone

 bitingly cold wind pulled clothes like insistent lover top wall wider kingsroad often tyrion fear falling although footing slicker would liked brothers spread crushed stone across walkways weight countless footsteps would melt wall beneath ice would seem grow around gravel swallowing path bare time crush stone

 still nothing tyrion could manage looked east west wall stretching vast white road beginning end dark abyss either side west decided special reason began walk way following pathway nearest north edge gravel looked freshest

 bare cheeks ruddy cold legs complained loudly every step tyrion ignored wind swirled around gravel crunched beneath boots ahead white ribbon followed lines hills rising higher higher lost beyond western horizon passed massive catapult tall city wall base sunk deep wall throwing arm taken repairs forgotten lay like broken toy halfembedded ice

 far side catapult muffled voice called challenge “who goes halt”

 tyrion stopped “if halt long i’ll freeze place jon” said shaggy pale shape slid toward silently sniffed furs “hello ghost”

 jon snow moved closer looked bigger heavier layers fur leather hood cloak pulled face “lannister” said yanking loose scarf uncover mouth “this last place would expected see you” carried heavy spear tipped iron taller sword hung side leather sheath across chest gleaming black warhorn banded silver

 “this last place would expected seen” tyrion admitted “i captured whim touch ghost chew hand off”

 “not here” jon promised

 tyrion scratched white wolf behind ears red eyes watched impassively beast came high chest another year tyrion gloomy feeling he’d looking “what tonight” asked “besides freezing manhood off…”

 “i drawn night guard” jon said “again ser alliser kindly arranged watch commander take special interest seems think keep awake half night i’ll fall asleep morning drill far disappointed him”

 tyrion grinned “and ghost learned juggle yet”

 “no” said jon smiling “but grenn held halder morning pyp longer dropping sword quite often did”

 “pyp”

 “pypar real name small boy large ears saw working grenn asked help thorne never even shown proper way grip sword” turned look north “i mile wall guard walk me”

 “if walk slowly” tyrion said

 “the watch commander tells must walk keep blood freezing never said fast”

 walked ghost pacing along beside jon like white shadow “i leave morrow” tyrion said

 “i know” jon sounded strangely sad

 “i plan stop winterfell way south message would like deliver…”

 “tell robb i’m going command night’s watch keep safe might well take needlework girls mikken melt sword horseshoes”

 “your brother bigger me” tyrion said laugh “i decline deliver message might get killed”

 “rickon ask i’m coming home try explain i’ve gone tell things i’m away he’ll like that”

 people seemed asking great deal today tyrion lannister thought “you could put letter know”

 “rickon can’t read yet bran…” stopped suddenly “i don’t know message send bran help tyrion”

 “what help could give maester ease pain spells give back legs”

 “you gave help needed it” jon snow said

 “i gave nothing” tyrion said “words”

 “then give words bran too”

 “you’re asking lame man teach cripple dance” tyrion said “however sincere lesson result likely grotesque still know love brother lord snow give bran whatever small help power”

 “thank lord lannister” pulled glove offered bare hand “friend”

 tyrion found oddly touched “most kin bastards” said wry smile “but you’re first i’ve friend” pulled glove teeth clasped snow hand flesh flesh boy’s grip firm strong

 donned glove jon snow turned abruptly walked low icy northern parapet beyond wall fell away sharply beyond darkness wild tyrion followed side side stood upon edge world

 arya

 father fighting council arya could see face came table late often first course thick sweet soup made pumpkins already taken away ned stark strode small hall called set apart great hall king could feast thousand long room high vaulted ceiling bench space two hundred trestle tables

 “the talk yard shall tourney lord” jory said resumed seat “they say knights come realm joust feast honor appointment hand king”

 arya could see father happy “do also say last thing world would wished”

 sansa’s eyes grown wide plates “a tourney” breathed seated septa mordane jeyne poole far arya could get without drawing reproach father “will permitted go father”

 “you know feelings sansa seems must arrange robert’s games pretend honored sake mean must subject daughters folly”

 “oh please” sansa said “i want see”

 septa mordane spoke “princess myrcella lord younger lady sansa ladies court expected grand event like tourney honor would look queer family attend”

 father looked pained “i suppose well shall arrange place sansa” saw arya “for you”

 “i don’t care stupid tourney” arya said knew prince joffrey would hated prince joffrey

 sansa lifted head “it splendid event shan’t wanted”

 anger flashed across father’s face “enough sansa change mind weary unto death endless war two fighting sisters expect behave like sisters understood”

 sansa bit lip nodded arya lowered face stare sullenly plate could feel tears stinging eyes rubbed away angrily determined cry

 sound clatter knives forks “pray excuse me” father announced table “i find small appetite tonight” walked hall

 gone sansa exchanged excited whispers jeyne poole table jory laughed joke hullen started horseflesh “your warhorse may best one joust thing oh all” men heard desmond jacks hullen’s son harwin shouted together porther called wine

 arya loved nothing better sit father’s table listen talk loved listening men benches freeriders tough leather courtly knights bold young squires grizzled old menatarms used throw snowballs help steal pies kitchen wives gave scones invented names babies played monstersandmaidens hidethetreasure comeintomycastle children fat tom used call “arya underfoot” said always she’d liked lot better “arya horseface”

 winterfell world away everything changed first time supped men since arriving king’s landing arya hated hated sounds voices way laughed stories told they’d friends she’d felt safe around knew lie they’d let queen kill lady horrible enough hound found mycah jeyne poole told arya he’d cut many pieces they’d given back butcher bag first poor man thought pig they’d slaughtered one raised voice drawn blade anything harwin always talked bold alyn going knight jory captain guard even father

 “he friend” arya whispered plate low one could hear ribs sat untouched grown cold thin film grease congealing beneath plate arya looked felt ill pushed away table

 “pray think going young lady” septa mordane asked

 “i’m hungry” arya found effort remember courtesies “may excused please” recited stiffly

 “you may not” septa said “you scarcely touched food sit clean plate”

 “you clean it” anyone could stop arya bolted door men laughed septa mordane called loudly voice rising higher higher

 fat tom post guarding door tower hand blinked saw arya rushing toward heard septa’s shouts “here little one hold on” started say reaching arya slid legs running winding tower steps feet hammering stone fat tom huffed puffed behind

 bedchamber place arya liked king’s landing thing liked best door massive slab dark oak black iron bands slammed door dropped heavy crossbar nobody could get room septa mordane fat tom sansa jory hound nobody slammed

 bar arya finally felt safe enough cry

 went window seat sat sniffling hating fault everything bad happened sansa said jeyne

 fat tom knocking door “arya girl what’s wrong” called “you there”

 “no” shouted knocking stopped moment later heard going away fat tom always easy fool

 arya went chest foot bed knelt opened lid began pulling clothes hands grabbing handfuls silk satin velvet wool tossing floor bottom chest she’d hidden arya lifted almost tenderly drew slender blade sheath

 needle

 thought mycah eyes filled tears fault fault fault never asked play swords her…

 pounding door louder “arya stark open door hear me”

 arya spun around needle hand “you better come here” warned slashed air savagely

 “the hand hear this” septa mordane raged

 “i don’t care” arya screamed “go away”

 “you rue insolent behavior young lady promise that” arya listened door heard sound septa’s receding footsteps

 went back window needle hand looked courtyard could climb like bran thought would go window tower run away horrible place away sansa septa mordane prince joffrey steal food kitchens take needle good boots warm cloak could find nymeria wild woods trident together they’d return winterfell run jon wall found wishing jon maybe wouldn’t feel alone

 soft knock door behind turned arya away window dreams escape “arya” father’s voice called “open door need talk”

 arya crossed room lifted crossbar father alone seemed sad angry made arya feel even worse “may come in” arya nodded dropped eyes ashamed father closed door “whose sword that”

 “mine” arya almost forgotten needle hand

 “give me”

 reluctantly arya surrendered sword wondering would ever hold father turned light examining sides blade tested point thumb “a bravo’s blade” said “yet seems know maker’s mark mikken’s work”

 arya could lie lowered eyes

 lord eddard stark sighed “my nineyearold daughter armed forge know nothing hand king expected rule seven kingdoms yet seems cannot even rule household come sword arya get this”

 arya chewed lip said nothing would betray jon even father

 father said “i don’t suppose matters truly” looked gravely sword hands “this toy children least girl would septa mordane say knew playing swords”

 “i wasn’t playing” arya insisted “i hate septa mordane”

 “that’s enough” father’s voice curt hard “the septa duty though gods know made struggle poor woman mother charged impossible task making lady”

 “i don’t want lady” arya flared

 “i ought snap toy across knee put end nonsense”

 “needle wouldn’t break” arya said defiantly voice betrayed words

 “it name it” father sighed “ah arya wildness child ‘the wolf blood’ father used call lyanna touch brother brandon touch brought early grave” arya heard sadness voice often speak father brother sister died born “lyanna might carried sword lord father allowed remind sometimes even look like her”

 “lyanna beautiful” arya said startled everybody said thing ever said arya

 “she was” eddard stark agreed “beautiful willful dead time” lifted sword held “arya think this… needle hope skewer sister septa mordane know first thing sword fighting”

 could think lesson jon given “stick pointy end” blurted

 father snorted back laughter “that essence suppose”

 arya desperately wanted explain make see “i trying learn but…” eyes filled tears “i asked mycah practice me” grief came turned away shaking “i asked him” cried “it fault me…”

 suddenly father’s arms around held gently turned sobbed chest “no sweet one” murmured “grieve friend never blame kill butcher’s boy murder lies hound’s door cruel woman serves”

 “i hate them” arya confided redfaced sniffling “the hound queen king prince joffrey hate joffrey lied wasn’t way said hate sansa remember lied joffrey would like her”

 “we lie” father said “or truly think i’d believe nymeria ran off”

 arya blushed guiltily “jory promised tell”

 “jory kept word” father said smile “there things need told even blind man could see wolf would never left willingly”

 “we throw rocks” said miserably “i told run go free didn’t want anymore wolves play heard howling jory said woods full game she’d deer hunt kept following finally throw rocks hit twice whined looked felt ’shamed right wasn’t queen would killed her”

 “it right” father said “and even lie was… without honor” he’d put needle aside went arya embrace took blade walked window stood moment looking across courtyard turned back eyes thoughtful seated window seat needle across lap “arya sit need try explain things you”

 perched anxiously edge bed “you young burdened cares” told “but also stark winterfell know words”

 “winter coming” arya whispered

 “the hard cruel times” father said “we tasted trident child bran fell born long summer sweet one you’ve never known anything else winter truly coming remember sigil house arya”

 “the direwolf” said thinking nymeria hugged knees chest suddenly afraid

 “let tell something wolves child snows fall white winds blow lone wolf dies pack survives summer time squabbles winter must protect one another keep warm share strengths must hate arya hate would truly us harm septa mordane good woman sansa… sansa sister may different sun moon blood flows hearts need needs you… need gods help me”

 sounded tired made arya sad “i don’t hate sansa” told “not truly” half lie

 “i mean frighten neither lie come dark dangerous place child winterfell enemies mean us ill cannot fight war among willfulness running angry words disobedience… home summer games child winter soon upon us different matter time begin growing up”

 “i will” arya vowed never loved much instant “i strong strong robb”

 held needle hilt first “here”

 looked sword wonder eyes moment afraid touch afraid reached would snatched away father said “go it’s yours” took hand

 “i keep it” said “for true”

 “for true” smiled “if took away doubt i’d find morningstar hidden pillow within fortnight try stab sister whatever provocation”

 “i won’t promise” arya clutched needle tightly chest father took leave

 next morning broke fast apologized septa mordane asked pardon septa peered suspiciously father nodded

 three days later midday father’s steward vayon poole sent arya small hall trestle tables dismantled benches shoved walls hall seemed empty unfamiliar voice said “you late boy” slight man bald head great beak nose stepped shadows holding pair slender wooden swords “tomorrow midday” accent lilt free cities braavos perhaps myr

 “who you” arya asked

 “i dancing master” tossed one wooden blades grabbed missed heard clatter floor “tomorrow catch pick up”

 stick true wooden sword complete grip guard pommel arya picked clutched nervously hands holding front heavier looked much heavier needle

 bald man clicked teeth together “that way boy greatsword needing two hands swing take blade one hand”

 “it’s heavy” arya said

 “it heavy needs make strong balancing hollow inside filled lead one hand needing”

 arya took right hand grip wiped sweaty palm pants held sword left hand seemed approve “the left good reversed make enemies awkward standing wrong turn body sideface yes skinny shaft spear know good target smaller grip let see” moved closer peered hand prying fingers apart rearranging “just yes squeeze tight grip must deft delicate”

 “what drop it” arya said

 “the steel must part arm” bald man told “can drop part arm nine years syrio forel first sword sealord braavos knows things listen boy”

 third time called “boy” “i’m girl” arya objected

 “boy girl” syrio forel said “you sword all” clicked teeth together “just grip holding battleaxe holding a—”

 “—needle” arya finished fiercely

 “just begin dance remember child iron dance westeros learning knight’s dance hacking hammering bravo’s dance water dance swift sudden men made water know pierce water leaks die” took step backward raised wooden blade “now try strike me”

 arya tried strike tried four hours every muscle body sore aching syrio forel clicked teeth together told

 next day real work began





 daenerys

 “the dothraki sea” ser jorah mormont said reined halt beside top ridge beneath plain stretched immense empty vast flat expanse reached distant horizon beyond sea dany thought past hills mountains trees cities roads endless grasses tall blades rippling like waves winds blew “it’s green” said

 knight smiled ser jorah handsome man neck shoulders like bull coarse black hair covered arms chest thickly none left head yet smiles gave dany comfort “you learning talk like queen daenerys”

 “not queen” said dany “a khaleesi” wheeled horse galloped ridge alone

 descent steep rocky dany rode fearlessly joy danger song heart life viserys told princess rode silver daenerys targaryen ever felt like one

 first come easy khalasar broken camp morning wedding moving east toward vaes dothrak third day dany thought going die saddle sores opened bottom hideous bloody thighs chafed raw hands blistered reins muscles legs back wracked pain could scarcely sit time dusk fell handmaids would need help mount

 even nights brought relief khal drogo ignored rode even ignored wedding spent evenings drinking warriors bloodriders racing prize horses watching women dance men die dany place parts life left sup alone ser jorah brother afterward cry sleep yet every night time dawn drogo would come tent wake dark ride relentlessly rode stallion always took behind dothraki fashion dany grateful way lord husband could see tears wet face could use pillow muffle cries pain done would close eyes begin snore softly dany would lie beside body bruised sore hurting much sleep

 day followed day night followed night dany knew could endure moment longer would kill rather go decided one night…

 yet slept night dreamt dragon dream viserys time dragon scales black night wet slick blood blood dany sensed eyes pools molten magma opened mouth flame came roaring hot jet could hear singing opened arms fire embraced let swallow whole let cleanse temper scour clean could feel flesh sear blacken slough away could feel blood boil turn steam yet pain felt strong new fierce

 next day strangely seem hurt quite much gods heard taken pity even handmaids noticed change “khaleesi” jhiqui said “what wrong sick”

 “i was” answered standing dragon’s eggs illyrio given wed touched one largest three running hand lightly shelf blackandscarlet thought like dragon dream stone felt strangely warm beneath fingers… still dreaming pulled hand back nervously

 hour onward day easier one legs grew stronger blisters burst hands grew callused soft thighs toughened supple leather

 khal commanded handmaid irri teach dany ride dothraki fashion filly real teacher horse seemed know moods shared single mind every passing day dany felt surer seat dothraki hard unsentimental people custom name animals dany thought silver never loved anything much

 riding became less ordeal dany began notice beauties land around rode head khalasar drogo bloodriders came country fresh unspoiled behind great horde might tear earth muddy rivers send clouds choking dust fields ahead always green verdant

 crossed rolling hills norvos past terraced farms small villages townsfolk watched anxiously atop white stucco walls forded three wide placid rivers fourth swift narrow treacherous camped beside high blue waterfall skirted tumbled ruins vast dead city ghosts said moan among blackened marble columns raced valyrian roads thousand years old straight dothraki arrow half moon rode forest qohor leaves made golden canopy high trunks trees wide city gates great elk wood spotted tigers lemurs silver fur huge purple eyes fled approach khalasar dany got glimpse

 agony fading memory still ached long day’s riding yet somehow pain sweetness morning came willingly saddle eager know wonders waited lands ahead began find pleasure even nights still cried drogo took always pain

 bottom ridge grasses rose around tall supple dany slowed trot rode onto plain losing green blessedly alone khalasar never alone khal drogo came sun went handmaids fed bathed slept door tent drogo’s bloodriders men khas never far brother unwelcome shadow day night dany could hear top ridge voice shrill anger shouted ser jorah rode submerging deeper dothraki sea

 green swallowed air rich scents earth grass mixed smell horseflesh dany’s sweat oil hair dothraki smells seemed belong dany breathed laughing sudden urge feel ground beneath curl toes thick black soil swinging saddle let silver graze pulled high boots

 viserys came upon sudden summer storm horse rearing beneath reined hard “you dare” screamed “you give commands me” vaulted horse stumbling landed face flushed struggled back feet grabbed shook “have forgotten look look you”

 dany need look barefoot oiled hair wearing dothraki riding leathers painted vest given bride gift looked though belonged viserys soiled stained city silks ringmail

 dany shoved away hard

 viserys stared lilac eyes incredulous never defied never fought back rage twisted features would hurt badly knew

 crack

 whip made sound like thunder coil took viserys around throat yanked backward went sprawling grass stunned choking dothraki riders hooted struggled free one whip young jhogo rasped question dany understand words irri ser jorah rest khas “jhogo asks would dead khaleesi” irri said

 “no” dany replied “no”

 jhogo understood one others barked comment dothraki laughed irri told “quaro thinks take ear teach respect”

 brother knees fingers digging leather coils crying incoherently struggling breath whip tight around windpipe

 “tell wish harmed” dany said

 irri repeated words dothraki jhogo gave pull whip yanking viserys around like puppet string went sprawling freed leather embrace thin line blood chin whip cut deep

 “i warned would happen lady” ser jorah mormont said “i told stay ridge commanded”

 “i know did” dany replied watching viserys lay ground sucking air noisily redfaced sobbing pitiful thing always pitiful thing never seen hollow place inside fear

 “take horse” dany commanded ser jorah viserys gaped could believe hearing could dany quite believe saying yet words came “let brother walk behind us back khalasar” among dothraki man ride man lowest low without honor pride “let everyone see is”

 “no” viserys screamed turned ser jorah pleading common tongue words horsemen would understand “hit mormont hurt king commands kill dothraki dogs teach her”

 exile knight looked dany brother barefoot dirt toes oil hair silks steel dany could see decision face “he shall walk khaleesi” said took brother’s horse hand dany remounted silver

 viserys gaped sat dirt kept silence would move eyes full poison rode away soon lost tall grass could see anymore dany grew afraid “will find way back” asked ser jorah rode

 “even man blind brother able follow trail” replied

 “he proud may shamed come back”

 jorah laughed “where else go cannot find khalasar khalasar surely find hard drown dothraki sea child”

 dany saw truth khalasar like city march march blindly always scouts ranged far ahead main column alert sign game prey enemies outriders guarded flanks missed nothing land place come plains part them…

 “i hit him” said wonder voice seemed like strange dream dreamed “ser jorah think… he’ll angry gets back… shivered “i woke dragon didn’t i”

 ser jorah snorted “can wake dead girl brother rhaegar last dragon died trident viserys less shadow snake”

 blunt words startled seemed though things always believed suddenly called question “you… swore sword…”

 “that girl” ser jorah said “and brother shadow snake make servants” voice bitter

 “he still true king is…”

 jorah pulled horse looked “truth would want see viserys sit throne”

 dany thought “he would good king would he”

 “there worse… many” knight gave heels mount started

 dany rode close beside “still” said “the common people waiting magister illyrio says sewing dragon banners praying viserys return across narrow sea free them”

 “the common people pray rain healthy children summer never ends” ser jorah told “it matter high lords play game thrones long left peace” gave shrug “they never are”

 dany rode along quietly time working words like puzzle box went everything viserys ever told think people could care little whether true king usurper reigned yet thought jorah’s words rang truth

 “what pray ser jorah” asked

 “home” said voice thick longing

 “i pray home too” told believing

 ser jorah laughed “look around khaleesi”

 plains dany saw king’s landing great red keep aegon conqueror built dragonstone born mind’s eye burned thousand lights fire blazing every window mind’s eye doors red

 “my brother never take back seven kingdoms” dany said known long time realized known life never let say words even whisper said jorah mormont world hear

 “he could lead army even lord husband gave one” dany said “he coin knight follows reviles less snake dothraki make mock weakness never take us home”

 “wise child” knight smiled

 dany gave silver slaves grooming entered tent cool dim beneath silk let door flap close behind dany saw finger dusty red light reach touch dragon’s eggs across tent instant thousand droplets scarlet flame swam eyes blinked gone

 stone told stone even illyrio said dragons dead put palm black egg fingers spread gently across curve shell stone warm almost hot “the sun” dany whispered “the sun warmed rode”

 commanded handmaids prepare bath doreah built fire outside tent irri jhiqui fetched big copper tub—another bride gift—from packhorses carried water pool bath steaming irri helped climbed

 “have ever seen dragon” asked irri scrubbed back jhiqui sluiced sand hair heard first dragons come east shadow lands beyond asshai islands jade sea perhaps still living realms strange wild

 door opened bang bran’s heart leapt mouth sudden fear maester luwin hodor looming stairway behind “hodor” stableboy announced custom smiling hugely

 maester luwin smiling “we visitors” announced “and presence required bran”

 “i’m listening story now” bran complained

 “stories wait little lord come back are” old nan said “visitors patient ofttimes bring stories own”

 robb seated father’s high seat wearing ringmail boiled leather stern face robb lord theon greyjoy hallis mollen stood behind dozen guardsmen lined grey stone walls beneath tall narrow windows center room dwarf stood servants four strangers black night’s watch bran could sense anger hall moment hodor carried doors

 “any man night’s watch welcome winterfell long wishes stay” robb saying voice robb lord sword across knees steel bare world see even bran knew meant greet guest unsheathed sword

 “any man night’s watch” dwarf repeated “but take meaning boy”

 robb stood pointed little man sword “i lord mother father away lannister boy”

 “if lord might learn lord’s courtesy” little man replied ignoring sword point face “your bastard brother father’s graces would seem”

 “jon” bran gasped hodor’s arms

 dwarf turned look “so true boy lives could scarce believe starks hard kill”

 “you lannisters best remember that” robb said lowering sword “hodor bring brother here”

 “hodor” hodor said trotted forward smiling set bran high seat starks lords winterfell sat since days called kings north seat cold stone polished smooth countless bottoms carved heads direwolves snarled ends massive arms bran clasped sat useless legs dangling great seat made feel half baby

 robb put hand shoulder “you said business bran well lannister”

 “what sort horse saddle suggesting” maester luwin asked

 “a smart horse” lannister replied “the boy cannot use legs command animal must shape horse rider teach respond reins voice would begin unbroken yearling old training unlearned” drew rolled paper belt “give saddler provide rest”

 maester luwin took paper dwarfs hand curious small grey squirrel unrolled studied “i see draw nicely lord yes ought work thought myself”

 door yard flew open sunlight came streaming across hall rickon burst breathless direwolves boy stopped door wideeyed wolves came eyes found lannister perhaps caught scent summer began growl first grey wind picked padded toward little man one right one left

 “the wolves like smell lannister” theon greyioy commented

 “perhaps it’s time took leave” tyrion said took step backward… shaggydog came shadows behind snarling lannister recoiled summer lunged side reeled away unsteady feet grey wind snapped arm teeth ripping sleeve tearing loose scrap cloth

 “no” bran shouted high seat lannister’s men reached steel “summer summer me”

 direwolf heard voice glanced bran lannister crept backward away little man settled bran’s dangling feet

 robb holding breath let sigh called “grey wind” direwolf moved swift silent shaggydog rumbling small man eyes burning like green fire

 “rickon call him” bran shouted baby brother rickon remembered screamed “home shaggy home now” black wolf gave lannister one final snarl bounded rickon hugged tightly around neck

 tyrion lannister undid scarf mopped brow said flat voice “how interesting”

 “are well lord” asked one men sword hand glanced nervously direwolves spoke

 “my sleeve torn breeches unaccountably damp nothing harmed save dignity”

 even robb looked shaken “the wolves… don’t know that…”

 “no doubt mistook dinner” lannister bowed stiffly bran “i thank calling young ser promise would found quite indigestible leaving truly”

 “a moment lord” maester luwin said moved robb huddled close together whispering bran tried hear saying voices low

 robb stark finally sheathed sword “i… may hasty you” said “you’ve done bran kindness well…” robb composed effort “the hospitality winterfell wish lannister”

 eddard

 “lord arryn’s death great sadness us lord” grand maester pycelle said “i would happy tell manner passing seated would care refreshments dates perhaps fine persimmons well wine longer agrees digestion fear offer cup iced milk sweetened honey find refreshing heat”

 denying heat ned could feel silk tunic clinging chest thick moist air covered city like damp woolen blanket riverside grown unruly poor fled hot airless warrens jostle sleeping places near water breath wind found “that would kind” ned said seating

 pycelle lifted tiny silver bell thumb forefinger tinkled gently slender young serving girl hurried solar “iced milk king’s hand would kind child well sweetened”

 girl went fetch drinks grand maester knotted fingers together rested hands stomach “the smallfolk say last year summer always hottest yet ofttimes feels way days like envy northerners summer snows” heavy jeweled chain around old man’s neck chinked softly shifted seat “to sure king maekar’s summer hotter one near long fools even citadel took mean great summer come last summer never ends seventh year broke suddenly short autumn terrible long winter still heat fierce lasted oldtown steamed sweltered day came alive night would walk gardens river argue gods remember smells nights lord—perfume sweat melons ripe bursting peaches pomegranates nightshade moonbloom young man still forging chain heat exhaust now” pycelle’s eyes heavily lidded looked halfasleep “my pardons lord eddard come hear foolish meanderings summer forgotten father born forgive old man wanderings would minds like swords fear old ones go rust ah milk” serving girl placed tray pycelle gave smile “sweet child” lifted cup tasted nodded “thank may go”

 girl taken leave pycelle peered ned pale rheumy eyes “now oh yes asked lord arryn…”

 “i did” ned sipped politely iced milk pleasantly cold oversweet taste

 “if truth told hand seemed quite time” pycelle said “we sat together council many year signs read put great burdens borne faithfully long broad shoulders weighed cares realm besides son ever sickly lady wife anxious would scarcely let boy sight enough weary even strong man lord jon young small wonder seemed melancholy tired thought time yet less certain” gave ponderous shake head

 “what tell final illness”

 grand maester spread hands gesture helpless sorrow “he came one day asking certain book hale healthy ever though seem something troubling deeply next morning twisted pain sick rise bed maester colemon thought chill stomach weather hot hand often iced wine upset digestion lord jon continued weaken went gods grant power save him”

 “i heard sent maester colemon away”

 grand maester’s nod slow deliberate glacier “i fear lady lysa never forgive maybe wrong time thought best maester colemon like son yield none esteem abilities young young ofttimes comprehend frailty older body purging lord arryn wasting potions pepper juice feared might kill him”

 “did lord arryn say anything final hours”

 pycelle wrinkled brow “in last stage fever hand called name robert several times whether asking son king could say lady lysa would permit boy enter sickroom fear might taken ill king come sat beside bed hours talking joking times long past hopes raising lord jon’s spirits love fierce see”

 “was nothing else final words”

 “when saw hope fled gave hand milk poppy suffer closed eyes last time whispered something king lady wife blessing son seed strong said end speech slurred comprehend death come next morning lord jon peace never spoke again”

 ned took another swallow milk trying gag sweetness “did seem anything unnatural lord arryn’s death”

 “unnatural” aged maester’s voice thin whisper “no could say sad certainty yet way death natural thing lord eddard jon arryn rests easy burdens lifted last”

 “this illness took him” said ned “had ever seen like men”

 “near forty years grand maester seven kingdoms” pycelle replied “under good king robert aerys targaryen father jaehaerys second even short months jaehaerys’s father aegon fortunate fifth name seen illness care remember lord tell every case different every case alike lord jon’s death stranger other”

 “his wife thought otherwise”

 grand maester nodded “i recall widow sister noble wife old man may forgiven blunt speech let say grief derange even strongest disciplined minds lady lysa never since last stillbirth seen enemies every shadow death lord husband left shattered lost”

 “so quite certain jon arryn died sudden illness”

 “i am” pycelle replied gravely “if illness good lord else could be”

 “poison” ned suggested quietly

 pycelle’s sleepy eyes flicked open aged maester shifted uncomfortably seat “a disturbing thought free cities things common grand maester aethelmure wrote men carry murder hearts yet even poisoner beneath contempt” fell silent moment eyes lost thought “what suggest possible lord yet think likely every hedge maester knows common poisons lord arryn displayed none signs hand loved sort monster man’s flesh would dare murder noble lord”

 “i heard said poison woman’s weapon”

 pycelle stroked beard thoughtfully “it said women cravens… eunuchs” cleared throat spat thick glob phelm onto rushes raven cawed loudly rookery “the lord varys born slave lys know put trust spiders lord”

 scarcely anything ned needed told something varys made flesh crawl “i remember maester thank help taken enough time” stood

 grand maester pycelle pushed chair slowly escorted ned door “i hope helped small way put mind ease service might perform need ask”

 “one thing” ned told “i curious examine book lent jon day fell ill”

 “i fear would find little interest” pycelle said “it ponderous tome grand maester malleon lineages great houses”

 “still like see it”

 old man opened door “as wish somewhere find shall sent chambers straightaway”

 “you courteous” ned told almost afterthought said “one last question would kind mentioned king lord arryn’s bedside died wonder queen him”

 “why no” pycelle said “she children making journey casterly rock company father lord tywin brought retinue city tourney prince joffrey’s name day doubt hoping see son jaime win champion’s crown sadly disappointed fell send queen word lord arryn’s sudden death never sent bird heavier heart”

 “dark wings dark words” ned murmured proverb old nan taught boy

 “so fishwives say” grand maester pycelle agreed “but know always maester luwin’s bird brought word bran message lifted every true heart castle not”

 “as say maester”

 “the gods merciful” pycelle bowed head “come often like lord eddard serve”

 yes ned thought door swung shut

 way back chambers came upon daughter arya winding steps tower hand windmilling arms struggled balance one leg rough stone scuffed bare feet ned stopped looked “arya doing”

 “syrio says water dancer stand one toe hours” hands flailed air steady

 ned smile “which toe” teased

 “any toe” arya said exasperated question hopped right leg left swaying dangerously regained balance

 “must standing here” asked “it’s long hard fall steps”

 “syrio says water dancer never falls” lowered leg stand two feet “father bran come live us now”

 “not long time sweet one” told “he needs win strength back”

 arya bit lip “what bran he’s age”

 ned knelt beside “he years find answer arya enough know live” night bird come winterfell eddard stark taken girls castle godswood acre elm alder black cottonwood overlooking river heart tree great oak ancient limbs overgrown smokeberry vines knelt offer thanksgiving weirwood sansa drifted sleep moon rose arya several hours later curling grass ned’s cloak dark hours kept vigil alone dawn broke city dark red blooms dragon’s breath surrounded girls lay “i dreamed bran” sansa whispered “i saw smiling”

 “he going knight” arya saying “a knight kingsguard still knight”

 “no” ned said saw use lying “yet someday may lord great holdfast sit king’s council might raise castles like brandon builder sail ship across sunset sea enter mother’s faith become high septon” never run beside wolf thought sadness deep words lie woman hold son arms

 arya cocked head one side “can king’s councillor build castles become high septon”

 “you” ned said kissing lightly brow “will marry king rule castle sons knights princes lords yes perhaps even high septon”

 arya screwed face “no” said “that’s sansa” folded right leg resumed balancing ned sighed left

 inside chambers stripped sweatstained silks sluiced cold water head basin beside bed alyn entered drying face “my lord” said “lord baelish without begs audience”

 “escort solar” ned said reaching fresh tunic lightest linen could find “i’ll see once”

 littlefinger perched window seat ned entered watching knights kingsguard practice swords yard “if old selmy’s mind nimble blade” said wistfully “our council meetings would good deal livelier”

 “ser barristan valiant honorable man king’s landing” ned come deep respect aged whitehaired lord commander kingsguard

 “and tiresome” littlefinger added “though daresay well tourney last year unhorsed hound four years ago champion”

 question might win tourney interested eddard stark least “is reason visit lord petyr simply enjoy view window”

 littlefinger smiled “i promised cat would help inquiries have”

 took ned aback promise promise could find trust lord petyr baelish struck clever half “you something me”

 “someone” littlefinger corrected “four someones truth told thought question hand’s servants”

 ned frowned “would could lady arryn took household back eyrie” lysa done favor regard stood closest husband gone fled jon’s maester steward captain guard knights retainers

 “most household” littlefinger said “not remain pregnant kitchen girl hastily wed one lord renly’s grooms stablehand joined city watch potboy discharged service theft lord arryn’s squire”

 “his squire” ned pleasantly surprised man’s squire often knew great deal comings goings

 “ser hugh vale” littlefinger named “the king knighted boy lord arryn’s death”

 “i shall send him” ned said “and others”

 littlefinger winced “my lord step window would kind”

 “why”

 “come i’ll show lord”

 frowning ned crossed window petyr baelish made casual gesture “there across yard door armory see boy squatting steps honing sword oilstone”

 “what him”

 “he reports varys spider taken great interest doings” shifted window seat “now glance wall farther west stables guardsman leaning ramparts”

 ned saw man “another eunuch’s whisperers”

 “no one belongs queen notice enjoys fine view door tower better note calls others many unknown even red keep full eyes think hid cat brothel”

 eddard stark taste intrigues “seven hells” swore seem though man walls watching suddenly uncomfortable ned moved away window “is everyone someone’s informer cursed city”

 “scarcely” said littlefinger counted fingers hand “why there’s king… although come think king tells queen much much i’m less certain you” stood “is man service trust utterly completely”

 “yes” said ned

 “in case delightful palace valyria would dearly love sell you” littlefinger said mocking smile “the wiser answer lord may send paragon ser hugh others comings goings noted even varys spider cannot watch every man service every hour day” started door

 “lord petyr” ned called “i… grateful help perhaps wrong distrust you”

 littlefinger fingered small pointed beard “you slow learn lord eddard distrusting wisest thing you’ve done since climbed horse”

 jon snow winced halder born quarry apprenticed stonemason sixteen tall muscular blows hard jon ever felt “this uglier whore’s ass” pyp muttered

 fight lasted less minute fat boy ground whole body shaking blood leaked shattered helm pudgy fingers “i yield” shrilled “no yield don’t hit me” rast boys laughing

 even ser alliser would call end “on feet ser piggy” called “pick sword” boy continued cling ground thorne gestured halder “hit flat blade finds feet” halder delivered tentative smack foe’s upraised cheeks “you hit harder that” thorne taunted halder took hold longsword hands brought hard blow split leather even flat new boy screeched pain

 jon snow took step forward pyp laid mailed hand arm “jon no” small boy whispered anxious glance ser alliser thorne

 “on feet” thorne repeated fat boy struggled rise slipped fell heavily “ser piggy starting grasp notion” ser alliser observed “again”

 halder lifted sword another blow “cut us ham” rast urged laughing

 jon shook pyp’s hand “halder enough”

 halder looked ser alliser

 “the bastard speaks peasants tremble” masteratarms said sharp cold voice “i remind masteratarms lord snow”

 “look halder” jon urged ignoring thorne best could “there’s honor beating fallen foe yielded” knelt beside fat boy

 halder lowered sword “he yielded” echoed

 ser alliser’s onyx eyes fixed jon snow “it would seem bastard love” said jon helped fat boy feet “show steel lord snow”

 jon drew longsword dared defy ser alliser point feared well beyond

 thorne smiled “the bastard wishes defend lady love shall make exercise rat pimple help stone head here” rast albett moved join halder “three ought sufficient make lady piggy squeal need get past bastard”

 “stay behind me” jon said fat boy ser alliser often sent two foes never three knew would likely go sleep bruised bloody tonight braced assault

 suddenly pyp beside “three two make better sport” small boy said cheerfully dropped visor slid sword jon could even think protest grenn stepped make third

 yard grown deathly quiet jon could feel ser alliser’s eyes “why waiting” asked rast others voice gone deceptively soft jon moved first halder barely got sword time

 jon drove backward attacking every blow keeping older boy heels know foe ser rodrik taught jon knew halder brutally strong short patience taste defense frustrate would leave open certain sunset

 grenn standing ground jon taught giving albett cared pyp hardpressed rast two years forty pounds jon stepped behind rang raper’s helm like bell rast went reeling pyp slid guard knocked leveled blade throat jon moved facing two swords albett backed away “i yield” shouted

 ser alliser thorne surveyed scene disgust “the mummer’s farce gone long enough today” walked away session end

 dareon helped halder feet quarryman’s son wrenched helm threw across yard “for instant thought finally snow”

 “for instant did” jon replied mail leather shoulder throbbing sheathed sword tried remove helm raised arm pain made grit teeth

 “let me” voice said thickfingered hands unfastened helm gorget lifted gently “did hurt you”

 “i’ve bruised before” touched shoulder winced yard emptying around

 blood matted fat boy’s hair halder split helm asunder “my name samwell tarly horn…” stopped licked lips “i mean horn hill i… left i’ve come take black father lord randyll bannerman tyrells highgarden used heir only…” voice trailed

 “i’m jon snow ned stark’s bastard winterfell”

 samwell tarly nodded “i… want call sam mother calls sam”

 “you call lord snow” pyp said came join “you don’t want know mother calls him”

 “these two grenn pypar” jon said

 “grenn’s ugly one” pyp said

 grenn scowled “you’re uglier least don’t ears like bat”

 “my thanks you” fat boy said gravely

 “why didn’t get fight” grenn demanded

 “i wanted truly just… couldn’t didn’t want hit anymore” looked ground “i… fear i’m coward lord father always said so”

 grenn looked thunderstruck even pyp words say pyp words everything sort man would proclaim coward

 samwell tarly must read thoughts faces eyes met jon’s darted away quick frightened animals “i… i’m sorry” said “i don’t mean to… like am” walked heavily toward armory

 jon called “you hurt” said “tomorrow you’ll better”

 sam looked mournfully back one shoulder “no won’t” said blinking back tears “i never better”

 gone grenn frowned “nobody likes cravens” said uncomfortably “i wish hadn’t helped think we’re craven too”

 “you’re stupid craven” pyp told

 “i not” grenn said

 “yes bear attacked woods you’d stupid run away”

 “i would not” grenn insisted “i’d run away faster you” stopped suddenly scowling saw pyp’s grin realized he’d said thick neck flushed dark red jon left arguing returned armory hung sword stripped battered armor

 life castle black followed certain patterns mornings swordplay afternoons work black brothers set new recruits many different tasks learn skills lay jon cherished rare afternoons sent ghost ranging side bring back game lord commander’s table every day spent hunting gave dozen donal noye armory spinning whetstone onearmed smith sharpened axes grown dull use pumping bellows noye hammered new sword times ran messages stood guard mucked stables fletched arrows assisted maester aemon birds bowen marsh counts inventories

 afternoon watch commander sent winch cage four barrels freshcrushed stone scatter gravel icy footpaths atop wall lonely boring work even ghost along company jon found mind clear day could see half world top wall air always cold bracing could think found thinking samwell tarly… oddly tyrion lannister wondered tyrion would made fat boy men would rather deny hard truth face dwarf told grinning world full cravens pretended heroes took queer sort courage admit cowardice samwell tarly

 sore shoulder made work go slowly late afternoon jon finished graveling paths lingered high watch sun go turning western sky color blood finally dusk settling north jon rolled empty barrels back cage signaled winch men lower

 evening meal almost done time ghost reached common hall group black brothers dicing mulled wine near fire friends bench nearest west wall laughing pyp middle story mummer’s boy big ears born liar hundred different voices tell tales much live playing parts needed king one moment swineherd next turned alehouse girl virgin princess used high falsetto voice reduced tears helpless laughter eunuchs always eerily accurate caricatures ser alliser jon took much pleasure pyp’s antics anyone… yet night turned away went instead end bench samwell tarly sat alone far others could get

 finishing last pork pie cooks served supper jon sat across fat boy’s eyes widened sight ghost “is wolf”

 “a direwolf” jon said “his name ghost direwolf sigil father’s house”

 “ours striding huntsman” samwell tarly said

 “do like hunt”

 fat boy shuddered “i hate it” looked though going cry

 “what’s wrong now” jon asked “why always frightened”

 sam stared last pork pie gave feeble shake head scared even talk burst laughter filled hall jon heard pyp squeaking high voice stood “let’s go outside”

 round fat face looked suspicious “why outside”

 “talk” jon said “have seen wall”

 “i’m fat blind” samwell tarly said “of course saw it’s seven hundred feet high” yet stood wrapped furlined cloak shoulders followed jon common hall still wary suspected cruel trick waiting night ghost padded along beside “i never thought would like this” sam said walked words steaming cold air already huffing puffing tried keep “all buildings falling it’s so… so…”

 “cold” hard frost settling castle jon could hear soft crunch grey weeds beneath boots

 sam nodded miserably “i hate cold” said “last night woke dark fire gone certain going freeze death morning”

 “it must warmer come from”

 “i never saw snow last month crossing barrowlands men father sent see north white stuff began fall like soft rain first thought beautiful like feathers drifting sky kept frozen bone men crusts snow beards shoulders still kept coming afraid would never end”

 jon smiled

 wall loomed glimmering palely light half moon sky stars burned clear sharp “are going make go there” sam asked face curdled like old milk looked great wooden stairs “i’ll die climb that”

 “there’s winch” jon said pointing “they draw cage”

 samwell tarly sniffled “i don’t like high places”

 much jon frowned incredulous “are afraid everything” asked “i don’t understand truly craven would coward want join night’s watch”

 samwell tarly looked long moment round face seemed cave sat frostcovered ground began cry huge choking sobs made whole body shake jon snow could stand watch like snowfall barrowlands seemed tears would never end

 ghost knew silent shadow pale direwolf moved closer began lick warm tears samwell tarly’s face fat boy cried startled… somehow heartbeat sobs turned laughter

 jon snow laughed afterward sat frozen ground huddled cloaks ghost jon told story robb found pups newborn late summer snows seemed thousand years ago long found talking winterfell

 “sometimes dream it” said “i’m walking long empty hall voice echoes around one answers walk faster opening doors shouting names don’t even know i’m looking nights it’s father sometimes it’s robb instead little sister arya uncle” thought benjen stark saddened uncle still missing old bear sent rangers search ser jaremy rykker led two sweeps quorin halfhand gone forth shadow tower they’d found nothing aside blazes trees uncle left mark way stony highlands northwest marks stopped abruptly trace ben stark vanished

 “do ever find anyone dream” sam asked

 jon shook head “no one castle always empty” never told anyone dream understand telling sam yet somehow felt good talk “even ravens gone rookery stables full bones always scares start run throwing open doors climbing tower three steps time screaming someone anyone find front door crypts it’s black inside see steps spiraling somehow know go don’t want i’m afraid might waiting old kings winter sitting thrones stone wolves feet iron swords across laps it’s i’m afraid scream i’m stark isn’t place it’s good go anyway start feeling walls descend torch light way gets darker darker want scream” stopped frowning embarrassed “that’s always wake” skin cold clammy shivering darkness cell ghost would leap beside warmth comforting daybreak would go back sleep face pressed direwolf shaggy white fur “do dream horn hill” jon asked

 “no” sam’s mouth grew tight hard “i hated there” scratched ghost behind ear brooding jon let silence breathe long samwell tarly began talk jon snow listened quietly learned selfconfessed coward found wall

 tarlys family old honor bannermen mace tyrell lord highgarden warden south eldest son lord randyll tarly samwell born heir rich lands strong keep storied twohanded greatsword named heartsbane forged valyrian steel passed father son near five hundred years

 finally three girls many years lady tarly gave lord husband second son day lord randyll ignored sam devoting time younger boy fierce robust child liking samwell known several years sweet peace music books

 sam told tale calm dead voice something happened someone else strangely jon thought weep even done sat together listened wind time sound world

 finally jon said “we go back common hall”

 “why” sam asked

 jon shrugged “there’s hot cider drink mulled wine prefer nights dareon sings us mood singer before… well truly almost apprentice singer”

 “how come here” sam asked

 “lord rowan goldengrove found bed daughter girl two years older dareon swears helped window father’s eye named rape maester aemon heard sing said voice honey poured thunder” jon smiled “toad sometimes sings call singing drinking songs learned father’s winesink pyp says voice piss poured fart” laughed together

 “i like hear both” sam admitted “but would want there” face troubled “he’s going make fight morrow isn’t he”

 “he is” jon forced say

 sam got awkwardly feet “i better try sleep” huddled cloak plodded

 others still common room jon returned alone ghost “where been” pyp asked

 “talking sam” said

 “he truly craven” said grenn “at supper still places bench got pie scared come sit us”

 “the lord ham thinks he’s good eat likes us” suggested jeren

 “i saw eat pork pie” toad said smirking “do think brother” began make oinking noises

 “stop it” jon snapped angrily

 boys fell silent taken aback sudden fury “listen me” jon said quiet told going pyp backed he’d known would halder spoke pleasant surprise grenn anxious first jon knew words move one one rest fell line jon persuaded cajoled shamed others made threats threats required end agreed… rast

 “you girls please” rast said “but thorne sends lady piggy i’m going slice rasher bacon” laughed jon’s face left

 hours later castle slept three paid call cell grenn held arms pyp sat legs jon could hear rast’s rapid breathing ghost leapt onto chest direwolf’s eyes burned red embers teeth nipped lightly soft skin boy’s throat enough draw blood “remember know sleep” jon said softly

 next morning jon heard rast tell albett toad razor slipped shaved

 day forth neither rast others would hurt samwell tarly ser alliser matched would stand ground swat aside slow clumsy strokes masteratarms screamed attack would dance tap sam lightly breastplate helm leg ser alliser raged threatened called cravens women worse yet sam remained unhurt nights later jon’s urging joined evening meal taking place bench beside halder another fortnight found nerve join talk time laughing pyp’s faces teasing grenn best

 fat awkward frightened might samwell tarly fool one night visited jon cell “i don’t know did” said “but know it” looked away shyly “i’ve never friend before”

 “we’re friends” jon said put hand sam’s broad shoulder “we’re brothers”

 thought sam taken leave robb bran rickon father’s sons loved still yet jon knew never truly one catelyn stark seen grey walls winterfell might still haunt dreams castle black life brothers sam grenn halder pyp castouts wore black night’s watch

 “my uncle spoke truly” whispered ghost wondered would ever see benjen stark tell

 robert baratheon took long swallow beer tossed empty horn onto sleeping furs wiped mouth back hand said darkly “fat fat speak king” let go laughter sudden storm “ah damn ned always right”

 squires smiled nervously king turned “you yes heard hand king fat armor go find ser aron santagar tell need breastplate stretcher waiting for”

 “ah wish could see santagar’s face” robert said “i hope he’ll wit send someone else ought keep running day”

 “those boys” ned asked “lannisters”

 robert nodded wiping tears eyes “cousins sons lord tywin’s brother one dead ones perhaps live one come think don’t recall wife comes large family ned”

 ambitious family ned thought nothing squires troubled see robert surrounded queen’s kin waking sleeping lannister appetite offices honors seemed know bounds “the talk queen angry words last night”

 mirth curdled robert’s face “the woman tried forbid fight melee she’s sulking castle damn sister would never shamed like that”

 “you never knew lyanna robert” ned told “you saw beauty iron underneath would told business melee”

 “i sit damn iron seat must mean don’t hungers men bit wine girl squealing bed feel horse legs seven hells ned want hit someone”

 ser barristan selmy spoke “your grace” said “it seemly king ride melee would fair contest would dare strike you”

 robert seemed honestly taken aback “why damn last man left standing…”

 “…will you” ned finished saw selmy hit mark dangers melee savor robert touched pride “ser barristan right there’s man seven kingdoms would dare risk displeasure hurting you”

 king rose feet face flushed “are telling prancing cravens let win”

 “for certainty” ned said ser barristan selmy bowed head silent accord

 moment robert angry could speak strode across tent whirled strode back face dark angry snatched breastplate ground threw barristan selmy wordless fury selmy dodged “get out” king said coldly “get kill you”

 ser barristan left quickly ned follow king called “not ned”

 ned turned back robert took horn filled beer barrel corner thrust ned “drink” said brusquely

 “i’ve thirst—”

 “drink king commands it”

 ned took horn drank beer black thick strong stung eyes

 robert sat “damn ned stark jon arryn loved done one king jon”

 “robert…”

 “drink stay quiet king talking swear never alive winning throne dead i’ve cersei… jon arryn thank wish marry lyanna taken jon said realm needed heir cersei lannister would good match told would bind lord tywin viserys targaryen ever try win back father’s throne” king shook head “i loved old man swear think bigger fool moon boy oh cersei lovely look truly cold… way guards cunt you’d think gold casterly rock legs give beer won’t drink it” took horn upended belched wiped mouth “i sorry girl ned truly wolf mean son lying i’d stake soul son… love children don’t you”

 “he’s boy” ned said awkwardly small liking prince joffrey could hear pain robert’s voice “have forgotten wild age”

 “it would trouble boy wild ned don’t know do” sighed shook head “ah perhaps right jon despaired often enough yet grew good king” robert looked ned scowled silence “you might speak agree know”

 “your grace…” ned began carefully

 robert slapped ned back “ah say i’m better king aerys done never could lie love honor ned stark i’m still young you’re things different we’ll make reign sing damn lannisters seven hells smell bacon think champion today seen mace tyrell’s boy knight flowers call there’s son man would proud last tourney dumped kingslayer golden rump ought seen look cersei’s face laughed till sides hurt renly says sister maid fourteen lovely dawn…”

 musings ended soft rap door “a man see lord” harwin called “he give name”

 “send in” ned said wondering

 visitor stout man cracked mudcaked boots heavy brown robe coarsest roughspun features hidden cowl hands drawn voluminous sleeves

 “who you” ned asked

 “a friend” cowled man said strange low voice “we must speak alone lord stark”

 curiosity stronger caution “harwin leave us” commanded alone behind closed doors visitor draw back cowl

 “lord varys” ned said astonishment

 “lord stark” varys said politely seating “i wonder might trouble drink”

 ned filled two cups summerwine handed one varys “i might passed within foot never recognized you” said incredulous never seen eunuch dress anything silk velvet richest damasks man smelled sweat instead lilacs

 “that dearest hope” varys said “it would certain people learned spoken private queen watches closely wine choice thank you”

 “how get past guards” ned asked porther cayn posted outside tower alyn stairs

 “the red keep ways known ghosts spiders” varys smiled apologetically “i keep long lord things must know king’s hand king fool” eunuch’s cloying tones gone voice thin sharp whip “your friend know yet fool nonetheless… doomed unless save today near thing hoped kill melee”

 moment ned speechless shock “who”

 varys sipped wine “if truly need tell bigger fool robert wrong side”

 “the lannisters” ned said “the queen… believe even cersei asked fight”

 “she forbade fight front brother knights half court tell truly know surer way force king robert melee ask you”

 ned sick feeling gut eunuch hit upon truth tell robert baratheon could must thing good done “even he’d fought would dared strike king”

 varys shrugged “there forty riders melee lannisters many friends amidst chaos horses screaming bones breaking thoros myr waving absurd firesword could name murder chance blow felled grace” went flagon refilled cup “after deed done slayer would beside grief almost hear weeping sad yet doubt gracious compassionate widow would take pity lift poor unfortunate feet bless gentle kiss forgiveness good king joffrey would choice pardon him” eunuch stroked cheek “or perhaps cersei would let ser ilyn strike head less risk lannisters way though quite unpleasant surprise little friend”

 ned felt anger rise “you knew plot yet nothing”

 “i command whisperers warriors”

 “you might come earlier”

 “oh yes confess would rushed straight king yes robert heard peril would done wonder”

 ned considered “he would damned fought anyway show fear them”

 varys spread hands “i make another confession lord eddard curious see would come ask must answer trust lord”

 “you trust me” ned frankly astonished

 “the red keep shelters two sorts people lord eddard” varys said “those loyal realm loyal morning could say might be… waited see… know certainty” smiled plump tight little smile moment private face public mask one “i begin comprehend queen fears much oh yes do”

 “—wife” varys finished smile cut “his brothers hate lannisters true enough hating queen loving king quite thing ser barristan loves honor grand maester pycelle loves office littlefinger loves littlefinger”

 “the kingsguard—”

 “a paper shield” eunuch said “try look shocked lord stark jaime lannister sworn brother white swords know oath worth days men like ryam redwyne prince aemon dragonknight wore white cloak gone dust song seven ser barristan selmy made true steel selmy old ser boros ser meryn queen’s creatures bone deep suspicions others lord swords come earnest true friend robert baratheon have”

 “robert must told” ned said “if say true even part true king must hear himself”

 “and proof shall lay words little birds queen kingslayer brothers council wardens east west might casterly rock pray send ser ilyn directly save us time know road ends”

 “yet say true bide time make another attempt”

 “indeed will” said varys “and sooner rather later fear making anxious lord eddard little birds listening together may able forestall i” rose pulled cowl face hidden “thank wine speak see next council certain treat accustomed contempt find difficult”

 door ned called “varys” eunuch turned back “how jon arryn die”

 “i wondered would get around that”

 “tell me”

 “the tears lys call rare costly thing clear sweet water leaves trace begged lord arryn use taster room begged would hear one less man would even think thing told me”

 ned know rest “who gave poison”

 “some dear sweet friend often shared meat mead doubt oh one many lord arryn kindly trusting man” eunuch sighed “there one boy owed jon arryn widow fled eyrie household stayed king’s landing prospered always gladdens heart see young rise world” whip voice every word stroke “he must cut gallant figure tourney bright new armor crescent moons cloak pity died untimely could talk him…”

 ned felt halfpoisoned “the squire” said “ser hugh” wheels within wheels within wheels ned’s head pounding “why jon arryn hand fourteen years kill him”

 “asking questions” varys said slipping door





 tyrion

 “none us go hungry tonight” bronn said near shadow bone thin bone hard black eyes black hair stubble beard

 “some us may” tyrion told “i fond eating horse particularly horse”

 “meat meat” bronn said shrug “the dothraki like horse beef pork”

 “do take dothraki” tyrion asked sourly dothraki ate horse truth also left deformed children feral dogs ran behind khalasars dothraki customs scant appeal

 chiggen sliced thin strip bloody meat carcass held inspection “want taste dwarf”

 “my brother jaime gave mare twentythird name day” tyrion said flat voice

 “thank us ever see again” chiggen grinned showing yellow teeth swallowed raw meat two bites “tastes well bred”

 “better fry onions” bronn put

 wordlessly tyrion limped away cold settled deep bones legs sore could scarcely walk perhaps dead mare lucky one hours riding ahead followed mouthfuls food short cold sleep hard ground another night another another gods knew would end “damn her” muttered struggled road rejoin captors remembering “damn starks”

 memory still bitter one moment he’d ordering supper eye blink later facing room armed men jyck reaching sword fat innkeep shrieking “no swords please m’lords”

 tyrion wrenched jyck’s arm hurriedly got hacked pieces “where courtesies jyck good hostess said swords asks” forced smile must looked queasy felt “you’re making sad mistake lady stark part attack son honor—”

 “lannister honor” said held hands room see “his dagger left scars blade sent open son’s throat”

 tyrion felt anger around thick smoky fed deep cuts stark woman’s hands “kill him” hissed drunken slattern back voices took call faster would believed strangers friendly enough moment ago yet cried blood like hounds trail

 tyrion spoke loudly trying keep quaver voice “if lady stark believes crime answer go answer it”

 possible course trying cut way sure invitation early grave good dozen swords responded stark woman’s plea help harrenhal man three brackens pair unsavory sellswords looked though they’d kill soon spit fool field hands doubtless idea tyrion dagger belt two men jyck swung fair enough sword morrec scarcely counted part groom part cook part body servant soldier yoren whatever feelings might black brothers sworn take part quarrels realm yoren would nothing

 “nor i” said “i tell part attempt kill son”

 “the assassin armed dagger”

 tyrion felt heat rise “it dagger” insisted “how many times must swear lady stark whatever may believe stupid man fool would arm common footpad blade”

 tyrion cocked head “why every man court heard tell took maidenhead lady”

 kurleket grabbed handful hair yanked head back hard jerk baring throat tyrion felt cold kiss steel beneath chin “shall bleed lady”

 “kill truth dies me” tyrion gasped

 kurleket let go tyrion’s hair reluctantly

 tyrion took deep breath “how littlefinger tell came dagger answer that”

 “you wager tourney prince joffrey’s name day”

 red keep full cats lazy old cats dozing sun coldeyed mousers twitching tails quick little kittens claws like needles ladies’ cats combed trusting ragged shadows prowling midden heaps one one arya chased snatched brought proudly syrio forel… one oneeared black devil tomcat “that’s real king castle right there” one gold cloaks told “older sin twice mean one time king feasting queen’s father black bastard hopped table snatched roast quail right lord tywin’s fingers robert laughed hard like burst stay away one child”

 run halfway across castle twice around tower hand across inner bailey stables serpentine steps past small kitchen pig yard barracks gold cloaks along base river wall steps back forth traitor’s walk gate around well strange buildings arya didn’t know

 last high walls pressed close either side ahead blank windowless mass stone quiet shadow repeated sliding forward light feather

 three steps away tomcat bolted left right went right left went arya cutting escape hissed tried dart legs quick snake thought hands closed around hugged chest whirling laughing aloud claws raked front leather jerkin ever fast kissed right eyes jerked head back instant claws would found face tomcat yowled spit

 “what’s cat”

 “what cat boy” myrcella asked sternly brother said “he’s ragged boy isn’t look him” giggled

 “a ragged dirty smelly boy” tommen agreed

 don’t know arya realized don’t even know i’m girl small wonder barefoot dirty hair tangled long run castle clad jerkin ripped cat claws brown roughspun pants hacked scabby knees don’t wear skirts silks you’re catching cats quickly lowered head dropped one knee maybe wouldn’t recognize would never hear end septa mordane would mortified sansa would never speak shame

 old fat septa moved forward “boy come business part castle”

 “you can’t keep sort out” one red cloaks said “like trying keep rats”

 “who belong boy” septa demanded “answer what’s wrong mute”

 arya’s voice caught throat answered tommen myrcella would know certain

 “godwyn bring here” septa said taller guardsmen started alley

 panic gripped throat like giant’s hand arya could spoken life hung calm still water mouthed silently

 godwyn reached arya moved quick snake leaned left letting fingers brush arm spinning around smooth summer silk time got turned sprinting alley swift deer septa screeching arya slid legs thick white marble columns bounded feet bowled prince tommen hopped sat hard said “oof” spun away second guard past running full

 heard shouts pounding footsteps closing behind dropped rolled red cloak went careening past stumbling arya sprang back feet saw window high narrow scarcely arrow slit arya leapt caught sill pulled held breath wriggled slippery eel dropping floor front startled scrubwoman hopped brushed rushes clothes door along long hall stair across hidden courtyard around corner wall low narrow window pitchdark cellar sounds grew distant behind

 arya breath quite thoroughly lost recognized didn’t think she’d moved fast swift deer

 hunkered dark damp stone wall listened pursuit sound beating heart distant drip water quiet shadow told wondered first come king’s landing used bad dreams getting lost castle father said red keep smaller winterfell dreams immense endless stone maze walls seemed shift change behind would find wandering gloomy halls past faded tapestries descending endless circular stairs darting courtyards bridges shouts echoing unanswered rooms red stone walls would seem drip blood nowhere could find window sometimes would hear father’s voice always long way matter hard ran would grow fainter fainter faded nothing arya alone dark

 monsters still fear gone

 arya got feet moving warily heads around touched one curious wondering real fingertips brushed massive jaw felt real enough bone smooth beneath hand cold hard touch ran fingers tooth black sharp dagger made darkness made shiver

 “it’s dead” said aloud “it’s skull can’t hurt me” yet somehow monster seemed know could feel empty eyes watching gloom something dim cavernous room love edged away skull backed second larger first instant could feel teeth digging shoulder wanted bite flesh arya whirled felt leather catch tear huge fang nipped jerkin running another skull loomed ahead biggest monster arya even slow leapt ridge black teeth tall swords dashed hungry jaws threw door

 fingers brushed rough unfinished stone left followed wall hand skimming along surface taking small gliding steps darkness halls lead somewhere way way fear cuts deeper swords arya would afraid seemed walking long ways wall ended abruptly draft cold air blew past cheek loose hairs stirred faintly skin

 somewhere far heard noises scrape boots distant sound voices flickering light brushed wall ever faintly saw stood top great black well shaft twenty feet across plunging deep earth huge stones set curving walls steps circling dark steps hell old nan used tell something coming darkness bowels earth…

 arya peered edge felt cold black breath face far saw light single torch small flame candle two men made shadows writhed sides well tall giants could hear voices echoing shaft

 “…found one bastard” one said “the rest come soon day two days fortnight…”

 “and learns truth do” second voice asked liquid accents free cities

 “the gods alone know” first voice said arya could see wisp grey smoke drifting torch writhing like snake rose “the fools tried kill son what’s worse made mummer’s farce he’s man put aside warn wolf lion soon other’s throats whether no”

 “too soon soon” voice accent complained “what good war ready delay”

 “as well bid stop time take wizard”

 chuckled “no less” flames licked cold air tall shadows almost top instant later man holding torch climbed sight companion beside arya crept back away well dropped stomach flattened wall held breath men reached top steps

 “what would do” asked torchbearer stout man leather half cape even heavy boots feet seemed glide soundlessly ground round scarred face stubble dark beard showed steel cap wore mail boiled leather dirk shortsword belt seemed arya something oddly familiar

 “if one hand die second” replied man accent forked yellow beard “you danced dance friend” one arya ever seen certain grossly fat yet seemed walk lightly carrying weight balls feet water dancer might rings glimmered torchlight redgold pale silver crusted rubies sapphires slitted yellow tiger eyes every finger wore ring two

 “before hand other” scarred man said stepped hall still stone arya told quiet shadow blinded blaze torch see pressed flat stone feet away

 “perhaps so” forked beard replied pausing catch breath long climb “nonetheless must time princess child khal bestir son born know savages”

 man torch pushed something arya heard deep rumbling huge slab rock red torchlight slid ceiling resounding crash almost made cry entry well nothing stone solid unbroken

 “if bestir soon may late” stout man steel cap said “this longer game two players ever stannis baratheon lysa arryn fled beyond reach whispers say gathering swords around knight flowers writes highgarden urging lord father send sister court girl maid fourteen sweet beautiful tractable lord renly ser loras intend robert bed wed make new queen littlefinger… gods know game littlefinger playing yet lord stark’s one troubles sleep bastard book soon enough he’ll truth wife abducted tyrion lannister thanks littlefinger’s meddling lord tywin take outrage jaime queer affection imp lannisters move north bring tullys well delay say make haste reply even finest jugglers cannot keep hundred balls air forever”

 “you juggler old friend true sorcerer ask work magic awhile longer” started hall direction arya come past room monsters

 “what will” one torch said softly “i must gold another fifty birds”

 let get long way ahead went creeping quiet shadow

 “so many” voices fainter light dwindled ahead “the ones need hard find… young know letters… perhaps older… die easy…”

 “no younger safer… treat gently…”

 “…if kept tongues…”

 “…the risk…”

 long voices faded away arya could still see light torch smoking star bid follow twice seemed disappear kept straight times found top steep narrow stairs torch glimmering far hurried stumbled rock fell wall hand found raw earth supported timbers whereas tunnel dressed stone

 guards exchanged glance “i want fuck queen good me” younger one said

 older scowled “who’s father boy city ratcatcher”

 “the hand king” arya told

 men laughed older one swung fist casually man would swat dog arya saw blow coming even began danced back way untouched “i’m boy” spat “i’m arya stark winterfell lay hand lord father heads spikes don’t believe fetch jory cassel vayon poole tower hand” put hands hips “now going open gate need clout ear help hearing”

 father alone solar harwin fat tom marched oil lamp glowing softly elbow bent biggest book arya ever seen great thick tome cracked yellow pages crabbed script bound faded leather covers closed listen harwin’s report face stern sent men away thanks

 “you realize half guard searching you” eddard stark said alone “septa mordane beside fear she’s sept praying safe return arya know never go beyond castle gates without leave”

 “i didn’t go gates” blurted “well didn’t mean dungeons turned tunnel dark didn’t torch candle see follow couldn’t go back way came account monsters father talking killing monsters two men didn’t see still stone quiet shadow heard said book bastard one hand could die second book jon’s bastard bet”

 “jon arya talking said this”

 “they did” told “there fat one rings forked yellow beard another mail steel cap fat one said delay one told couldn’t keep juggling wolf lion going eat mummer’s farce” tried remember rest hadn’t quite understood everything she’d heard mixed head “the fat one said princess child one steel cap torch said hurry think wizard”

 “a wizard” said ned unsmiling “did long white beard tall pointed hat speckled stars”

 “no wasn’t like old nan’s stories didn’t look like wizard fat one said was”

 “i warn arya you’re spinning thread air—”

 “no told dungeons place secret wall chasing cats well…” screwed face admitted knocking prince tommen would really angry “…well went window that’s found monsters”

 “monsters wizards” father said “it would seem you’ve quite adventure men heard say spoke juggling mummery”

 “yes” arya admitted “only—”

 “arya mummers” father told “there must dozen troupes king’s landing right come make coin tourney crowds i’m certain two castle perhaps king asked show”

 “no” shook head stubbornly “they weren’t—”

 “you shouldn’t following people spying case cherish notion daughter climbing strange windows stray cats look sweetling arms covered scratches gone long enough tell syrio forel want word hirn—”

 interrupted short sudden knock “lord eddard pardons” desmond called opening door crack “but there’s black brother begging audience says matter urgent thought would want know”

 “my door always open night’s watch” father said

 desmond ushered man inside stooped ugly unkempt beard unwashed clothes yet father greeted pleasantly asked name

 “yoren please m’lord pardons hour” bowed arya “and must son look”

 “i’m girl” arya said exasperated old man wall must come way winterfell “do know brothers” asked excitedly “robb bran winterfell jon’s wall jon snow he’s night’s watch must know direwolf white one red eyes jon ranger yet i’m arya stark” old man smelly black clothes looking oddly arya could seem stop talking “when ride back wall would bring jon letter wrote one” wished jon right he’d believe dungeons fat man forked beard wizard steel cap

 “my daughter often forgets courtesies” eddard stark said faint smile softened words “i beg forgiveness yoren brother benjen send you”

 “no one sent m’lord saving old mormont i’m find men wall robert next holds court i’ll bend knee cry need see king hand scum dungeons they’d well rid might say benjen stark we’re talking though blood ran black made brother much it’s sake i’m come rode hard near killed horse way drove left others well behind”

 “the others”

 yoren spat “sellswords freeriders like trash inn full o’ saw take scent scent blood scent gold smell end o’ made king’s landing either went galloping casterly rock rock lies closer lord tywin gotten word count it”

 father frowned “what word this”

 yoren eyed arya “one best spoken private m’lord begging pardons”

 “as say desmond see daughter chambers” kissed brow “we’ll finish talk morrow”

 arya stood rooted spot “nothing bad’s happened jon it” asked yoren “or uncle benjen”

 “well stark can’t say snow boy well enough left wall it’s concerns me”

 desmond took hand “come along milady heard lord father”

 arya choice go wishing fat tom tom might able linger door excuse hear yoren saying desmond singleminded trick “how many guards father have” asked descended bedchamber

 “here king’s landing fifty”

 “you wouldn’t let anyone kill would you” asked

 desmond laughed “no fear count little lady lord eddard’s guarded night day he’ll come harm”

 “the lannisters fifty men” arya pointed

 “so every northerner worth ten southron swords sleep easy”

 “what wizard sent kill him”

 “well that” desmond replied drawing longsword “wizards die men cut heads off”





 eddard

 “robert beg you” ned pleaded “hear saying talking murdering child”

 “the whore pregnant” king’s fist slammed council table loud thunderclap “i warned would happen ned back barrowlands warned care hear well you’ll hear want dead mother child fool viserys well plain enough want dead”

 councillors best pretend somewhere else doubt wiser eddard stark seldom felt quite alone “you dishonor forever this”

 “then let head long done blind cannot see shadow axe hanging neck”

 “there axe” ned told king “only shadow shadow twenty years removed… exists all”

 “if” varys asked softly wringing powdered hands together “my lord wrong would bring ties king council”

 ned looked eunuch coldly “you would bring us whisperings traitor half world away lord perhaps mormont wrong perhaps lying”

 “ser jorah would dare deceive me” varys said sly smile “rely lord princess child”

 “so say wrong need fear girl miscarries need fear births daughter place son need fear babe dies infancy need fear”

 “but boy” robert insisted “if lives”

 “the narrow sea would still lie us shall fear dothraki day teach horses run water”

 king took swallow wine glowered ned across council table “so would counsel nothing dragonspawn landed army shores it”

 “this ‘dragonspawn’ mother’s belly” ned said “even aegon conquering weaned”

 “gods stubborn aurochs stark” king looked around council table “have rest mislaid tongues one talk sense frozenfaced fool”

 varys gave king unctuous smile laid soft hand ned’s sleeve “i understand qualms lord eddard truly gave joy bring grievous news council terrible thing contemplate vile thing yet presume rule must vile things good realm howevermuch pains us”

 lord renly shrugged “the matter seems simple enough ought viserys sister killed years ago grace brother made mistake listening jon arryn”

 “mercy never mistake lord renly” ned replied “on trident ser barristan cut dozen good men robert’s friends mine brought us grievously wounded near death roose bolton urged us cut throat brother said ‘i kill man loyalty fighting well’ sent maester tend ser barristan’s wounds” gave king long cool look “would man today”

 robert shame enough blush “it same” complained “ser barristan knight kingsguard”

 “whereas daenerys fourteenyearold girl” ned knew pushing well past point wisdom yet could keep silent “robert ask rise aerys targaryen put end murder children”

 “to put end targaryens” king growled

 “your grace never knew fear rhaegar” ned fought keep scorn voice failed “have years unmanned tremble shadow unborn child”

 robert purpled “no ned” warned pointing “not another word forgotten king here”

 “no grace” ned replied “have you”

 “enough” king bellowed “i sick talk i’ll done damned say all”

 “she must killed” lord renly declared

 “we choice” murmured varys “sadly sadly…”

 ser barristan selmy raised pale blue eyes table said “your grace honor facing enemy battlefield none killing mother’s womb forgive must stand lord eddard”

 grand maester pycelle cleared throat process seemed take minutes “my order serves realm ruler counseled king aerys loyally counsel king robert bear girl child ill yet ask this—should war come many soldiers die many towns burn many children ripped mothers perish end spear” stroked luxuriant white beard infinitely sad infinitely weary “is wiser even kinder daenerys targaryen die tens thousands might live”

 “kinder” varys said “oh well truly spoken grand maester true gods caprice grant daenerys targaryen son realm must bleed”

 littlefinger last ned looked lord petyr stifled yawn “when find bed ugly woman best thing close eyes get it” declared “waiting won’t make maid prettier kiss done it”

 “kiss her” ser barristan repeated aghast

 “a steel kiss” said littlefinger

 robert turned face hand “well ned selmy stand alone matter question remains find kill her”

 “mormont craves royal pardon” lord renly reminded

 “desperately” varys said “yet craves life even princess nears vaes dothrak death draw blade told dothraki would poor man used one khaleesi none would sleep tonight” stroked powdered cheek “now poison… tears lys let us say khal drogo need never know natural death”

 grand maester pycelle’s sleepy eyes flicked open squinted suspiciously eunuch

 “poison coward’s weapon” king complained

 ned heard enough “you send hired knives kill fourteenyearold girl still quibble honor” pushed back chair stood “do robert man passes sentence swing sword look eyes kill see tears hear last words owe much least”

 “gods” king swore word exploding could barely contain fury “you mean damn you” reached flagon wine elbow found empty flung away shatter wall “i wine patience enough done”

 “i part murder robert ask fix seal it”

 moment robert seem understand ned saying defiance dish tasted often slowly face changed comprehension came eyes narrowed flush crept neck past velvet collar pointed angry finger ned “you king’s hand lord stark command i’ll find hand will”

 “i wish every success” ned unfastened heavy clasp clutched folds cloak ornate silver hand badge office laid table front king saddened memory man pinned friend loved “i thought better man robert thought made nobler king”

 robert’s face purple “out” croaked choking rage “out damn i’m done waiting go run back winterfell make certain never look face swear i’ll head spike”

 ned bowed turned heel without another word could feel robert’s eyes back strode council chambers discussion resumed scarcely pause “on braavos society called faceless men” grand maester pycelle offered

 “do idea costly are” littlefinger complained “you could hire army common sellswords half price that’s merchant don’t dare think might ask princess”

 closing door behind silenced voices ser boros blount stationed outside chamber wearing long white cloak armor kingsguard gave ned quick curious glance corner eye asked questions

 day felt heavy oppressive crossed bailey back tower hand could feel threat rain air ned would welcomed might made feel trifle less unclean reached solar summoned vayon poole steward came “you sent lord hand”

 “hand longer” ned told “the king quarreled shall returning winterfell”

 “i shall begin making arrangements lord need fortnight ready everything journey”

 “we may fortnight may day king mentioned something seeing head spike” ned frowned truly believe king would harm robert angry ned safely sight rage would cool always

 always suddenly uncomfortably found recalling rhaegar targaryen fifteen years dead yet robert hates much ever disturbing notion… matter business catelyn dwarf yoren warned last night would come light soon sure sunrise king black fury… robert might care fig tyrion lannister would touch pride telling queen might

 “it might safest went ahead” told poole “i take daughters guardsmen rest follow ready inform jory tell one else nothing girls gone castle full eyes ears would rather plans known”

 “as command lord”

 gone eddard stark went window sat brooding robert left choice could see ought thank would good return winterfell ought never left sons waiting perhaps catelyn would make new son together returned old yet late often found dreaming snow deep quiet wolfswood night

 yet thought leaving angered well much still undone robert council cravens flatterers would beggar realm left unchecked… worse sell lannisters payment loans truth jon arryn’s death still eluded oh found pieces enough convince jon indeed murdered spoor animal forest floor sighted beast yet though sensed lurking hidden treacherous

 struck suddenly might return winterfell sea ned sailor ordinarily would preferred kingsroad took ship could stop dragonstone speak stannis baratheon pycelle sent raven across water polite letter ned requesting lord stannis return seat small council yet reply silence deepened suspicions lord stannis shared secret jon arryn died certain truth sought might well waiting ancient island fortress house targaryen

 could robert part would thought would thought robert could command murder women children either catelyn tried warn knew man said king stranger sooner quit king’s landing better ship sailing north morrow would well

 summoned vayon poole sent docks make inquiries quietly quickly “find fast ship skilled captain” told steward “i care nothing size cabins quality appointments long swift safe wish leave once”

 poole sooner taken leave tomard announced visitor “lord baelish see m’lord”

 ned halftempted turn away thought better free yet must play games “show tom”

 lord petyr sauntered solar nothing gone amiss morning wore slashed velvet doublet creamandsilver grey silk cloak trimmed black fox customary mocking smile

 ned greeted coldly “might ask reason visit lord baelish”

 “i won’t detain long i’m way dine lady tanda lamprey pie roast suckling pig thought wed younger daughter table always astonishing truth told i’d sooner marry pig don’t tell love lamprey pie”

 “don’t let keep eels lord” ned said icy disdain “at moment cannot think anyone whose company desire less yours”

 “oh i’m certain put mind could come names varys say cersei robert grace wroth went length took leave us morning words insolence ingratitude came frequently seem recall”

 ned honor reply offer guest seat littlefinger took one anyway “after stormed left convince hire faceless men” continued blithely “instead varys quietly let known we’ll make lord whoever targaryen girl”

 ned disgusted “so grant titles assassins”

 littlefinger shrugged “titles cheap faceless men expensive truth told targaryen girl good talk honor let sellsword drunk visions lordship try kill likely he’ll make botch afterward dothraki guard we’d sent faceless man she’d good buried”

 ned frowned “you sit council talk ugly women steel kisses expect believe tried protect girl big fool take for”

 “well quite enormous one actually” said littlefinger laughing

 “do always find murder amusing lord baelish”

 “it’s murder find amusing lord stark it’s rule like man dancing rotten ice daresay make noble splash believe heard first crack morning”

 “the first last” said ned “i’ve fill”

 “when mean return winterfell lord”

 “as soon concern yours”

 “none… perchance you’re still come evenfall i’d pleased take brothel man jory searching ineffectually” littlefinger smiled “and won’t even tell lady catelyn”





 catelyn

 “my lady sent word coming” ser donnel waynwood told horses climbed pass “we would sent escort high road safe party small yours”

 “we learned sorrow ser donnel” catelyn said sometimes felt though heart turned stone six brave men died bring far could even find weep even names fading “the clansmen harried us day night lost three men first attack two second lannister’s serving man died fever wounds festered heard men approaching thought us doomed certain” drawn last desperate fight blades hand backs rock dwarf whetting edge axe making mordant jest bronn spotted banner riders carried moonandfalcon house arryn skyblue white catelyn never seen welcome sight

 “the clans grown bolder since lord jon died” ser donnel said stocky youth twenty years earnest homely wide nose shock thick brown hair “if would take hundred men mountains root fastnesses teach sharp lessons sister forbidden would even permit knights fight hand’s tourney wants swords kept close home defend vale… one certain shadows say” looked anxiously suddenly remembered “i hope spoken turn lady meant offense”

 “frank talk offend ser donnel” catelyn knew sister feared shadows lannisters thought glancing back dwarf rode beside bronn two grown thick thieves since chiggen died little man cunning liked entered mountains captive bound helpless captive still yet rode along dirk belt axe strapped saddle wearing shadowskin cloak he’d dicing singer chainmail hauberk he’d taken chiggen’s corpse two score men flanked dwarf rest ragged band knights menatarms service sister lysa jon arryn’s young son yet tyrion betrayed hint fear could wrong catelyn wondered first time could innocent bran jon arryn rest make six men died bring

 resolute pushed doubts away “when reach keep would take kindly could send maester colemon ser rodrik feverish wounds” feared gallant old knight would survive journey toward end could scarcely sit horse bronn urged leave fate catelyn would hear tied saddle instead commanded marillion singer watch

 ser donnel hesitated answered “the lady lysa commanded maester remain eyrie times care lord robert” said “we septon gate tends wounded see man’s hurts”

 catelyn faith maester’s learning septon’s prayers say much saw battlements ahead long parapets built stone mountains either side pass shrank narrow defile scarce wide enough four men ride abreast twin watchtowers clung rocky slopes joined covered bridge weathered grey stone arched road silent faces watched arrow slits tower battlements bridge climbed almost top knight rode meet horse armor grey cloak rippling blueandred riverrun shiny black fish wrought gold obsidian pinned folds shoulder “who would pass bloody gate” called

 “ser donnel waynwood lady catelyn stark companions” young knight answered

 knight gate lifted visor “i thought lady looked familiar far home little cat”

 “and uncle” said smiling despite hearing hoarse smoky voice took back twenty years days childhood

 “my home back” said gruffly

 “your home heart” catelyn told “take helm would look face again”

 “the years improved fear” brynden tully said lifted helm catelyn saw lied features lined weathered time stolen auburn hair left grey smile bushy eyebrows fat caterpillars laughter deep blue eyes “did lysa know coming”

 “there time send word ahead” catelyn told others coming behind “i fear ride storm uncle”

 “may enter vale” ser donnel asked waynwoods ever ones ceremony

 “in name robert arryn lord eyrie defender vale true warden east bid enter freely charge keep peace” ser brynden replied “come”

 rode behind beneath shadow bloody gate dozen armies dashed pieces age heroes far side stoneworks mountains opened suddenly upon vista green fields blue sky snowcapped mountains took breath away vale arryn bathed morning light

 stretched misty cast tranquil land rich black soil wide slowmoving rivers hundreds small lakes shone like mirrors sun protected sides sheltering peaks wheat corn barley grew high fields even highgarden pumpkins larger fruit sweeter stood western end valley high road crested last pass began winding descent bottomlands two miles vale narrow half day’s ride across northern mountains seemed close catelyn could almost reach touch looming jagged peak called giant’s lance mountain even mountains looked head lost icy mists three half miles valley floor massive western shoulder flowed ghost torrent alyssa’s tears even distance catelyn could make shining silver thread bright dark stone

 uncle saw stopped moved horse closer pointed “it’s beside alyssa’s tears see flash white every look hard sun hits walls right”

 seven towers ned told like white daggers thrust belly sky high stand parapets look clouds “how long ride” asked

 “we mountain evenfall” uncle brynden said “but climb take another day”

 ser rodrik cassel spoke behind “my lady” said “i fear go farther today” face sagged beneath ragged newgrown whiskers looked weary catelyn feared might fall horse

 “nor you” said “you done could asked hundred times uncle see rest way eyrie lannister must come reason others rest recover strength”

 “we honored guest” ser donnel said grave courtesy young beside ser rodrik bronn ser willis wode marillion singer remained party ridden inn crossroads

 “my lady” marillion said riding forward “i beg allow accompany eyrie see end tale saw beginnings” boy sounded haggard yet strangely determined fevered shine eyes

 catelyn never asked singer ride choice made come survive journey many braver men lay dead unburied behind could never say yet scruff beard made look almost man perhaps owed something come far “very well” told

 “i’ll come well” bronn announced

 liked less well without bronn would never reached vale knew sellsword fierce fighter ever seen sword helped cut safety yet catelyn misliked man courage strength kindness little loyalty seen riding beside lannister far often talking low voices laughing private joke would preferred separate dwarf agreed marillion might continue eyrie could see gracious way deny right bronn “as wish” said although noted actually asked permission

 ser willis wode remained ser rodrik softspoken septon fussing wounds horses left behind well poor ragged things ser donnel promised send birds ahead eyrie gates moon word coming fresh mounts brought forth stables surefooted mountain stock shaggy coats within hour set forth catelyn rode beside uncle began descent valley floor behind came bronn tyrion lannister marillion six brynden’s men

 third way mountain path well earshot others brynden tully turn say “so child tell storm yours”

 “i child many years uncle” catelyn said told nonetheless took longer would believed tell lysa’s letter bran’s fall assassin’s dagger littlefinger chance meeting tyrion lannister crossroads inn

 uncle listened silently heavy brows shadowing eyes frown grew deeper brynden tully always known listen… anyone father lord hoster’s brother younger five years two war far back catelyn could remember one louder quarrels catelyn eight lord hoster called brynden “the black goat tully flock” laughing brynden pointed sigil house leaping trout ought black fish rather black goat day forward taken personal emblem

 war ended day lysa wed wedding feast brynden told brother leaving riverrun serve lysa new husband lord eyrie lord hoster spoken brother’s name since edmure told infrequent letters

 nonetheless years catelyn’s girlhood brynden blackfish lord hoster’s children run tears tales father busy mother ill catelyn lysa edmure… yes even petyr baelish father’s ward… listened patiently listened laughing triumphs sympathizing childish misfortunes

 done uncle remained silent long time horse negotiated steep rocky trail “your father must told” said last “if lannisters march winterfell remote vale walled behind mountains riverrun lies right path”

 “i’d fear” catelyn admitted “i shall ask maester colemon send bird reach eyrie” messages send well commands ned given bannermen ready defenses north “what mood vale” asked

 “angry” brynden tully admitted “lord jon much loved insult keenly felt king named jaime lannister office arryns held near three hundred years lysa commanded us call son true warden east one fooled sister alone wondering manner hand’s death none dare say jon murdered openly suspicion casts long shadow” gave catelyn look mouth tight “and boy”

 “the boy him” ducked head passed low overhang rock around sharp turn

 uncle’s voice troubled “lord robert” sighed “six years old sickly prone weep take dolls away jon arryn’s trueborn heir gods yet say weak sit father’s seat nestor royce high steward past fourteen years lord jon served king’s landing many whisper rule boy comes age others believe lysa must marry soon already suitors gather like crows battlefield eyrie full them”

 “i might expected that” catelyn said small wonder lysa still young kingdom mountain vale made handsome wedding gift “will lysa take another husband”

 “she says yes provided finds man suits her” brynden tully said “but already rejected lord nestor dozen suitable men swears time choose lord husband”

 “you people scarce fault that”

 ser brynden snorted “nor but… seems lysa playing courtship enjoys sport believe sister intends rule boy old enough lord eyrie truth well name”

 “a woman rule wisely man” catelyn said

 “the right woman can” uncle said sideways glance “make mistake cat lysa you” hesitated moment “if truth told fear may find sister helpful would like”

 puzzled “what mean”

 “the lysa came back king’s landing girl went south husband named hand years hard must know lord arryn dutiful husband marriage made politics passion”

 “as own”

 “they began ending happier sister’s two babes stillborn twice many miscarriages lord arryn’s death… catelyn gods gave lysa one child sister lives poor boy small wonder fled rather see handed lannisters sister afraid child lannisters fears ran vale stealing away red keep like thief night snatch son lion’s mouth… brought lion door”

 “in chains” catelyn said crevasse yawned right falling away darkness reined horse picked way along step careful step

 “oh” uncle glanced back tyrion lannister making slow descent behind “i see axe saddle dirk belt sellsword trails like hungry shadow chains sweet one”

 catelyn shifted uneasily seat “the dwarf choice chains prisoner lysa want answer crimes less lord husband lannisters murdered letter first warned us them”

 brynden blackfish gave weary smile “i hope right child” sighed tones said wrong

 sun well west time slope began flatten beneath hooves horses road widened grew straight first time catelyn noticed wildflowers grasses growing reached valley floor going faster made good time cantering verdant greenwoods sleepy little hamlets past orchards golden wheat fields splashing across dozen sunlit streams uncle sent standardbearer ahead double banner flying staff moonandfalcon house arryn high black fish farm wagons merchants’ carts riders lesser houses moved aside let pass

 even full dark reached stout castle stood foot giant’s lance torches flickered atop ramparts horned moon danced upon dark waters moat drawbridge portcullis catelyn saw lights burning gatehouse spilling windows square towers beyond

 “the gates moon” uncle said party drew rein standardbearer rode edge moat hail men gatehouse “lord nestor’s seat expecting us look up”

 catelyn raised eyes first saw stone trees looming mass great mountain shrouded night black starless sky noticed glow distant fires well tower keep built upon steep side mountain lights like orange eyes staring another higher distant still higher third flickering spark sky finally falcons soared flash white moonlight vertigo washed stared upward pale towers far

 “the eyrie” heard marillion murmur awed

 sharp voice tyrion lannister broke “the arryns must overfond company you’re planning make us climb mountain dark i’d rather kill here”

 “we’ll spend night make ascent morrow” brynden told

 “i scarcely wait” dwarf replied “how get i’ve experience riding goats”

 “mules” brynden said smiling

 “there steps carved mountain” catelyn said ned told talked youth robert baratheon jon arryn

 uncle nodded “it dark see steps steep narrow horses mules manage way path guarded three waycastles stone snow sky mules take us far sky”

 tyrion lannister glanced doubtfully “and beyond that”

 brynden smiled “beyond path steep even mules ascend foot rest way perchance you’d prefer ride basket eyrie clings mountain directly sky cellars six great winches long iron chains draw supplies prefer lord lannister arrange ride bread beer apples”

 dwarf gave bark laughter “would pumpkin” said “alas lord father would doubt chagrined son lannister went fate like load turnips ascend foot fear must lannisters certain pride”

 “pride” catelyn snapped mocking tone easy manner made angry “arrogance might call arrogance avarice lust power”

 “my brother undoubtedly arrogant” tyrion lannister replied “my father soul avarice sweet sister cersei lusts power every waking breath however innocent little lamb shall bleat you” grinned

 drawbridge came creaking could reply heard sound oiled chains portcullis drawn menatarms carried burning brands light way uncle led across moat lord nestor royce high steward vale keeper gates moon waiting yard greet surrounded knights “lady stark” said bowing massive barrelchested man bow clumsy

 catelyn dismounted stand “lord nestor” said knew man reputation bronze yohn’s cousin lesser branch house royce yet still formidable lord right “we long tiring journey would beg hospitality roof tonight might”

 “my roof lady” lord nestor returned gruffly “but sister lady lysa sent word eyrie wishes see rest party housed sent first light”

 uncle swung horse “what madness this” said bluntly brynden tully never man blunt edge words “a night ascent moon even full even lysa know that’s invitation broken neck”

 “the mules know way ser brynden” wiry girl seventeen eighteen years stepped beside lord nestor dark hair cropped short straight around head wore riding leathers light shirt silvered ringmail bowed catelyn gracefully lord “i promise lady harm come would honor take i’ve made dark climb hundred times mychel says father must goat”

 sounded cocky catelyn smile “do name child”

 “mya stone please lady” girl said

 please effort catelyn keep smile face stone bastard’s name vale snow north flowers highgarden seven kingdoms custom fashioned surname children born names catelyn nothing girl suddenly could help think ned’s bastard wall thought made angry guilty struggled find words reply

 lord nestor filled silence “mya’s clever girl vows bring safely lady lysa believe failed yet”

 “then put hands mya stone” catelyn said “lord nestor charge keep close guard prisoner”

 “and charge bring prisoner cup wine nicely crisped capon dies hunger” lannister said “a girl would pleasant well suppose that’s much ask you” sellsword bronn laughed aloud

 lord nestor ignored banter “as say lady done” look dwarf “see lord lannister tower cell bring meat mead”

 catelyn took leave uncle others tyrion lannister led followed bastard girl castle two mules waiting upper bailey saddled ready mya helped mount one guardsman skyblue cloak opened narrow postern gate beyond dense forest pine spruce mountain like black wall steps chiseled deep rock ascending sky “some people find easier close eyes” mya said led mules gate dark wood “when get frightened dizzy sometimes hold mule tight don’t like that”

 “i born tully wed stark” catelyn said “i frighten easily plan light torch” steps black pitch

 girl made face “torches blind clear night like moon stars enough mychel says eyes owl” mounted urged mule first step catelyn’s animal followed accord

 “you mentioned mychel before” catelyn said mules set pace slow steady perfectly content

 “mychel’s love” mya explained “mychel redfort he’s squire ser lyn corbray we’re wed soon becomes knight next year year after”

 sounded like sansa happy innocent dreams catelyn smiled smile tinged sadness redforts old name vale knew blood first men veins love might redfort would ever wed bastard family would arrange suitable match corbray waynwood royce perhaps daughter greater house outside vale mychel redfort laid girl would wrong side sheet

 ascent easier catelyn dared hope trees pressed close leaning path make rustling green roof shut even moon seemed though moving long black tunnel mules surefooted tireless mya stone indeed seem blessed nighteyes plodded upward winding way back forth across face mountain steps twisted turned thick layer fallen needles carpeted path shoes mules made softest sound rock quiet soothed gentle rocking motion set catelyn swaying saddle long fighting sleep

 perhaps doze moment suddenly massive ironbound gate looming “stone” mya announced cheerily dismounting iron spikes set along tops formidable stone walls two fat round towers overtopped keep gate swung open mya’s shout inside portly knight commanded waycastle greeted mya name offered skewers charred meat onions still hot spit catelyn realized hungry ate standing yard stablehands moved saddles fresh mules hot juices ran chin dripped onto cloak famished care

 onto new mule starlight second part ascent seemed treacherous catelyn trail steeper steps worn littered pebbles broken stone mya dismount halfdozen times move fallen rocks path “you don’t want mule break leg here” said catelyn forced agree could feel altitude trees sparser wind blew vigorously sharp gusts tugged clothing pushed hair eyes time time steps doubled back could see stone gates moon farther torches brighter candles

 snow smaller stone single fortified tower timber keep stable hidden behind low wall unmortared rock yet nestled giant’s lance way command entire stone stair lower waycastle enemy intent eyrie would fight way stone step step rocks arrows rained snow commander anxious young knight pockmarked face offered bread cheese chance warm fire mya declined “we ought keep going lady” said “if please you” catelyn nodded

 given fresh mules white mya smiled saw “whitey’s good one lady sure foot even ice need careful he’ll kick doesn’t like you”

 white mule seemed like catelyn kicking thank gods ice either grateful well “my mother says hundreds years ago snow began” mya told “it always white ice never melted” shrugged “i can’t remember ever seeing snow far mountain maybe way olden times”

 young catelyn thought trying remember ever like girl lived half life summer knew winter coming child wanted tell words lips almost said perhaps becoming stark last

 snow wind living thing howling around like wolf waste falling nothing lure complacency stars seemed brighter close could almost touch horned moon huge clear black sky climbed catelyn found better look steps cracked broken centuries freeze thaw tread countless mules even dark heights put heart throat came high saddle two spires rock mya dismounted “it’s best lead mules over” said “the wind little scary lady”

 catelyn climbed stiffly shadows looked path ahead twenty feet long close three feet wide precipitous drop either side could hear wind shrieking mya stepped lightly mule following calmly crossing bailey turn yet sooner taken first step fear caught catelyn jaws could feel emptiness vast black gulfs air yawned around stopped trembling afraid move wind screamed wrenched cloak trying pull edge catelyn edged foot backward timid steps mule behind could retreat going die thought could feel cold sweat trickling back

 “lady stark” mya called across gulf girl sounded thousand leagues away “are well”

 catelyn tully stark swallowed remained pride “i… cannot child” called

 “yes can” bastard girl said “i know look wide path is”

 “i don’t want look” world seemed spinning around mountain sky mules whirling like child’s top catelyn closed eyes steady ragged breathing

 “i’ll come back you” mya said “don’t move lady”

 moving last thing catelyn listened skirling wind scuffling sound leather stone mya taking gently arm “keep eyes closed like let go rope whitey take care good lady i’ll lead it’s easy you’ll see give step that’s move foot slide forward see another easy could run across another one go yes” foot foot step step bastard girl led catelyn across blind trembling white mule followed placidly behind

 waycastle called sky high crescentshaped wall unmortared stone raised side mountain even topless towers valyria could looked beautiful catelyn stark last snow crown began sky’s weathered stones rimed frost long spears ice hung slopes

 dawn breaking east mya stone hallooed guards gates opened inside walls series ramps great tumble boulders stones sizes doubt would easiest thing world begin avalanche mouth yawned rock face front “the stables barracks there” mya said “the last part inside mountain little dark least you’re wind far mules go past well it’s sort chimney like stone ladder proper steps it’s bad another hour we’ll there”

 catelyn looked directly overhead pale dawn light could see foundations eyrie could six hundred feet looked like small white honeycomb remembered uncle said baskets winches “the lannisters may pride” told mya “but tullys born better sense ridden day best part night tell lower basket shall ride turnips”

 sun well mountains time catelyn stark finally reached eyrie stocky silverhaired man skyblue cloak hammered moonandfalcon breastplate helped basket ser vardis egen captain jon arryn’s household guard beside stood maester colemon thin nervous little hair much neck “lady stark” ser vardis said “the pleasure great unanticipated” maester colemon bobbed head agreement “indeed lady indeed sent word sister left orders awakened instant arrived”

 “i hope good night’s rest” catelyn said certain bite tone seemed go unnoticed

 men escorted winch room spiral stair eyrie small castle standards great houses seven slender white towers bunched tightly arrows quiver shoulder great mountain need stables smithys kennels ned said granary large winterfell’s towers could house five hundred men yet seemed strangely deserted catelyn passed pale stone halls echoing empty

 lysa waiting alone solar still clad bed robes long auburn hair tumbled unbound across bare white shoulders back maid stood behind brushing night’s tangles catelyn entered sister rose feet smiling “cat” said “oh cat good see sweet sister” ran across chamber wrapped sister arms “how long been” lysa murmured “oh long”

 five years truth five cruel years lysa taken toll sister two years younger yet looked older shorter catelyn lysa grown thick body pale puffy face blue eyes tullys pale watery never still small mouth turned petulant catelyn held remembered slender highbreasted girl who’d waited beside day sept riverrun lovely full hope remained sister’s beauty great fall thick auburn hair cascaded waist

 “you look well” catelyn lied “but… tired”

 sister broke embrace “tired yes oh yes” seemed notice others maid maester colemon ser vardis “leave us” told “i wish speak sister alone” held catelyn’s hand withdrew…

 … dropped instant door closed catelyn saw face change sun gone behind cloud “have taken leave senses” lysa snapped “to bring without word permission without much warning drag us quarrels lannisters…”

 “my quarrels” catelyn could scarce believe hearing great fire burned hearth trace warmth lysa’s voice “they quarrels first sister sent cursed letter wrote lannisters murdered husband”

 “to warn could stay away never meant fight gods cat know you’ve done”

 “mother” small voice said lysa whirled heavy robe swirling around robert arryn lord eyrie stood doorway clutching ragged cloth doll looking large eyes painfully thin child small age sickly days time time trembled shaking sickness maesters called “i heard voices”

 small wonder catelyn thought lysa almost shouting still sister looked daggers “this aunt catelyn baby sister lady stark remember”

 boy glanced blankly “i think so” said blinking though less year old last time catelyn seen

 lysa seated near fire said “come mother sweet one” straightened bedclothes fussed fine brown hair “isn’t beautiful strong don’t believe things hear jon knew seed strong told last words kept saying robert’s name grabbed arm hard left marks tell seed strong seed wanted everyone know good strong boy baby going be”

 “lysa” catelyn said “if you’re right lannisters reason must act quickly we—”

 “not front baby” lysa said “he delicate temper don’t sweet one”

 “the boy lord eyrie defender vale” catelyn reminded “and times delicacy ned thinks may come war”

 “quiet” lysa snapped “you’re scaring boy” little robert took quick peek shoulder catelyn began tremble doll fell rushes pressed mother “don’t afraid sweet baby” lysa whispered “mother’s nothing hurt you” opened robe drew pale heavy breast tipped red boy grabbed eagerly buried face chest began suck lysa stroked hair

 catelyn loss words jon arryn’s son thought incredulously remembered baby threeyearold rickon half age boy five times fierce small wonder lords vale restive first time understood king tried take child away mother foster lannisters…

 “we’re safe here” lysa saying whether boy catelyn sure

 “don’t fool” catelyn said anger rising “no one safe think hiding make lannisters forget sadly mistaken”

 lysa covered boy’s ear hand “even could bring army mountains past bloody gate eyrie impregnable saw enemy could ever reach us here”

 catelyn wanted slap uncle brynden tried warn realized “no castle impregnable”

 “this one is” lysa insisted “everyone says thing imp brought me”

 “is bad man” lord eyrie asked mother’s breast popping mouth nipple wet red

 “a bad man” lysa told covered “but mother won’t let harm little baby”

 “make fly” robert said eagerly

 lysa stroked son’s hair “perhaps will” murmured “perhaps do”

 “she does” eddard stark touched baby’s fine dark hair flowed fingers like black silk robert’s firstborn fine hair seemed recall

 “tell see milord it… please tell beautiful is”

 “well start”

 littlefinger shrugged rivulets moisture twisted back cloak “does matter bed enough women give presents grace never shy count know he’s acknowledged boy storm’s end one fathered night lord stannis wed could hardly otherwise mother florent niece lady selyse one bedmaids renly says robert carried girl upstairs feast broke wedding bed stannis bride still dancing lord stannis seemed think blot honor wife’s house boy born shipped renly” gave ned sideways glance “i’ve also heard whispers robert got pair twins serving wench casterly rock three years ago went west lord tywin’s tourney cersei babes killed sold mother passing slaver much affront lannister pride close home”

 ned stark grimaced ugly tales like told every great lord realm could believe cersei lannister readily enough… would king stand let happen robert known would robert known never practiced shutting eyes things wish see “why would jon arryn take sudden interest king’s baseborn children”

 ned’s men drawn swords three twenty eyes watched nearby windows doors one intervene party mounted lannisters foot save jaime charge might win free seemed eddard stark surer safer tactic “kill me” warned kingslayer “and catelyn certainly slay tyrion”

 jaime lannister poked ned’s chest gilded sword sipped blood last dragonkings “would noble catelyn tully riverrun murder hostage think… not” sighed “but willing chance brother’s life woman’s honor” jaime slid golden sword sheath “so suppose i’ll let run back robert tell frightened wonder he’ll care” jaime pushed wet hair back fingers wheeled horse around beyond line swordsmen glanced back captain “tregar see harm comes lord stark”

 horse gate vaes dothrak made two gigantic bronze stallions rearing hooves meeting hundred feet roadway form pointed arch

 dany could said city needed gate walls… buildings could see yet stood immense beautiful great horses framing distant purple mountain beyond bronze stallions threw long shadows across waving grasses khal drogo led khalasar hooves godsway bloodriders beside

 dany followed silver escorted ser jorah mormont brother viserys mounted day grass left walk back khalasar dothraki laughingly called khal rhae mhar sorefoot king khal drogo offered place cart next day viserys accepted stubborn ignorance even known mocked carts eunuchs cripples women giving birth young old yet another name khal rhaggat cart king brother thought khal’s way apologizing wrong dany done begged ser jorah tell truth lest shamed knight replied king could well bit shame… yet done bid taken much pleading pillow tricks doreah taught dany able make drogo relent allow viserys rejoin head column

 “where city” asked passed beneath bronze arch buildings seen people grass road lined ancient monuments lands dothraki sacked centuries

 “ahead” ser jorah answered “under mountain”

 beyond horse gate plundered gods stolen heroes loomed either side forgotten deities dead cities brandished broken thunderbolts sky dany rode silver past feet stone kings looked thrones faces chipped stained even names lost mists time lithe young maidens danced marble plinths draped flowers poured air shattered jars monsters stood grass beside road black iron dragons jewels eyes roaring griffins manticores barbed tails poised strike beasts could name statues lovely took breath away others misshapen terrible dany could scarcely bear look ser jorah said likely come shadow lands beyond asshai

 “so many” said silver stepped slowly onward “and many lands”

 viserys less impressed “the trash dead cities” sneered careful speak common tongue dothraki could understand yet even dany found glancing back men khas make certain overheard went blithely “all savages know steal things better men built… kill” laughed “they know kill otherwise i’d use all”

 “they people now” dany said “you call savages brother”

 “the dragon speaks likes” viserys said… common tongue glanced shoulder aggo rakharo riding behind favored mocking smile “see savages lack wit understand speech civilized men” mosseaten stone monolith loomed road fifty feet tall viserys gazed boredom eyes “how long must linger amidst ruins drogo gives army grow tired waiting”

 “he better” viserys said grimly “i promised crown mean dragon mocked” spying obscene likeness woman six breasts ferret’s head rode inspect closely

 dany relieved yet less anxious “i pray sunandstars keep waiting long” told ser jorah brother earshot

 knight looked viserys doubtfully “your brother bided time pentos place khalasar illyrio tried warn him”

 “he go soon ten thousand lord husband promised golden crown”

 ser jorah grunted “yes khaleesi but… dothraki look things differently west told much illyrio told brother listen horselords traders viserys thinks sold wants price yet khal drogo would say gift give viserys gift return yes… time demand gift khal demand anything khal”

 “it right make wait” dany know defending brother yet “viserys says could sweep seven kingdoms ten thousand dothraki screamers”

 ser jorah snorted “viserys could sweep stable ten thousand brooms”

 dany could pretend surprise disdain tone “what… viserys” asked “if someone else led someone stronger could dothraki truly conquer seven kingdoms”

 ser jorah’s face grew thoughtful horses trod together godsway “when first went exile looked dothraki saw halfnaked barbarians wild horses asked princess told thousand good knights would trouble putting flight hundred times many dothraki”

 “but asked now”

 “now” knight said “i less certain better riders knight utterly fearless bows outrange seven kingdoms archers fight foot behind shieldwall barricade sharpened stakes dothraki fire horseback charging retreating makes matter full deadly… many lady lord husband alone counts forty thousand mounted warriors khalasar”

 “i don’t want race” bran looked around direwolves vanished wood “did hear summer howling last night”

 “grey wind restless too” robb said auburn hair grown shaggy unkempt reddish stubble covered jaw making look older fifteen years “sometimes think know things… sense things…” robb sighed “i never know much tell bran wish older”

 “i’m eight now” bran said “eight isn’t much younger fifteen i’m heir winterfell you”

 “so are” robb sounded sad even little scared “bran need tell something bird last night king’s landing maester luwin woke me”

 “bran” robb asked “what’s wrong”

 bran shook head “i remembering” said “jory brought us fish trout jon remember”

 “i remember” robb said voice quiet sad

 “i didn’t catch anything” bran said “but jon gave fish way back winterfell ever see jon again”

 “i’m lost” bran like way strangers looking counted four turned head saw two others behind “my brother rode moment ago guard shortly”

 “your guard it” second man said grey stubble covered gaunt face “and would guarding little lord silver pin see cloak”

 “pretty” said woman’s voice scarcely looked like woman tall lean hard face others hair hidden beneath bowlshaped halfhelm spear held eight feet black oak tipped rusted steel

 “let’s look” said big bald man

 bran watched anxiously man’s clothes filthy fallen almost pieces patched brown blue dark green faded everywhere grey cloak might black grey stubbly man wore black rags saw sudden start suddenly bran remembered oathbreaker father beheaded day found wolf pups man worn black well father said deserter night’s watch man dangerous remembered lord eddard saying deserter knows life forfeit taken flinch crime matter vile cruel

 “no” bran blurted “i can’t…”

 big man grabbed reins bran could think wheel dancer around gallop “you lordling… know what’s good you”

 “stiv look he’s strapped on” tall woman pointed spear “might it’s truth he’s telling”

 “straps it” stiv said drew dagger sheath belt “there’s ways deal straps”

 “you kind cripple” asked short woman

 bran flared “i’m brandon stark winterfell better let go horse i’ll see dead”

 gaunt man grey stubbled face laughed “the boy’s stark true enough stark would fool enough threaten smarter men would beg”

 “cut little cock stuff mouth” suggested short woman “that shut up”

 “you’re stupid ugly hali” said tall woman “the boy’s worth nothing dead alive… gods damned think mance would give benjen stark’s blood hostage”

 “mance damned” big man cursed “you want go back osha fool think white walkers care hostage” turned back bran slashed strap around thigh leather parted sigh

 stroke quick careless biting deep looking bran glimpsed pale flesh wool leggings parted blood began flow watched red stain spread feeling lightheaded curiously apart pain even hint feeling big man grunted surprise

 “put steel promise shall quick painless death” robb called

 bran looked desperate hope strength words undercut way voice cracked strain mounted bloody carcass elk slung across back horse sword gloved hand

 “the brother” said man grey stubbly face

 “he’s fierce one is” mocked short woman hali called “you mean fight us boy”

 “don’t fool lad you’re one six” tall woman osha leveled spear “off horse throw sword we’ll thank kindly mount venison brother way”

 robb whistled heard faint sound soft feet wet leaves undergrowth parted lowhanging branches giving accumulation snow grey wind summer emerged green summer sniffed air growled

 “wolves” gasped hali

 “direwolves” bran said still halfgrown large wolf ever seen differences easy spot knew look maester luwin farlen kennelmaster taught direwolf bigger head longer legs proportion body snout jaw markedly leaner pronounced something gaunt terrible stood amid gently falling snow fresh blood spotted grey wind’s muzzle

 “dogs” big bald man said contemptuously “yet i’m told there’s nothing like wolfskin cloak warm man night” made sharp gesture “take them”

 robb shouted “winterfell” kicked horse gelding plunged bank ragged men closed man axe rushed shouting heedless robb’s sword caught full face sickening crunch spray bright blood man gaunt stubbly face made grab reins half second them… grey wind bearing fell back stream splash shout flailing wildly knife head went direwolf plunged white water turned red vanished

 robb reined horse breathing hard fury went eyes sword arm dropped

 “grey wind summer me” robb said

 direwolves stopped turned heads grey wind loped back robb summer stayed eyes bran man beside growled muzzle wet red eyes burned

 osha used butt end spear lever back feet blood leaked wound upper arm robb cut bran could see sweat trickling big man’s face stiv scared realized “starks” man muttered “bloody starks” raised voice “osha kill wolves get sword”

 “kill yourself” replied “i’ll getting near monsters”

 robb move

 “you wolves boy”

 “no” bran screamed robb asked stiv would kill anyway direwolves dead

 bald man took hold hair free hand twisted cruelly till bran sobbed pain “you shut mouth cripple hear me” twisted harder “you hear me”

 low thrum came woods behind stiv gave choked gasp half foot razortipped broadhead suddenly exploded chest arrow bright red painted blood

 dagger fell away bran’s throat big man swayed collapsed facedown stream arrow broke beneath bran watched life go swirling water

 osha glanced around father’s guardsmen appeared beneath trees steel hand threw spear “mercy m’lord” called robb

 guardsmen strange pale look faces took scene slaughter eyed wolves uncertainly summer returned hali’s corpse feed joseth dropped knife scrambled bush heaving even maester luwin seemed shocked stepped behind tree instant shook head waded across stream bran’s side “are hurt”

 “he cut leg” bran said “but couldn’t feel it”

 maester knelt examine wound bran turned head theon greyjoy stood beside sentinel tree bow hand smiling ever smiling halfdozen arrows thrust soft ground feet taken one “a dead enemy thing beauty” announced

 “jon always said ass greyjoy” robb said loudly “i ought chain yard let bran take practice shots you”

 “you thanking saving brother’s life”

 “what missed shot” robb said “what you’d wounded made hand jump hit bran instead knew man might wearing breastplate could see back cloak would happened brother ever think greyjoy”

 theon’s smile gone gave sullen shrug began pull arrows ground one one

 robb glared guardsmen “where you” demanded “i sure close behind us”

 men traded unhappy glances “we following m’lord” said quent youngest beard soft brown fuzz “only first waited maester luwin ass begging pardons well were…” glanced theon quickly looked away abashed

 “i spied turkey” theon said annoyed question “how know you’d leave boy alone”

 robb turned head look theon bran never seen angry yet said nothing finally knelt beside maester luwin “how badly brother wounded”

 “no scratch” maester said wet cloth stream clean cut “two wear black” told robb worked

 robb glanced stiv lay sprawled stream ragged black cloak moving fitfully rushing waters tugged “deserters night’s watch” said grimly “they must fools come close winterfell”

 “folly desperation ofttimes hard tell apart” said maester luwin

 “shall bury m’lord” asked quent

 “they would buried us” robb said “hack heads we’ll send back wall leave rest carrion crows”

 “and one” quent jerked thumb toward osha

 robb walked head taller dropped knees approach “give life m’lord stark yours”

 “mine would oathbreaker”

 “i broke oaths stiv wallen flew wall black crows got place women”

 theon greyjoy sauntered closer “give wolves” urged robb woman’s eyes went left hali quickly away shuddered even guardsmen looked queasy

 “she’s woman” robb said

 “a wildling” bran told “she said keep alive could take mance rayder”

 “do name” robb asked

 “osha please lord” muttered sourly

 maester luwin stood “we might well question her”

 bran could see relief brother’s face “as say maester wayn bind hands she’ll come back winterfell us… live die truths gives us”





 tyrion

 “you want eat” mord asked glowering plate oiled beans one thick stubfingered hand

 tyrion lannister starved refused let brute see cringe “a leg lamb would pleasant” said heap soiled straw corner cell “perhaps dish peas onions fresh baked bread butter flagon mulled wine wash beer that’s easier try overly particular”

 “is beans” mord said “here” held plate

 tyrion sighed turnkey twenty stone gross stupidity brown rotting teeth small dark eyes left side face slick scar axe cut ear part cheek predictable ugly tyrion hungry reached plate

 mord jerked away grinning “is here” said holding beyond tyrion’s reach

 dwarf climbed stiffly feet every joint aching “must play fool’s game every meal” made another grab beans

 mord shambled backward grinning rotten teeth “is dwarf man” held plate arm’s length edge cell ended sky began “you want eat come take”

 tyrion’s arms short reach plate step close edge would take would quick shove mord’s heavy white belly would end sickening red splotch stones sky like many prisoners eyrie centuries “come think i’m hungry all” declared retreating corner cell

 mord grunted opened thick fingers wind took plate flipping fell handful beans sprayed back food tumbled sight turnkey laughed gut shaking like bowl pudding

 tyrion felt pang rage “you fucking son poxridden ass” spat “i hope die bloody flux”

 mord gave kick driving steeltoed boot hard tyrion’s ribs way “i take back” gasped doubled straw “i’ll kill swear it” heavy ironbound door slammed shut tyrion heard rattle keys

 small man cursed dangerously big mouth reflected crawled back corner arryns laughably called dungeon huddled beneath thin blanket bedding staring blaze empty blue sky distant mountains seemed go forever wishing still shadowskin cloak he’d marillion dice singer stolen body brigand chief skin smelled blood mold warm thick mord taken moment laid eyes

 wind tugged blanket gusts sharp talons cell miserably small even dwarf five feet away wall ought wall would proper dungeon floor ended sky began plenty fresh air sunshine moon stars night tyrion would traded instant dankest gloomiest pit bowels casterly rock

 “you fly” mord promised he’d shoved cell “twenty day thirty fifty maybe fly”

 arryns kept dungeon realm prisoners welcome escape first day girding courage hours tyrion lain flat stomach squirmed edge poke head look sky six hundred feet nothing empty air craned neck far could go could see cells right left bee stone honeycomb someone torn wings

 cold cell wind screamed night day worst floor sloped ever slightly yet enough afraid close eyes afraid might roll steep wake sudden terror went sliding edge small wonder sky cells drove men mad

 gods save previous tenant written wall something looked suspiciously like blood blue calling first tyrion wondered he’d become later decided would rather know

 shut mouth…

 wretched boy started looking throne carved weirwood beneath moonandfalcon banners house arryn tyrion lannister looked life seldom rheumyeyed sixyearolds needed stuff fat cushions cheeks lift height man “is bad man” boy asked clutching doll

 “he is” lady lysa said lesser throne beside blue powdered perfumed suitors filled court

 “he’s small” lord eyrie said giggling

 “this tyrion imp house lannister murdered father” raised voice carried length high hall eyrie ringing milkwhite walls slender pillars every man could hear “he slew hand king”

 “oh kill too” tyrion said like fool

 would good time kept mouth closed head bowed could see seven hells seen high hall arryns long austere forbidding coldness walls blueveined white marble faces around colder far power casterly rock far away friends lannisters vale arryn submission silence would best defenses

 tyrion’s mood foul sense shame faltered last leg daylong climb eyrie stunted legs unable take higher bronn carried rest way humiliation poured oil flames anger “it would seem i’ve busy little fellow” said bitter sarcasm “i wonder found time slaying murdering”

 ought remembered dealing lysa arryn halfsane weakling son known court love wit especially directed

 “imp” lysa said coldly “you guard mocking tongue speak son politely promise cause regret remember eyrie knights vale see around true men loved jon arryn well every one would die me”

 “lady arryn harm come brother jaime pleased see do” even spat words tyrion knew folly

 “can fly lord lannister” lady lysa asked “does dwarf wings would wiser swallow next threat comes mind”

 “i made threats” tyrion said “that promise”

 little lord robert hopped feet upset dropped doll “you can’t hurt us” screamed “no one hurt us tell mother tell can’t hurt us here” boy began twitch

 “the eyrie impregnable” lysa arryn declared calmly drew son close holding safe circle plump white arms “the imp trying frighten us sweet baby lannisters liars one hurt sweet boy”

 hell doubt right seen took get tyrion could well imagine would knight trying fight way armor stones arrows poured enemies contested every step nightmare begin describe small wonder eyrie never taken

 still tyrion unable silence “not impregnable” said “merely inconvenient”

 young robert pointed hand trembling “you’re liar mother want see fly” two guardsmen skyblue cloaks seized tyrion arms lifting floor

 gods know might happened catelyn stark “sister” called stood thrones “i beg remember man prisoner harmed”

 lysa arryn glanced sister coolly moment rose swept tyrion long skirts trailing instant feared would strike instead commanded release men shoved floor legs went tyrion fell

 must made quite sight struggled knees feel right leg spasm sending sprawling laughter boomed high hall arryns

 “my sister’s little guest weary stand” lady lysa announced “ser vardis take dungeon rest one sky cells much good”

 guardsmen jerked upright tyrion lannister dangled kicking feebly face red shame “i remember this” told carried

 good

 first consoled imprisonment could last long lysa arryn wanted humble would send soon catelyn stark would want question time would guard tongue closely dare kill hand still lannister casterly rock shed blood would mean war told

 certain

 perhaps captors meant let rot feared strength rot long growing weaker every day matter time mord’s kicks blows serious harm provided gaoler starve death first nights cold hunger blue would start calling

 wondered happening beyond walls cell lord tywin would surely sent riders word reached jaime might leading host mountains moon even now… unless riding north winterfell instead anyone outside vale even suspect catelyn stark taken wondered cersei would heard king could order freed would robert listen queen hand tyrion illusions king’s love sister

 cersei kept wits would insist king sit judgment tyrion even ned stark could scarcely object without impugning honor king tyrion would glad take chances trial whatever murders might lay door starks proof anything far could see let make case iron throne lords land would end cersei clever enough see that…

 tyrion lannister sighed sister without certain low cunning pride blinded would see insult opportunity jaime even worse rash headstrong quick anger brother never untied knot could slash two sword

 wondered sent footpad silence stark boy whether truly conspired death lord arryn old hand murdered deftly subtly done men age died sudden illness time contrast sending oaf stolen knife brandon stark struck unbelievably clumsy wasn’t peculiar come think it…

 tyrion shivered nasty suspicion perhaps direwolf lion beasts woods true someone using catspaw tyrion lannister hated used

 would get soon chances overpowering mord small none one smuggle sixhundredfootlong rope would talk free mouth gotten cell could damn well get

 tyrion pushed feet best ignore slope floor beneath eversosubtle tug toward edge hammered door fist “mord” shouted “turnkey mord want you” keep good ten minutes heard footsteps tyrion stepped back instant door opened crash

 “making noise” mord growled blood eyes dangling one meaty hand leather strap wide thick doubled fist

 never show you’re afraid tyrion reminded “how would like rich” asked

 mord hit swung strap backhand lazily leather caught tyrion high arm force staggered pain made grit teeth “no mouth dwarf man” mord warned

 “gold” tyrion said miming smile “casterly rock full gold… ahhhh…” time blow forehand mord put arm swing making leather crack jump caught tyrion ribs dropped knees wimpering forced look gaoler “as rich lannisters” wheezed “that’s say mord—”

 mord grunted strap whistled air smashed tyrion full face pain bad remember falling opened eyes floor cell ear ringing mouth full blood groped purchase push fingers brushed against… nothing tyrion snatched hand back fast scalded tried best stop breathing fallen right edge inches blue

 “more say” mord held strap fists gave sharp pull snap made tyrion jump turnkey laughed

 won’t push tyrion told desperately crawled away edge catelyn stark wants alive doesn’t dare kill wiped blood lips back hand grinned said “that stiff one mord” gaoler squinted trying decide mocked “i could make good use strong man like you” strap flew time tyrion able cringe away took glancing blow shoulder nothing “gold” repeated scrambling backward like crab “more gold you’ll see lifetime enough buy land women horses… could lord lord mord” tyrion hawked glob blood phlegm spat sky

 “is gold” mord said

 he’s listening tyrion thought “they relieved purse captured gold still mine catelyn stark might take man prisoner she’d never stoop rob wouldn’t honorable help gold yours” mord’s strap licked halfhearted desultory swing slow contemptuous tyrion caught leather hand held prisoned “there risk need deliver message”

 gaoler yanked leather strap free tyrion’s grasp “message” said never heard word frown made deep creases brow

 “you heard lord carry word lady tell her…” would possibly make lysa anyn relent inspiration came tyrion lannister suddenly “…tell wish confess crimes”

 mord raised arm tyrion braced another blow turnkey hesitated suspicion greed warred eyes wanted gold yet feared trick look man often tricked “is lie” muttered darkly “dwarf man cheat me”

 “i put promise writing” tyrion vowed

 illiterates held writing disdain others seemed superstitious reverence written word sort magic fortunately mord one latter turnkey lowered strap “writing gold much gold”

 “oh much gold” tyrion assured “the purse taste friend brother wears armor solid gold plate” truth jaime’s armor gilded steel oaf would never know difference

 mord fingered strap thoughtfully end relented went fetch paper ink letter written gaoler frowned suspiciously “now deliver message” tyrion urged

 shivering sleep came late night mord opened door kept silence ser vardis egen woke tyrion point boot “on feet imp lady wants see you”

 tyrion rubbed sleep eyes put grimace scarcely felt “no doubt makes think wish see her”

 ser vardis frowned tyrion remembered well years spent king’s landing captain hand’s household guard square plain face silver hair heavy build humor whatsoever “your wishes concern feet i’ll carried”

 tyrion clambered awkwardly feet “a cold night” said casually “and high hall drafty don’t wish catch chill mord would good fetch cloak”

 gaoler squinted face dull suspicion

 “my cloak” tyrion repeated “the shadowskin took safekeeping recall”

 “get damnable cloak” ser vardis said

 rear hall bronn lounged beneath pillar freerider’s black eyes fixed tyrion hand lay lightly pommel sword tyrion gave long look wondering…

 catelyn stark spoke first “you wish confess crimes told”

 “i lady” tyrion answered

 lysa arryn smiled sister “the sky cells always break gods see darkness hide in”

 “he look broken me” lady catelyn said

 lady lysa paid mind “say will” commanded tyrion

 roll dice thought another quick glance back bronn “where begin vile little man confess crimes sins beyond counting lords ladies lain whores hundreds times wished lord father dead sister gracious queen well” behind someone chuckled “i always treated servants kindness gambled even cheated blush admit said many cruel malicious things noble lords ladies court” drew outright laughter “once i—”

 “silence” lysa arryn’s pale round face turned burning pink “what imagine dwarf”

 tyrion cocked head one side “why confessing crimes lady—”

 catelyn stark took step forward “you accused sending hired knife slay son bran bed conspiring murder lord jon arryn hand king”

 tyrion gave helpless shrug “those crimes cannot confess fear know nothing murders”

 lady lysa rose weirwood throne “i made mock little jape imp trust enjoyed ser vardis take back dungeon… time find smaller cell floor sharply sloped”

 “is justice done vale” tyrion roared loudly ser vardis froze instant “does honor stop bloody gate accuse crimes deny throw open cell freeze starve” lifted head give good look bruises mord left face “where king’s justice eyrie part seven kingdoms stand accused say well demand trial let speak let truth falsehood judged openly sight gods men”

 low murmuring filled high hall tyrion knew highborn son powerful lord realm brother queen could denied trial guardsmen skyblue cloaks started toward tyrion ser vardis bid halt looked lady lysa

 small mouth twitched petulant smile “if tried found guilty crimes stand accused king’s laws must pay life’s blood keep headsman eyrie lord lannister open moon door”

 press spectators parted narrow weirwood door stood two slender marble pillars crescent moon carved white wood standing closest edged backward pair guardsmen marched one man removed heavy bronze bars second pulled door inward blue cloaks rose snapping shoulders caught sudden gust wind came howling open door beyond emptiness night sky speckled cold uncaring stars

 “behold king’s justice” lysa arryn said torch flames fluttered like pennons along walls odd torch guttered

 “lysa think unwise” catelyn stark said black wind swirled around hall

 sister ignored “you want trial lord lannister well trial shall son listen whatever care say shall hear judgment may leave… one door other”

 “i thank good lady see need trouble lord robert” tyrion said politely “the gods know truth innocence verdict judgment men demand trial combat”

 storm sudden laughter filled high hall arryns lord nestor royce snorted ser willis chuckled ser lyn corbray guffawed others threw back heads howled tears ran faces marillion clumsily plucked gay note new woodharp fingers broken hand even wind seemed whistle derision came skirling moon door

 ser vardis singularly silent “my lady” said gravely sinking one knee “pray give burden another taste man warrior look dwarf half size lame legs would shameful slaughter man call justice”

 oh excellent tyrion thought “i agree”

 lysa glared “you demanded trial combat”

 “and demand champion chosen brother jaime gladly take part know”

 “your precious kingslayer hundreds leagues here” snapped lysa arryn

 “send bird gladly await arrival”

 “you face ser vardis morrow”

 “singer” tyrion said turning marillion “when make ballad certain tell lady arryn denied dwarf right champion sent forth lame bruised hobbling face finest knight”

 “i deny nothing” lysa arryn said voice peeved shrill irritation “name champion imp… think find man die you”

 “if i’d sooner find one kill me” tyrion looked long hall one moved long moment wondered colossal blunder

 “your lady sister thought better let sleep maester colemon told me”

 “i woken” insisted

 “the maester tells sister planned speak combat” ser rodrik said

 “then still plans go mummer’s farce” catelyn grimaced “the dwarf played like set pipes deaf hear tune whatever happens morning ser rodrik past time took leave place winterfell sons strong enough travel shall ask lysa escort see us gulltown take ship there”

 “another ship” ser rodrik looked shade green yet managed shudder “as say lady”

 old knight waited outside door catelyn summoned servants lysa given spoke sister duel perhaps could change mind thought dressed lysa’s policies varied moods moods changed hourly shy girl known riverrun grown woman turns proud fearful cruel dreamy reckless timid stubborn vain inconstant

 vile turnkey come crawling tell tyrion lannister wished confess catelyn urged lysa dwarf brought privately nothing would sister must make show half vale this…

 “lannister prisoner” told ser rodrik descended tower stairs made way eyrie’s cold white halls catelyn wore plain grey wool silvered belt “my sister must reminded that”

 “there bird riverrun” catelyn began “a letter edmure…”

 “i know child” black fish fastened cloak brynden’s concession ornament “i hear maester colemon asked sister leave take thousand seasoned men ride riverrun haste know told vale cannot spare thousand swords even one uncle said knight gate place here” gust childish laughter drifted open doors behind uncle glanced darkly shoulder “well told could bloody well find new knight gate black fish still tully shall leave riverrun evenfall”

 catelyn could pretend surprise “alone know well never survive high road ser rodrik returning winterfell come us uncle give thousand men riverrun fight alone”

 brynden thought moment nodded brusque agreement “as say it’s long way home i’m like get i’ll wait below” went striding cloak swirling behind

 catelyn exchanged look ser rodrik went doors high nervous sound child’s giggles

 lysa espied catelyn welcomed sisterly embrace moist kiss cheek “isn’t lovely morning gods smiling us try cup wine sweet sister lord hunter kind enough send cellars”

 “thank lysa must talk”

 “after” sister promised already beginning turn away

 “now” catelyn spoke loudly she’d intended men turning look “lysa cannot mean go ahead folly alive imp value dead food crows champion prevail here—”

 “small chance lady” lord hunter assured patting shoulder liverspotted hand “ser vardis doughty fighter make short work sellsword”

 “will lord” catelyn said coolly “i wonder” seen bronn fight high road accident survived journey men died moved like panther ugly sword seemed part arm

 lysa’s suitors gathering around like bees round blossom “women understand little things” ser morton waynwood said “ser vardis knight sweet lady fellow well sort cowards heart useful enough battle thousands fellows around stand alone manhood leaks right them”

 “say truth then” catelyn said courtesy made mouth ache “what gain dwarf’s death imagine jaime care fig gave brother trial flung mountain”

 “behead man” ser lyn corbray suggested “when kingslayer receives imp’s head warning him”

 lysa gave impatient shake waistlong auburn hair “lord robert wants see fly” said settled matter “and imp blame demanded trial combat”

 “lady lysa honorable way deny even she’d wished to” lord hunter intoned ponderously

 ignoring catelyn turned force sister “i remind tyrion lannister prisoner”

 “and remind dwarf murdered lord husband” voice rose “he poisoned hand king left sweet baby fatherless mean see pay” whirling skirts swinging around lysa stalked across terrace ser lyn ser morton suitors excused cool nods trailed

 “do think did” ser rodrik asked quietly alone “murder lord jon imp still denies fiercely…”

 “i believe lannisters murdered lord arryn” catelyn replied “but whether tyrion ser jaime queen together could begin say” lysa named cersei letter sent winterfell seemed certain tyrion killer… perhaps dwarf queen safe behind walls red keep hundreds leagues south catelyn almost wished burned sister’s letter reading

 ser rodrik tugged whiskers “poison well… could dwarf’s work true enough cersei’s it’s said poison woman’s weapon begging pardons lady kingslayer now… great liking man he’s sort fond sight blood golden sword poison lady”

 catelyn frowned vaguely uneasy “how else could make look natural death” behind lord robert shrieked delight one puppet knights sliced half spilling flood red sawdust onto terrace glanced nephew sighed “the boy utterly without discipline never strong enough rule unless taken away mother time”

 “his lord father agreed you” said voice elbow turned behold maester colemon cup wine hand “he planning send boy dragonstone fostering know… oh i’m speaking turn” apple throat bobbed anxiously beneath loose maester’s chain “i fear i’ve much lord hunter’s excellent wine prospect bloodshed nerves afray…”

 “you mistaken maester” catelyn said “it casterly rock dragonstone arrangements made hand’s death without sister’s consent”

 maester’s head jerked vigorously end absurdly long neck looked half puppet “no begging forgiveness lady lord jon who—”

 bell tolled loudly high lords serving girls alike broke moved balustrade two guardsmen skyblue cloaks led forth tyrion lannister eyrie’s plump septon escorted statue center garden weeping woman carved veined white marble doubt meant alyssa

 “the bad little man” lord robert said giggling “mother make fly want see fly”

 “later sweet baby” lysa promised

 “trial first” drawled ser lyn corbray “then execution”

 moment later two champions appeared opposite sides garden knight attended two young squires sellsword eyrie’s masteratarms

 knelt grass beneath weeping woman facing lannister septon removed faceted crystal sphere soft cloth bag waist lifted high head light shattered rainbows danced across imp’s face high solemn singsong voice septon asked gods look bear witness find truth man’s soul grant life freedom innocent death guilty voice echoed surrounding towers

 last echo died away septon lowered crystal made hasty departure tyrion leaned whispered something bronn’s ear guardsmen led away sellsword rose laughing brushed blade grass knee

 robert arryn lord eyrie defender vale fidgeting impatiently elevated chair “when going fight” asked plaintively

 ser vardis helped back feet one squires brought triangular shield almost four feet tall heavy oak dotted iron studs strapped left forearm lysa’s masteratarms offered bronn similar shield sellsword spat waved away three days growth coarse black beard covered jaw cheeks shave want razor edge sword dangerous glimmer steel honed every day hours sharp touch

 ser vardis held gauntleted hand squire placed handsome doubleedged longsword grasp blade engraved delicate silver tracery mountain sky pommel falcon’s head crossguard fashioned shape wings “i sword crafted jon king’s landing” lysa told guests proudly watched ser vardis try practice cut “he wore whenever sat iron throne king robert’s place isn’t lovely thing thought fitting champion avenge jon blade”

 engraved silver blade beautiful beyond doubt seemed catelyn ser vardis might comfortable sword yet said nothing weary futile arguments sister

 “make fight” lord robert called

 ser vardis faced lord eyrie lifted sword salute “for eyrie vale”

 tyrion lannister seated balcony across garden flanked guards bronn turned cursory salute

 “they await command” lady lysa said lord son

 “fight” boy screamed arms trembling clutched chair

 ser vardis swiveled bringing heavy shield bronn turned face swords rang together twice testing sellsword backed step knight came holding shield tried slash bronn jerked back reach silver blade cut air bronn circled right ser vardis turned follow keeping shield knight pressed forward placing foot carefully uneven ground sellsword gave way faint smile playing lips ser vardis attacked slashing bronn leapt away hopping lightly low mosscovered stone sellsword circled left away shield toward knight’s unprotected side ser vardis tried hack legs reach bronn danced farther left ser vardis turned place

 “the man craven” lord hunter declared “stand fight coward” voices echoed sentiment

 catelyn looked ser rodrik masteratarms gave curt shake head “he wants make ser vardis chase weight armor shield tire even strongest man”

 seen men practice swordplay near every day life viewed half hundred tourneys time something different deadlier dance smallest misstep meant death watched memory another duel another time came back catelyn stark vivid yesterday

 met lower bailey riverrun brandon saw petyr wore helm breastplate mail took armor petyr begged favor might wear turned away lord father promised brandon stark gave token pale blue handscarf embroidered leaping trout riverrun pressed hand pleaded “he foolish boy loved like brother would grieve see die” betrothed looked cool grey eyes stark promised spare boy loved

 fight almost soon began brandon man grown drove littlefinger way across bailey water stair raining steel every step boy staggering bleeding dozen wounds “yield” called petyr would shake head fight grimly river lapping ankles brandon finally ended brutal backhand cut bit petyr’s rings leather soft flesh ribs deep catelyn certain wound mortal looked fell murmured “cat” bright blood came flowing mailed fingers thought forgotten

 last time seen face… day brought king’s landing

 fortnight passed littlefinger strong enough leave riverrun lord father forbade visit tower lay abed lysa helped maester nurse softer shyer days edmure called well petyr sent away brother acted brandon’s squire duel littlefinger would forgive soon strong enough moved lord hoster tully sent petyr baelish away closed litter finish healing fingers upon windswept jut rock he’d born

 ringing clash steel steel jarred catelyn back present ser vardis coming hard bronn driving shield sword sellsword scrambled backward checking blow stepping lithely rock root eyes never leaving foe quicker catelyn saw knight’s silvered sword never came near touching ugly grey blade hacked notch ser vardis’s shoulder plate

 brief flurry fighting ended swiftly begun bronn sidestepped slid behind statue weeping woman ser vardis lunged striking spark pale marble alyssa’s thigh

 “they’re fighting good mother” lord eyrie complained “i want fight”

 “they sweet baby” mother soothed “the sellsword can’t run day”

 lords lysa’s terrace making wry jests refilled wine cups across garden tyrion lannister’s mismatched eyes watched champions dance nothing else world

 bronn came behind statue hard fast still moving left aiming twohanded cut knight’s unshielded right side ser vardis blocked clumsily sellsword’s blade flashed upward head metal rang falcon’s wing collapsed crunch ser vardis took half step back brace raised shield oak chips flew bronn’s sword hacked wooden wall sellsword stepped left away shield caught ser vardis across stomach razor edge blade leaving bright gash bit knight’s plate

 ser vardis drove forward back foot silver blade descending savage arc bronn slammed aside danced away knight crashed weeping woman rocking plinth staggered stepped backward head turning way searched foe slit visor helm narrowed vision

 “behind ser” lord hunter shouted late bronn brought sword hands catching ser vardis elbow sword arm thin lobstered metal protected joint crunched knight grunted turning wrenching weapon time bronn stood ground swords flew steel song filled garden rang white towers eyrie

 “ser vardis hurt” ser rodrik said voice grave

 catelyn need told eyes could see bright finger blood running along knight’s forearm wetness inside elbow joint every parry little slower little lower one ser vardis turned side foe trying use shield block instead bronn slid around quick cat sellsword seemed getting stronger cuts leaving marks deep shiny gashes gleamed knight’s armor right thigh beaked visor crossing breastplate long one along front gorget moonandfalcon rondel ser vardis’s right arm sheared clean half hanging strap could hear labored breath rattling air holes visor

 blind arrogance even knights lords vale could see happening yet sister could “enough ser vardis” lady lysa called “finish baby growing tired”

 must said ser vardis egen true lady’s command even last one moment reeling backward halfcrouched behind scarred shield next charged sudden bull rush caught bronn balance ser vardis crashed slammed lip shield sellsword’s face almost almost bronn lost feet… staggered back tripped rock caught hold weeping woman keep balance throwing aside shield ser vardis lurched using hands raise sword right arm blood elbow fingers yet last desperate blow would opened bronn neck navel… sellsword stood receive

 bronn jerked back jon arryn’s beautiful engraved silver sword glanced marble elbow weeping woman snapped clean third way blade bronn put shoulder statue’s back weathered likeness alyssa arryn tottered fell great crash ser vardis egen went beneath

 bronn heartbeat kicking left shattered rondel aside expose weak spot arm breastplate ser vardis lying side pinned beneath broken torso weeping woman catelyn heard knight groan sellsword lifted blade hands drove weight behind arm ribs ser vardis egen shuddered lay still

 silence hung eyrie bronn yanked halfhelm let fall grass lip smashed bloody shield caught coalblack hair soaked sweat spit broken tooth

 “is mother” lord eyrie asked

 catelyn wanted tell it’s beginning

 “yes” lysa said glumly voice cold dead captain guard

 “can make little man fly now”

 across garden tyrion lannister got feet “not little man” said “this little man going turnip hoist thank much”

 “you presume—” lysa began

 “i presume house arryn remembers words” imp said “as high honor”

 “you promised could make fly” lord eyrie screamed mother began shake

 lady lysa’s face flushed fury “the gods seen fit proclaim innocent child choice free him” lifted voice “guards take lord lannister his… creature sight escort bloody gate set free see horses supplies sufficient reach trident make certain goods weapons returned shall need high road”

 “the high road” tyrion lannister said lysa allowed faint satisfied smile another sort death sentence catelyn realized tyrion lannister must know well yet dwarf favored lady arryn mocking bow “as command lady” said “i believe know way”

 jon jammed open boot “i need speak morning late”

 chett scowled “the maester accustomed woken night know old is”

 fire blazing nicely bronn stood tucked flint back pouch tossed tyrion dagger “fair enough” said “my sword’s then… don’t go looking bend knee m’lord every time take shit i’m man’s toady”

 “nor man’s friend” tyrion said “i’ve doubt you’d betray quick lady stark saw profit day ever comes you’re tempted sell remember bronn—i’ll match price whatever like living think could something finding us supper”

 “take care horses” bronn said unsheathing long dirk wore hip strode trees

 hour later horses rubbed fed fire crackling away merrily haunch young goat turning flames spitting hissing “all lack good wine wash kid” tyrion said

 “that woman another dozen swords” bronn said sat crosslegged beside fire honing edge longsword oilstone something strangely reassuring rasping sound made drew steel “it full dark soon” sellsword pointed “i’ll take first watch… good us might kinder let kill us sleep”

 “oh imagine they’ll long comes sleep” smell roasting meat made tyrion’s mouth water

 bronn watched across fire “you plan” said flatly scrape steel stone

 “a hope call it” tyrion said “another toss dice”

 “with lives stake”

 tyrion shrugged “what choice have” leaned fire sawed thin slice meat kid “ahhhh” sighed happily chewed grease ran chin “a bit tougher i’d like want spicing i’ll complain loudly back eyrie i’d dancing precipice hopes boiled bean”

 “and yet gave turnkey purse gold” bronn said

 “a lannister always pays debts”

 even mord scarcely believed tyrion tossed leather purse gaoler’s eyes gone big boiled eggs yanked open drawstring beheld glint gold “i kept silver” tyrion told crooked smile “but promised gold is” man like mord could hope earn lifetime abusing prisoners “and remember said taste ever grow tired lady arryn’s service present casterly rock i’ll pay rest owe you” golden dragons spilling hands mord fallen knees promised would

 bronn yanked dirk pulled meat fire began carve thick chunks charred meat bone tyrion hollowed two heels stale bread serve trenchers “if reach river then” sellsword asked cut

 “if i’d fear trap” bronn said “why else would open lure in”

 tyrion chuckled “then ought sing send fleeing terror” began whistle tune

 “you’re mad dwarf” bronn said cleaned grease nails dirk

 “where’s love music bronn”

 “if music wanted gotten singer champion you”

 tyrion grinned “that would amusing see fending ser vardis woodharp” resumed whistling “do know song” asked

 “you hear inns whorehouses”

 “myrish ‘the seasons love’ sweet sad understand words first girl ever bedded used sing i’ve never able put head” tyrion gazed sky clear cold night stars shone upon mountains bright merciless truth “i met night like this” heard saying “jaime riding back lannisport heard scream came running road two men dogging heels shouting threats brother unsheathed sword went dismounted protect girl scarcely year older darkhaired slender face would break heart certainly broke mine lowborn halfstarved unwashed… yet lovely they’d torn rags wearing half back wrapped cloak jaime chased men woods time came trotting back i’d gotten name story crofter’s child orphaned father died fever way to… well nowhere really

 “she hungrier would believed finished two whole chickens part third drank flagon wine talking thirteen wine went head fear next thing knew sharing bed shy shyer i’ll never know found courage broke maidenhead wept afterward kissed sang little song morning love”

 “you” bronn’s voice amused

 “absurd isn’t it” tyrion began whistle song “i married her” finally admitted

 “a lannister casterly rock wed crofter’s daughter” bronn said “how manage that”

 “oh you’d astonished boy make lies fifty pieces silver drunken septon dared bring bride home casterly rock set cottage fortnight played man wife septon sobered confessed lord father” tyrion surprised desolate made feel say even years perhaps tired “that end marriage” sat stared dying fire blinking light

 “he sent girl away”

 “he better that” tyrion said “first made brother tell truth girl whore see jaime arranged whole affair road outlaws thought time woman paid double maiden knowing would first time

 “after jaime made confession drive home lesson lord tywin brought wife gave guards paid fair enough silver man many whores command high price sat corner barracks bade watch end many silvers coins slipping fingers rolling floor she…” smoke stinging eyes tyrion cleared throat turned away fire gaze darkness “lord tywin go last” said quiet voice “and gave gold coin pay lannister worth more”

 time heard noise rasp steel stone bronn sharpened sword “thirteen thirty three would killed man me”

 tyrion swung around face “you may get chance one day remember told lannister always pays debts” yawned “i think try sleep wake we’re die”

 rolled shadowskin shut eyes ground stony cold time tyrion lannister sleep dreamt sky cell time gaoler prisoner big strap hand hitting father driving back toward abyss…

 tyrion awake blink eye fire burned embers shadows creeping around bronn raised one knee sword one hand dirk tyrion held hand stay still said “come share fire night cold” called creeping shadows “i fear we’ve wine offer you’re welcome goat”

 movement stopped tyrion saw glint moonlight metal “our mountain” voice called trees deep hard unfriendly “our goat”

 “your goat” tyrion agreed “who you”

 “when meet gods” different voice replied “say gunthor son gurn stone crows sent them” branch cracked underfoot stepped light thin man horned helmet armed long knife

 “and shagga son dolf” first voice deep deadly boulder shifted left stood became man massive slow strong seemed dressed skins club right hand axe left smashed together lumbered closer

 voices called names conn torrek jaggot tyrion forgot instant heard ten least swords knives others brandished pitchforks scythes wooden spears waited done shouting names gave answer “i tyrion son tywin clan lannister lions rock gladly pay goat ate”

 “what give us tyrion son tywin” asked one named gunthor seemed chief

 “there silver purse” tyrion told “this hauberk wear large fit conn nicely battleaxe carry would suit shagga’s mighty hand far better woodaxe holds”

 “the halfman would pay us coin” said conn

 “conn speaks truly” gunthor said “your silver horses hauberk battleaxe knife belt nothing give us lives would like die tyrion son tywin”

 “in bed belly full wine maiden’s mouth around cock age eighty” replied

 huge one shagga laughed first loudest others seemed less amused “conn take horses” gunthor commanded “kill seize halfinan milk goats make mothers laugh”

 bronn sprang feet “who dies first”

 “no” tyrion said sharply “gunthor son gurn hear house rich powerful stone crows see us safely mountains lord father shower gold”

 “the gold lowland lord worthless halfman’s promises” gunthor said

 “half man may be” tyrion said “yet courage face enemies stone crows hide behind rocks shiver fear knights vale ride by”

 shagga gave roar anger clashed club axe jaggot poked tyrion’s face firehardened point long wooden spear best flinch “are best weapons could steal” said “good enough killing sheep perhaps… sheep fight back father’s smiths shit better steel”

 “little boyman” shagga roared “will mock axe chop manhood feed goats”

 gunthor raised hand “no would hear words mothers go hungry steel fills mouths gold would give us lives tyrion son tywin swords lances mail”

 “ser loras young” said ned “i daresay outgrow disappointment”

 “and ser ilyn” eunuch stroked plump powdered cheek “he king’s justice sending men office… might construe grave insult”

 “no slight intended” truth ned trust mute knight though perhaps misliked executioners “i remind paynes bannermen house lannister thought best choose men owed lord tywin fealty”

 “very prudent doubt” varys said “still chanced see ser ilyn back hall staring us pale eyes must say look pleased though sure hard tell silent knight hope outgrows disappointment well love work…”





 sansa

 “he wouldn’t send ser loras” sansa told jeyne poole night shared cold supper lamplight “i think leg”

 lord eddard taken supper bedchamber alyn harwin vayon poole better rest broken leg septa mordane complained sore feet standing gallery day arya supposed join late coming back dancing lesson

 “his leg” jeyne said uncertainly pretty darkhaired girl sansa’s age “did ser loras hurt leg”

 “not leg” sansa said nibbling delicately chicken leg “father’s leg silly hurts ever much makes cross otherwise i’m certain would sent ser loras”

 father’s decision still bewildered knight flowers spoken she’d sure see one old nan’s stories come life ser gregor monster ser loras true hero would slay even looked true hero slim beautiful golden roses around slender waist rich brown hair tumbling eyes father refused upset could tell said much septa mordane descended stairs gallery septa told place question lord father’s decisions

 lord baelish said “oh don’t know septa lord father’s decisions could bit questioning young lady wise lovely” made sweeping bow sansa deep quite sure complimented mocked

 septa mordane upset realize lord baelish overheard “the girl talking lord” she’d said “foolish chatter meant nothing comment”

 lord baelish stroked little pointed beard said “nothing tell child would sent ser loras”

 sansa choice explain heroes monsters king’s councillor smiled “well reasons i’d given but…” touched cheek thumb lightly tracing line cheekbone “life song sweetling may learn one day sorrow”

 sansa feel like telling jeyne however made uneasy think back

 “ser ilyn’s king’s justice ser loras” jcyne said “lord eddard sent him”

 sansa shuddered every time looked ser ilyn payne shivered made feel though something dead slithering naked skin “ser ilyn’s almost like second monster i’m glad father didn’t pick him”

 “lord beric much hero ser loras he’s ever brave gallant”

 “i suppose” sansa said doubtfully beric dondarrion handsome enough awfully old almost twentytwo knight flowers would much better course jeyne love lord beric ever since first glimpsed lists sansa thought silly jeyne steward’s daughter matter much mooned lord beric would never look someone far beneath even hadn’t half age

 would unkind say however sansa took sip milk changed subject “i dream joffrey would one take white hart” said wish actually sounded better call dream everyone knew dreams prophetic white harts supposed rare magical heart knew gallant prince worthier drunken father

 “a dream truly prince joffrey go touch bare hand harm”

 “no” sansa said “he shot golden arrow brought back me” songs knights never killed magical beasts went touched harm knew joffrey liked hunting especially killing part animals though sansa certain prince part murdering jory poor men wicked uncle kingslayer knew father still angry wasn’t fair blame joff would like blaming something arya done

 “i saw sister afternoon” jeyne blurted she’d reading sansa’s thoughts “she walking stables hands would thing like that”

 “i’m sure don’t know arya anything” sansa hated stables smelly places full manure flies even went riding liked boy saddle horse bring yard “do want hear court not”

 “i do” jeyne said

 “there black brother” sansa said “begging men wall kind old smelly” hadn’t liked always imagined night’s watch men like uncle benjen songs called black knights wall man crookbacked hideous looked though might lice night’s watch truly like felt sorry bastard half brother jon “father asked knights hall would honor houses taking black one came forward gave yoren pick king’s dungeons sent way later two brothers came freeriders dornish marches pledged swords service king father accepted oaths…”

 jeyne yawned “are lemon cakes”

 sansa like interrupted admit lemon cakes sounded interesting gone throne room “let’s see” said

 kitchen yielded lemon cakes find half cold strawberry pie almost good ate tower steps giggling gossiping sharing secrets sansa went bed night feeling almost wicked arya

 next morning woke first light crept sleepily window watch lord beric form men rode dawn breaking city three banners going crowned stag king flew high staff direwolf stark lord beric’s forked lightning standard shorter poles exciting song come life clatter swords flicker torchlight banners dancing wind horses snorting whinnying golden glow sunrise slanting bars portcullis jerked upward winterfell men looked especially fine silvery mail long grey cloaks

 alyn carried stark banner saw rein beside lord beric exchange words made sansa feel ever proud alyn handsomer jory going knight one day

 tower hand seemed empty left sansa even pleased see arya went break fast “where everyone” sister wanted know ripped skin blood orange “did father send hunt jaime lannister”

 sansa sighed “they rode lord beric behead ser gregor clegane” turned septa mordane eating porridge wooden spoon “septa lord beric spike ser gregor’s head gate bring back king” jeyne poole arguing last night

 septa horrorstruck “a lady discuss things porridge courtesies sansa swear late you’ve near bad sister”

 “what gregor do” arya asked

 “he burned holdfast murdered lot people women children too”

 arya screwed face scowl “jaime lannister murdered jory heward wyl hound murdered mycah somebody beheaded them”

 “it’s same” sansa said “the hound joffrey’s sworn shield butcher’s boy attacked prince”

 “liar” arya said hand clenched blood orange hard red juice oozed fingers

 warm blood filled mouth ran chin taste threatened gag made chew swallow heart stallion would make son strong swift fearless dothraki believed mother could eat choked blood retched flesh omens less favorable child might stillborn come forth weak deformed female

 handmaids helped ready ceremony despite tender mother’s stomach afflicted past two moons dany dined bowls halfclotted blood accustom taste irri made chew strips dried horseflesh jaws aching starved day night ceremony hopes hunger would help keep raw meat

 wild stallion’s heart muscle dany worry teeth chew mouthful long time steel permitted within sacred confines vaes dothrak beneath shadow mother mountains rip heart apart teeth nails stomach roiled heaved yet kept face smeared heartsblood sometimes seemed explode lips

 smoke ascended chanting died away ancient crone closed single eye better peer future silence fell complete dany could hear distant call night birds hiss crackle torches gentle lapping water lake dothraki stared eyes night waiting

 khal drogo laid hand dany’s arm could feel tension fingers even khal mighty drogo could know fear dosh khaleen peered smoke future back handmaids fluttered anxiously

 finally crone opened eye lifted arms “i seen face heard thunder hooves” proclaimed thin wavery voice

 “the thunder hooves” others chorused

 “as swift wind rides behind khalasar covers earth men without number arakhs shining hands like blades razor grass fierce storm prince enemies tremble wives weep tears blood rend flesh grief bells hair sing coming milk men stone tents fear name” old woman trembled looked dany almost afraid “the prince riding shall stallion mounts world”

 “what meaning name rhaego” khal drogo asked walked using common tongue seven kingdoms teaching words could drogo quick learn put mind though accent thick barbarous neither ser jorah viserys could understand word said

 “my brother rhaegar fierce warrior sunandstars” told “he died born ser jorah says last dragons”

 khal drogo looked face copper mask yet long black mustache drooping beneath weight gold rings thought glimpsed shadow smile “is good name dan ares wife moon life” said

 sounds drums horns swirled night halfclothed women spun danced low tables amid joints meat platters piled high plums dates pomegranates many men drunk clotted mare’s milk yet dany knew arakhs would clash tonight sacred city blades bloodshed forbidden

 khal drogo dismounted took place high bench khal jommo khal ogo vaes dothrak khalasars arrived given seats high honor drogo’s right left bloodriders three khals sat farther khal jommo’s four wives

 dany climbed silver gave reins one slaves doreah irri arranged cushions searched brother even across length crowded hall viserys conspicuous pale skin silvery hair beggar’s rags see anywhere

 patted stuffed horsehide cushion beside “sit talk me”

 “you honor me” knight seated crosslegged cushion slave knelt offering wooden platter full ripe figs ser jorah took one bit half

 “where brother” dany asked “he ought come feast”

 “i saw grace morning” told “he told going western market search wine”

 “wine” dany said doubtfully viserys could abide taste fermented mare’s milk dothraki drank knew oft bazaars days drinking traders came great caravans east west seemed find company congenial

 “wine” ser jorah confirmed “and thought recruit men army sellswords guard caravans” serving girl laid blood pie front attacked hands

 “is wise” asked “he gold pay soldiers he’s betrayed” caravan guards seldom troubled much thoughts honor usurper king’s landing would pay well brother’s head “you ought gone keep safe sworn sword”

 “we vaes dothrak” reminded “no one may carry blade shed man’s blood”

 “yet men die” said “jhogo told traders eunuchs huge men strangle thieves wisps silk way blood shed gods angered”

 “then let us hope brother wise enough steal anything” ser jorah wiped grease mouth back hand leaned close table “he planned take dragon’s eggs warned i’d cut hand much touched them”

 moment dany shocked words “my eggs… they’re mine magister illyrio gave bride gift would viserys want… they’re stones…”

 “the could said rubies diamonds fire opals princess… dragon’s eggs rarer far traders he’s drinking would sell manhoods even one stones three viserys could buy many sellswords might need”

 dany known even suspected “then… need steal ask brother… true king”

 “he brother” ser jorah acknowledged

 “you understand ser” said “my mother died giving birth father brother rhaegar even would never known much names viserys tell one left one have”

 “once” said ser jorah “no longer khaleesi belong dothraki womb rides stallion mounts world” held cup slave filled fermented mare’s milk soursmelling thick clots

 dany waved away even smell made feel ill would take chances bringing horse heart forced eat “what mean” asked “what stallion everyone shouting don’t understand”

 “the stallion khal khals promised ancient prophecy child unite dothraki single khalasar ride ends earth promised people world herd”

 “oh” dany said small voice hand smoothed robe swell stomach “i named rhaego”

 “a name make usurper’s blood run cold”

 suddenly doreah tugging elbow “my lady” handmaid whispered urgently “your brother…”

 dany looked length long roofless hall striding toward lurch step could tell viserys found wine… something passed courage

 wearing scarlet silks soiled travelstained cloak gloves black velvet faded sun boots dry cracked silverblond hair matted tangled longsword swung belt leather scabbard dothraki eyed sword passed dany heard curses threats angry muttering rising around like tide music died away nervous stammering drums

 sense dread closed around heart “go him” commanded ser jorah “stop bring tell dragon’s eggs wants” knight rose swiftly feet

 “where sister” viserys shouted voice thick wine “i’ve come feast dare presume eat without one eats king whore can’t hide dragon”

 stopped beside largest three firepits peering around faces dothraki five thousand men hall handful knew common tongue yet even words incomprehensible look know drunk

 ser jorah went swiftly whispered something ear took arm viserys wrenched free “keep hands one touches dragon without leave”

 dany glanced anxiously high bench khal drogo saying something khals beside khal jommo grinned khal ogo began guffaw loudly

 sound laughter made viserys lift eyes “khal drogo” said thickly voice almost polite “i’m feast” staggered away ser jorah making join three khals high bench

 khal drogo rose spat dozen words dothraki faster dany could understand pointed “khal drogo says place high bench” ser jorah translated brother “khal drogo says place there”

 viserys glanced khal pointing back long hall corner wall deep shadow better men would need look sat lowest low raw unblooded boys old men clouded eyes stiff joints dimwitted maimed far meat farther honor “that place king” brother declared

 “is place” khal drogo answered common tongue dany taught “for sorefoot king” clapped hands together “a cart bring cart khal rhaggat”

 five thousand dothraki began laugh shout ser jorah standing beside viserys screaming ear roar hall thunderous dany could hear saying brother shouted back two men grappled mormont knocked viserys bodily floor

 brother drew sword

 bared steel shone fearful red glare firepits “keep away me” viserys hissed ser jorah backed step brother climbed unsteadily feet waved sword head borrowed blade magister illyrio given make seem kingly dothraki shrieking sides screaming vile curses

 dany gave wordless cry terror knew drawn sword meant even brother

 voice made viserys turn head saw first time “there is” said smiling stalked toward slashing air cut path wall enemies though one tried bar way

 “the blade… must not” begged “please viserys forbidden put sword come share cushions there’s drink food… dragon’s eggs want throw away sword”

 “do tells fool” ser jorah shouted “before get us killed”

 viserys laughed “they can’t kill us can’t shed blood sacred city… can” laid point sword daenerys’s breasts slid downward curve belly “i want came for” told “i want crown promised bought never paid tell want bargained i’m taking back eggs keep bloody foal i’ll cut bastard leave him” sword point pushed silks pricked navel viserys weeping saw weeping laughing time man brother

 distantly far away dany heard handmaid jhiqui sobbing fear pleading dared translate khal would bind drag behind horse way mother mountains put arm around girl “don’t afraid” said “i shall tell him”

 know enough words yet done khal drogo spoke brusque sentences dothraki knew understood sun life stepped high bench “what say” man brother asked flinching

 grown silent hall could hear bells khal drogo’s hair chiming softly step took bloodriders followed like three copper shadows daenerys gone cold “he says shall splendid golden crown men shall tremble behold”

 viserys smiled lowered sword saddest thing thing tore afterward… way smiled “that wanted” said “what promised”

 sun life reached dany slid arm around waist khal said word bloodriders leapt forward qotho seized man brother arms haggo shattered wrist single sharp twist huge hands cohollo pulled sword limp fingers even viserys understand “no” shouted “you cannot touch dragon dragon crowned”

 khal drogo unfastened belt medallions pure gold massive ornate one large man’s hand shouted command cook slaves pulled heavy iron stew pot firepit dumped stew onto ground returned pot flames drogo tossed belt watched without expression medallions turned red began lose shape could see fires dancing onyx eyes slave handed pair thick horsehair mittens pulled never much looking man

 viserys began scream high wordless scream coward facing death kicked twisted whimpered like dog wept like child dothraki held tight ser jorah made way dany’s side put hand shoulder “turn away princess beg you”

 “no” folded arms across swell belly protectively

 last viserys looked “sister please… dany tell them… make them… sweet sister…”

 gold halfmelted starting run drogo reached flames snatched pot “crown” roared “here crown cart king” upended pot head man brother

 sound viserys targaryen made hideous iron helmet covered face like nothing human feet hammered frantic beat dirt floor slowed stopped thick globs molten gold dripped onto chest setting scarlet silk smoldering… yet drop blood spilled

 dragon dany thought curiously calm fire cannot kill dragon

 robert knocked cup away back hand “away i’ll sleep soon enough old fool get out”

 grand maester pycelle gave ned stricken look shuffled room

 “damn robert” ned said alone leg throbbing badly almost blind pain perhaps grief fogged eyes lowered bed beside friend “why always headstrong”

 “ah fuck ned” king said hoarsely “i killed bastard didn’t i” lock matted black hair fell across eyes glared ned “ought can’t leave man hunt peace ser robar found gregor’s head ugly thought never told hound let cersei surprise him” laugh turned grunt spasm pain hit “gods mercy” muttered swallowing agony “the girl daenerys child right… that’s girl… gods sent boar… sent punish me…” king coughed bringing blood “wrong wrong i… girl… varys littlefinger even brother… worthless… one tell ned… you…” lifted hand gesture pained feeble “paper ink table write tell you”

 ned smoothed paper across knee took quill “at command grace”

 “this word robert house baratheon first name king andals rest—put damn titles know goes hereby command eddard house stark lord winterfell hand king serve lord regent protector realm upon my… upon death… rule my… stead son joffrey come age…”

 “robert…” joffrey son wanted say words would come agony written plainly across robert’s face could hurt ned bent head wrote king said “my son joffrey” scrawled “my heir” instead deceit made feel soiled lies tell love thought may gods forgive “what else would say”

 “say… whatever need protect defend gods old new words write i’ll sign give council i’m dead”

 “yes grace” ned offered robert paper king scrawled signature blindly leaving smear blood across letter “the seal witnessed”

 “serve boar funeral feast” robert rasped “apple mouth skin seared crisp eat bastard don’t care choke promise ned”

 “i promise” promise ned lyanna’s voice echoed

 “the girl” king said “daenerys let live it… late… talk them… varys littlefinger… don’t let kill help son ned make be… better me” winced “gods mercy”

 “they friend” ned said “they will”

 king closed eyes seemed relax “killed pig” muttered “ought laugh hurts much”

 ned laughing “shall call back”

 robert gave weak nod “as gods cold here”

 servants rushed back hurried feed fires queen gone small relief least sense cersei would take children fly break day ned thought lingered long already

 king robert seem miss bid brother renly grand maester pycelle stand witness pressed seal hot yellow wax ned dripped upon letter “now give something pain let die”

 hurriedly grand maester pycelle mixed another draught milk poppy time king drank deeply black beard beaded thick white droplets threw empty cup aside “will dream”

 ned gave answer “you lord”

 “good” said smiling “i give lyanna love ned take care children me”

 words twisted ned’s belly like knife moment loss could bring lie remembered bastards little barra mother’s breast mya vale gendry forge others “i shall… guard children own” said slowly

 robert nodded closed eyes ned watched old friend sag softly pillows milk poppy washed pain face sleep took

 heavy chains jangled softly grand maester pycelle came ned “i power lord wound mortified took two days get back time saw late lessen grace’s suffering gods heal now”

 “how long” ned asked

 “by rights dead already never seen man cling life fiercely”

 “my brother always strong” lord renly said “not wise perhaps strong” sweltering heat bedchamber brow slick sweat might robert’s ghost stood young dark handsome “he slew boar entrails sliding belly yet somehow slew boar” voice full wonder

 “robert never man leave battleground long foe remained standing” ned told

 outside door ser barristan selmy still guarded tower stairs “maester pycelle given robert milk poppy” ned told “see one disturbs rest without leave me”

 “it shall command lord” ser barristan seemed old beyond years “i failed sacred trust”

 “even truest knight cannot protect king himself” ned said “robert loved hunt boar seen take thousand them” would stand ground without flinching legs braced great spear hands often would curse boar charged wait last possible second almost killed single sure savage thrust “no one could know one would death”

 “you kind say lord eddard”

 “the king said much blamed wine”

 whitehaired knight gave weary nod “his grace reeling saddle time flushed boar lair yet commanded us stand aside”

 “i wonder ser barristan” asked varys quietly “who gave king wine”

 ned heard eunuch approach looked around stood wore black velvet robe brushed floor face freshly powdered

 “the wine king’s skin” ser barristan said

 “only one skin hunting thirsty work”

 “i keep count one certainty squire would fetch fresh skin whenever required it”

 “such dutiful boy” said varys “to make certain grace lack refreshment”

 ned bitter taste mouth recalled two fairhaired boys robert sent chasing breastplate stretcher king told everyone tale night feast laughing shook “which squire”

 “the elder” said ser barristan “lancel”

 “i know lad well” said varys “a stalwart boy ser kevan lannister’s son nephew lord tywin cousin queen hope dear sweet lad blame children vulnerable innocence youth well remember”

 certainly varys young ned doubted ever innocent “you mention children robert change heart concerning daenerys targaryen whatever arrangements made want unmade once”

 “alas” said varys “at may late fear birds flown shall lord leave” bowed vanished steps softsoled slippers whispering stone made descent

 cayn tomard helping ned across bridge lord renly emerged maegor’s holdfast “lord eddard” called ned “a moment would kind”

 ned stopped “as wish”

 renly walked side “send men away” met center bridge dry moat beneath moonlight silvered cruel edges spikes lined bed

 ned gestured tomard cayn bowed heads backed away respectfully lord renly glanced warily ser boros far end span ser preston doorway behind “that letter” leaned close “was regency brother named protector” wait reply “my lord thirty men personal guard friends beside knights lords give hour put hundred swords hand”

 “and hundred swords lord”

 “strike castle sleeps” renly looked back ser boros dropped voice urgent whisper “we must get joffrey away mother take hand protector man holds king holds kingdom seize myrcella tommen well children cersei dare oppose us council confirm lord protector make joffrey ward”

 ned regarded coldly “robert dead yet gods may spare shall convene council hear final words consider matter succession dishonor last hours earth shedding blood halls dragging frightened children beds”

 lord renly took step back taut bowstring “every moment delay gives cersei another moment prepare time robert dies may late… us”

 “then pray robert die”

 “small chance that” said renly

 “sometimes gods merciful”

 “the lannisters not” lord renly turned away went back across moat tower brother lay dying

 time ned returned chambers felt weary heartsick yet question going back sleep play game thrones win die cersei lannister told godswood found wondering done right thing refusing lord renly’s offer taste intrigues honor threatening children yet… cersei elected fight rather flee might well need renly’s hundred swords besides

 “i want littlefinger” told cayn “if he’s chambers take many men need search every winesink whorehouse king’s landing find bring break day” cayn bowed took leave ned turned tomard “the wind witch sails evening tide chosen escort”

 “ten men porther command”

 “twenty command” ned said porther brave man headstrong wanted someone solid sensible keep watch daughters

 “as wish m’lord” tom said “can’t say i’ll sad see back place miss wife”

 “you pass near dragonstone turn north need deliver letter me”

 tom looked apprehensive “to dragonstone m’lord” island fortress house targaryen sinister repute

 “tell captain qos hoist banner soon comes sight island may wary unexpected visitors reluctant offer whatever takes give letter place hand lord stannis baratheon one else steward captain guard lady wife lord stannis himself”

 “as command m’lord”

 tomard left lord eddard stark sat staring flame candle burned beside table moment grief overwhelmed wanted nothing much seek godswood kneel heart tree pray life robert baratheon brother men would whisper afterward eddard stark betrayed king’s friendship disinherited sons could hope gods would know better robert would learn truth land beyond grave

 ned took king’s last letter roll crisp white parchment sealed golden wax short words smear blood small difference victory defeat life death

 drew fresh sheet paper dipped quill inkpot grace stannis house baratheon wrote time receive letter brother robert king past fifteen years dead savaged boar whilst hunting kingswood…

 letters seemed writhe twist paper hand trailed stop lord tywin ser jaime men suffer disgrace meekly would fight rather flee doubt lord stannis wary murder jon arryn imperative sail king’s landing power lannisters could march

 ned chose word care done signed letter eddard stark lord winterfell hand king protector realm blotted paper folded twice melted sealing wax candle flame

 ned scowled “the king lies wounded near death”

 “i know” littlefinger said “i also know robert named protector realm”

 ned’s eyes flicked king’s letter table beside seal unbroken “and know lord”

 “varys hinted much” littlefinger said “and confirmed it”

 ned’s mouth twisted anger “damn varys little birds catelyn spoke truly man black art trust him”

 “excellent you’re learning” littlefinger leaned forward “yet i’ll wager drag black night discuss eunuch”

 “no” ned admitted “i know secret jon arryn murdered protect robert leave trueborn son behind joffrey tommen jaime lannister’s bastards born incestuous union queen”

 littlefinger lifted eyebrow “shocking” said tone suggested shocked “the girl well doubt king dies…”

 “the throne rights passes lord stannis elder robert’s two brothers”

 lord petyr stroked pointed beard considered matter “so would seem unless…”

 “unless lord seeming stannis heir nothing change that”

 “stannis cannot take throne without help you’re wise you’ll make certain joffrey succeeds”

 ned gave stony stare “have shred honor”

 “oh shred surely” littlefinger replied negligently “hear stannis friend mine even brothers scarcely stomach man iron hard unyielding he’ll give us new hand new council certainty doubt he’ll thank handing crown won’t love ascent mean war stannis cannot rest easy throne cersei bastards dead think lord tywin sit idly daughter’s head measured spike casterly rock rise alone robert found pardon men served king aerys long fealty stannis less forgiving forgotten siege storm’s end lords tyrell redwyne dare every man fought beneath dragon banner rose balon greyjoy good cause fear seat stannis iron throne promise realm bleed

 “we” ned repeated

 littlefinger gave shrug “you’ll need someone share burdens assure price would modest”

 “only lose”

 “you forget” ned told “you forget jon arryn forget jory cassel forget this” drew dagger laid table length dragonbone valyrian steel sharp difference right wrong true false life death “they sent man cut son’s throat lord baelish”

 littlefinger sighed “i fear forget lord pray forgive moment remember talking stark” mouth quirked “so stannis war”

 “it choice stannis heir”

 “far dispute lord protector would wisdom certainty”

 “i shall best forget your… wisdom” ned said distaste “i called ask help promised catelyn perilous hour us robert named protector true enough eyes world joffrey still son heir queen dozen knights hundred menatarms whatever commands… enough overwhelm remains household guard know brother jaime may riding king’s landing even speak lannister host back”

 “and without army” littlefinger toyed dagger table turning slowly finger “there small love lost lord renly lannisters bronze yohn royce ser balon swann ser loras lady tanda redwyne twins… retinue knights sworn swords court”

 “renly thirty men personal guard rest even fewer enough even could certain choose give allegiance must gold cloaks city watch two thousand strong sworn defend castle city king’s peace”

 “ah queen proclaims one king hand another whose peace protect” lord petyr flicked dagger finger setting spinning place round round went wobbling turned last slowed stop blade pointed littlefinger “why there’s answer” said smiling “they follow man pays them” leaned back looked ned full face greygreen eyes bright mockery “you wear honor like suit armor stark think keeps safe weigh make hard move look know summoned know want ask know done… it’s honorable words stick throat”

 “i would so” grenn insisted “i’d see long way off”

 mormont confirmed grenn’s doubts “castle black need godswood beyond wall haunted forest stands stood dawn age long andals brought seven across narrow sea find grove weirwoods half league spot mayhap gods well”

 “my lord” voice made jon glance back surprise samwell tarly feet fat boy wiped sweaty palms tunic “might i… might go well say words heart tree”

 “does house tarly keep old gods too” mormont asked

 “no lord” sam replied thin nervous voice high officers frightened jon knew old bear “i named light seven sept horn hill father father tarlys thousand years”

 “why would forsake gods father house” wondered ser jaremy rykker

 “the night’s watch house now” sam said “the seven never answered prayers perhaps old gods will”

 “as wish boy” mormont said sam took seat jon “we placed order befits need strengths skills” bowen marsh stepped forward handed paper lord commander unrolled began read “haider builders” began haider gave stiff nod approval “grenn rangers albett builders pypar rangers” pyp looked jon wiggled ears “samwell stewards” sam sagged relief mopping brow witha scrap silk “matthar rangers dareon stewards todder rangers jon stewards”

 marsh turned smile jon “lord commander mormont requested personal steward jon you’ll sleep cell beneath chambers lord commander’s tower”

 “and duties be” jon asked sharply “will serve lord commander’s meals help fasten clothes fetch hot water bath”

 “certainly” marsh frowned jon’s tone “and run messages keep fire burning chambers change sheets blankets daily else lord commander might require you”

 “do take servant”

 “no” maester aemon said back sept clydas helped stand “we took man night’s watch… perhaps wrong that”

 jon could stop walking supposed churn butter sew doublets like girl rest days “may go” asked stiffly

 “as wish” bowen marsh responded

 dareon sam left descended yard silence outside jon looked wall shining sun melting ice creeping side hundred thin fingers jon’s rage would smashed instant world damned

 “there shame steward” sam said

 “do think want spend rest life washing old man’s smallclothes”

 “the old man lord commander night’s watch” sam reminded “you’ll day night yes you’ll pour wine see bed linen fresh you’ll also take letters attend meetings squire battle you’ll close shadow you’ll know everything part everything… lord steward said mormont asked

 jon taken aback true lord eddard often made robb part councils back winterfell could sam right even bastard could rise high night’s watch said “i never asked this” said stubbornly

 “none us asking” sam reminded

 suddenly jon snow ashamed

 craven samwell tarly found courage accept fate like man wall man gets earns benjen stark said last night jon seen alive you’re ranger jon green boy smell summer still he’d heard said bastards grow faster children wall grew died

 jon let deep sigh “you right acting boy”

 “then you’ll stay say words me”

 “they never have” jon climbed saddle bowen marsh ranger escort mounted jon put two fingers mouth whistled ghost came loping tunnel

 lord steward’s garron whickered backed away direwolf “do mean take beast”

 “yes lord” jon said ghost’s head lifted seemed taste air blink eye racing across broad weedchoked field vanish trees

 entered forest different world jon often hunted father jory brother robb knew wolfswood around winterfell well man haunted forest much yet feel different

 perhaps knowing ridden past end world somehow changed everything every shadow seemed darker every sound ominous trees pressed close shut light setting sun thin crust snow cracked beneath hooves horses sound like breaking bones wind set leaves rustling like chilly finger tracing path jon’s spine wall backs gods knew lay ahead

 sun sinking trees reached destination small clearing deep wood nine weirwoods grew rough circle jon drew breath saw sam tarly staring even wolfswood never found two three white trees growing together grove nine unheard forest floor carpeted fallen leaves bloodred top black rot beneath wide smooth trunks bone pale nine faces stared inward dried sap crusted eyes red hard ruby bowen marsh commanded leave horses outside circle “this sacred place defile it”

 entered grove samwell tarly turned slowly looking face turn two quite alike “they’re watching us” whispered “the old gods”

 “yes” jon knelt sam knelt beside

 said words together last light faded west grey day became black night

 “hear words bear witness vow” recited voices filling twilit grove “night gathers watch begins shall end death shall take wife hold lands father children shall wear crowns win glory shall live die post sword darkness watcher walls fire burns cold light brings dawn horn wakes sleepers shield guards realms men pledge life honor night’s watch night nights come”

 suddenly ghost back stalking softly two weirwoods white fur red eyes jon realized disquieted like trees…

 wolf something jaws something black “what’s got there” asked bowen marsh frowning

 “to ghost” jon knelt “bring here”

 direwolf trotted jon heard samwell tarly’s sharp intake breath

 “gods good” dywen muttered “that’s hand”

 look eyes said saw knight pale armor head foot legs throat hands sheathed metal eyes hidden behind high white helm hand cruel steel syrio leather vest wooden sword hand “syrio run” screamed

 “the first sword braavos run” sang ser meryn slashed syrio danced away cut stick blur heartbeat bounced blows knight’s temple elbow throat wood ringing metal helm gauntlet gorget arya stood frozen ser meryn advanced syrio backed away checked next blow spun away second deflected third

 fourth sliced stick two splintering wood shearing lead core

 sobbing arya spun ran

 syrio forel taught went racing head swift deer quiet shadow fear cuts deeper swords quick snake calm still water fear cuts deeper swords strong bear fierce wolverine fear cuts deeper swords man fears losing already lost fear cuts deeper swords fear cuts deeper swords fear cuts deeper swords grip wooden sword slick sweat arya breathing hard reached turret stair instant froze would take covered bridge spanned small court tower hand would way they’d expect go certain never expect syrio said arya went around around leaping narrow stone steps two three time emerged cavernous vaulted cellar surrounded casks ale stacked twenty feet tall light came narrow slanting windows high wall

 cellar dead end way way come dare go back steps couldn’t stay either find father tell happened father would protect

 arya thrust wooden sword belt began climb leaping cask cask could reach window grasping stone hands pulled wall three feet thick window tunnel slanting arya wriggled toward daylight head reached ground level peered across bailey tower hand

 stout wooden door hung splintered broken axes dead man sprawled facedown steps cloak tangled beneath back mailed shirt soaked red corpse’s cloak grey wool trimmed white satin saw sudden terror could tell

 “no” whispered happening father red cloaks come remembered man yellow beard said day found monsters one hand die second arya felt tears eyes held breath listen heard sounds fighting shouts screams clang steel steel coming windows tower hand

 could go back father…

 arya closed eyes moment frightened move killed jory wyl heward guardsman step whoever could kill father caught “fear cuts deeper swords” said aloud good pretending water dancer syrio water dancer white knight probably killed anyhow little girl wooden stick alone afraid

 squirmed yard glancing around warily climbed feet castle seemed deserted red keep never deserted people must hiding inside doors barred arya glanced longingly bedchamber moved away tower hand keeping close wall slid shadow shadow pretended chasing cats… except cat caught would kill

 moving buildings walls keeping stone back wherever possible one could surprise arya reached stables almost without incident dozen gold cloaks mail plate ran past edging across inner bailey without knowing whose side hunched low shadows let pass

 hullen master horse winterfell long arya could remember slumped ground stable door stabbed many times looked tunic patterned scarlet flowers arya certain dead crept closer eyes opened “arya underfoot” whispered “you must… warn your… lord father…” frothy red spittle bubbled mouth master horse closed eyes said

 inside bodies groom played three father’s household guard wagon laden crates chests stood abandoned near door stable dead men must loading trip docks attacked arya snuck closer one corpses desmond who’d shown longsword promised protect father lay back staring blindly ceiling flies crawled across eyes close dead man red cloak lioncrest helm lannisters one though every northerner worth ten southron swords desmond told “you liar” said kicking body sudden fury

 animals restless stalls whickering snorting scent blood arya’s plan saddle horse flee away castle city stay kingsroad would take back winterfell took bridle harness wall

 crossed back wagon fallen chest caught eye must knocked fight dropped loaded wood split lid opening spill chest’s contents across ground arya recognized silks satins velvets never wore might need warm clothes kingsroad though… besides…

 arya knelt dirt among scattered clothes found heavy woolen cloak velvet skirt silk tunic smallclothes dress mother embroidered silver baby bracelet might sell shoving broken lid way groped inside chest needle hidden way bottom everything stuff jumbled around chest dropped moment arya afraid someone found sword stolen fingers felt hardness metal satin gown

 “there is” voice hissed close behind

 startled arya whirled stableboy stood behind smirk face filthy white undertunic peeking beneath soiled jerkin boots covered manure pitchfork one hand “who you” asked

 “she don’t know me” said “but knows oh yes wolf girl”

 “help saddle horse” arya pleaded reaching back chest groping needle “my father’s hand king he’ll reward you”

 “father’s dead” boy said shuffled toward “it’s queen who’ll rewarding come girl”

 “stay away” fingers closed around needle’s hilt

 “i says come” grabbed arm hard

 everything syrio forel ever taught vanished heartbeat instant sudden terror lesson arya could remember one jon snow given first

 stuck pointy end driving blade upward wild hysterical strength

 needle went leather jerkin white flesh belly came shoulder blades boy dropped pitchfork made soft noise something gasp sigh hands closed around blade “oh gods” moaned undertunic began redden “take out”

 took died

 horses screaming arya stood body still frightened face death blood gushed boy’s mouth collapsed seeping slit belly pooling beneath body palms cut he’d grabbed blade backed away slowly needle red hand get away someplace far someplace safe away stableboy’s accusing eyes

 snatched bridle harness ran mare lifted saddle horse’s back arya realized sudden sick dread castle gates would closed even postern doors would likely guarded maybe guards wouldn’t recognize thought boy perhaps they’d let her… they’d orders let anyone wouldn’t matter whether knew

 another way castle…

 saddle slipped arya’s fingers fell dirt thump puff dust could find room monsters wasn’t certain yet knew try

 found clothing she’d gathered slipped cloak concealing needle beneath folds rest things tied roll bundle arm crept far end stable unlatching back door peeked anxiously could hear distant sound swordplay shivery wail man screaming pain across bailey would need go serpentine steps past small kitchen pig yard she’d gone last time chasing black tomcat… would take right past barracks gold cloaks couldn’t go way arya tried think another way crossed side castle could creep along river wall little godswood… first she’d cross yard plain view guards walls

 never seen many men walls gold cloaks armed spears knew sight would saw running across yard she’d look small would able tell would care

 leave told moment came frightened move

 calm still water small voice whispered ear arya startled almost dropped bundle looked around wildly one stable horses dead men

 quiet shadow heard voice syrio’s could tell yet somehow calmed fears

 stepped stable

 scariest thing she’d ever done wanted run hide made walk across yard slowly putting one foot front time world reason afraid anyone thought could feel eyes like bugs crawling skin clothes arya never looked saw watching courage would desert knew would drop bundle clothes run cry like baby would kept gaze ground time reached shadow royal sept far side yard arya cold sweat one raised hue cry

 sept open empty inside half hundred prayer candles burned fragrant silence arya figured gods would never miss two stuffed sleeves left back window sneaking back alley cornered oneeared tom easy got lost crawled windows hopped walls felt way dark cellars quiet shadow heard woman weeping took hour find low narrow window slanted dungeon monsters waited

 tossed bundle doubled back light candle chancy fire she’d remembered seeing burnt embers heard voices blowing coals cupping fingers around flickering candle went window coming door without ever getting glimpse

 time monsters frighten seemed almost old friends arya held candle head step took shadows moved walls turning watch pass “dragons” whispered slid needle cloak slender blade seemed small dragons big yet somehow arya felt better steel hand

 long windowless hall beyond door black remembered held needle left hand sword hand candle right fist hot wax ran across knuckles entrance well left arya went right part wanted run afraid snuffing candle heard faint squeaking rats glimpsed pair tiny glowing eyes edge light rats scare things would easy hide hidden wizard man forked beard could almost see stableboy standing wall hands curled claws blood still dripping deep gashes palms needle cut might waiting grab passed would see candle coming long way maybe would better without light…

 fear cuts deeper swords quiet voice inside whispered suddenly arya remembered crypts winterfell lot scarier place told she’d little girl first time saw brother robb taken sansa baby bran who’d bigger rickon they’d one candle bran’s eyes gotten big saucers stared stone faces kings winter wolves feet iron swords across laps

 robb took way end past grandfather brandon lyanna show tombs sansa kept looking stubby little candle anxious might go old nan told spiders rats big dogs robb smiled said “there worse things spiders rats” whispered “this dead walk” heard sound low deep shivery baby bran clutched arya’s hand

 spirit stepped open tomb pale white moaning blood sansa ran shrieking stairs bran wrapped around robb’s leg sobbing arya stood ground gave spirit punch jon covered flour “you stupid” told “you scared baby” jon robb laughed laughed pretty soon bran arya laughing

 memory made arya smile darkness held terrors stableboy dead she’d killed jumped she’d kill going home everything would better home safe behind winterfell’s grey granite walls

 footsteps sent soft echoes hurrying ahead arya plunged deeper darkness





 sansa

 came sansa third day

 chose simple dress dark grey wool plainly cut richly embroidered around collar sleeves fingers felt thick clumsy struggled silver fastenings without benefit servants jeyne poole confined jeyne useless face puffy crying could seem stop sobbing father

 “i’m certain father well” sansa told finally gotten dress buttoned right “i’ll ask queen let see him” thought kindness might lift jeyne’s spirits girl looked red swollen eyes began cry harder child

 sansa wept first day even within stout walls maegor’s holdfast door closed barred hard terrified killing began grown sound steel yard scarcely day life passed without hearing clash sword sword yet somehow knowing fighting real made difference world heard never heard sounds well grunts pain angry curses shouts help moans wounded dying men songs knights never screamed begged mercy

 wept pleading door tell happening calling father septa mordane king gallant prince men guarding heard pleas gave answer time door opened late night thrust jeyne poole inside bruised shaking “they’re killing everyone” steward’s daughter shrieked went hound broken door warhammer said bodies stair tower hand steps slick blood sansa dried tears struggled comfort friend went sleep bed cradled other’s arms like sisters

 second day even worse room sansa confined top highest tower maegor’s holdfast window could see heavy iron portcullis gatehouse drawbridge drawn deep dry moat separated keepwithinakeep larger castle surrounded lannister guardsmen prowled walls spears crossbows hand fighting silence grave settled red keep sounds jeyne poole’s endless whimpers sobs

 fed—hard cheese freshbaked bread milk break fast roast chicken greens midday late supper beef barley stew—but servants brought meals would answer sansa’s questions evening women brought clothes tower hand jeyne’s things well seemed nearly frightened jeyne tried talk fled grey plague guards outside door still refused let leave room

 “please need speak queen again” sansa told told everyone saw day “she’ll want talk know tell want see please queen prince joffrey you’d kind we’re marry we’re older”

 sunset second day great bell began ring voice deep sonorous long slow clanging filled sansa sense dread ringing went heard bells answering great sept baelor visenya’s hill sound rumbled across city like thunder warning storm come

 “what it” jeyne asked covering ears “why ringing bells”

 “the king dead” sansa could say knew yet slow endless clanging filled room mournful dirge enemy stormed castle murdered king robert meaning fighting heard

 went sleep wondering restless fearful beautiful joffrey king killed afraid father would tell happening…

 night sansa dreamt joffrey throne seated beside gown woven gold crown head everyone ever known came bend knee say courtesies

 next morning morning third day ser boros blount kingsguard came escort queen

 ser boros ugly man broad chest short bandy legs nose flat cheeks baggy jowls hair grey brittle today wore white velvet snowy cloak fastened lion brooch beast soft sheen gold eyes tiny rubies “you look handsome splendid morning ser boros” sansa told lady remembered courtesies resolved lady matter

 “and lady” ser boros said flat voice “her grace awaits come me”

 guards outside door lannister menatarms crimson cloaks lioncrested helms sansa made smile pleasantly bid good morning passed first time allowed outside chamber since ser arys oakheart led two mornings past “to keep safe sweet one” queen cersei told “joffrey would never forgive anything happened precious”

 sansa expected ser boros would escort royal apartments instead led maegor’s holdfast bridge workmen lowering man ropes depths dry moat sansa peered saw body impaled huge iron spikes averted eyes quickly afraid ask afraid look long afraid might someone knew

 found queen cersei council chambers seated head long table littered papers candles blocks sealing wax room splendid sansa ever seen stared awe carved wooden screen twin sphinxes sat beside door

 “your grace” ser boros said ushered inside another kingsguard ser mandon curiously dead face “i’ve brought girl”

 sansa hoped joffrey might prince three king’s councillors lord petyr baelish sat queen’s left hand grand maester pycelle end table lord varys hovered smelling flowery clad black realized feeling dread mourning clothes…

 queen wore highcollared black silk gown hundred dark red rubies sewn bodice covering neck bosom cut shape teardrops queen weeping blood cersei smiled see sansa thought sweetest saddest smile ever seen “sansa sweet child” said “i know you’ve asking i’m sorry could send sooner matters unsettled moment trust people taking good care you”

 “everyone sweet pleasant grace thank ever much asking” sansa said politely “only well one talk us tell us what’s happened…”

 “us” cersei seemed puzzled

 “we put steward’s girl her” ser boros said “we know else her”

 queen frowned “next time ask” said voice sharp “the gods know sort tales she’s filling sansa’s head with”

 “jeyne’s scared” sansa said “she won’t stop crying promised i’d ask could see father”

 old grand maester pycelle lowered eyes

 “her father well isn’t he” sansa said anxiously knew fighting surely one would harm steward vayon poole even wear sword

 queen cersei looked councillors turn “i won’t sansa fretting needlessly shall little friend lords”

 lord petyr leaned forward “i’ll find place her”

 “not city” said queen

 “do take fool”

 queen ignored “ser boros escort girl lord petyr’s apartments instruct people keep comes tell littlefinger taking see father ought calm want gone sansa returns chamber”

 “as command grace” ser boros said bowed deeply spun heel took leave long white cloak stirring air behind

 sansa confused “i don’t understand” said “where jeyne’s father can’t ser boros take instead lord petyr it” promised would lady gentle queen strong mother lady catelyn sudden scared second thought might cry “where sending hasn’t done anything wrong she’s good girl”

 “she’s upset you” queen said gently “we can’t another word lord baelish see jeyne’s well taken care promise you” patted chair beside “sit sansa want talk you”

 sansa seated beside queen cersei smiled make feel less anxious varys wringing soft hands together grand maester pycelle kept sleepy eyes papers front could feel littlefinger staring something way small man looked made sansa feel though clothes goose bumps pimpled skin

 “sweet sansa” queen cersei said laying soft hand wrist “such beautiful child hope know much joffrey love you”

 “you do” sansa said breathless littlefinger forgotten prince loved nothing else mattered

 queen smiled “i think almost daughter know love bear joffrey” gave weary shake head “i afraid grave news lord father must brave child”

 quiet words gave sansa chill “what it”

 “your father traitor dear” lord varys said

 grand maester pycelle lifted ancient head “with ears heard lord eddard swear beloved king robert would protect young princes sons yet moment king dead called small council together steal prince joffrey’s rightful throne”

 “no” sansa blurted “he wouldn’t wouldn’t”

 queen picked letter paper torn stiff dried blood broken seal father’s direwolf stamped pale wax “we found captain household guard sansa letter late husband’s brother stannis inviting take crown”

 “please grace there’s mistake” sudden panic made dizzy faint “please send father he’ll tell would never write letter king friend”

 “robert thought so” said queen “this betrayal would broken heart gods kind live see it” sighed “sansa sweetling must see dreadful position left us innocent wrong know yet daughter traitor allow marry son”

 “but love him” sansa wailed confused frightened mean done father supposed happen way wed joffrey betrothed promised even dreamed wasn’t fair take away account whatever father might done

 “how well know child” cersei said voice kind sweet “why else come told father’s plan send away us love”

 “it love” sansa said rush “father wouldn’t even give leave say farewell” good girl obedient girl felt wicked arya morning sneaking away septa mordane defying lord father never done anything willful would never done hadn’t loved joffrey much “he going take back winterfell marry hedge knight even though joff wanted told wouldn’t listen” king last hope king could command father let stay king’s landing marry prince joffrey sansa knew could king always frightened loud roughvoiced drunk often would probably sent back lord eddard even let see went queen instead poured heart cersei listened thanked sweetly… ser arys escorted high room maegor’s holdfast posted guards hours later fighting begun outside “please” finished “you let marry joffrey i’ll ever good wife you’ll see i’ll queen like promise”

 queen cersei looked others “my lords council say plea”

 “the poor child” murmured varys “a love true innocent grace would cruel deny it… yet father stands condemned” soft hands washed gesture helpless distress

 “a child born traitor’s seed find betrayal comes naturally her” said grand maester pycelle “she sweet thing ten years say treasons may hatch”

 “no” sansa said horrified “i’m i’d never… wouldn’t betray joffrey love swear do”

 “oh poignant” said varys “and yet truly said blood runs truer oaths”

 “she reminds mother father” lord petyr baelish said quietly “look hair eyes image cat age”

 queen looked troubled yet sansa could see kindness clear green eyes “child” said “if could truly believe like father nothing please see wed joffrey know loves heart” sighed “and yet fear lord varys grand maester right blood tell remember sister set wolf son”

 “i’m like arya” sansa blurted “she traitor’s blood i’m good ask septa mordane she’ll tell want joffrey’s loyal loving wife”

 felt weight cersei’s eyes queen studied face “i believe mean child” turned face others “my lords seems rest kin remain loyal terrible time would go long way toward laying fears rest”

 grand maester pycelle stroked huge soft beard wide brow furrowed thought “lord eddard three sons”

 “mere boys” lord petyr said shrug “i concerned lady catelyn tullys”

 queen took sansa’s hand “child know letters”

 sansa nodded nervously could read write better brothers although hopeless sums

 “i pleased hear perhaps hope joffrey still…”

 “what want do”

 “you must write lady mother brother eldest… name”

 “robb” sansa said

 “the word lord father’s treason doubt reach soon better come must tell lord eddard betrayed king”

 sansa wanted joffrey desperately think courage queen asking “but never… don’t… grace wouldn’t know say…”

 queen patted hand “we tell write child important thing urge lady catelyn brother keep king’s peace”

 “it go hard don’t” said grand maester pycelle “by love bear must urge walk path wisdom”

 “your lady mother doubt fear dreadfully” queen said “you must tell well care treating gently seeing every want bid come king’s landing pledge fealty joffrey takes throne that… shall know taint blood come flower womanhood shall wed king great sept baelor eyes gods men”

 …wed king… words made breath come faster yet still sansa hesitated “perhaps… might see father talk about…”

 “treason” lord varys hinted

 “you disappoint sansa” queen said eyes gone hard stones “we’ve told father’s crimes truly loyal say want see him”

 “i… meant…” sansa felt eyes grow wet “he’s not… please hasn’t been… hurt or… or…”

 “lord eddard harmed” queen said

 “but… what’s become him”

 “that matter king decide” grand maester pycelle announced ponderously

 king sansa blinked back tears joffrey king thought gallant prince would never hurt father matter might done went pleaded mercy certain he’d listen listen loved even queen said joff would need punish father lords would expect perhaps could send back winterfell exile one free cities across narrow sea would years joffrey would married queen could persuade joff bring father back grant pardon

 only… mother robb anything treasonous called banners refused swear fealty anything would go wrong joffrey good kind knew heart king stern rebels make understand

 “i’ll… i’ll write letters” sansa told

 smile warm sunrise cersei lannister leaned close kissed gently cheek “i knew would joffrey proud tell courage good sense you’ve shown today”

 end wrote four letters mother lady catelyn stark brothers winterfell aunt grandfather well lady lysa arryn eyrie lord hoster tully riverrun time done fingers cramped stiff stained ink varys father’s seal warmed pale white beeswax candle poured carefully watched eunuch stamped letter direwolf house stark

 jeyne poole things gone ser mandon moore returned sansa high tower maegor’s holdfast weeping thought gratefully yet somehow seemed colder jeyne gone even she’d built fire pulled chair close hearth took one favorite books lost stories florian jonquil lady shella rainbow knight valiant prince aemon doomed love brother’s queen

 later night drifting sleep sansa realized forgotten ask sister





 jon

 “othor” announced ser jaremy rykker “beyond doubt one jafer flowers” turned corpse foot dead white face stared overcast sky blue blue eyes “they ben stark’s men them”

 uncle’s men jon thought numbly remembered he’d pleaded ride gods green boy taken might lying here…

 jafer’s right wrist ended ruin torn flesh splintered bone left ghost’s jaws right hand floating jar vinegar back maester aemon’s tower left hand still end arm black cloak

 “gods mercy” old bear muttered swung garron handing reins jon morning unnaturally warm beads sweat dotted lord commander’s broad forehead like dew melon horse nervous rolling eyes backing away dead men far lead would allow jon led paces fighting keep bolting horses like feel place matter neither jon

 dogs liked least ghost led party pack hounds useless bass kennelmaster tried get take scent severed hand gone wild yowling barking fighting get away even snarling whimpering turns pulling leashes chett cursed curs

 wood jon told they’re dead men seen dead men before…

 last night dreamt winterfell dream wandering empty castle searching father descending crypts time dream gone dark he’d heard scrape stone stone turned saw vaults opening one dead kings came stumbling cold black graves jon woken pitchdark heart hammering even ghost leapt bed nuzzle face could shake deep sense terror dared go back sleep instead climbed wall walked restless saw light dawn cast dream brother night’s watch frightened boy

 samwell tarly huddled beneath trees halfhidden behind horses round fat face color curdled milk far lurched woods retch much glanced dead men either “i can’t look” whispered miserably

 “you look” jon told keeping voice low others would hear “maester aemon sent eyes didn’t good eyes they’re shut”

 “yes but… i’m coward jon”

 jon put hand sam’s shoulder “we dozen rangers us dogs even ghost one hurt sam go ahead look first look hardest”

 sam gave tremulous nod working courage visible effort slowly swiveled head eyes widened jon held arm could turn away

 “ser jaremy” old bear asked gruffly “ben stark six men rode wall others”

 ser jaremy shook head “would knew”

 plainly mormont pleased answer “two brothers butchered almost within sight wall yet rangers heard nothing saw nothing night’s watch fallen still sweep woods”

 “yes lord but—”

 “do still mount watches”

 “we but—”

 “this man wears hunting horn” mormont pointed othor “must suppose died without sounding rangers gone deaf well blind”

 ser jaremy bristled face taut anger “no horn blown lord rangers would heard sufficient men mount many patrols like… since benjen lost stayed closer wall wont command”

 old bear grunted “yes well may” made impatient gesture “tell died”

 squatting beside dead man named jafer flowers ser jaremy grasped head scalp hair came fingers brittle straw knight cursed shoved face heel hand great gash side corpse’s neck opened like mouth crusted dried blood ropes pale tendon still attached head neck “this done axe”

 “aye” muttered dywen old forester “belike axe othor carried m’lord”

 jon could feel breakfast churning belly pressed lips together made look second body othor big ugly man made big ugly corpse axe evidence jon remembered othor one bellowing bawdy song rangers rode singing days done flesh blanched white milk everywhere hands hands black like jafer’s blossoms hard cracked blood decorated mortal wounds covered like rash breast groin throat yet eyes still open stared sky blue sapphires

 ser jaremy stood “the wildlings axes too”

 mormont rounded “so believe mance rayder’s work close wall”

 “who else lord”

 jon could told knew knew yet man would say words others story tale make children shiver ever lived gone eight thousand years even thought made feel foolish man grown black brother night’s watch boy who’d sat old nan’s feet bran robb arya

 yet lord commander mormont gave snort “if ben stark come wildling attack half day’s ride castle black would returned men chased killers seven hells brought back heads”

 “unless slain well” ser jaremy insisted

 words hurt even long seemed folly cling hope ben stark still alive jon snow nothing stubborn

 “it close half year since benjen left us lord” ser jaremy went “the forest vast wildlings might fallen anywhere i’d wager two last survivors party way back us… enemy caught could reach safety wall corpses still fresh men cannot dead day…”

 “no” samwell tarly squeaked

 jon startled sam’s nervous highpitched voice last would expected hear fat boy frightened officers ser jaremy known patience

 “i ask views boy” rykker said coldly

 “let speak ser” jon blurted

 mormont’s eyes flicked sam jon back “if lad something say i’ll hear come closer boy can’t see behind horses”

 sam edged past jon garrons sweating profusely “my lord it… can’t day or… look… blood…”

 “yes” mormont growled impatiently “blood it”

 “he soils smallclothes sight it” chett shouted rangers laughed

 sam mopped sweat brow “you… see ghost… jon’s direwolf… see tore man’s hand yet… stump hasn’t bled look…” waved hand “my father… llord randyll made watch dress animals sometimes when… after…” sam shook head side side chins quivering looked bodies could seem look away “a fresh kill… blood would still flow lords later… later would clotted like a… jelly thick and… and…” looked though going sick “this man… look wrist it’s all… crusty… dry… like…”

 jon saw sam meant could see torn veins dead man’s wrist iron worms pale flesh blood black dust yet jaremy rykker unconvinced “if they’d dead much longer day they’d ripe boy don’t even smell”

 dywen gnarled old forester liked boast could smell snow coming sidled closer corpses took whiff “well they’re pansy flowers but… m’lord truth there’s corpse stink”

 “they… aren’t rotting” sam pointed fat finger shaking little “look there’s… there’s maggots or… or… worms anything… they’ve lying woods they… haven’t chewed eaten animals… ghost… otherwise they’re… they’re…”

 “untouched” jon said softly “and ghost different dogs horses won’t go near them”

 rangers exchanged glances could see true every man mormont frowned glancing corpses dogs “chett bring hounds closer”

 chett tried cursing yanking leashes giving one animal lick boot dogs whimpered planted feet tried dragging one bitch resisted growling squirming escape collar finally lunged chett dropped leash stumbled backward dog leapt bounded trees

 “this… wrong” sam tarly said earnestly “the blood… there’s bloodstains clothes and… flesh dry hard but… there’s none ground or… anywhere those… those… those…” sam made swallow took deep breath “with wounds… terrible wounds… blood shouldn’t there”

 dywen sucked wooden teeth “might didn’t die might someone brought ’em left ’em us warning like” old forester peered suspiciously “and might i’m fool don’t know othor never blue eyes afore”

 ser jaremy looked startled “neither flowers” blurted turning stare dead man

 silence fell wood moment heard sam’s heavy breathing wet sound dywen sucking teeth jon squatted beside ghost

 “burn them” someone whispered one rangers jon could said “yes burn them” second voice urged

 old bear gave stubborn shake head “not yet want maester aemon look we’ll bring back wall”

 commands easily given obeyed wrapped dead men cloaks hake dywen tried tie one onto horse animal went mad screaming rearing lashing hooves even biting ketter ran help rangers better luck garrons even placid wanted part burdens end forced hack branches fashion crude slings carry corpses back foot well past midday time started back

 “i woods searched” mormont commanded ser jaremy set “every tree every rock every bush every foot muddy ground within ten leagues use men enough borrow hunters foresters stewards ben others dead alive found anyone else woods know track take alive possible understood”

 “it lord” ser jaremy said “it done”

 mormont rode silence brooding jon followed close behind lord commander’s steward place day grey damp overcast sort day made wish rain wind stirred wood air hung humid heavy jon’s clothes clung skin warm warm wall weeping copiously weeping days sometimes jon even imagined shrinking

 old men called weather spirit summer said meant season giving ghosts last cold would come warned long summer always meant long winter summer lasted ten years jon babe arms began

 ghost ran time vanished among trees without direwolf jon felt almost naked found glancing every shadow unease unbidden thought back tales old nan used tell boy winterfell could almost hear voice clickclickclick needles darkness others came riding used say dropping voice lower lower cold dead hated iron fire touch sun every living creature hot blood veins holdfasts cities kingdoms men fell moved south pale dead horses leading hosts slain fed dead servants flesh human children…

 caught first glimpse wall looming tops ancient gnarled oak jon vastly relieved mormont reined suddenly turned saddle “tarly” barked “come here”

 jon saw start fright sam’s face lumbered mare doubtless thought trouble “you’re fat you’re stupid boy” old bear said gruffly “you well back snow”

 sam blushed vivid crimson tripped tongue tried stammer courtesy jon smile

 emerged trees mormont spurred tough little garron trot ghost came streaking woods meet licking chops muzzle red prey high men wall saw column approaching jon heard deep throaty call watchman’s great horn calling across miles single long blast shuddered trees echoed ice

 uuuuuuuooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

 sound faded slowly silence one blast meant rangers returning jon thought ranger one day least whatever may come cannot take away

 bowen marsh waiting first gate led garrons icy tunnel lord steward redfaced agitated “my lord” blurted mormont swung open iron bars “there’s bird must come once”

 “what man” mormont said gruffly

 curiously marsh glanced jon answered “maester aemon letter he’s waiting solar”

 “very well jon see horse tell ser jaremy put dead men storeroom maester ready them” mormont strode away grumbling

 led horses back stable jon uncomfortably aware people watching ser alliser thorne drilling boys yard broke stare jon faint half smile lips onearmed donal noye stood door armory “the gods snow” called

 something’s wrong jon thought something’s wrong

 dead men carried one storerooms along base wall dark cold cell chiseled ice used keep meat grain sometimes even beer jon saw mormont’s horse fed watered groomed took care afterward sought friends grenn toad watch found pyp common hall “what’s happened” asked

 pyp lowered voice “the king’s dead”

 jon stunned robert baratheon looked old fat visited winterfell yet he’d seemed hale enough there’d talk illness “how know”

 “one guards overheard clydas reading letter maester aemon” pyp leaned close “jon i’m sorry father’s friend wasn’t he”

 “they close brothers once” jon wondered joffrey would keep father king’s hand seem likely might mean lord eddard would return winterfell sisters well might even allowed visit lord mormont’s permission would good see arya’s grin talk father ask mother resolved man past time told even whore don’t care want know

 “i heard hake say dead men uncle’s” pyp said

 “yes” jon replied “two six took they’d dead long time only… bodies queer”

 “queer” pyp curiosity “how queer”

 “sam tell you” jon want talk “i see old bear need me”

 walked lord commander’s tower alone curious sense apprehension brothers guard eyed solemnly approached “the old bear’s solar” one announced “he asking you”

 jon nodded come straight stable climbed tower steps briskly wants wine fire hearth that’s told

 entered solar mormont’s raven screamed “corn” bird shrieked “corn corn corn”

 “don’t believe fed him” old bear growled seated window reading letter “bring cup wine pour one yourself”

 “for lord”

 mormont lifted eyes letter stare jon pity look could taste “you heard me”

 jon poured exaggerated care vaguely aware drawing act cups filled would choice face whatever letter yet soon filled “sit boy” mormont commanded “drink”

 jon remained standing “it’s father isn’t it”

 old bear tapped letter finger “your father king” rumbled “i won’t lie it’s grievous news never thought see another king age robert half years strong bull” took gulp wine “they say king loved hunt things love destroy us every time lad remember son loved young wife vain woman would never thought sell poachers”

 jon could scarcely follow saying “my lord don’t understand what’s happened father”

 “i told sit” mormont grumbled “sit” raven screamed “and drink damn that’s command snow”

 jon sat took sip wine

 “lord eddard imprisoned charged treason said plotted robert’s brothers deny throne prince joffrey”

 “no” jon said “that couldn’t father would never betray king”

 “be may” said mormont “it say you”

 “but it’s lie” jon insisted could think father traitor gone mad lord eddard stark would never dishonor himself… would

 fathered bastard small voice whispered inside honor mother even speak name

 “my lord happen kill him”

 “as cannot say lad mean send letter knew king’s councillors youth old pycelle lord stannis ser barristan… whatever father done hasn’t done great lord must allowed take black join us gods knows need men lord eddard’s ability”

 jon knew men accused treason allowed redeem honor wall days past lord eddard father strange thought strangely uncomfortable would monstrous injustice strip winterfell force take black yet meant life…

 would joffrey allow remembered prince winterfell way he’d mocked robb ser rodrik yard jon scarcely even noticed bastards beneath even contempt “my lord king listen you”

 old bear shrugged “a boy king… imagine he’ll listen mother pity dwarf isn’t he’s lad’s uncle saw need visited us bad thing lady mother taking captive—”

 “lady stark mother” jon reminded sharply tyrion lannister friend lord eddard killed would much blame queen “my lord sisters arya sansa father know—”

 “pycelle makes mention doubtless they’ll treated gently ask write” mormont shook head “this could happened worse time ever realm needed strong king… dark days cold nights ahead feel bones…” gave jon long shrewd look “i hope thinking anything stupid boy”

 he’s father jon wanted say knew mormont would want hear throat dry made take another sip wine

 yet must dozed woke legs stiff cramped candle long since burned ghost stood hind legs scrabbling door jon startled see tall he’d grown “ghost it” called softly direwolf turned head looked baring fangs silent snarl gone mad jon wondered “it’s ghost” murmured trying sound afraid yet trembling violently gotten cold

 ghost backed away door deep gouges he’d raked wood jon watched mounting disquiet “there’s someone isn’t there” whispered crouching direwolf crept backward white fur rising back neck guard thought left man guard door ghost smells door that’s

 slowly jon pushed feet shivering uncontrollably wishing still sword three quick steps brought door grabbed handle pulled inward creak hinges almost made jump

 guard sprawled bonelessly across narrow steps looking looking even though lying stomach head twisted completely around

 can’t jon told lord commander’s tower it’s guarded day night couldn’t happen it’s dream i’m nightmare

 ghost slid past door wolf started steps stopped looked back jon heard soft scrape boot stone sound latch turning sounds came lord commander’s chambers

 nightmare might yet dream

 guard’s sword sheath jon knelt worked free heft steel fist made bolder moved steps ghost padding silently shadows lurked every turn stair jon crept warily probing suspicious darkness point sword

 suddenly heard shriek mormont’s raven “corn” bird screaming “corn corn corn corn corn corn” ghost bounded ahead jon came scrambling door mormont’s solar wide open direwolf plunged jon stopped doorway blade hand giving eyes moment adjust heavy drapes pulled across windows darkness black ink “who’s there” called

 saw shadow shadows sliding toward inner door led mormont’s sleeping cell manshape black cloaked hooded… beneath hood eyes shone icy blue radiance…

 karstarks came cold windy morning bringing three hundred horsemen near two thousand foot castle karhold steel points pikes winked pale sunlight column approached man went pounding slow deepthroated marching rhythm drum bigger boom boom boom

 bran watched come guard turret atop outer wall peering maester luwin’s bronze fareye perched hodor’s shoulders lord rickard led sons harrion eddard torrhen riding beside beneath nightblack banners emblazoned white sunburst house old nan said stark blood going back hundreds years look like starks bran big men fierce faces covered thick beards hair worn loose past shoulders cloaks made skins pelts bear seal wolf

 “i’ll take summer” bran argued

 “don’t act boy bran” robb said “you know better two days ago one lord bolton’s men knifed one lord cerwyn’s smoking log lady mother would skin pelt let put risk” using voice robb lord said bran knew meant appeal

 year ago would visited town even meant climbing walls days could run stairs get pony wield wooden sword good enough knock prince tommen dirt could watch peering maester luwin’s lens tube maester taught banners mailed fist glovers silver scarlet lady mormont’s black bear hideous flayed man went roose bolton dreadfort bull moose hornwoods battleaxe cerwyns three sentinel trees tallharts fearsome sigil house umber roaring giant shattered chains

 soon enough learned faces lords sons knights retainer came winterfell feast even great hall large enough seat robb hosted principal bannermen turn bran always given place honor brother’s right hand lords bannermen gave queer hard stares sat wondered right green boy placed cripple

 “how many now” bran asked maester luwin lord karstark sons rode gates outer wall

 “twelve thousand men near enough makes matter”

 “how many knights”

 “few enough” maester said touch impatience “to knight must stand vigil sept anointed seven oils consecrate vows north great houses worship seven rest honor old gods name knights… lords sons sworn swords less fierce loyal honorable man’s worth marked ser name told hundred times before”

 “still” said bran “how many knights”

 maester luwin sighed “three hundred perhaps four… among three thousand armored lances knights”

 “lord karstark last” bran said thoughtfully “robb feast tonight”

 “no doubt will”

 “how long before… go”

 “he must march soon all” maester luwin said “the winter town full bursting army eat countryside clean camps much longer others waiting join along kingsroad barrow knights crannogmen lords manderly flint fighting begun riverlands brother many leagues go”

 “i know” bran felt miserable sounded handed bronze tube back maester noticed thin luwin’s hair grown top could see pink scalp showing felt queer look way he’d spent whole life looking sat hodor’s back looked everyone “i don’t want watch anymore hodor take back keep”

 “hodor” said hodor

 maester luwin tucked tube sleeve “bran lord brother time see must greet lord karstark sons make welcome”

 “i won’t trouble robb want visit godswood” put hand hodor’s shoulder “hodor”

 series chiselcut handholds made ladder granite tower’s inner wall hodor hummed tunelessly went hand hand bran bouncing back wicker seat maester luwin fashioned luwin gotten idea baskets women used carry firewood backs simple matter cutting legholes attaching new straps spread bran’s weight evenly good riding dancer places dancer could go shame bran way hodor carried arms like baby hodor seemed like though hodor hard tell tricky part doors sometimes hodor forgot bran back could painful went door

 near fortnight many comings goings robb ordered portcullises kept drawbridge even dead night long column armored lancers crossing moat walls bran emerged tower karstark men following lords castle wore black iron halfhelms black woolen cloaks patterned white sunburst hodor trotted along beside smiling boots thudding wood drawbridge riders gave queer looks went bran heard someone guffaw refused let trouble “men look you” maester luwin warned first time strapped wicker basket around hodor’s chest “they look talk mock you” let mock bran thought one mocked bedchamber would live life bed

 passed beneath gatehouse portcullis bran put two fingers mouth whistled summer came loping across yard suddenly karstark lancers fighting control horses rolled eyes whickered dismay one stallion reared screaming rider cursing hanging desperately scent direwolves sent horses frenzy fear accustomed they’d quiet soon enough summer gone “the godswood” bran reminded hodor

 even winterfell crowded yard rang sound sword axe rumble wagons barking dogs armory doors open bran glimpsed mikken forge hammer ringing sweat dripped bare chest bran never seen many strangers years even king robert come visit father

 tried flinch hodor ducked low door walked long dim hallway summer padding easily beside wolf glanced time time eyes smoldering like liquid gold bran would liked touch riding high hand reach

 godswood island peace sea chaos winterfell become hodor made way dense stands oak ironwood sentinels still pool beside heart tree stopped gnarled limbs weirwood humming bran reached head pulled seat drawing dead weight legs holes wicker basket hung moment dangling dark red leaves brushing face hodor lifted lowered smooth stone beside water “i want while” said “you go soak go pools”

 “hodor” hodor stomped trees vanished across godswood beneath windows guest house underground hot spring fed three small ponds steam rose water day night wall loomed thick moss hodor hated cold water would fight like treed wildcat threatened soap would happily immerse hottest pool sit hours giving loud burp echo spring whenever bubble rose murky green depths break upon surface

 summer lapped water settled bran’s side rubbed wolf jaw moment boy beast felt peace bran always liked godswood even late found drawn even heart tree longer scared way used deep red eyes carved pale trunk still watched yet somehow took comfort gods looking told old gods gods starks first men children forest father’s gods felt safe sight deep silence trees helped think bran thinking lot since fall thinking dreaming talking gods

 “please make robb won’t go away” prayed softly moved hand cold water sending ripples across pool “please make stay go bring home safe mother father girls make it… make rickon understands”

 baby brother wild winter storm since learned robb riding war weeping angry turns he’d refused eat cried screamed night even punched old nan tried sing sleep next day he’d vanished robb set half castle searching last they’d found crypts rickon slashed rusted iron sword he’d snatched dead king’s hand shaggydog come slavering darkness like greeneyed demon wolf near wild rickon he’d bitten gage arm torn chunk flesh mikken’s thigh taken robb grey wind bring bay farlen black wolf chained kennels rickon cried without

 maester luwin counseled robb remain winterfell bran pleaded sake much rickon’s brother shook head stubbornly said “i don’t want go to”

 half lie someone go hold neck help tullys lannisters bran could understand robb brother might given command hal mollen theon greyjoy one lords bannermen maester luwin urged robb would hear “my lord father would never sent men die huddled like craven behind walls winterfell” said robb lord

 robb seemed half stranger bran transformed lord truth though yet seen sixteenth name day even father’s bannermen seemed sense many tried test way roose bolton robett glover demanded honor battle command first brusquely second smile jest stout greyhaired maege mormont dressed mail like man told robb bluntly young enough grandson business giving commands… happened granddaughter would willing marry softspoken lord cerwyn actually brought daughter plump homely maid thirty years sat father’s left hand never lifted eyes plate jovial lord hornwood daughters bring gifts horse one day haunch venison next silverchased hunting horn day asked nothing return… nothing certain holdfast taken grandfather hunting rights north certain ridge leave dam white knife please lord

 robb answered cool courtesy much father might somehow bent

 lord umber called greatjon men stood tall hodor twice wide threatened take forces home placed behind hornwoods cerwyns order march robb told welcome “and done lannisters” promised scratching grey wind behind ear “we march back north root keep hang oathbreaker” cursing greatjon flung flagon ale fire bellowed robb green must piss grass hallis mollen moved restrain knocked floor kicked table unsheathed biggest ugliest greatsword bran ever seen along benches sons brothers sworn swords leapt feet grabbing steel

 yet robb said quiet word snarl blink eye lord umber back sword spinning floor three feet away hand dripping blood grey wind bitten two fingers “my lord father taught death bare steel liege lord” robb said “but doubtless meant cut meat” bran’s bowels went water greatjon struggled rise sucking red stumps fingers… astonishingly huge man laughed “your meat” roared “is bloody tough”

 somehow greatjon became robb’s right hand staunchest champion loudly telling sundry boy lord stark they’d damn well better bend knees didn’t fancy chewed

 yet night brother came bran’s bedchamber pale shaken fires burned low great hall “i thought going kill me” robb confessed “did see way threw hal like bigger rickon gods scared greatjon’s worst loudest lord roose never says word looks think room dreadfort boltons hang skins enemies”

 “that’s one old nan’s stories” bran said note doubt crept voice “isn’t it”

 “i don’t know” gave weary shake head “lord cerwyn means take daughter south us cook says theon certain i’ll find girl bedroll one night wish… wish father here…”

 one thing could agree bran rickon robb lord wished father lord eddard thousand leagues away captive dungeon hunted fugitive running life even dead one seemed know certain every traveler told different tale terrifying last heads father’s guardsmen rotting walls red keep impaled spikes king robert dead father’s hands baratheons laid siege king’s landing lord eddard fled south king’s wicked brother renly arya sansa murdered hound mother killed tyrion imp hung body walls riverrun lord tywin lannister marching eyrie burning slaughtering went one winesodden taleteller even claimed rhaegar targaryen returned dead marshaling vast host ancient heroes dragonstone reclaim father’s throne

 raven came bearing letter marked father’s seal written sansa’s hand cruel truth seemed less incredible bran would never forget look robb’s face stared sister’s words “she says father conspired treason king’s brothers” read “king robert dead mother summoned red keep swear fealty joffrey says must loyal marries joffrey plead spare lord father’s life” fingers closed fist crushing sansa’s letter “and says nothing arya nothing much word damn what’s wrong girl”

 bran felt cold inside “she lost wolf” said weakly remembering day four father’s guardsmen returned south lady’s bones summer grey wind shaggydog begun howl crossed drawbridge voices drawn desolate beneath shadow first keep ancient lichyard headstones spotted pale lichen old kings winter laid faithful servants buried lady brothers stalked graves like restless shadows gone south bones returned

 grandfather old lord rickard gone well son brandon father’s brother two hundred best men none ever returned father gone south arya sansa jory hullen fat tom rest later mother ser rodrik gone hadn’t come back either robb meant go king’s landing swear fealty riverrun sword hand lord father truly prisoner could mean death certainty frightened bran could say

 “if robb go watch him” bran entreated old gods watched heart tree’s red eyes “and watch men hal quent rest lord umber lady mormont lords theon suppose watch keep safe please gods help defeat lannisters save father bring home”

 faint wind sighed godswood red leaves stirred whispered summer bared teeth “you hear boy” voice asked

 bran lifted head osha stood across pool beneath ancient oak face shadowed leaves even irons wildling moved quiet cat summer circled pool sniffed tall woman flinched

 “summer me” bran called direwolf took one final sniff spun bounded back bran wrapped arms around “what here” seen osha since they’d taken captive wolfswood though knew she’d set working kitchens

 “they gods too” osha said “beyond wall gods” hair growing brown shaggy made look womanly simple dress brown roughspun they’d given took mail leather “gage lets prayers time time feel need let likes skirt feels need it’s nothing like smell flour hands he’s gentler stiv” gave awkward bow “i’ll leave there’s pots want scouring”

 “no stay” bran commanded “tell meant hearing gods”

 osha studied “you asked they’re answering open ears listen you’ll hear”

 bran listened “it’s wind” said moment uncertain “the leaves rustling”

 “who think sends wind gods” seated across pool clinking faintly moved mikken fixed iron manacles ankles heavy chain could walk long kept strides small way run climb mount horse “they see boy hear talking rustling that’s talking back”

 “what saying”

 “they’re sad lord brother get help he’s going old gods power south weirwoods cut thousands years ago watch brother eyes”

 bran thought frightened even gods could help brother hope maybe osha wasn’t hearing right cocked head tried listen thought could hear sadness nothing

 rustling grew louder bran heard muffled footfalls low humming hodor came blundering trees naked smiling “hodor”

 “he must heard voices” bran said “hodor forgot clothes”

 “hodor” hodor agreed dripping wet neck steaming chill air body covered brown hair thick pelt legs manhood swung long heavy

 osha eyed sour smile “now there’s big man” said “he giant’s blood i’m queen”

 “maester luwin says giants says they’re dead like children forest that’s left old bones earth men turn plows time time”

 “let maester luwin ride beyond wall” osha said “he’ll find giants they’ll find brother killed one ten foot tall stunted they’ve known grow big twelve thirteen feet fierce things hair teeth wives beards like husbands there’s telling apart women take human men lovers it’s half bloods come goes harder women catch men big they’ll rip maid apart get child” grinned “but don’t know mean boy”

 “yes do” bran insisted understood mating seen dogs yard watched stallion mount mare talking made uncomfortable looked hodor “go back bring clothes hodor” said “go dress”

 “hodor” walked back way come ducking lowhanging tree limb

 awfully big bran thought watched go “are truly giants beyond wall” asked osha uncertainly

 “giants worse giants lordling tried tell brother asked questions maester smiley boy greyjoy cold winds rising men go fires never come back… they’re men wights blue eyes cold black hands think run south stiv hali rest fools mance thinks he’ll fight brave sweet stubborn man like white walkers rangers know call kingbeyondthewall likes he’s still another old black crow flew shadow tower he’s never tasted winter born child like mother mother mother born free folk remember” osha stood chains rattling together “i tried tell lordling brother yesterday saw yard ‘m’lord stark’ called respectful please looked sweaty oaf greatjon umber shoves path i’ll wear irons hold tongue man won’t listen can’t hear”

 “tell robb listen know will”

 “will we’ll see tell m’lord tell he’s bound marching wrong way it’s north taking swords north south hear me”

 bran nodded “i’ll tell him”

 night feasted great hall robb took meal solar instead lord rickard greatjon lords bannermen make final plans long march come left bran fill place head table act host lord karstark’s sons honored friends already places hodor carried bran hall back knelt beside high seat two serving men helped lift basket bran could feel eyes every stranger hall grown quiet “my lords” hallis mollen announced “brandon stark winterfell”

 “i welcome fires” bran said stiffly “and offer meat mead honor friendship”

 harrion karstark oldest lord rickard’s sons bowed brothers yet settled back places heard younger two talking low voices clatter wine cups “…sooner die live like that” muttered one father’s namesake eddard brother torrhen said likely boy broken inside well craven take life

 broken bran thought bitterly clutched knife bran broken “i don’t want broken” whispered fiercely maester luwin who’d seated right “i want knight”

 “there call order knights mind” luwin replied “you surpassing clever boy work bran ever thought might wear maester’s chain limit might learn”

 “i want learn magic” bran told “the crow promised would fly”

 maester luwin sighed “i teach history healing herblore teach speech ravens build castle way sailor steers ship stars teach measure days mark seasons citadel oldtown teach thousand things bran man teach magic”

 “the children could” bran said “the children forest” reminded promise made osha godswood told luwin said

 maester listened politely “the wildling woman could give old nan lessons telling tales think” said bran done “i talk like would best trouble brother folly enough concern without fretting giants dead men woods it’s lannisters hold lord father bran children forest” put gentle hand bran’s arm “think said child”

 two days later red dawn broke across windswept sky bran found yard beneath gatehouse strapped atop dancer said farewells brother

 “you lord winterfell now” robb told mounted shaggy grey stallion shield hung horse’s side wood banded iron white grey snarling face direwolf brother wore grey chainmail bleached leathers sword dagger waist furtrimmed cloak across shoulders “you must take place took father’s come home”

 “i know” bran replied miserably never felt little alone scared know lord

 “listen maester luwin’s counsel take care rickon tell i’ll back soon fighting done”

 rickon refused come chamber redeyed defiant “no” he’d screamed bran asked didn’t want say farewell robb “no farewell”

 “i told him” bran said “he says one ever comes back”

 “he can’t baby forever he’s stark near four” robb sighed “well mother home soon i’ll bring back father promise”

 wheeled courser around trotted away grey wind followed loping beside warhorse lean swift hallis mollen went gate carrying rippling white banner house stark atop high standard grey ash theon greyjoy greatjon fell either side robb knights formed double column behind steeltipped lances glinting sun

 uncomfortably remembered osha’s words he’s marching wrong way thought instant wanted gallop shout warning robb vanished beneath portcullis moment gone

 beyond castle walls roar sound went foot soldiers townsfolk cheering robb rode past bran knew cheering lord stark lord winterfell great stallion cloak streaming grey wind racing beside would never cheer way realized dull ache might lord winterfell brother father gone still bran broken could even get horse except fall

 distant cheers faded silence yard empty last winterfell seemed deserted dead bran looked around faces remained women children old men… hodor huge stableboy lost frightened look face “hodor” said sadly

 “hodor” bran agreed wondering meant

 “yes” reports robert’s sudden death ned’s fall frightened catelyn could say would let son see fear “lord manderly told landed white harbor word sisters”

 “there letter” robb said scratching direwolf jaw “one well came winterfell mine” went table rummaged among maps papers returned crumpled parchment “this one wrote never thought bring yours”

 something robb’s tone troubled smoothed paper read concern gave way disbelief anger lastly fear “this cersei’s letter sister’s” said done “the real message sansa say kindly gently lannisters treating her… know sound threat even whispered sansa hostage mean keep her”

 “there’s mention arya” robb pointed miserable

 “what afraid robb” asked gently

 “i…” turned head away hide first tear “if march… even win… lannisters hold sansa father they’ll kill won’t they”

 “they want us think so”

 “you mean they’re lying”

 “i know robb know choice go king’s landing swear fealty never allowed leave turn tail retreat winterfell lords lose respect may even go lannisters queen much less fear likes prisoners best hope true hope defeat foe field chance take lord tywin kingslayer captive trade might well possible heart long power enough must fear ned sister safe cersei wise enough know may need make peace fighting go her”

 “what fighting doesn’t go her” robb asked “what goes us”

 catelyn took hand “robb soften truth lose hope us say naught stone heart casterly rock remember fate rhaegar’s children”

 saw fear young eyes strength well “then lose” vowed

 “tell know fighting riverlands” said learn truly ready

 “less fortnight past fought battle hills golden tooth” robb said “uncle edmure sent lord vance lord piper hold pass kingslayer descended put flight lord vance slain last word lord piper falling back join brother bannermen riverrun jaime lannister heels that’s worst though time battling pass lord tywin bringing second lannister army around south it’s said even larger jaime’s host

 “father must known sent men oppose king’s banner gave command southron lordling lord erik derik something like ser raymun darry rode letter said knights well force father’s guardsmen trap lord derik sooner crossed red fork lannisters fell upon king’s banner damned gregor clegane took rear tried pull back across mummer’s ford lord derik others may escaped one certain ser raymun killed men winterfell lord tywin closed kingsroad it’s said he’s marching north toward harrenhal burning goes”

 idea chilled catelyn bone chance would fifteenyearold boy seasoned battle commanders like jaime tywin lannister “is wise strongly placed it’s said old kings north could stand moat cailin throw back hosts ten times size own”

 “yes food supplies running low land live easily we’ve waiting lord manderly sons joined us need march”

 hearing lords bannermen speaking son’s voice realized years hosted many winterfell welcomed ned hearths tables knew sorts men one wondered robb

 yet sense said host son assembled standing army free cities accustomed maintain force guardsmen paid coin smallfolk crofters fieldhands fishermen sheepherders sons innkeeps traders tanners leavened smattering sellswords freeriders hungry plunder lords called came… forever “marching well” said son “but purpose mean do”

 robb hesitated “the greatjon thinks take battle lord tywin surprise him” said “but glovers karstarks feel we’d wiser go around army join uncle ser edmure kingslayer” ran fingers shaggy mane auburn hair looking unhappy “though time reach riverrun… i’m certain…”

 “be certain” catelyn told son “or go home take wooden sword cannot afford seem indecisive front men like roose bolton rickard karstark make mistake robb—these bannermen friends named battle commander command”

 son looked startled could credit hearing “as say mother”

 “i’ll ask mean do”

 robb drew map across table ragged piece old leather covered lines faded paint one end curled rolled weighed dagger “both plans virtues but… look try swing around lord tywin’s host take risk caught kingslayer attack him… reports men lot armored horse greatjon says won’t matter catch breeches seems man fought many battles tywin lannister won’t easily surprised”

 “good” said could hear echoes ned voice sat puzzling map “tell more”

 catelyn frowned map “you’d put river two parts army”

 “and jaime lord tywin” said eagerly smile came last “there’s crossing green fork ruby ford robert crown twins way lord frey controls bridge he’s father’s bannerman isn’t so”

 late lord frey catelyn thought “he is” admitted “but father never trusted you”

 “i won’t” robb promised “what think”

 impressed despite looks like tully thought yet he’s still father’s son ned taught well “which force would command”

 “the horse” answered like father ned would always take dangerous task

 “and other”

 “the greatjon always saying smash lord tywin thought i’d give honor”

 first misstep make see without wounding fledgling confidence “your father told greatjon fearless man ever known”

 robb grinned “grey wind ate two fingers laughed agree then”

 “your father fearless” catelyn pointed “he brave different”

 son considered moment “the eastern host stands lord tywin winterfell” said thoughtfully “well whatever bowmen leave moat don’t want someone fearless i”

 “no want cold cunning think courage”

 “roose bolton” robb said “that man scares me”

 “then let us pray scare tywin lannister well”

 robb nodded rolled map “i’ll give commands assemble escort take home winterfell”

 catelyn fought keep strong ned’s sake stubborn brave son put despair fear aside garments choose wear… saw donned

 “wine” voice answered ratfaced man gaoler stouter shorter though wore leather half cape spiked steel cap “drink lord eddard” thrust wineskin ned’s hands

 voice strangely familiar yet took ned stark moment place “varys” said groggily came touched man’s face “i’m not… dreaming you’re here” eunuch’s plump cheeks covered dark stubble beard ned felt coarse hair fingers varys transformed grizzled turnkey reeking sweat sour wine “how you… sort magician you”

 “your ends ends lord varys”

 “peace” varys replied without hesitation “if one soul king’s landing truly desperate keep robert baratheon alive me” sighed “for fifteen years protected enemies could protect friends strange fit madness led tell queen learned truth joffrey’s birth”

 “the madness mercy” ned admitted

 “ah” said varys “to sure honest honorable man lord eddard ofttimes forget met life” glanced around cell “when see honesty honor understand why”

 “cersei frightened lord… enemies fears even beloved jaime fighting river lords even lysa arryn sits eyrie ringed stone steel love lost queen dorne martells still brood murder princess elia babes son marches neck northern host back”

 “robb boy” ned said aghast

 “a boy army” varys said “yet boy say king’s brothers ones giving cersei sleepless nights… lord stannis particular claim true one known prowess battle commander utterly without mercy creature earth half terrifying truly man one knows stannis dragonstone wager he’s gathered swords seashells cersei’s nightmare father brother spend power battling starks tullys lord stannis land proclaim king lop son’s curly blond head… bargain though truly believe cares boy”

 “and let believe mine tell lord varys truly serve”

 varys smiled thinly “why realm good lord ever could doubt swear lost manhood serve realm realm needs peace” finished last swallow wine tossed empty skin aside “so answer lord eddard give word you’ll tell queen wants hear comes calling”

 “if word would hollow empty suit armor life precious that”

 “pity” eunuch stood “and daughter’s life lord precious that”

 chill pierced ned’s heart “my daughter…”

 “surely think i’d forgotten sweet innocent lord queen certainly not”

 “no” ned pleaded voice cracking “varys gods mercy like leave daughter schemes sansa’s child”

 “rhaenys child prince rhaegar’s daughter precious little thing younger girls small black kitten called balerion know always wondered happened rhaenys liked pretend true balerion black dread old imagine lannisters taught difference kitten dragon quick enough day broke door” varys gave long weary sigh sigh man carried sadness world sack upon shoulders “the high septon told sin suffer that’s true lord eddard tell me… always innocents suffer high lords play game thrones ponder would wait upon queen spare thought well next visitor calls could bring bread cheese milk poppy pain… could bring sansa’s head

 catelyn

 host trooped causeway black bogs neck spilled riverlands beyond catelyn’s apprehensions grew masked fears behind face kept still stern yet growing every league crossed days anxious nights restless every raven flew overhead made clench teeth

 feared lord father wondered ominous silence feared brother edmure prayed gods would watch must face kingslayer battle feared ned girls sweet sons left behind winterfell yet nothing could made put thought aside must save strength robb told one help must fierce hard north catelyn tully must stark true like son

 robb rode front column beneath flapping white banner winterfell day would ask one lords join might confer marched honored every man turn showing favorites listening lord father listened weighing words one learned much ned thought watched learned enough

 blackfish taken hundred picked men hundred swift horses raced ahead screen movements scout way reports ser brynden’s riders brought back little reassure lord tywin’s host still many days south… walder frey lord crossing assembled force near four thousand men castles green fork

 “late again” catelyn murmured heard trident damn man brother edmure called banners rights lord frey gone join tully host riverrun yet sat

 “four thousand men” robb repeated perplexed angry “lord frey cannot hope fight lannisters surely means join power ours”

 “does he” catelyn asked ridden forward join robb robett glover companion day vanguard spread behind slowmoving forest lances banners spears “i wonder expect nothing walder frey never surprised”

 “he’s father’s bannerman”

 “some men take oaths seriously others robb lord walder always friendlier casterly rock father would liked one sons wed tywin lannister’s sister means little sure lord walder sired great many children years must needs marry someone still…”

 “do think means betray us lannisters lady” robett glover asked gravely

 catelyn sighed “if truth told doubt even lord frey knows lord frey intends old man’s caution young man’s ambition never lacked cunning”

 “we must twins mother” robb said heatedly “there way across river know that”

 “yes walder frey sure that”

 night made camp southern edge bogs halfway kingsroad river theon greyjoy brought word uncle “ser brynden says tell he’s crossed swords lannisters dozen scouts won’t reporting back lord tywin anytime soon ever” grinned “ser addam marbrand commands outriders he’s pulling back south burning goes knows less blackfish vows know split”

 “unless lord frey tells him” catelyn said sharply “theon return uncle tell place best bowmen around twins day night orders bring raven see leaving battlements want birds bringing word son’s movements lord tywin”

 “ser brynden seen already lady” theon replied cocky smile “a blackbirds enough bake pie i’ll save feathers hat”

 ought known brynden blackfish would well ahead “what freys lannisters burn fields plunder holdfasts”

 “there’s fighting ser addam’s men lord walder’s” theon answered “not day’s ride found two lannister scouts feeding crows freys strung lord walder’s strength remains massed twins though”

 bore walder frey’s seal beyond doubt catelyn thought bitterly hold back wait watch take risk unless forced

 “if he’s fighting lannisters perhaps mean hold vows” robb said

 catelyn less encouraged “defending lands one thing open battle lord tywin quite another”

 robb turned back theon greyjoy “has blackfish found way across green fork”

 theon shook head “the river’s running high fast ser brynden says can’t forded far north”

 “i must crossing” robb declared fuming “oh horses might able swim river suppose armored men backs we’d need build rafts pole steel across helms mail lances don’t trees time lord tywin marching north…” balled hand fist

 “lord frey would fool try bar way” theon greyjoy said customary easy confidence “we five times numbers take twins need robb”

 “not easily” catelyn warned “and time mounting siege tywin lannister would bring host assault rear”

 robb glanced greyjoy searching answer finding none moment looked even younger fifteen years despite mail sword stubble cheeks “what would lord father do” asked

 “find way across” told “whatever took”

 next morning ser brynden tully rode back put aside heavy plate helm he’d worn knight gate lighter leatherandmail outrider obsidian fish still fastened cloak

 uncle’s face grave swung horse “there battle walls riverrun” said mouth grim “we lannister outrider took captive kingslayer destroyed edmure’s host sent lords trident reeling flight”

 cold hand clutched catelyn’s heart “and brother”

 “wounded taken prisoner” ser brynden said “lord blackwood survivors siege inside riverrun surrounded jaime’s host”

 robb looked fretful “we must get across accursed river we’re hope relieving time”

 “that easily done” uncle cautioned “lord frey pulled whole strength back inside castles gates closed barred”

 “damn man” robb swore “if old fool relent let cross he’ll leave choice storm walls i’ll pull twins around ears we’ll see well likes that”

 “you sound like sulky boy robb” catelyn said sharply “a child sees obstacle first thought run around knock lord must learn sometimes words accomplish swords cannot”

 robb’s neck reddened rebuke “tell mean mother” said meekly

 “the freys held crossing six hundred years six hundred years never failed exact toll”

 “what toll want”

 smiled “that must discover”

 “and choose pay toll”

 “then best retreat back moat cailin deploy meet lord tywin battle… grow wings see choices” catelyn put heels horse rode leaving son ponder words would make feel mother usurping place teach wisdom well valor ned wondered teach kneel graveyards seven kingdoms full brave men never learned lesson

 near midday vanguard came sight twins lords crossing seat

 old man squinted suspiciously “is doubt spare sweet words lady catelyn old boy proud come you”

 catelyn girl last time visited twins even lord walder irascible sharp tongue blunt manner age made worse ever would seem would need choose words care best take offense

 “father” ser stevron said reproachfully “you forget lady stark invitation”

 “did ask lord frey yet die look dead i’ll hear instructions you”

 “this way speak front noble guest father” one younger sons said

 “now bastards presume teach courtesy” lord walder complained “i’ll speak way like damn i’ve three kings guest life queens well think require lessons likes ryger mother milking goats first time gave seed” dismissed redfaced youth flick fingers gestured two sons “danwell whalen help chair”

 shifted lord walder litter carried high seat freys tall chair black oak whose back carved shape two towers linked bridge young wife crept timidly covered legs blanket settled old man beckoned catelyn forward planted papery dry kiss hand “there” announced “now observed courtesies lady perhaps sons honor shutting mouths here”

 “to ask open gates lord” catelyn replied politely “my son lords bannermen anxious cross river way”

 “to riverrun” sniggered “oh need tell need i’m blind yet old man still read map”

 catelyn would gladly spitted querulous old man roasted fire till evenfall open bridge calmly said “all reason must reach riverrun soon go talk lord”

 “we’re talking now” lord frey complained spotted pink head snapped around “what looking at” shouted kin “get lady stark wants speak private might designs fidelity heh go find something useful yes woman out” sons grandsons daughters bastards nieces nephews streamed hall leaned close catelyn confessed “they’re waiting die stevron’s waiting forty years keep disappointing heh die lord ask won’t it”

 “i every hope live hundred”

 “that would boil sure oh sure want say”

 “we want cross” catelyn told

 “they’ll twenty thousand fresh corpses lord tywin gets here” old man shot back “don’t try frighten lady husband’s traitor’s cell red keep father’s sick might dying jaime lannister’s got brother chains fear son i’ll match son son i’ll still eighteen dead”

 “you swore oath father” catelyn reminded

 bobbed head side side smiling “oh yes said words swore oaths crown seems joffrey’s king makes boy fools better rebels sense gods gave fish i’d help lannisters boil all”

 “i’m certain give many sons”

 catelyn frowned disquieted “i understood lysa’s boy fostered lord tywin casterly rock”

 “no lord stannis” walder frey said irritably “do think can’t tell lord stannis lord tywin they’re bungholes think they’re noble shit never mind know difference think i’m old can’t remember i’m ninety remember well remember woman wife mine give son time next year i’ll wager daughter can’t helped boy girl red wrinkled squalling like she’ll want name walder walda”

 “are well snow” lord mormont asked scowling

 “well” raven squawked “well”

 “i lord” jon lied… loudly could make true “and you”

 mormont frowned “a dead man tried kill well could be” scratched chin shaggy grey beard singed fire he’d hacked pale stubble new whiskers made look old disreputable grumpy “you look well hand”

 “healing” jon flexed bandaged fingers show burned badly knew throwing flaming drapes right hand swathed silk halfway elbow time he’d felt nothing agony come cracked red skin oozed fluid fearsome blood blisters rose fingers big roaches “the maester says i’ll scars otherwise hand good before”

 “a scarred hand nothing wall you’ll wearing gloves often not”

 “as say lord” thought scars troubled jon rest maester aemon given milk poppy yet even pain hideous first felt hand still aflame burning day night plunging basins snow shaved ice gave relief jon thanked gods one ghost saw writhing bed whimpering pain last sleep dreamt even worse dream corpse fought blue eyes black hands father’s face dared tell mormont

 “dywen hake returned last night” old bear said “they found sign uncle others did”

 “i know” jon dragged common hall sup friends failure rangers’ search men talking

 “you know” mormont grumbled “how everyone knows everything around here” seem expect answer “it would seem two of… creatures whatever call men thank gods and… well doesn’t bear thinking though feel old bones mine maester aemon agrees cold winds rising summer end winter coming world never seen”

 winter coming stark words never sounded grim ominous jon “my lord” asked hesitantly “it’s said bird last night…”

 “there it”

 “i hoped word father”

 “father” taunted old raven bobbing head walked across mormont’s shoulders “father”

 lord commander reached pinch beak shut raven hopped head fluttered wings flew across chamber light window “grief noise” mormont grumbled “that’s they’re good ravens put pestilential bird… news lord eddard don’t think would sent bastard you’re still blood message concerned ser barristan selmy seems he’s removed kingsguard gave place black dog clegane selmy’s wanted treason fools sent watchmen seize slew two escaped” mormont snorted leaving doubt view men who’d send gold cloaks knight renowed barristan bold “we white shadows woods unquiet dead stalking halls boy sits iron throne” said disgust

 raven laughed shrilly “boy boy boy boy”

 ser barristan old bear’s best hope jon remembered fallen chance mormont’s letter would heeded curled hand fist pain shot burned fingers “what sisters”

 “the message made mention lord eddard girls” gave irritated shrug “perhaps never got letter aemon sent two copies best birds say like pycelle deign reply would first time last fear count less nothing king’s landing tell us want us know that’s little enough”

 tell want know that’s less jon thought resentfully brother robb called banners ridden south war yet word breathed him… save samwell tarly who’d read letter maester aemon whispered contents jon night secret time saying shouldn’t doubtless thought brother’s war none concern troubled could say robb marching matter often jon told place new brothers wall still felt craven

 “corn” raven crying “corn corn”

 “oh quiet” old bear told “snow soon maester aemon say you’ll use hand back”

 “soon” jon replied

 “good” table lord mormont laid large sword black metal scabbard banded silver “here you’ll ready then”

 raven flapped landed table strutting toward sword head cocked curiously jon hesitated inkling meant “my lord”

 “the fire melted silver pommel burnt crossguard grip well dry leather old wood could expect blade now… you’d need fire hundred times hot harm blade” mormont shoved scabbard across rough oak planks “i rest made anew take it”

 “take it” echoed raven preening “take take it”

 awkwardly jon took sword hand left hand bandaged right still raw clumsy carefully pulled scabbard raised level eyes

 pommel hunk pale stone weighted lead balance long blade carved likeness snarling wolf’s head chips garnet set eyes grip virgin leather soft black yet unstained sweat blood blade good half foot longer jon used tapered thrust well slash three fullers deeply incised metal ice true twohanded greatsword handandahalfer sometimes named “bastard sword” yet wolf sword actually seemed lighter blades wielded jon turned sideways could see ripples dark steel metal folded back “this valyrian steel lord” said wonderingly father let handle ice often enough knew look feel

 “it is” old bear told “it father’s sword father’s mormonts carried five centuries wielded day passed son took black”

 giving son’s sword jon could scarcely believe blade exquisitely balanced edges glimmered faintly kissed light “your son—”

 “my son brought dishonor house mormont least grace leave sword behind fled sister returned keeping sight reminded jorah’s shame put aside thought found ashes bedchamber original pommel bear’s head silver yet worn features indistinguishable thought white wolf apt one builders fair stonecarver”

 jon bran’s age dreamed great deeds boys always details feats changed every dreaming quite often imagined saving father’s life afterward lord eddard would declare jon proved true stark place ice hand even known child’s folly bastard could ever hope wield father’s sword even memory shamed kind man stole brother’s birthright right thought ice twitched burned fingers feeling throb pain deep skin “my lord honor but—”

 “spare but’s boy” lord mormont interrupted “i would sitting beast fought bravely… point thought quickly fire yes damn ought known ought remembered long night come oh eight thousand years good sure… yet night’s watch remember will”

 “who will” chimed talkative raven “who will”

 truly gods heard jon’s prayer night fire caught dead man’s clothing consumed flesh candle wax bones old dry wood jon close eyes see thing staggering across solar crashing furniture flailing flames face haunted surrounded nimbus fire hair blazing like straw dead flesh melting away sloughing skull reveal gleam bone beneath

 whatever demonic force moved othor driven flames twisted thing found ashes cooked meat charred bone yet nightmare faced again… time burning corpse wore lord eddard’s features father’s skin burst blackened father’s eyes ran liquid cheeks like jellied tears jon understand might mean frightened could say

 “a sword’s small payment life” mormont concluded “take i’ll hear understood”

 “yes lord” soft leather gave beneath jon’s fingers sword molding grip already knew honored yet…

 father thought leapt unbidden jon’s mind lord eddard stark father forget matter many swords give yet could scarcely tell lord mormont another man’s sword dreamt of…

 “i want courtesies either” mormont said “so thank thanks honor steel deeds words”

 jon nodded “does name lord”

 “it longclaw called”

 “claw” raven cried “claw”

 “longclaw apt name” jon tried practice cut clumsy uncomfortable left hand yet even steel seemed flow air “wolves claws much bears”

 old bear seemed pleased “i suppose you’ll want wear shoulder imagine it’s long hip least you’ve put inches you’ll need work twohanded strikes well ser endrew show moves burns healed”

 “ser endrew” jon know name

 “ser endrew tarth good man he’s way shadow tower assume duties masteratarms ser alliser thorne left yestermorn eastwatchbythesea”

 jon lowered sword “why” said stupidly

 mormont snorted “because sent think he’s bringing hand ghost tore end jafer flowers’s wrist commanded take ship king’s landing lay boy king get young joffrey’s attention i’d think… ser alliser’s knight highborn anointed old friends court altogether harder ignore glorified crow”

 “crow” jon thought raven sounded faintly indignant

 “as well” lord commander continued ignoring bird’s protest “it puts thousand leagues twixt without seeming rebuke” jabbed finger jon’s face “and don’t think means approve nonsense common hall valor makes fair amount folly you’re boy anymore however many years you’ve seen that’s man’s sword take man wield i’ll expect act part henceforth”

 “yes lord” jon slid sword back silverbanded scabbard blade would chosen nonetheless noble gift freeing alliser thorne’s malignance nobler still

 old bear scratched chin “i forgotten much new beard itches” said “well help hand healed enough resume duties”

 “yes lord”

 “good night cold i’ll want hot spice wine find flagon red sour don’t skimp spices tell hobb sends boiled mutton i’m like boil last haunch grey even bird wouldn’t touch it” stroked raven’s head thumb bird made contented quorking sound “away i’ve work do”

 guards smiled niches wound way turret stair carrying sword good hand “sweet steel” one man said “you earned snow” another told jon made smile back heart knew pleased yet feel hand ached taste anger mouth though could said angry

 half dozen friends lurking outside left king’s tower lord commander mormont made residence they’d hung target granary doors could seem honing skills archers knew lurkers saw sooner emerge pyp called “well come let’s look”

 “at what” jon said

 toad sidled close “your rosy butt cheeks else”

 “the sword” grenn stated “we want see sword”

 jon raked accusing look “you knew”

 pyp grinned “we’re dumb grenn”

 “you so” insisted grenn “you’re dumber”

 halder gave apologetic shrug “i helped pate carve stone pommel” builder said “and friend sam bought garnets mole’s town”

 “we knew even though” grenn said “rudge helping donal noye forge old bear brought burnt blade”

 “the sword” matt insisted others took chant “the sword sword sword”

 jon unsheathed longclaw showed turning way could admire bastard blade glittered pale sunlight dark deadly “valyrian steel” declared solemnly trying sound pleased proud ought felt

 “i heard man razor made valyrian steel” declared toad “he cut head trying shave”

 pyp grinned “the night’s watch thousands years old” said “but i’ll wager lord snow’s first brother ever honored burning lord commander’s tower”

 others laughed even jon smile fire he’d started truth burned formidable stone tower done fair job gutting interior top two floors old bear chambers one seemed mind much since also destroyed othor’s murderous corpse

 wight onehanded thing ranger named jafer flowers also destroyed cut near pieces dozen swords… slain ser jaremy rykker four men ser jaremy finished job hacking head yet died headless corpse pulled dagger sheath buried bowels strength courage avail much foemen would fall already dead even arms armor offered small protection

 grim thought soured jon’s fragile mood “i need see hobb old bear’s supper” announced brusquely sliding longclaw back scabbard friends meant well understand fault truly face othor seen pale glow dead blue eyes felt cold dead black fingers know fighting riverlands could hope comprehend turned away abruptly strode sullen pyp called jon paid mind

 moved back old cell tumbledown hardin’s tower fire returned ghost curled asleep beside door lifted head sound jon’s boots direwolf’s red eyes darker garnets wiser men jon knelt scratched ear showed pommel sword “look it’s you”

 ghost sniffed carved stone likeness tried lick jon smiled “you’re one deserves honor” told wolf… suddenly found remembering he’d found day late summer snow riding pups jon heard noise turned back white fur almost invisible drifts alone thought apart others litter different drove

 “jon” looked samwell tarly stood rocking nervously heels cheeks red wrapped heavy fur cloak made look ready hibernation

 “sam” jon stood “what want see sword” others known doubt sam

 fat boy shook head “i heir father’s blade once” said mournfully “heartsbane lord randyll let hold times always scared valyrian steel beautiful sharp afraid i’d hurt one sisters dickon now” wiped sweaty hands cloak “i ah… maester aemon wants see you”

 time bandages changed jon frowned suspiciously “why” demanded sam looked miserable answer enough “you told didn’t you” jon said angrily “you told told me”

 “i… he… jon didn’t want to… asked… mean think knew sees things one else sees…”

 “he’s blind” jon pointed forcefully disgusted “i find way myself” left sam standing openmouthed quivering

 found maester aemon rookery feeding ravens clydas carrying bucket chopped meat shuffled cage cage “sam said wanted me”

 maester nodded “i indeed clydas give jon bucket perhaps kind enough assist me” hunched pinkeyed brother handed jon bucket scurried ladder “toss meat cages” aemon instructed “the birds rest “

 jon shifted bucket right hand thrust left bloody bits ravens began scream noisily fly bars beating metal nightblack wings meat chopped pieces larger finger joint filled fist tossed raw red morsels cage squawking squabbling grew hotter feathers flew two larger birds fought choice piece quickly jon grabbed second handful threw first “lord mormont’s raven likes fruit corn”

 “he rare bird” maester said “most ravens eat grain prefer flesh makes strong fear relish taste blood like men… like men ravens alike”

 jon nothing say threw meat wondering he’d summoned doubt old man would tell good time maester aemon man hurried

 “doves pigeons also trained carry messages” maester went “though raven stronger flyer larger bolder far clever better able defend hawks… yet ravens black eat dead godly men abhor baelor blessed tried replace ravens doves know” maester turned white eyes jon smiling “the night’s watch prefers ravens”

 jon’s fingers bucket blood wrist “dywen says wildlings call us crows” said uncertainty

 “the crow raven’s poor cousin beggars black hated misunderstood”

 jon wished understood talking care ravens doves old man something say couldn’t say

 “jon ever wonder men night’s watch take wives father children” maester aemon asked

 jon shrugged “no” scattered meat fingers left hand slimy blood right throbbed weight bucket

 “so love” old man answered “for love bane honor death duty”

 sound right jon yet said nothing maester hundred years old high officer night’s watch place contradict

 old man seemed sense doubts “tell jon day ever come lord father must needs choose honor one hand loves would do”

 jon hesitated wanted say lord eddard would never dishonor even love yet inside small sly voice whispered fathered bastard honor mother duty even say name “he would whatever right” said… ringingly make hesitation “no matter what”

 “then lord eddard man ten thousand us strong honor compared woman’s love duty feel newborn son arms… memory brother’s smile wind words wind words human gods fashioned us love great glory great tragedy

 “the men formed night’s watch knew courage shielded realm darkness north knew must divided loyalties weaken resolve vowed would wives children

 “yet brothers sisters mothers gave birth fathers gave names came hundred quarrelsome kingdoms knew times may change men pledged well night’s watch would take part battles realms guarded

 “they kept pledge aegon slew black harren claimed kingdom harren’s brother lord commander wall ten thousand swords hand march days seven kingdoms seven kingdoms generation passed three four war watch took part andals crossed narrow sea swept away kingdoms first men sons fallen kings held true vows remained posts always years beyond counting price honor

 “a craven brave man nothing fear duty cost easy seems walk path honor yet soon late every man’s life comes day easy day must choose”

 ravens still eating long stringy bits meat dangling beaks rest seemed watching jon could feel weight tiny black eyes “and day… you’re saying”

 maester aemon turned head looked dead white eyes seeing right heart jon felt naked exposed took bucket hands flung rest slops bars strings meat blood flew everywhere scattering ravens took air shrieking wildly quicker birds snatched morsels wing gulped greedily jon let empty bucket clang floor

 old man laid withered spotted hand shoulder “it hurts boy” said softly “oh yes choosing… always hurt always know”

 “you don’t know” jon said bitterly “no one knows even bastard he’s still father…”

 maester aemon sighed “have heard nothing i’ve told jon think first” shook ancient head gesture weary beyond words “three times gods saw fit test vows boy fullness manhood grown old strength fled eyes grown dim yet last choice cruel first ravens would bring news south words darker wings ruin house death kin disgrace desolation could done old blind frail helpless suckling babe yet still grieved sit forgotten cut brother’s poor grandson son even little children…”

 jon shocked see shine tears old man’s eyes “who you” asked quietly almost dread

 toothless smile quivered ancient lips “only maester citadel bound service castle black night’s watch order put aside house names take vows collar” old man touched maester’s chain hung loosely around thin fleshless neck “my father maekar first name brother aegon reigned stead grandfather named prince aemon dragonknight uncle father depending tale believe aemon called me…”

 “aemon… targaryen” jon could scarcely believe

 “once” old man said “once see jon know… knowing tell stay go must make choice live rest days have” voice fell whisper “as have…”

 catelyn

 woods full whispers

 moonlight winked tumbling waters stream wound rocky way along floor valley beneath trees warhorses whickered softly pawed moist leafy ground men made nervous jests hushed voices heard chink spears faint metallic slither chain mail even sounds muffled

 “it long lady” hallis mollen said asked honor protecting battle come right winterfell’s captain guards robb refused thirty men around charged keep unharmed see safely home winterfell fighting went robb wanted fifty catelyn insisted ten would enough would need every sword fight made peace thirty neither happy

 “it come comes” catelyn told came knew would mean death hal’s death perhaps… robb’s one safe life certain catelyn content wait listen whispers woods faint music brook feel warm wind hair

 stranger waiting men always made wait “watch little cat” father would always tell rode court fair battle would standing patiently battlements riverrun waters red fork tumblestone flowed always come said would days would ofttimes pass catelyn stood vigil peering crenels arrow loops caught glimpse lord hoster old brown gelding trotting along rivershore toward landing “did watch me” he’d ask bent bug “did little cat”

 “no” son answered peeling bloody glove “he’s use alive dead lord father never condoned murder prisoners battle”

 “a wise man” jaime lannister said “and honorable”

 “take away put irons” catelyn said

 “do lady mother says” robb commanded “and make certain there’s strong guard around lord karstark want head pike”

 “that will” greatjon agreed gesturing lannister led away bandaged chained

 “why lord karstark want dead” catelyn asked

 robb looked away woods brooding look ned often got “he… killed them…”

 “lord karstark’s sons” galbart glover explained

 “both them” said robb “torrhen eddard daryn hornwood well”

 “no one fault lannister courage” glover said “when saw lost rallied retainers fought way valley hoping reach lord robb cut almost did”

 “he mislaid sword eddard karstark’s neck took torrhen’s hand split daryn hornwood’s skull open” robb said “all time shouting hadn’t tried stop him—”

 “—i mourning place lord karstark” catelyn said “your men sworn robb died protecting liege lord grieve honor valor time grief may lopped head snake three quarters body still coiled around father’s castle battle war”

 “but battle” said theon greyjoy eagerly “my lady realm seen victory since field fire vow lannisters lost ten men every one fell we’ve taken close hundred knights captive dozen lords bannermen lord westerling lord banefort ser garth greenfield lord estren ser tytos brax mallor dornishman… three lannisters besides jaime lord tywin’s nephews two sister’s sons one dead brother’s…”

 “and lord tywin” catelyn interrupted “have perchance taken lord tywin theon”

 “no” greyjoy answered brought short

 “until war far done”

 robb raised head pushed hair back eyes “my mother right still riverrun”

 arya

 scent hot bread drifting shops along street flour sweeter perfume arya ever smelled took deep breath stepped closer pigeon plump one speckled brown busily pecking crust fallen two cobblestones arya’s shadow touched took air

 stick sword whistled caught two feet ground went flurry brown feathers blink eye grabbing wing pigeon flapped fluttered pecked hand grabbed neck twisted felt bone snap

 compared catching cats pigeons easy

 passing septon looking askance “here’s best place find pigeon” arya told brushed picked fallen stick sword “they come crumbs” hurried away

 tied pigeon belt started street man pushing load tarts twowheeled cart smells sang blueberries lemons apricots stomach made hollow rumbly noise “could one” heard say “a lemon or… kind”

 pushcart man looked plainly like saw “three coppers”

 arya tapped wooden sword side boot “i’ll trade fat pigeon” said

 “the others take pigeon” pushcart man said

 tarts still warm oven smells making mouth water three coppers… one gave pushcart man look remembering syrio told seeing short little round belly moved seemed favor left leg little thinking snatched tart ran would never able catch said “you keepin’ filthy hands gold cloaks know deal thieving little gutter rats do”

 arya glanced warily behind two city watch standing mouth alley cloaks hung almost ground heavy wool dyed rich gold mail boots gloves black one wore longsword hip iron cudgel last wistful glance tarts arya edged back cart hurried gold cloaks paying special attention sight tied stomach knots arya staying far castle could get yet even distance could see heads rotting atop high red walls flocks crows squabbled noisily head thick flies talk flea bottom gold cloaks thrown lannisters commander raised lord lands trident seat king’s council

 outside city would find berries pick orchards might raid apples cherries arya remembered seeing kingsroad journey south could dig roots forest even run rabbits city things run rats cats scrawny dogs potshops would give fistful coppers litter pups she’d heard didn’t like think

 street flour maze twisting alleys cross streets arya scrambled crowds trying put distance gold cloaks learned keep center street sometimes dodge wagons horses least could see coming walked near buildings people grabbed alleys couldn’t help brush walls buildings leaned close almost met

 whooping gang small children went running past chasing rolling hoop arya stared resentment remembering times she’d played hoops bran jon baby brother rickon wondered big rickon grown whether bran sad would given anything jon call “little sister” muss hair needed mussing she’d seen reflection puddles didn’t think hair got mussed

 tried talking children saw street hoping make friend would give place sleep must talked wrong something little ones looked quick wary eyes ran away came close big brothers sisters asked questions arya couldn’t answer called names tried steal yesterday scrawny barefoot girl twice age knocked tried pull boots feet arya gave crack ear stick sword sent sobbing bleeding

 gull wheeled overhead made way hill toward flea bottom arya glanced thoughtfully well beyond reach stick made think sea maybe way old nan used tell stories boys stowed away trading galleys sailed kinds adventures maybe arya could decided visit riverfront way mud gate anyway hadn’t checked one today

 wharfs oddly quiet arya got spied another pair gold cloaks walking side side fish market never much looked half stalls empty seemed fewer ships dock remembered blackwater three king’s war galleys moved formation goldpainted hulls splitting water oars rose fell arya watched bit began make way along river

 saw guardsmen third pier grey woolen cloaks trimmed white satin heart almost stopped chest sight winterfell’s colors brought tears eyes behind sleek threebanked trading galley rocked moorings arya could read name painted hull words strange myrish braavosi perhaps even high valyrian grabbed passing longshoreman sleeve “please” said “what ship this”

 “she’s wind witch myr” man said

 “she’s still here” arya blurted longshoreman gave queer look shrugged walked away arya ran toward pier wind witch ship father hired take home… still waiting she’d imagined sailed ages ago

 two guardsmen dicing together third walked rounds hand pommel sword ashamed let see crying like baby stopped rub eyes eyes eyes eyes did…

 look eyes heard syrio whisper

 arya looked knew father’s men three grey cloaks strangers “you” one walking rounds called “what want boy” two looked dice

 far across city bells began ring

 arya glanced listening wondering ringing meant time

 “what’s now” fat man called potshop

 “the bells gods ha’mercy” wailed old woman

 redhaired whore wisp painted silk pushed open secondstory window “is boy king that’s died now” shouted leaning street “ah that’s boy never last long” laughed naked man slid arms around behind biting neck rubbing heavy white breasts hung loose beneath shift

 “stupid slut” fat man shouted “the king’s dead that’s summoning bells one tower tolling king dies ring every bell city”

 “here quit biting i’ll ring bells” woman window said man behind pushing elbow “so died king”

 “it’s summoning” fat man repeated

 two boys close arya’s age scampered past splashing puddle old woman cursed kept right going people moving heading hill see noise arya ran slower boy “where going” shouted right behind “what’s happening”

 glanced back without slowing “the gold cloaks carryin’ sept”

 “who” yelled running hard

 “the hand they’ll taking head buu says”

 passing wagon left deep rut street boy leapt arya never saw tripped fell face first scraping knee open stone smashing fingers hands hit hardpacked earth needle tangled legs sobbed struggled knees thumb left hand covered blood sucked saw half thumbnail gone ripped fall hands throbbed knee bloody

 everyone moving direction hurry see ringing bells seemed louder clanging calling arya joined stream people thumb hurt bad nail broken could cry bit lip limped along listening excited voices around

 “—the king’s hand lord stark they’re carrying baelor’s sept”

 “i heard dead”

 “soon enough soon enough got silver stag says lop head off”

 “well don’t mean anoint knight heard stark killed old king robert slit throat woods found stood cool please said old boar grace”

 “ah that’s true brother renly gold antlers”

 “you shut lying mouth woman don’t know you’re saying lordship’s fine true man”

 time reached street sisters packed shoulder shoulder arya let human current carry along top visenya’s hill white marble plaza solid mass people yammering excitedly straining get closer great sept baelor bells loud

 arya squirmed press ducking legs horses clutching tight sword stick middle crowd could see arms legs stomachs seven slender towers sept looming overhead spotted wood wagon thought climb back might able see others idea teamster cursed drove crack whip

 arya grew frantic forcing way front crowd shoved stone plinth looked baelor blessed septon king sliding stick sword belt arya began climb broken thumbnail left smears blood painted marble made wedged king’s feet

 saw father

 lord eddard stood high septon’s pulpit outside doors sept supported two gold cloaks dressed rich grey velvet doublet white wolf sewn front beads grey wool cloak trimmed fur thinner arya ever seen long face drawn pain standing much held cast broken leg grey rotten

 high septon stood behind squat man grey age ponderously fat wearing long white robes immense crown spun gold crystal wreathed head rainbows whenever moved

 clustered around doors sept front raised marble pulpit knot knights high lords joffrey prominent among raiment crimson silk satin patterned prancing stags roaring lions gold crown head queen mother stood beside black mourning gown slashed crimson veil black diamonds hair arya recognized hound wearing snowy white cloak dark grey armor four kingsguard around saw varys eunuch gliding among lords soft slippers patterned damask robe thought short man silvery cape pointed beard might one fought duel mother

 midst sansa dressed skyblue silk long auburn hair washed curled silver bracelets wrists arya scowled wondering sister looked happy

 long line goldcloaked spearmen held back crowd commanded stout man elaborate armor black lacquer gold filigree cloak metallic shimmer true clothofgold

 bell ceased toll quiet slowly settled across great plaza father lifted head began speak voice thin weak could scarcely make people behind began shout “what” “louder” man blackandgold armor stepped behind father prodded sharply leave alone arya wanted shout knew one would listen chewed lip

 father raised voice began “i eddard stark lord winterfell hand king” said loudly voice carrying across plaza “and come confess treason sight gods men”

 “no” arya whimpered crowd began scream shout taunts obscenities filled air sansa hidden face hands

 father raised voice still higher straining heard “i betrayed faith king trust friend robert” shouted “i swore defend protect children yet blood cold plotted depose murder son seize throne let high septon baelor beloved seven bear witness truth say joffrey baratheon one true heir iron throne grace gods lord seven kingdoms protector realm”

 stone came sailing crowd arya cried saw father hit gold cloaks kept falling blood ran face deep gash across forehead stones followed one struck guard father’s left another went clanging breastplate knight blackandgold armor two kingsguard stepped front joffrey queen protecting shields

 hand slid beneath cloak found needle sheath tightened fingers around grip squeezing hard ever squeezed anything please gods keep safe prayed don’t let hurt father

 high septon knelt joffrey mother “as sin suffer” intoned deep swelling voice much louder father’s “this man confessed crimes sight gods men holy place” rainbows danced around head lifted hands entreaty “the gods yet blessed baelor taught us also merciful shall done traitor grace”

 thousand voices screaming arya never heard prince joffrey… king joffrey… stepped behind shields kingsguard “my mother bids let lord eddard take black lady sansa begged mercy father” looked straight sansa smiled moment arya thought gods heard prayer joffrey turned back crowd said “but soft hearts women long king treason shall never go unpunished ser ilyn bring head”

 crowd roared arya felt statue baelor rock surged high septon clutched king’s cape varys came rushing waving arms even queen saying something joffrey shook head lords knights moved aside stepped tall fleshless skeleton iron mail king’s justice dimly far arya heard sister scream sansa fallen knees sobbing hysterically ser ilyn payne climbed steps pulpit

 arya wriggled baelor’s feet threw crowd drawing needle landed man butcher’s apron knocking ground immediately someone slammed back almost went bodies closed around stumbling pushing trampling poor butcher arya slashed needle

 high atop pulpit ser ilyn payne gestured knight blackandgold gave command gold cloaks flung lord eddard marble head chest edge

 “here you” angry voice shouted arya bowled past shoving people aside squirming slamming anyone way hand fumbled leg hacked kicked shins woman stumbled arya ran back cutting sides good good many people sooner make hole closed someone buffeted aside could still hear sansa screaming

 ser ilyn drew twohanded greatsword scabbard back lifted blade head sunlight seemed ripple dance dark metal glinting edge sharper razor ice thought ice tears streamed face blinding

 hand shot press closed round arm like wolf trap hard needle went flying hand arya wrenched feet would fallen hadn’t held easy doll face pressed close long black hair tangled beard rotten teeth “don’t look” thick voice snarled

 “i… i… i…” arya sobbed

 old man shook hard teeth rattled “shut mouth close eyes boy” dimly far away heard a… noise… soft sighing sound million people let breath old man’s fingers dug arm stiff iron “look yes that’s way me” sour wine perfumed breath “remember boy”

 smell arya saw matted greasy hair patched dusty black cloak covered twisted shoulders hard black eyes squinting remembered black brother come visit father

 “know there’s bright boy” spat “they’re done you’ll coming you’ll keeping mouth shut” started reply shook even harder “shut said”

 plaza beginning empty press dissolved around people drifted back lives arya’s life gone numb trailed along beside… yoren yes name yoren recall finding needle handed sword back “hope use boy”

 “i’m not—” started

 shoved doorway thrust dirty fingers hair gave twist yanking head back “—not smart boy mean say”

 blade flashed toward face arya threw backward kicking wildly wrenching head side side hair strong could feel scalp tearing lips salt taste tears





 bran

 oldest men grown seventeen eighteen years day naming one past twenty younger sixteen less

 bran watched balcony maester luwin’s turret listening grunt strain curse swung staves wooden swords yard alive clack wood wood punctuated often thwacks yowls pain blow struck leather flesh ser rodrik strode among boys face reddening beneath white whiskers muttering one bran never seen old knight look fierce “no” kept saying “no no”

 “they don’t fight well” bran said dubiously scratched summer idly behind ears direwolf tore haunch meat bones crunched teeth

 “for certainty” maester luwin agreed deep sigh maester peering big myrish lens tube measuring shadows noting position comet hung low morning sky “yet given time… ser rodrik truth need men walk walls lord father took cream guard king’s landing brother took rest along likely lads leagues around many come back us must needs find men take places”

 bran stared resentfully sweating boys “if still legs could beat all” remembered last time he’d held sword hand king come winterfell wooden sword yet he’d knocked prince tommen half hundred times “ser rodrik teach use poleaxe poleaxe big long haft hodor could legs could knight together”

 “i think that… unlikely” maester luwin said “bran man fights arms legs thoughts must one”

 yard ser rodrik yelling “you fight like goose pecks peck harder parry block blow goose fighting suffice real swords first peck would take arm off” one boys laughed old knight rounded “you laugh gall fight like hedgehog…”

 “there knight couldn’t see” bran said stubbornly ser rodrik went “old nan told long staff blades ends could spin hands chop two men once”

 “symeon stareyes” luwin said marked numbers book “when lost eyes put star sapphires empty sockets singers claim bran story like tales florian fool fable age heroes” maester tsked “you must put dreams aside break heart”

 mention dreams reminded “i dreamed crow last night one three eyes flew bedchamber told come went crypts father talked sad”

 “and that” luwin peered tube

 “it something jon think” dream deeply disturbing crow dreams “hodor won’t go crypts”

 maester half listening bran could tell lifted eye tube blinking “hodor won’t…”

 “go crypts woke told take see father truly first didn’t know saying got steps telling go go wouldn’t go stood top step said ‘hodor’ like scared dark torch made mad almost gave swat head like old nan always doing” saw way maester frowning hurriedly added “i didn’t though”

 “good hodor man mule beaten”

 “in dream flew crow can’t i’m awake” bran explained

 “why would want go crypts”

 “i told look father”

 maester tugged chain around neck often uncomfortable “bran sweet child one day lord eddard sit stone beside father father’s father starks back old kings north… many years gods good father prisoner queen king’s landing find crypts”

 “he last night talked him”

 “stubborn boy” maester sighed setting book aside “would like go see”

 “i can’t hodor won’t go steps narrow twisty dancer”

 “i believe solve difficulty”

 place hodor wildling woman osha summoned tall tough uncomplaining willing go wherever commanded “i lived life beyond wall hole ground won’t fret none m’lords” said

 “summer come” bran called lifted wirystrong arms direwolf left bone followed osha carried bran across yard spiral steps cold vault earth maester luwin went ahead torch bran even mind—too badly—that carried arms back ser rodrik ordered osha’s chain struck since served faithfully well since winterfell still wore heavy iron shackles around ankles—a sign yet wholly trusted—but hinder sure strides steps

 bran could recall last time crypts certain little used play robb jon sisters

 wished vault might seemed dark scary summer stalked echoing gloom stopped lifted head sniffed chill dead air bared teeth crept backward eyes glowing golden light maester’s torch even osha hard old iron seemed uncomfortable “grim folk look them” said eyed long row granite starks stone thrones

 “they kings winter” bran whispered somehow felt wrong talk loudly place

 osha smiled “winter’s got king you’d seen you’d know summer boy”

 “they kings north thousands years” maester luwin said lifting torch high light shone stone faces hairy bearded shaggy men fierce wolves crouched feet others shaved clean features gaunt sharpedged iron longswords across laps “hard men hard time come” strode briskly vault past procession stone pillars endless carved figures tongue flame trailed back upraised torch went

 vault cavernous longer winterfell jon told levels underneath vaults even deeper darker older kings buried would lose light summer refused move steps even osha followed torch bran arms

 “do recall history bran” maester said walked “tell osha can”

 looked passing faces tales came back maester told stories old nan made come alive “that one jon stark sea raiders landed east drove built castle white harbor son rickard stark father’s father another rickard took neck away marsh king married daughter theon stark’s real thin one long hair skinny beard called ‘hungry wolf’ always war that’s brandon tall one dreamy face brandon shipwright loved sea tomb empty tried sail west across sunset sea never seen son brandon burner put torch father’s ships grief there’s rodrik stark bear island wrestling match gave mormonts that’s torrhen stark king knelt last king north first lord winterfell yielded aegon conqueror oh he’s cregan stark fought prince aemon dragonknight said he’d never faced finer swordsman” almost end bran felt sadness creeping “and there’s grandfather lord rickard beheaded mad king aerys daughter lyanna son brandon tombs beside another brandon father’s brother they’re supposed statues that’s lords kings father loved much done”

 “the maid’s fair one” osha said

 “robert betrothed marry prince rhaegar carried raped her” bran explained “robert fought war win back killed rhaegar trident hammer lyanna died never got back all”

 “a sad tale” said osha “but empty holes sadder”

 “lord eddard’s tomb time comes” maester luwin said “is saw father dream bran”

 “yes” memory made shiver looked around vault uneasily hairs back neck bristling heard noise someone

 maester luwin stepped toward open sepulchre torch hand “as see he’s many year dreams dreams child” thrust arm blackness inside tomb mouth great beast “do see it’s quite empt—”

 darkness sprang snarling

 bran saw eyes like green fire flash teeth fur black pit around maester luwin yelled threw hands torch went flying fingers caromed stone face brandon stark tumbled statue’s feet flames licking legs drunken shifting torchlight saw luwin struggling direwolf beating muzzle one hand jaws closed

 “summer” bran screamed

 summer came shooting dimness behind leaping shadow slammed shaggydog knocked back two direwolves rolled tangle grey black fur snapping biting maester luwin struggled knees arm torn bloody osha propped bran lord rickard’s stone wolf hurried assist maester light guttering torch shadow wolves twenty feet tall fought wall roof

 “shaggy” small voice called bran looked little brother standing mouth father’s tomb one final snap summer’s face shaggydog broke bounded rickon’s side “you let father be” rickon warned luwin “you let be”

 “rickon” bran said softly “father’s here”

 “yes saw him” tears glistened rickon’s face “i saw last night”

 “in dream…”

 rickon nodded “you leave leave he’s coming home like promised he’s coming home”

 bran never seen maester luwin took uncertain blood dripped arm shaggydog shredded wool sleeve flesh beneath “osha torch” said biting pain snatched went soot stains blackened legs uncle’s likeness “that… beast” luwin went “is supposed chained kennels”

 rickon patted shaggydog’s muzzle damp blood “i let loose doesn’t like chains” licked fingers

 “rickon” bran said “would like come me”

 “no like here”

 “it’s dark cold”

 “i’m afraid wait father”

 “you wait me” bran said “we’ll wait together wolves” direwolves licking wounds would bear close watching

 “bran” maester said firmly “i know mean well shaggydog wild run loose i’m third man he’s savaged give freedom castle it’s question time kills someone truth hard wolf chained or…” hesitated

 …or killed bran thought said “he made chains wait tower us”

 “that quite impossible” maester luwin said

 osha grinned “the boy’s lordling recall” handed luwin back torch scooped bran arms “the maester’s tower is”

 “will come rickon”

 brother nodded “if shaggy comes too” said running osha bran nothing maester luwin could follow keeping wary eye wolves

 maester luwin’s turret cluttered seemed bran wonder ever found anything tottering piles books covered tables chairs rows stoppered jars lined shelves candle stubs puddles dried wax dotted furniture bronze myrish lens tube sat tripod terrace door star charts hung walls shadow maps lay scattered among rushes papers quills pots inks everywhere spotted droppings ravens rafters strident quorks drifted osha washed cleaned bandaged maester’s wounds luwin’s terse instruction “this folly” small grey man said dabbed wolf bites stinging ointment “i agree odd boys dreamed dream yet stop consider it’s natural miss lord father know captive fear fever man’s mind give queer thoughts rickon young comprehend—”

 “i’m four now” rickon said peeking lens tube gargoyles first keep direwolves sat opposite sides large round room licking wounds gnawing bones

 “—too young and—ooh seven hells burns don’t stop young say bran you’re old enough know dreams dreams”

 “some aren’t” osha poured pale red firemilk long gash luwin gasped “the children forest could tell thing two dreaming”

 tears streaming maester’s face yet shook head doggedly “the children… live dreams dead gone enough that’s enough bandages pads wrap make tight i’ll bleeding”

 “old nan says children knew songs trees could fly like birds swim like fish talk animals” bran said “she says made music beautiful made cry like little baby hear it”

 “and magic” maester luwin said distracted “i wish spell would heal arm less painfully could talk shaggydog tell bite” gave big black wolf angry glance corner eye “take lesson bran man trusts spells dueling glass sword children let show something” stood abruptly crossed room returned green jar good hand “have look these” said pulled stopper shook handful shiny black arrowheads

 bran picked one “it’s made glass” curious rickon drifted closer peer table

 “dragonglass” osha named sat beside luwin bandagings hand

 “obsidian” maester luwin insisted holding wounded arm “forged fires gods far earth children forest hunted thousands years ago children worked metal place mail wore long shirts woven leaves bound legs bark seemed melt wood place swords carried blades obsidian”

 “and still do” osha placed soft pads bites maester’s forearm bound tight long strips linen

 bran held arrowhead close black glass slick shiny thought beautiful “can keep one”

 “as wish” maester said

 “i want one too” rickon said “i want four i’m four”

 luwin made count “careful they’re still sharp don’t cut yourself”

 “tell children” bran said important

 “what wish know”

 “everything”

 maester luwin tugged chain collar chafed neck “they people dawn age first kings kingdoms” said “in days castles holdfasts cities much market town found sea dorne men children forest dwelt lands call seven kingdoms

 “the pact began four thousand years friendship men children time first men even put aside gods brought took worship secret gods wood signing pact ended dawn age began age heroes”

 bran’s fist curled around shiny black arrowhead “but children forest gone said”

 “here are” said osha bit end last bandage teeth “north wall things different that’s children went giants old races”

 maester luwin sighed “woman rights ought dead chains starks treated gently deserve unkind repay kindness filling boys’ heads folly”

 “tell went” bran said “i want know”

 “me too” rickon echoed

 “oh well” luwin muttered “so long kingdoms first men held sway pact endured age heroes long night birth seven kingdoms yet finally came time many centuries later peoples crossed narrow sea

 summer began howl

 maester luwin broke startled shaggydog bounded feet added voice brother’s dread clutched bran’s heart “it’s coming” whispered certainty despair known since last night realized since crow led crypts say farewell known believed wanted maester luwin right crow thought threeeyed crow…

 howling stopped suddenly begun summer padded across tower floor shaggydog began lick mat bloody fur back brother’s neck window came flutter wings

 sansa

 tower room heart maegor’s holdfast sansa gave darkness

 drew curtains around bed slept woke weeping slept could sleep lay blankets shivering grief servants came went bringing meals sight food could bear dishes piled table beneath window untouched spoiling servants took away

 sometimes sleep leaden dreamless woke tired closed eyes yet best times dreamed dreamed father waking sleeping saw saw gold cloaks fling saw ser ilyn striding forward unsheathing ice scabbard back saw moment… moment when… wanted look away wanted legs gone fallen knees yet somehow could turn head people screaming shouting prince smiled he’d smiled she’d felt safe heartbeat said words father’s legs… remembered legs way they’d jerked ser ilyn… sword…

 perhaps die told thought seem terrible flung window could put end suffering years come singers would write songs grief body would lie stones broken innocent shaming betrayed sansa went far cross bedchamber throw open shutters… courage left ran back bed sobbing

 serving girls tried talk brought meals never answered grand maester pycelle came box flasks bottles ask ill felt brow made undress touched bedmaid held left gave potion honeywater herbs told drink swallow every night drank right went back sleep

 dreamt footsteps tower stair ominous scraping leather stone man climbed slowly toward bedchamber step step could huddle behind door listen trembling came closer closer ser ilyn payne knew coming ice hand coming take head place run place hide way bar door finally footsteps stopped knew outside standing silent dead eyes long pocked face realized naked crouched trying cover hands door began swing open creaking point greatsword poking through…

 woke murmuring “please please i’ll good i’ll good please don’t” one hear

 finally came truth sansa never heard footsteps joffrey opened door ser ilyn boy prince bed curled tight curtains drawn could said noon midnight first thing heard slam door bed hangings yanked back threw hand sudden light saw standing

 “you attend court afternoon” joffrey said “see bathe dress befits betrothed” sandor clegane stood shoulder plain brown doublet green mantle burned face hideous morning light behind two knights kingsguard long white satin cloaks

 sansa drew blanket chin cover “no” whimpered “please… leave be”

 “if won’t rise dress hound you” joffrey said

 “i beg prince…”

 “i’m king dog get bed”

 sandor clegane scooped around waist lifted featherbed struggled feebly blanket fell floor underneath thin bedgown cover nakedness “do you’re bid child” clegane said “dress” pushed toward wardrobe almost gently

 sansa backed away “i queen asked wrote letters wrote told promised you’d merciful please let go home won’t treason i’ll good swear don’t traitor’s blood don’t want go home” remembering courtesies lowered head “as please you” finished weakly

 “it please me” joffrey said “mother says i’m still marry you’ll stay you’ll obey”

 “i don’t want marry you” sansa wailed “you chopped father’s head”

 “he traitor never promised spare i’d merciful hadn’t father would torn flayed gave clean death”

 sansa stared seeing first time wearing padded crimson doublet patterned lions clothofgold cape high collar framed face wondered could ever thought handsome lips soft red worms found rain eyes vain cruel “i hate you” whispered

 king joffrey’s face hardened “my mother tells isn’t fitting king strike wife ser meryn”

 knight could think yanking back hand tried shield face backhanding across ear gloved fist sansa remember failing yet next knew sprawled one knee amongst rushes head ringing ser meryn trant stood blood knuckles white silk glove

 “will obey shall chastise again”

 sansa’s ear felt numb touched fingertips came away wet red “i… as… command lord”

 “your grace” joffrey corrected “i shall look court” turned left

 ser meryn ser arys followed sandor clegane lingered long enough yank roughly feet “save pain girl give wants”

 “what… want please tell me”

 “he wants smile smell sweet lady love” hound rasped “he wants hear recite pretty little words way septa taught wants love him… fear him”

 gone sansa sank back onto rushes staring wall two bedmaids crept timidly chamber “i need hot water bath please” told “and perfume powder hide bruise” right side face swollen beginning ache knew joffrey would want beautiful

 hot water made think winterfell took strength washed since day father died startled filthy water became maids sluiced blood face scrubbed dirt back washed hair brushed sprang back thick auburn curls sansa speak except give commands lannister servants trust time came dress chose green silk gown worn tourney recalled gallant joff night feast perhaps would make remember well treat gently

 “as do” replied

 “yes… true knight ser meryn”

 sandor clegane would laughed sansa knew men might cursed warned keep silent even begged forgiveness ser meryn trant none ser meryn trant simply care

 balcony deserted save sansa stood head bowed fighting hold back tears joffrey sat iron throne dispensed pleased call justice nine cases ten seemed bore allowed council handle squirming restlessly lord baelish grand maester pycelle queen cersei resolved matter choose make ruling though even queen mother could sway

 thief brought ser ilyn chop hand right court two knights came dispute land decreed duel morrow “to death” added woman fell knees plead head man executed traitor loved said wanted see decently buried “if loved traitor must traitor too” joffrey said two gold cloaks dragged dungeons

 frogfaced lord slynt sat end council table wearing black velvet doublet shiny clothofgold cape nodding approval every time king pronounced sentence sansa stared hard ugly face remembering thrown father ser ilyn behead wishing could hurt wishing hero would throw cut head voice inside whispered heroes remembered lord petyr said hall “life song sweetling” he’d told “you may learn one day sorrow” life monsters win told hound’s voice heard cold rasp metal stone “save pain girl give wants”

 last case plump tavern singer accused making song ridiculed late king robert joff commanded fetch woodharp ordered perform song court singer wept swore would never sing song king insisted sort funny song robert fighting pig pig boar who’d killed sansa knew verses almost sounded singing queen song done joffrey announced he’d decided merciful singer could keep either fingers tongue would day make choice janos slynt nodded

 final business afternoon sansa saw relief ordeal yet done herald’s voice dismissed court fled balcony find joffrey waiting base curving stairs hound ser meryn well young king examined critically top bottom “you look much better did”

 “thank grace” sansa said hollow words made nod smile

 “walk me” joffrey commanded offering arm choice take touch hand would thrilled made flesh crawl “my name day soon” joffrey said slipped rear throne room “there great feast gifts going give me”

 “i… thought lord”

 “your grace” said sharply “you truly stupid girl aren’t mother says so”

 “she does” happened words lost power hurt yet somehow queen always kind

 “oh yes worries children whether they’ll stupid like told trouble herself” king gestured ser meryn opened door

 “thank grace” murmured hound right thought little bird repeating words taught sun fallen western wall stones red keep glowed dark blood

 “i’ll get child soon you’re able” joffrey said escorted across practice yard “if first one stupid i’ll chop head find smarter wife think you’ll able children”

 sansa could look shamed “septa mordane says most… highborn girls flowering twelve thirteen”

 joffrey nodded “this way” led gatehouse base steps led battlements

 sansa jerked back away trembling suddenly knew going “no” said voice frightened gasp “please don’t make beg you…”

 joffrey pressed lips together “i want show happens traitors”

 sansa shook head wildly “i won’t won’t”

 “i ser meryn drag up” said “you won’t like better say” joffrey reached sansa cringed away backing hound

 “do girl” sandor clegane told pushing back toward king mouth twitched burned side face sansa could almost hear rest he’ll matter give wants

 forced take king joffrey’s hand climb something nightmare every step struggle pulling feet ankledeep mud steps would believed thousand thousand steps horror waiting ramparts

 high battlements gatehouse whole world spread sansa could see great sept baelor visenya’s hill father died end street sisters stood fireblackened ruins dragonpit west swollen red sun halfhidden behind gate gods salt sea back south fish market docks swirling torrent blackwater rush north…

 turned way saw city streets alleys hills bottoms streets alleys stone distant walls yet knew beyond open country farms fields forests beyond north north north stood winterfell

 “what looking at” joffrey said “this wanted see right here”

 thick stone parapet protected outer edge rampart reaching high sansa’s chin crenellations cut every five feet archers heads mounted crenels along top wall impaled iron spikes faced city sansa noted moment she’d stepped onto wallwalk river bustling streets setting sun ever much prettier make look heads told can’t make see

 “this one father” said “this one dog turn around see him”

 sandor clegane took head hair turned severed head dipped tar preserve longer sansa looked calmly seeing really look like lord eddard thought even look real “how long look”

 joffrey seemed disappointed “do want see rest” long row

 “if please grace”

 joffrey marched wallwalk past dozen heads two empty spikes “i’m saving uncle stannis uncle renly” explained heads dead mounted much longer father despite tar long past recognizable king pointed one said “that’s septa there” sansa could even told woman jaw rotted face birds eaten one ear cheek

 sansa wondered happened septa mordane although supposed known along “why kill her” asked “she godsworn…”

 “she traitor” joffrey looked pouty somehow upsetting “you haven’t said mean give name day maybe give something instead would like that”

 “if please lord” sansa said

 smiled knew mocking “your brother traitor know” turned septa mordane’s head back around “i remember brother winterfell dog called lord wooden sword didn’t dog”

 “did i” hound replied “i don’t recall”

 joffrey gave petulant shrug “your brother defeated uncle jaime mother says treachery deceit wept heard women weak even though pretends isn’t says need stay king’s landing case uncles attack don’t care name day feast i’m going raise host kill brother that’s i’ll give lady sansa brother’s head”

 kind madness took heard say “maybe brother give head”

 joffrey scowled “you must never mock like true wife mock lord ser meryn teach her”

 “you shouldn’t crying time” joffrey told “you’re pretty smile laugh”

 tyrion

 “they son” tywin lannister said

 “they lord” messenger’s voice dulled exhaustion breast torn surcoat brindled boar crakehall halfobscured dried blood

 one sons tyrion thought took sip wine said word thinking jaime lifted arm pain shot elbow reminding brief taste battle loved brother would wanted whispering wood gold casterly rock

 lord father’s assembled captains bannermen fallen quiet courier told tale sound crackle hiss log burning hearth end long drafty common room

 hardships long relentless drive south prospect even single night inn cheered tyrion mightily… though rather wished inn memories father set grueling pace taken toll men wounded battle kept best could abandoned fend every morning left roadside men went sleep never wake every afternoon collapsed along way every evening deserted stealing dusk tyrion halftempted go

 upstairs enjoying comfort featherbed warmth shae’s body beside squire woken say rider arrived dire news riverrun nothing rush south endless forced marches bodies left beside road… naught robb stark reached riverrun days days ago

 “how could happen” ser harys swyft moaned “how even whispering wood riverrun ringed iron surrounded great host… madness made ser jaime decide split men three separate camps surely knew vulnerable would leave them”

 better chinless craven tyrion thought jaime might lost riverrun angered hear brother slandered likes swyft shameless lickspittle whose greatest accomplishment marrying equally chinless daughter ser kevan thereby attaching lannisters

 “i would done same” uncle responded good deal calmly tyrion might “you never seen riverrun ser harys would know jaime little choice matter castle situated end point land tumblestone flows red fork trident rivers form two sides triangle danger threatens tullys open sluice gates upstream create wide moat third side turning riverrun island walls rise sheer water towers defenders commanding view opposite shores many leagues around cut approaches besieger must needs place one camp north tumblestone one south red fork third rivers west moat way none”

 “ser kevan speaks truly lords” courier said “we’d built palisades sharpened stakes around camps yet enough warning rivers cutting us came north camp first one expecting attack marq piper raiding supply trains fifty men ser jaime gone deal night before… well thought told stark host east green fork marching south…”

 “and outriders” ser gregor clegane’s face might hewn rock fire hearth gave somber orange cast skin put deep shadows hollows eyes “they saw nothing gave warning”

 bloodstained messenger shook head “our outriders vanishing marq piper’s work thought ones come back seen nothing”

 “a man sees nothing use eyes” mountain declared “cut give next outrider tell hope four eyes might see better two… man six”

 lord tywin lannister turned face study ser gregor tyrion saw glimmer gold light shone father’s pupils could said whether look one approval disgust lord tywin oft quiet council preferring listen spoke habit tyrion tried emulate yet silence uncharacteristic even wine untouched

 “you said came night” ser kevan prompted

 man gave weary nod “the blackfish led van cutting sentries clearing away palisades main assault time men knew happening riders pouring ditch banks galloping camp swords torches hand sleeping west camp rivers heard fighting saw tents fired lord brax led us rafts tried pole across current pushed us downstream tullys started flinging rocks us catapults walls saw one raft smashed kindling three others overturned men swept river drowned… make across found starks waiting riverbanks”

 ser flement brax wore silverandpurple tabard look man cannot comprehend heard “my lord father—”

 “sorry lord” messenger said “lord brax clad plateandmail raft overturned gallant”

 fool tyrion thought swirling cup staring winy depths crossing river night crude raft wearing armor enemy waiting side—if gallantry would take cowardice every time wondered lord brax felt especially gallant weight steel pulled black water

 “the camp rivers overrun well” messenger saying “while trying cross starks swept west two columns armored horse saw lord umber’s giantinchains mallister eagle boy led monstrous wolf running side wasn’t see it’s said beast killed four men ripped apart dozen horses spearmen formed shieldwall held first charge tullys saw engaged opened gates riverrun tytos blackwood led sortie across drawbridge took rear”

 “gods save us” lord lefford swore

 “greatjon umber fired siege towers building lord blackwood found ser edmure tully chains among captives made south camp command ser forley prester retreated good order saw camps lost two thousand spears many bowmen tyroshi sellsword led freeriders struck banners went foe”

 “curse man” uncle kevan sounded angry surprised “i warned jaime trust one man fights coin loyal purse”

 lord tywin wove fingers together chin eyes moved listened bristling golden sidewhiskers framed face still might mask tyrion could see tiny beads sweat dappling father’s shaven head

 ser addam marbrand said “i sure grateful pointing obvious ser harys question shall it”

 “what jaime’s host slaughtered taken put flight starks tullys sit squarely across line supply cut west march casterly rock choose what’s stop lords beaten must sue peace”

 “peace” tyrion swirled wine thoughtfully took deep draft hurled empty cup floor shattered thousand pieces “there’s peace ser harys sweet nephew broke good decided ornament red keep lord eddard’s head you’ll easier time drinking wine cup convincing robb stark make peace he’s winning… hadn’t noticed”

 “two battles make war” ser addam insisted “we far lost welcome chance try steel stark boy”

 “perhaps would consent truce allow us trade prisoners theirs” offered lord lefford

 “unless trade threeforone still come light scales” tyrion said acidly “and offer brother lord eddard’s rotting head”

 “i heard queen cersei hand’s daughters” lefford said hopefully “if give lad sisters back…”

 ser addam snorted disdainfully “he would utter ass trade jaime lannister’s life two girls”

 “then must ransom ser jaime whatever costs” lord lefford said

 tyrion rolled eyes “if starks feel need gold melt jaime’s armor”

 “if ask truce think us weak” ser addarn argued “we march once”

 “surely friends court could prevailed upon join us fresh troops” said ser harys “and someone might return casterly rock raise new host”

 lord tywin lannister rose feet “they son” said voice cut babble like sword suet “leave you”

 ever soul obedience tyrion rose depart rest father gave look “not tyrion remain well kevan rest out”

 tyrion eased back onto bench startled speechlessness ser kevan crossed room wine casks “uncle” tyrion called “if would kind—”

 “here” father offered cup wine untouched

 tyrion truly nonplussed drank

 lord tywin seated “you right stark alive might used lord eddard forge peace winterfell riverrun peace would given us time need deal robert’s brothers dead…” hand curled fist “madness rank madness”

 “joff’s boy” tyrion pointed “at age committed follies own”

 father gave sharp look “i suppose ought grateful yet married whore”

 tyrion sipped wine wondering lord tywin would look flung cup face

 “our position worse know” father went “it would seem new king”

 ser kevan looked poleaxed “a new—who done joffrey”

 faintest flicker distaste played across lord tywin’s thin lips “nothing… yet grandson still sits iron throne eunuch heard whispers south renly baratheon wed margaery tyrell highgarden fortnight past claimed crown bride’s father brothers bent knee sworn swords”

 “those grave tidings” ser kevan frowned furrows brow grew deep canyons

 “my daughter commands us ride king’s landing defend red keep king renly knight flowers” mouth tightened “commands us mind name king council”

 “how king joffrey taking news” tyrion asked certain black amusement

 “cersei seen fit tell yet” lord tywin said “she fears might insist marching renly himself”

 “with army” tyrion asked “you don’t plan give one hope”

 “he talks leading city watch” lord tywin said

 “if takes watch he’ll leave city undefended” ser kevan said “and lord stannis dragonstone…”

 “yes” lord tywin looked son “i thought one made motley tyrion would appear wrong”

 “why father” said tyrion “that almost sounds like praise” leaned forward intently “what stannis he’s elder renly feel brother’s claim”

 father frowned “i felt beginning stannis greater danger others combined yet nothing oh varys hears whispers stannis building ships stannis hiring sellswords stannis bringing shadowbinder asshai mean true” gave irritated shrug “kevan bring us map”

 ser kevan bid lord tywin unrolled leather smoothing flat “jaime left us bad way roose bolton remnants host north us enemies hold twins moat cailin robb stark sits west cannot retreat lannisport rock unless choose give battle jaime taken army purposes ceased exist thoros myr beric dondarrion continue plague foraging parties east arryns stannis baratheon sits dragonstone south highgarden storm’s end calling banners”

 tyrion smiled crookedly “take heart father least rhaegar targaryen still dead”

 “i hoped might offer us japes tyrion” lord tywin lannister said

 ser kevan frowned map forehead creasing “robb stark edmure tully lords trident combined power may exceed roose bolton behind us… tywin remain fear might caught three armies”

 “i intention remaining must finish business young lord stark renly baratheon march highgarden bolton concern wary man made warier green fork slow give pursuit so… morrow make harrenhal kevan want ser addam’s outriders screen movements give many men requires send groups four vanishings”

 “as say lord but… harrenhal grim unlucky place call cursed”

 “let them” lord tywin said “unleash ser gregor send us reavers send forth vargo hoat freeriders well ser amory lorch three hundred horse tell want see riverlands afire gods eye red fork”

 “they burn lord” ser kevan said rising “i shall give commands” bowed made door

 alone lord tywin glanced tyrion “your savages might relish bit rapine tell may ride vargo hoat plunder like—goods stock women may take want burn rest”

 “telling shagga timett pillage like telling rooster crow” tyrion commented “but prefer keep me” uncouth unruly might yet wildlings trusted father’s men hand

 “then best learn control city plundered”

 “the city” tyrion lost “what city would be”

 “king’s landing sending court”

 last thing tyrion lannister would ever anticipated

 reached wine considered moment sipped “and there”

 “rule” father said curtly

 tyrion hooted laughter “my sweet sister might word two say that”

 “let say likes son needs taken hand ruins us blame jackanapes council—our friend petyr venerable grand maester cockless wonder lord varys sort counsel giving joffrey lurches one folly next whose notion make janos slynt lord man’s father butcher grant harrenhal harrenhal seat kings ever set foot inside say told took bloody spear sigil bloody cleaver would choice” father raised voice yet tyrion could see anger gold eyes “and dismissing selmy sense yes man old name barristan bold still meaning realm lent honor man served anyone say hound feed dog bones table seat beside high bench” pointed finger tyrion’s face “if cersei cannot curb boy must councillors playing us false…”

 tyrion knew “spikes” sighed “heads walls”

 “i see taken lessons me”

 “more know father” tyrion answered quietly finished wine set cup aside thoughtful part pleased cared admit another part remembering battle upriver wondering sent hold left “why me” asked cocking head one side “why uncle ser addam ser flement lord serrett a… bigger man”

 lord tywin rose abruptly “you son”

 knew given lost thought bloody bastard think jaime’s good dead i’m left tyrion wanted slap spit face draw dagger cut heart see made old hard gold way smallfolks said yet sat silent still

 shards broken cup crunched beneath father’s heels lord tywin crossed room “one last thing” said door “you take whore court”

 tyrion sat alone common room long father gone finally climbed steps cozy garret beneath bell tower ceiling low scarcely drawback dwarf window could see gibbet father erected yard innkeep’s body turned slowly rope whenever night wind gusted flesh grown thin ragged lannister hopes

 shae murmured sleepily rolled toward sat edge featherbed slid hand blanket cupped soft breast eyes opened “m’lord” said drowsy smile

 left wall left father’s son robb’s brother gift sword even sword fine longclaw make mormont aemon targaryen three times old man chosen three times chosen honor even jon could decide whether maester stayed weak craven strong true yet understood old man meant pain choosing understood well

 tyrion lannister claimed men would rather deny hard truth face jon done denials jon snow bastard oathbreaker motherless friendless damned rest life—however long might be—he would condemned outsider silent man standing shadows dares speak true name wherever might go throughout seven kingdoms would need live lie lest every man’s hand raised made matter long lived long enough take place brother’s side help avenge father

 remembered robb last seen standing yard snow melting auburn hair jon would come secret disguised tried imagine look robb’s face revealed brother would shake head smile he’d say… he’d say…

 ghost kept pace almost half mile red tongue lolling mouth man horse alike lowered heads asked mare speed wolf slowed stopped watching eyes glowing red moonlight vanished behind jon knew would follow pace

 scattered lights flickered trees ahead sides road mole’s town dog barked rode heard mule’s raucous haw stable otherwise village still glow hearth fires shone shuttered windows leaking wooden slats

 mole’s town bigger seemed three quarters ground deep warm cellars connected maze tunnels even whorehouse nothing surface wooden shack bigger privy red lantern hung door wall he’d heard men call whores “buried treasures” wondered whether brothers black tonight mining oathbreaking yet one seemed care

 led mare road behind thick stand greygreen sentinels “ouiet now” said hushed voice crouching peer branches gods kind riders would pass likely smallfolk mole’s town farmers way fields although middle night…

 listened sound hooves growing steadily louder trotted briskly kingsroad sound five six least voices drifted trees

 “…certain came way”

 “we can’t certain”

 “he could ridden east know left road cut woods that’s i’d do”

 “in dark stupid didn’t fall horse break neck you’d get lost wind back wall sun came up”

 “i would not” grenn sounded peeved “i’d ride south tell south stars”

 “what sky cloudy” pyp asked

 “then wouldn’t go”

 another voice broke “you know i’d i’d mole’s town digging buried treasure” toad’s shrill laughter boomed trees jon’s mare snorted

 “keep quiet you” haider said “i thought heard something”

 “where didn’t hear anything” horses stopped

 “you can’t hear fart”

 “i too” grenn insisted

 “quiet”

 fell silent listening jon found holding breath sam thought hadn’t gone old bear hadn’t gone bed either he’d woken boys damn come dawn beds they’d named deserters think

 hushed silence seemed stretch jon crouched could see legs horses branches finally pyp spoke “what hear”

 “i don’t know” haider admitted “a sound thought might horse but…”

 “there’s nothing here”

 corner eye jon glimpsed pale shape moving trees leaves rustled ghost came bounding shadows suddenly jon’s mare started gave whinny “there” halder shouted

 “i heard too”

 “traitor” jon told direwolf swung saddle turned mare’s head slide trees gone ten feet

 “jon” pyp shouted

 “pull up” grenn said “you can’t outrun us all”

 jon wheeled around face drawing sword “get back don’t wish hurt to”

 “one seven” halder gave signal boys spread surrounding

 “what want me” jon demanded

 “we want take back belong” pyp said

 “i belong brother”

 “we’re brothers now” grenn said

 “they’ll cut head catch know” toad put nervous laugh “this stupid it’s like something aurochs would do”

 “i would not” grenn said “i’m oathbreaker said words meant them”

 “so i” jon told “don’t understand murdered father it’s war brother robb fighting riverlands—”

 “we know” said pyp solemnly “sam told us everything”

 “we’re sorry father” grenn said “but doesn’t matter say words can’t leave matter what”

 “i to” jon said fervently

 “you said words” pyp reminded “now watch begins said shall end death”

 “i shall live die post” grenn added nodding

 “you don’t tell words know well do” angry couldn’t let go peace making harder

 “i sword darkness” halder intoned

 “the watcher walls” piped toad

 jon cursed faces took notice pyp spurred horse closer reciting “i fire burns cold light brings dawn horn wakes sleepers shield guards realms men”

 “stay back” jon warned brandishing sword “i mean pyp” weren’t even wearing armor could cut pieces

 matthar circled behind joined chorus “i pledge life honor night’s watch”

 jon kicked mare spinning circle boys around closing every side

 “for night…” halder trotted left

 “…and nights come” finished pyp reached jon’s reins “so choices kill come back me”

 jon lifted sword… lowered helpless “damn you” said “damn all”

 “do bind hands give us word you’ll ride back peaceful” asked halder

 “i won’t run that’s mean” ghost moved trees jon glared “small help were” said deep red eyes looked knowingly

 “we best hurry” pyp said “if we’re back first light old bear heads”

 ride back jon snow remembered little seemed shorter journey south perhaps mind elsewhere pyp set pace galloping walking trotting breaking another gallop mole’s town came went red lantern brothel long extinguished made good time dawn still hour jon glimpsed towers castle black ahead dark pale immensity wall seem like home time

 could take back jon told could make stay war would end morrow day friends could watch day night would bide time make think content remain here… grown lax would next time would avoid kingsroad could follow wall east perhaps way sea longer route safer one even west mountains south high passes wildling’s way hard perilous least one wouid follow wouldn’t stray within hundred leagues winterfell kingsroad

 samwell tarly awaited old stables slumped ground bale hay anxious sleep rose brushed “i… i’m glad found jon”

 “i’m not” jon said dismounting

 pyp hopped horse looked lightening sky disgust “give us hand bedding horses sam” small boy said “we long day us sleep face thanks lord snow”

 day broke jon walked kitchens every dawn threefinger hobb said nothing gave old bear’s breakfast today three brown eggs boiled hard fried bread ham steak bowl wrinkled plums jon carried food back king’s tower found mormont window seat writing raven walking back forth across shoulders muttering “corn corn corn” bird shrieked jon entered “put food table” old bear said glancing “i’ll beer”

 jon opened shuttered window took flagon beer outside ledge filled horn hobb given lemon still cold wall jon crushed fist juice trickled fingers mormont drank lemon beer every day claimed still teeth

 “doubtless loved father” mormont said jon brought horn “the things love destroy us every time lad remember told that”

 “i remember” jon said sullenly care talk father’s death even mormont

 “see never forget hard truths ones hold tight fetch plate ham look weary moonlight ride tiring”

 jon’s throat dry “you know”

 “know” raven echoed mormont’s shoulder “know”

 old bear snorted “do think chose lord commander night’s watch i’m dumb stump snow aemon told you’d go told you’d back know men… boys honor set kingsroad… honor brought back”

 “my friends brought back” jon said

 “did say honor” mormont inspected plate

 “they killed father expect nothing”

 “if truth told expected did” mormont tried plum spit pit “i ordered watch kept seen leaving brothers fetched back would taken along way friends unless horse wings like raven you”

 “no” jon felt like fool

 “pity could use horse like that”

 jon stood tall told would die well much could least “i know penalty desertion lord i’m afraid die”

 “die” raven cried

 “nor live hope” mormont said cutting ham dagger feeding bite bird “you deserted—yet stand beheaded every boy rode mole’s town night ghosts would guard wall yet maybe mean flee morrow fortnight hope boy”

 jon kept silent

 “i thought so” mormont peeled shell boiled egg “your father dead lad think bring back”

 “no” answered sullen

 “good” mormont said “we’ve seen dead come back it’s something care see again” ate egg two bites flicked bit shell teeth “your brother field power north behind one lords bannermen commands swords you’ll find night’s watch imagine need help mighty warrior carry grumkin pocket magic sword”

 jon answer raven pecking egg breaking shell pushing beak hole pulled morsels white yoke

 old bear sighed “you one touched war like sister marching brother’s host daughters dressed men’s mail maege hoary old snark stubborn shorttempered willful truth told hardly stand around wretched woman mean love less love bear half sisters” frowning mormont took last egg squeezed fist shell crunched “or perhaps may i’d still grieve slain yet don’t see running said words place here… boy”

 place jon wanted say i’m bastard rights name mother even father words would come “i don’t know”

 “i do” said lord commander mormont “the cold winds rising snow beyond wall shadows lengthen cotter pyke writes vast herds elk streaming south east toward sea mammoths well says one men discovered huge misshapen footprints three leagues eastwatch rangers shadow tower found whole villages abandoned night ser denys says see fires mountains huge blazes burn dusk till dawn quorin halfhand took captive depths gorge man swears mance rayder massing people new secret stronghold he’s found end gods know think uncle benjen ranger we’ve lost past year”

 “ben jen” raven squawked bobbing head bits egg dribbling beak “ben jen ben jen”

 “no” jon said others many

 “do think brother’s war important ours” old man barked

 jon chewed lip raven flapped wings “war war war war” sang

 “it’s not” mormont told “gods save us boy you’re blind you’re stupid dead men come hunting night think matters sits iron throne”

 “no” jon thought way

 “your lord father sent us jon say”

 “why why” raven called

 “all know blood first men flows veins starks first men built wall it’s said remember things otherwise forgotten beast yours… led us wights warned dead man steps ser jaremy would doubtless call happenstance yet ser jaremy dead i’m not” lord mormont stabbed chunk ham point dagger “i think meant want wolf us go beyond wall”

 words sent chill excitement jon’s back “beyond wall”

 “you heard mean find ben stark alive dead” chewed swallowed “i sit meekly wait snows ice winds must know happening time night’s watch ride force kingbeyondthewall others anything else may mean command myself” pointed dagger jon’s chest “by custom lord commander’s steward squire well… care wake every dawn wondering you’ve run answer lord snow brother night’s watch… bastard boy wants play war”

 jon snow straightened took long deep breath forgive father robb arya bran… forgive cannot help truth place “i am… lord man swear run again”

 old bear snorted “good go put sword”





 catelyn

 seemed thousand years ago catelyn stark carried infant son riverrun crossing tumblestone small boat begin journey north winterfell across tumblestone came home though boy wore plate mail place swaddling clothes

 robb sat bow grey wind hand resting direwolf head rowers pulled oars theon greyjoy uncle brynden would come behind second boat greatjon lord karstark

 catelyn took place toward stern shot tumblestone letting strong current push past looming wheel tower splash rumble great waterwheel within sound girlhood brought sad smile catelyn’s face sandstone walls castle soldiers servants shouted name robb’s “winterfell” every rampart waved banner house tully leaping trout silver rippling blueandred field stirring sight yet lift heart wondered indeed heart would ever lift oh ned…

 wheel tower made wide turn knifed churning water men put backs wide arch water gate came view heard creak heavy chains great iron portcullis winched upward rose slowly approached catelyn saw lower half red rust bottom foot dripped brown mud passed underneath barbed spikes mere inches heads catelyn gazed bars wondered deep rust went well portcullis would stand ram whether ought replaced thoughts like seldom far mind days

 “i don’t know” said robb “i prayed know gods answer lannisters killed father traitor know lie joffrey lawful king fight traitors”

 “my lord father would urge caution” aged ser stevron said weaselly smile frey “wait let two kings play game thrones done fighting bend knees victor oppose choose renly arming likely lord tywin would welcome truce… safe return son noble lords allow go harrenhal arrange good terms ransoms…”

 roar outrage drowned voice “craven” greatjon thundered “begging truce make us seem weak” declared lady mormont “ransoms damned must give kingslayer” shouted rickard karstark

 “why peace” catelyn asked

 lords looked robb’s eyes felt alone “my lady murdered lord father husband” said grimly unsheathed longsword laid table bright steel rough wood “this peace lannisters”

 greatjon bellowed approval men added voices shouting drawing swords pounding fists table catelyn waited quieted “my lords” said “lord eddard liege shared bed bore children think love less you” voice almost broke grief catelyn took long breath steadied “robb sword could bring back never let sheathe ned stood side more… gone hundred whispering woods change ned gone daryn hornwood lord karstark’s valiant sons many good men besides none return us must deaths still”

 “you woman lady” greatjon rumbled deep voice “women understand things”

 “you gentle sex” said lord karstark lines grief fresh face “a man need vengeance”

 “give cersei lannister lord karstark would see gentle woman be” catelyn replied “perhaps understand tactics strategy… understand futility went war lannister armies ravaging riverlands ned prisoner falsely accused treason fought defend win lord’s freedom

 “well one done forever beyond reach mourn ned end days must think living want daughters back queen holds still must trade four lannisters two starks call bargain thank gods want safe robb ruling winterfell father’s seat want live life kiss girl wed woman father son want write end want go home lords weep husband”

 hall quiet catelyn finished speaking

 “peace” said uncle brynden “peace sweet lady… terms good hammering sword plowshare must forge morrow”

 “what torrhen eddard die return karhold nothing bones” asked rickard karstark

 “aye” said lord bracken “gregor clegane laid waste fields slaughtered smallfolk left stone hedge smoking ruin bend knee ones sent fought put back before”

 lord blackwood agreed catelyn’s surprise dismay “and make peace king joffrey traitors king renly stag prevail lion would leave us”

 “whatever may decide shall never call lannister king” declared marq piper

 “nor i” yelled little darry boy “i never will”

 shouting began catelyn sat despairing come close thought almost listened almost… moment gone would peace chance heal safety looked son watched listened lords debate frowning troubled yet wedded war pledged marry daughter walder frey saw true bride plain sword laid table

 catelyn thinking girls wondering would ever see greatjon lurched feet

 “my lords” shouted voice booming rafters “here say two kings” spat “renly baratheon nothing stannis neither rule mine flowery seat highgarden dorne know wall wolfswood barrows first men even gods wrong others take lannisters i’ve bellyful them” reached back shoulder drew immense twohanded greatsword “why shouldn’t rule dragons married dragons dead” pointed robb blade “there sits king mean bow knee m’lords” thundered “the king north”

 knelt laid sword son’s feet

 “i’ll peace terms” lord karstark said “they keep red castle iron chair well” eased longsword scabbard “the king north” said kneeling beside greatjon

 maege mormont stood “the king winter” declared laid spiked mace beside swords river lords rising blackwood bracken mallister houses never ruled winterfell yet catelyn watched rise draw blades bending knees shouting old words heard realm three hundred years since aegon dragon come make seven kingdoms one… yet heard ringing timbers father’s hall

 “why call that” dany challenged “my brother viserys king not”

 “he lady”

 “viserys dead heir last blood house targaryen whatever mine now”

 “my… queen” ser jorah said going one knee “my sword dacnerys heart well never belonged brother knight nothing offer exile beg hear let khal drogo go shall alone promise man shall take vaes dothrak unless wish go need join dosh khaleen come east yi ti qarth jade sea asshai shadow see wonders yet unseen drink wines gods see fit serve us please khaleesi know intend not”

 “is fear” dany kissed lightly broad forehead “i child sweet ser”

 “you mean die swear queen”

 “i swear it” said common tongue seven kingdoms rights

 “i shall hold oath pray never regret giving it” dany lifted feet stretching toes reach lips kissed knight gently said “you first queensguard”

 could feel eyes khalasar entered tent dothraki muttering giving strange sideways looks corners dark almond eyes thought mad dany realized perhaps would know soon enough look back lost

 sun going called back carry body pyre dothraki watched silence jhogo aggo bore tent dany walked behind laid cushions silks head toward mother mountains far northeast

 “oil” commanded brought forth jars poured pyre soaking silks brush bundles dry grass oil trickled beneath logs air rich fragrance “bring eggs” dany commanded handmaids something voice made run

 ser jorah took arm “my queen drogo use dragon’s eggs night lands better sell asshai sell one buy ship take us back free cities sell three wealthy woman days”

 “they given sell” dany told

 climbed pyre place eggs around sunandstars black beside heart arm green beside head braid coiled around creamandgold legs kissed last time dany could taste sweetness oil lips

 climbed pyre noticed mirri maz duur watching “you mad” godswife said hoarsely

 “is far madness wisdom” dany asked “ser jorah take maegi bind pyre”

 “to the… queen hear me…”

 “do say” still hesitated anger flared “you swore obey whatever might come rakharo help him”

 godswife cry dragged khal drogo’s pyre staked amidst treasures dany poured oil woman’s head “i thank mirri maz duur” said “for lessons taught me”

 “you hear scream” mirri responded oil dripped hair soaked clothing

 “i will” dany said “but screams want life remember told death pay life” mirri maz duur opened mouth made reply stepped away dany saw contempt gone maegi’s flat black eyes place something might fear nothing done watch sun look first star

 horselord dies horse slain might ride proud night lands bodies burned beneath open sky khal rises fiery steed take place among stars fiercely man burned life brighter star shine darkness

 jhogo spied first “there” said hushed voice dany looked saw low east first star comet burning red bloodred fire red dragon’s tail could asked stronger sign

 dany took torch aggo’s hand thrust logs oil took fire brush dried grass heartbeat later tiny flames went darting wood like swift red mice skating oil leaping bark branch leaf rising heat puffed face soft sudden lover’s breath seconds grown hot bear dany stepped backward wood crackled louder louder mirri maz duur began sing shrill ululating voice flames whirled writhed racing platform dusk shimmered air seemed liquefy heat dany heard logs spit crack fires swept mirri maz duur song grew louder shriller… gasped song became shuddering wail thin high full agony

 flames reached drogo around clothing took fire instant khal clad wisps floating orange silk tendrils curling smoke grey greasy dany’s lips parted found holding breath part wanted go ser jorah feared rush flames beg forgiveness take inside one last time fire melting flesh bones one forever

 another step dany could feel heat sand soles feet even sandals sweat ran thighs breasts rivulets cheeks tears run ser jorah shouting behind matter anymore fire mattered flames beautiful loveliest things ever seen one sorcerer robed yellow orange scarlet swirling long smoky cloaks saw crimson firelions great yellow serpents unicorns made pale blue flame saw fish foxes monsters wolves bright birds flowering trees beautiful last saw horse great grey stallion limned smoke flowing mane nimbus blue flame yes love sunandstars yes mount ride

 child plagued nightmares far back maester cressen could recall “we talked before” said gently “the dragons cannot come life carved stone child olden days island westernmost outpost great freehold valyria valyrians raised citadel ways shaping stone since lost us castle must towers wherever two walls meet angle defense valyrians fashioned towers shape dragons make fortress seem fearsome crowned walls thousand gargoyles instead simple crenellations” took small pink hand frail spotted one gave gentle squeeze “so see nothing fear “

 shireen unconvinced “what thing sky dalla matrice talking well dalla said heard red woman tell mother dragonsbreath dragons breathing doesn’t mean coming life”

 red woman maester cressen thought sourly ill enough she’s filled head mother madness must poison daughter’s dreams well would stern word dalla warn spread tales “the thing sky comet sweet child star tail lost heavens gone soon enough never seen lifetimes watch see”

 shireen gave brave little nod “mother said white raven means it’s summer anymore”

 “that lady white ravens fly citadel” cressen’s fingers went chain neck link forged different metal symbolizing mastery another branch learning maester’s collar mark order pride youth worn easily seemed heavy metal cold skin “they larger ravens clever bred carry important messages one came tell us conclave met considered reports measurements made maesters realm declared great summer done last ten years two turns sixteen days lasted longest summer living memory”

 “will get cold now” shireen summer child never known true cold

 “in time” cressen replied “if gods good grant us warm autumn bountiful harvests might prepare winter come” smallfolk said long summer meant even longer winter maester saw reason frighten child tales

 patchface rang bells “it always summer sea” intoned “the merwives wear nennymoans hair weave gowns silver seaweed know know oh oh oh”

 shireen giggled “i like gown silver seaweed”

 “under sea snows up” said fool “and rain dry bone know know oh oh oh”

 “will truly snow” child asked

 “it will” cressen said years yet pray long “ah pylos bird”

 shireen gave cry delight even cressen admit bird made impressive sight white snow larger hawk bright black eyes meant mere albino truebred white raven citadel “here” called raven spread wings leapt air flapped noisily across room land table beside

 “i’ll see breakfast now” pylos announced cressen nodded “this lady shireen” told raven bird bobbed pale head bowing “lady” croaked “lady”

 child’s mouth gaped open “it talks”

 “a words said clever birds”

 “clever bird clever man clever clever fool” said patchface jangling “oh clever clever clever fool” began sing “the shadows come dance lord dance lord dance lord” sang hopping one foot back “the shadows come stay lord stay lord stay lord” jerked head word bells antlers sending clangor

 white raven screamed went flapping away perch iron railing rookery stairs shireen seemed grow smaller “he sings time told stop won’t makes scared make stop”

 old man wondered might silenced forever now…

 patchface come boy lord steffon cherished memory found volantis across narrow sea king—the old king aerys ii targaryen quite mad days—had sent lordship seek bride prince rhaegar sisters wed “we found splendid fool” wrote cressen fortnight return home fruitless mission “only boy yet nimble monkey witty dozen courtiers juggles riddles magic sing prettily four tongues bought freedom hope bring home us robert delighted perhaps time even teach stannis laugh”

 saddened cressen remember letter one ever taught stannis laugh least boy patchface storm came suddenly howling shipbreaker bay proved truth name lord’s twomasted galley windproud broke within sight castle parapets two eldest sons watched father’s ship smashed rocks swallowed waters hundred oarsmen sailors went lord steffon baratheon lady wife days thereafter every tide left fresh crop swollen corpses strand storm’s end

 boy washed third day maester cressen come rest help put names dead found fool naked skin white wrinkled powdered wet sand cressen thought another corpse jommy grabbed ankles drag burial wagon boy coughed water sat dying day jommy sworn patchface’s flesh clammy cold

 one ever explained two days fool lost sea fisherfolk liked say mermaid taught breathe water return seed patchface said nothing witty clever lad lord steffon written never reached storm’s end boy found someone else broken body mind hardly capable speech much less wit yet fool’s face left doubt fashion free city volantis tattoo faces slaves servants neck scalp boy’s skin patterned squares red green motley

 “the wretch mad pain use anyone least himself” declared old ser harbert castellan storm’s end years “the kindest thing could one fill cup milk poppy painless sleep there’s end he’d bless wit it” cressen refused end whether patchface gotten joy victory could say even today many years later

 “the shadows come dance lord dance lord dance lord” fool sang swinging head making bells clang clatter bong dong ringaling bong dong

 “lord” white raven shrieked “lord lord lord”

 “a fool sings will” maester told anxious princess “you must take words heart morrow may remember another song one never heard again” sing prettily four tongues lord steffon written…

 pylos strode door “maester pardons”

 “you forgotten porridge” cressen said amused unlike pylos

 “maester ser davos returned last night talking kitchen thought would want know once”

 “davos… last night say he”

 “with king together night”

 time lord stannis would woken matter hour give counsel “i told” cressen complained “i woken” disentangled fingers shireen’s “pardons lady must speak lord father pylos give arm many steps castle seems add every night vex me”

 shireen patchface followed child soon grew restless old man’s creeping pace dashed ahead fool lurching cowbells clanging madly

 castles friendly places frail cressen reminded descended turnpike stairs sea dragon tower lord stannis would found chamber painted table atop stone drum dragonstone’s central keep named way ancient walls boomed rumbled storms reach must cross gallery pass middle inner walls guardian gargoyles black iron gates ascend steps cressen cared contemplate young men climbed steps two time old men bad hips every one torment lord stannis would think come maester resigned ordeal pylos help least grateful

 shuffling along gallery passed row tall arched windows commanding views outer bailey curtain wall fishing village beyond yard archers firing practice butts call “notch draw loose” arrows made sound like flock birds taking wing guardsmen strode wallwalks peering gargoyles host camped without morning air hazy smoke cookfires three thousand men sat break fasts beneath banners lords past sprawl camp anchorage crowded ships craft come within sight dragonstone past half year allowed leave lord stannis’s fury tripledecked war galley three hundred oars looked almost small beside bigbellied carracks cogs surrounded

 guardsmen outside stone drum knew maesters sight passed “wait here” cressen told pylos within “it’s best see alone”

 “it long climb maester”

 cressen smiled “you think forgotten climbed steps often know one name”

 halfway regretted decision stopped catch breath ease pain hip heard scuff boots stone came facetoface ser davos seaworth descending

 davos slight man low birth written plain upon common face wellworn green cloak stained salt spray faded sun draped thin shoulders brown doublet breeches matched brown eyes hair neck pouch worn leather hung thong small beard well peppered grey wore leather glove maimed left hand saw cressen checked descent

 “ser davos” maester said “when return”

 “in black morning favorite time” said one ever handled ship night half well davos shorthand lord stannis knighted notorious elusive smuggler seven kingdoms

 “and”

 man shook head “it warned rise maester love him”

 cressen thought ever strong able just… aye past point wisdom… yet enough never enough “you spoke all”

 “all would see love either highborns i’ll always onion knight” left hand closed stubby fingers locking fist stannis hacked ends last joint thumb “i broke bread gulian swann old penrose tarths consented midnight meeting grove others—well beric dondarrion gone missing say dead lord caron renly bryce orange rainbow guard”

 “the rainbow guard”

 “renly’s made kingsguard” onetime smuggler explained “but seven don’t wear white one color loras tyrell’s lord commander”

 sort notion would appeal renly baratheon splendid new order knighthood gorgeous new raiment proclaim even boy renly loved bright colors rich fabrics loved games well “look me” would shout ran laughing halls storm’s end “look i’m dragon” “look i’m wizard” “look look i’m rain god”

 bold little boy wild black hair laughing eyes man grown oneandtwenty still played games look i’m king cressen thought sadly oh renly renly dear sweet child know would care anyone cares “what reasons lords give refusals” asked ser davos

 “well gave soft words blunt made excuses promises lied” shrugged “in end words wind”

 “you could bring hope”

 “only false sort i’d that” davos said “he truth me”

 maester cressen remembered day davos knighted siege storm’s end lord stannis small garrison held castle close year great host lords tyrell redwyne even sea closed watched day night redwyne galleys flying burgundy banners arbor within storm’s end horses long since eaten dogs cats gone garrison roots rats came night moon new black clouds hid stars cloaked darkness davos smuggler dared redwyne cordon rocks shipbreaker bay alike little ship black hull black sails black oars hold crammed onions salt fish little enough yet kept garrison alive long enough eddard stark reach storm’s end break siege

 lord stannis rewarded davos choice lands cape wrath small keep knight’s honors… also decreed lose joint finger left hand pay years smuggling davos submitted condition stannis wield knife would accept punishment lesser hands lord used butcher’s cleaver better cut clean true afterward davos chosen name seaworth newmade house took banner black ship pale grey field—with onion sails onetime smuggler fond saying lord stannis done boon giving four less fingernails clean trim

 cressen thought man like would give false hope soften hard truth “ser davos truth bitter draught even man like lord stannis thinks returning king’s landing fullness power tear enemies claim rightfully yet now…”

 “if takes meager host king’s landing die numbers told much know pride” davos held gloved hand “my fingers grow back man bends sense”

 old man sighed “you done could must add voice yours” wearily resumed climb

 lord stannis baratheon’s refuge great round room walls bare black stone four tall narrow windows looked four points compass center chamber great table took name massive slab carved wood fashioned command aegon targaryen days conquest painted table fifty feet long perhaps half wide widest point less four feet across narrowest aegon’s carpenters shaped land westeros sawing bay peninsula table nowhere ran straight surface darkened near three hundred years varnish painted seven kingdoms aegon’s day rivers mountains castles cities lakes forests

 “once would woken me” old man said

 “once young old sick need sleep” stannis never learned soften speech dissemble flatter said thought like could damned “i knew you’d learn davos say soon enough always don’t you”

 “i would help not” cressen said “i met davos stair”

 “and told suppose man’s tongue shortened along fingers”

 “he would made poor envoy then”

 “he made poor envoy case storm lords rise seems like justice cause means nothing cravenly ones sit behind walls waiting see wind rises likely triumph bold ones already declared renly renly” spat name like poison tongue

 “your brother lord storm’s end past thirteen years lords sworn bannermen—”

 “his” stannis broke “when rights mine never asked dragonstone never wanted took robert’s enemies commanded root built fleet work dutiful younger brother elder renly robert’s thanks names lord dragonstone gives storm’s end incomes renly storm’s end belonged house baratheon three hundred years rights passed robert took iron throne”

 old grievance deeply felt never heart lord’s weakness dragonstone old strong though commanded allegiance handful lesser lords whose stony island holdings thinly peopled yield men stannis needed even sellswords brought across narrow sea free cities myr lys host camped outside walls far small bring power house lannister

 “robert injustice” maester cressen replied carefully “yet sound reasons dragonstone long seat house targaryen needed man’s strength rule renly child”

 “he child still” stannis declared anger ringing loud empty hall “a thieving child thinks snatch crown brow renly ever done earn throne sits council jests littlefinger tourneys dons splendid suit armor allows knocked horse better man sum brother renly thinks ought king ask gods inflict brothers”

 “i cannot answer gods”

 “you seldom answer days seems maesters renly perchance send might like counsel better think maester said brother decided steal crown counsel colleague offer traitor blood mine”

 “it would surprise lord renly sought counsel grace” youngest lord steffon’s three sons grown man bold heedless acted impulse rather calculation much else renly like brother robert utterly unlike stannis

 “your grace” stannis repeated bitterly “you mock king’s style yet king dragonstone rocks narrow sea kingdom” descended steps chair stand table shadow falling across mouth blackwater rush painted forest king’s landing stood stood brooding realm sought claim near hand yet far away “tonight sup lords bannermen celtigar velaryon bar emmon whole paltry lot poor crop truth told brothers left lysene pirate salladhor saan latest tally owe morosh myrman caution talk tides autumn gales lord sunglass mutters piously seven celtigar want know storm lords joining us velaryon threaten take levies home unless strike tell must now”

 “your true enemies lannisters lord” maester cressen answered “if brother make common cause them—”

 “i treat renly” stannis answered tone brooked argument “not calls king”

 “not renly then” maester yielded lord stubborn proud set mind changing “others might serve needs well eddard stark’s son proclaimed king north power winterfell riverrun behind him”

 “a green boy” said stannis “and another false king accept broken realm”

 “surely half kingdom better none” cressen said “and help boy avenge father’s murder—”

 “why avenge eddard stark man nothing oh robert loved sure loved brother often hear brother ned stark would never known way treated held storm’s end watching good men starve mace tyrell paxter redwyne feasted within sight walls robert thank thanked stark lifting siege rats radishes built fleet robert’s command took dragonstone name take hand say well done brother whatever without blamed letting willem darry steal away viserys babe could stopped sat council fifteen years helping jon arryn rule realm robert drank whored jon died brother name hand went galloping dear friend ned stark offered honor small good either “

 “be may lord” maester cressen said gently “great wrongs done past dust future may yet join starks others might sound well lady arryn queen murdered husband surely want justice young son jon arryn’s heir betroth shireen him—”

 “the boy weak sickly” lord stannis objected “even father saw asked foster dragonstone service page might done good damnable lannister woman lord arryn poisoned could done lysa hides eyrie she’ll never part boy promise “

 “then must send shireen eyrie” maester urged “dragonstone grim home child let fool go familiar face her”

 “familiar hideous” stannis furrowed brow thought “still… perhaps worth trying…

 “must rightful lord seven kingdoms beg help widow women usurpers” woman’s voice asked sharply

 maester cressen turned sand bowed head “my lady” said chagrined heard enter

 lord stannis scowled “i beg anyone mind remember woman”

 “i pleased hear lord” lady selyse tall husband thin body thin face prominent ears sharp nose faintest hint mustache upper lip plucked daily cursed regularly yet never failed return eyes pale mouth stern voice whip cracked “lady arryn owes allegiance starks brother renly rest one true king would fitting plead bargain rightfully grace god”

 god said gods red woman heart soul turning gods seven kingdoms old new worship one called lord light

 “your god keep grace” said lord stannis share wife’s fervent new faith “it’s swords need blessings army hidden somewhere you’ve told of” affection tone stannis always uncomfortable around women even wife gone king’s landing sit robert’s council left selyse dragonstone daughter letters visits fewer duty marriage bed twice year took joy sons hoped never come

 “my brothers uncles cousins armies” told “house florent rally banner”

 “house florent field two thousand swords best” said stannis knew strength every house seven kingdoms “and deal faith brothers uncles lady florent lands lie close highgarden lord uncle risk mace tyrell’s wrath”

 “there another way” lady selyse moved closer “look windows lord sign waited blazoned sky red red flame red fiery heart true god banner—and see unfurls across heavens like dragon’s hot breath lord dragonstone means time come grace nothing certain meant sail desolate rock aegon conqueror sailed sweep say word embrace power lord light”

 “how many swords lord light put hand” stannis demanded

 “all need” wife promised “the swords storm’s end highgarden start lords bannermen”

 “davos would tell different” stannis said “those swords sworn renly love charming young brother loved robert… never loved me”

 “yes” answered “but renly die…”

 stannis looked lady narrowed eyes cressen could hold tongue “it thought grace whatever follies renly committed—”

 “follies call treasons” stannis turned back wife “my brother young strong vast host around rainbow knights his”

 “melisandre gazed flames seen dead”

 cressen horrorstruck “fratricide… lord evil unthinkable… please listen me”

 lady selyse gave measured look “and tell maester might win half kingdom goes starks knees sells daughter lysa arryn”

 “i heard counsel cressen” lord stannis said “now hear dismissed”

 maester cressen bent stiff knee could feel lady selyse’s eyes back shuffled slowly across room time reached bottom steps could stand erect “help me” said pylos

 cressen made way toward raised platform lords sat king step wide around patchface dancing bells ringing fool neither saw heard approach hopped one leg patchface lurched cressen knocking cane went crashing together amidst rushes tangle arms legs sudden gale laughter went around doubt comical sight

 cressen slid hands sleeves warmth fingers found hard lumps crystals made wool “lord stannis”

 stannis turned red woman lady selyse replied “king stannis forget maester”

 arya

 winterfell called “arya horseface” she’d thought nothing could worse orphan boy lommy greenhands named “lumpyhead”

 head felt lumpy touched yoren dragged alley she’d thought meant kill sour old man held tight sawing mats tangles dagger remembered breeze sent fistfuls dirty brown hair skittering across paving stones toward sept father died “i’m taking men boys city” yoren growled sharp steel scraped head “now hold still boy” time finished scalp nothing tufts stubble

 afterward told winterfell she’d arry orphan boy “gate shouldn’t hard road’s another matter got long way go bad company got thirty time men boys bound wall don’t thinking they’re like bastard brother o’ yours” shook “lord eddard gave pick o’ dungeons didn’t find little lordlings lot half o’ would turn queen quick spit pardon maybe silvers half’d they’d rape first keep make water woods alone that’ll hardest part pissing don’t drink more’n need”

 leaving king’s landing easy like he’d said lannister guardsmen gate stopping everyone yoren called one name wagons waved one spared arya glance looking highborn girl daughter king’s hand skinny boy hair chopped arya never looked back wished rush would rise wash whole city away flea bottom red keep great sept everything everyone especially prince joffrey mother knew wouldn’t anyhow sansa still city would wash away remembered arya decided wish winterfell instead

 yoren wrong pissing though wasn’t hardest part lommy greenhands hot pie hardest part orphan boys yoren plucked streets promises food bellies shoes feet rest he’d found chains “the watch needs good men” told set “but lot do”

 yoren taken grown men dungeons well thieves poachers rapers like worst three he’d found black cells must scared even kept fettered hand foot back wagon vowed they’d stay irons way wall one nose hole face cut gross fat bald one pointed teeth weeping sores cheeks eyes like nothing human

 took five wagons king’s landing laden supplies wall hides bolts cloth bars pig iron cage ravens books paper ink bale sourleaf jars oil chests medicine spices teams plow horses pulled wagons yoren bought two coursers halfdozen donkeys boys arya would preferred real horse donkey better riding wagon

 men paid mind lucky boys two years younger youngest orphan mention smaller skinnier lommy hot pie took silence mean scared stupid deaf “look sword lumpyhead’s got there” lommy said one morning made plodding way past orchards wheat fields he’d dyer’s apprentice caught stealing arms mottled green elbow laughed brayed like donkeys riding “where’s gutter rat like lumpyhead get sword”

 arya chewed lip sullenly could see back yoren’s faded black cloak ahead wagons determined go crying help

 “maybe he’s little squire” hot pie put mother baker died he’d pushed cart streets day shouting “hot pies hot pies” “some lordy lord’s little squire boy that’s it”

 “he ain’t squire look bet that’s even real sword bet it’s play sword made tin”

 arya hated making fun needle “it’s castleforged steel stupid” snapped turning saddle glare “and better shut mouth”

 orphan boys hooted “where’d get blade like lumpyface” hot pie wanted know

 “lumpyhead” corrected lommy “he prob’ly stole it”

 “i not” shouted jon snow given needle maybe let call lumpyhead wasn’t going let call jon thief

 “if stole could take him” said hot pie “it’s anyhow could use sword like that”

 lommy egged “go take dare you”

 hot pie kicked donkey riding closer “hey lumpyface gimme sword” hair color straw fat face sunburnt peeling “you don’t know use it”

 yes arya could said killed boy fat boy like stabbed belly died i’ll kill don’t let alone dare yoren didn’t know stableboy afraid might found arya pretty sure men killers three manacles sure queen wasn’t looking wasn’t

 “look him” brayed lommy greenhands “i bet he’s going cry want cry lumpyhead”

 cried sleep night dreaming father come morning she’d woken redeyed dry could shed another tear life hung

 “he’s going wet pants” hot pie suggested

 “leave be” said boy shaggy black hair rode behind lommy named bull account horned helm polished time never wore lommy didn’t dare mock bull older big age broad chest stronglooking arms

 “you better give hot pie sword arry” lommy said “hot pie wants bad kicked boy death he’ll bet”

 “i knocked kicked balls kept kicking dead” hot pie boasted “i kicked pieces balls broke open bloody cock turned black better gimme sword”

 arya slid practice sword belt “you one” told hot pie wanting fight

 “that’s stick” rode nearer tried reach needle’s hilt

 arya made stick whistle laid wood across donkey’s hindquarters animal hawed bucked dumping hot pie ground vaulted donkey poked gut tried get sat back grunt whacked across face nose made crack like branch breaking blood dribbled nostrils hot pie began wail arya whirled toward lommy greenhands sitting donkey openmouthed “you want sword too” yelled didn’t raised dyed green hands front face squealed get away

 bull shouted “behind you” arya spun hot pie knees fist closing around big jagged rock let throw ducking head sailed past flew raised hand hit cheek knee grabbed danced aside bounced wood back head fell got stumbled red face smeared dirt blood arya slid water dancer’s stance waited came close enough lunged right legs hard wooden sword point would come butt cheeks

 time yoren pulled hot pie sprawled ground breeches brown smelly crying arya whapped “enough” black brother roared prying stick sword fingers “you want kill fool” lommy others started squeal old man turned “shut mouths i’ll shutting o’ i’ll tie lot behind wagons drag wall” spat “and goes twice arry come boy now”

 sansa

 morning king joffrey’s name day dawned bright windy long tail great comet visible high scuttling clouds sansa watching tower window ser arys oakheart arrived escort tourney grounds “what think means” asked

 “glory betrothed” ser arys answered “see flames across sky today grace’s name day gods raised banner honor smallfolk named king joffrey’s comet”

 doubtless told joffrey sansa sure “i’ve heard servants calling dragon’s tail”

 “king joffrey sits aegon dragon sat castle built son” ser arys said “he dragon’s heir—and crimson color house lannister another sign comet sent herald joffrey’s ascent throne doubt means triumph enemies”

 king shaded beneath crimson canopy one leg thrown negligently carved wooden arm chair princess myrcella prince tommen sat behind back royal box sandor clegane stood guard hands resting swordbelt white cloak kingsguard draped broad shoulders fastened jeweled brooch snowy cloth looking somehow unnatural brown roughspun tunic studded leather jerkin “lady sansa” hound announced curtly saw voice rough sound saw wood burn scars face throat made one side mouth twitch spoke

 princess myrcella nodded shy greeting sound sansa’s name plump little prince tommen jumped eagerly “sansa hear i’m ride tourney today mother said could” tommen eight reminded little brother bran age bran back winterfell cripple yet safe

 sansa would given anything “i fear life foeman” told tommen solemnly

 “his foeman stuffed straw” joff said rose king clad gilded breastplate roaring lion engraved upon chest expected war engulf moment thirteen today tall age green eyes golden hair lannisters

 “your grace” said dipping curtsy

 ser arys bowed “pray pardon grace must equip lists”

 joffrey waved curt dismissal studied sansa head heels “i’m pleased wore stones”

 king decided play gallant today sansa relieved “i thank them… tender words pray lucky name day grace”

 “sit” joff commanded gesturing empty seat beside “have heard beggar king dead”

 “who” moment sansa afraid meant robb

 “viserys last son mad king aerys he’s going free cities since born calling king well mother says dothraki finally crowned molten gold” laughed “that’s funny don’t think dragon sigil it’s almost good wolf killed traitor brother maybe i’ll feed wolves i’ve caught tell intend challenge single combat”

 “i like see grace” know sansa kept tone cool polite yet even joffrey’s eyes narrowed tried decide whether mocking “will enter lists today” asked quickly

 king frowned “my lady mother said fitting since tourney honor otherwise would champion isn’t dog”

 hound’s mouth twitched “against lot not”

 champion father’s tourney sansa remembered “will joust today lord” asked

 clegane’s voice thick contempt “wouldn’t worth bother arming tournament gnats”

 king laughed “my dog fierce bark perhaps command fight day’s champion death” joffrey fond making men fight death

 “you’d one knight poorer” hound never taken knight’s vows brother knight hated brother

 blare trumpets sounded king settled back seat took sansa’s hand would set heart pounding answered plea mercy presenting father’s head touch filled revulsion knew better show made sit still

 “ser meryn trant kingsguard” herald called

 ser meryn entered west side yard clad gleaming white plate chased gold mounted milkwhite charger flowing grey mane cloak streamed behind like field snow carried twelvefoot lance

 “ser hobber house redwyne arbor” herald sang ser hobber trotted east riding black stallion caparisoned burgundy blue lance striped colors shield bore grape cluster sigil house redwyne twins queen’s unwilling guests even sansa wondered whose notion ride joffrey’s tourney thought

 next came ser horas redwyne’s turn fared better twin vanquishing elderly knight whose mount bedecked silver griffins striped blueandwhite field splendid looked old man made poor contest joffrey curled lip “this feeble show”

 “i warned you” said hound “gnats”

 king growing bored made sansa anxious lowered eyes resolved keep quiet matter joffrey baratheon’s mood darkened chance word might set one rages

 “lothor brune freerider service lord baelish” cried herald “ser dontos red house hollard “

 freerider small man dented plate without device duly appeared west end yard opponent sign finally chestnut stallion trotted view swirl crimson scarlet silks ser dontos knight appeared moment later cursing staggering clad breastplate plumed helm nothing else legs pale skinny manhood flopped obscenely chased horse watchers roared shouted insults catching horse bridle ser dontos tried mount animal would stand still knight drunk bare foot kept missing stirrup

 crowd howling laughter… king joffrey look eyes sansa remembered well look he’d great sept baelor day pronounced death lord eddard stark finally ser dontos red gave bad job sat dirt removed plumed helm “i lose” shouted “fetch wine”

 king stood “a cask cellars i’ll see drowned it”

 sansa heard gasp “no can’t”

 joffrey turned head “what say”

 sansa could believe spoken mad tell front half court hadn’t meant say anything only… ser dontos drunk silly useless meant harm

 “did say can’t you”

 “please” sansa said “i meant… would ill luck grace… kill man name day”

 “you’re lying” joffrey said “i ought drown care much”

 “i don’t care grace” words tumbled desperately “drown head only… kill morrow like please… today name day couldn’t bear ill luck… terrible luck even kings singers say so…”

 joffrey scowled knew lying could see would make bleed

 “the girl speaks truly” hound rasped “what man sows name day reaps throughout year” voice flat care whit whether king believed could true sansa known something she’d said desperate avoid punishment

 unhappy joffrey shifted seat flicked fingers ser dontos “take away i’ll killed morrow fool”

 “he is” sansa said “a fool you’re clever see he’s better fitted fool knight isn’t ought dress motley make clown doesn’t deserve mercy quick death”

 king studied moment “perhaps you’re stupid mother says” raised voice “did hear lady dontos day you’re new fool sleep moon boy dress motley”

 ser dontos sobered near brush death crawled knees “thank grace lady thank you”

 brace lannister guardsmen led master revels approached box “your grace” said “shall summon new challenger brune proceed next tilt”

 “neither gnats knights i’d put death it’s name day tourney done get sight”

 master revels bowed prince tommen obedient “i’m supposed ride straw man”

 “not today”

 “but want ride”

 “i don’t care want”

 “mother said could ride”

 “she said” princess myrcella agreed

 “mother said” mocked king “don’t childish”

 “we’re children” myrcella declared haughtily “we’re supposed childish”

 hound laughed “she there”

 joffrey beaten “very well even brother couldn’t tilt worse others master bring quintain tommen wants gnat”

 tommen gave shout joy ran readied chubby little legs pumping hard “luck” sansa called

 set quintain far end lists prince’s pony saddled tommen’s opponent childsized leather warrior stuffed straw mounted pivot shield one hand padded mace someone fastened pair antlers knight’s head joffrey’s father king robert worn antlers helm sansa remembered… uncle lord renly robert’s brother turned traitor crowned king

 “oh” princess myrcella cried scrambled box ran little brother

 sansa found possessed queer giddy courage “you go her” told king “your brother might hurt”

 joffrey shrugged “what is”

 “you help tell well rode” sansa could seem stop

 “he got knocked horse fell dirt” king pointed “that’s riding well”

 “look” hound interrupted “the boy courage he’s going try again”

 helping prince tommen mount pony tommen elder instead joffrey sansa thought wouldn’t mind marrying tommen

 sounds gatehouse took surprise chains rattled portcullis drawn upward great gates opened creak iron hinges “who told open gate” joff demanded troubles city gates red keep closed days

 column riders emerged beneath portcullis clink steel clatter hooves clegane stepped close king one hand hilt longsword visitors dinted haggard dusty yet standard carried lion lannister golden crimson field wore red cloaks mail lannister menatarms freeriders sellswords armored oddments bristling sharp steel… others monstrous savages one old nan’s tales scary ones bran used love clad shabby skins boiled leather long hair fierce beards wore bloodstained bandages brows wrapped around hands others missing eyes ears fingers

 midst riding tall red horse strange high saddle cradled back front queen’s dwarf brother tyrion lannister one called imp let beard grow cover pushedin face bristly tangle yellow black hair coarse wire back flowed shadowskin cloak black fur striped white held reins left hand carried right arm white silk sling otherwise looked grotesque sansa remembered visited winterfell bulging brow mismatched eyes still ugliest man ever chanced look upon

 yet tommen put spurs pony galloped headlong across yard shouting glee one savages huge shambling man hairy face lost beneath whiskers scooped boy saddle armor deposited ground beside uncle tommen’s breathless laughter echoed walls tyrion clapped backplate sansa startled see two height myrcella came running brother dwarf picked waist spun circle squealing

 lowered back ground little man kissed lightly brow came waddling across yard toward joffrey two men followed close behind blackhaired blackeyed sellsword moved like stalking cat gaunt youth empty socket one eye tommen myrcella trailed

 dwarf went one knee king “your grace”

 “you” joffrey said

 “me” imp agreed “although courteous greeting might order uncle elder”

 “they said dead” hound said

 little man gave big one look one eyes green one black cool “i speaking king cur”

 “i’m glad you’re dead” said princess myrcella

 “we share view sweet child” tyrion turned sansa “my lady sorry losses truly gods cruel”

 sansa could think word say could sorry losses mocking wasn’t gods who’d cruel joffrey

 “i sorry loss well joffrey” dwarf said

 “what loss”

 “your royal father large fierce man black beard you’ll recall try king you”

 “oh yes sad boar killed him”

 “is ‘they’ say grace”

 joffrey frowned sansa felt ought say something septa mordane used tell lady’s armor courtesy donned armor said “i’m sorry lady mother took captive lord”

 “a great many people sorry that” tyrion replied “and done may deal sorrier… yet thank sentiment joffrey might find mother”

 “she’s council” king answered “your brother jaime keeps losing battles” gave sansa angry look fault “he’s taken starks we’ve lost riverrun stupid brother calling king”

 dwarf smiled crookedly “all sorts people calling kings days”

 joff know make though looked suspicious sorts “yes well pleased you’re dead uncle bring gift name day”

 “i wits”

 “i’d sooner robb stark’s head” joff said sly glance sansa “tommen myrcella come”

 sandor clegane lingered behind moment “i’d guard tongue little man” warned strode liege

 sansa left dwarf monsters tried think else might say “you hurt arm” managed last

 “one northmen hit morningstar battle green fork escaped falling horse” grin turned something softer studied face “is grief lord father makes sad”

 “my father traitor” sansa said “and brother lady mother traitors well” reflex learned quickly “i loyal beloved joffrey”

 “no doubt loyal deer surrounded wolves”

 “lions” whispered without thinking glanced nervously one close enough hear

 lannister reached took hand gave squeeze “i little lion child vow shall savage you” bowing said “but must excuse urgent business queen council”

 sansa watched walk body swaying heavily side side every step like something grotesquerie speaks gently joffrey thought queen spoke gently he’s still lannister brother joff’s uncle friend loved prince joffrey heart admired trusted mother queen repaid love trust father’s head sansa would never make mistake





 tyrion

 chilly white raiment kingsguard ser mandon moore looked like corpse shroud “her grace left orders council session disturbed”

 “i would small disturbance ser” tyrion slid parchment sleeve “i bear letter father lord tywin lannister hand king seal”

 “her grace wish disturbed” ser mandon repeated slowly tyrion dullard heard first time

 jaime told moore dangerous kingsguard—excepting always—because face gave hint might next tyrion would welcomed hint bronn timett could likely kill knight came swords would scarcely bode well began slaying one joffrey’s protectors yet let man turn away authority made smile “ser mandon met companions timett son timett red hand burned men bronn perchance recall ser vardis egen captain lord arryn’s household guard”

 “i know man” ser mandon’s eyes pale grey oddly flat lifeless

 “knew” bronn corrected thin smile

 ser mandon deign show heard

 “be may” tyrion said lightly “i truly must see sister present letter ser would kind open door us”

 white knight respond tyrion almost point trying force way past ser mandon abruptly stood aside “you may enter may not”

 small victory thought sweet passed first test tyrion lannister shouldered door feeling almost tall five members king’s small council broke discussion suddenly “you” sister cersei said tone equal parts disbelief distaste

 “i see joffrey learned courtesies” tyrion paused admire pair valyrian sphinxes guarded door affecting air casual confidence cersei could smell weakness way dog smells fear

 “what here” sister’s lovely green eyes studied without least hint affection

 “delivering letter lord father” sauntered table placed tightly rolled parchment

 eunuch varys took letter turned delicate powdered hands “how kind lord tywin scaling wax lovely shade gold” varys gave seal close inspection “it gives every appearance genuine”

 “of course it’s genuine” cersei snatched hands broke wax unrolled parchment

 tyrion watched read sister taken king’s seat herself—he gathered joffrey often trouble attend council meetings robert had—so tyrion climbed hand’s chair seemed appropriate

 “this absurd” queen said last “my lord father sent brother sit place council bids us accept tyrion hand king time join us”

 grand maester pycelle stroked flowing white beard nodded ponderously “it would seem welcome order”

 “indeed” jowly balding janos slynt looked rather like frog smug frog gotten rather “we sore need lord rebellion everywhere grim omen sky rioting city streets…”

 “and whose fault lord janos” cersei lashed “your gold cloaks charged keeping order tyrion could better serve us field battle”

 laughed “no i’m done fields battle thank sit chair better horse i’d sooner hold wine goblet battleaxe thunder drums sunlight flashing armor magnificent destriers snorting prancing well drums gave headaches sunlight flashing armor cooked like harvest day goose magnificent destriers shit everywhere complaining compared hospitality enjoyed vale arryn drums horseshit fly bites favorite things”

 littlefinger laughed “well said lannister man heart”

 tyrion smiled remembering certain dagger dragonbone hilt valyrian steel blade must talk soon wondered lord petyr would find subject amusing well “please” told “do let service whatever small way can”

 cersei read letter “how many men brought “

 “a hundred men chiefly father loath part fighting war all”

 “what use hundred men renly marches city stannis sails dragonstone ask army father sends dwarf king names hand consent council joffrey named lord father”

 “and lord father named me”

 “he cannot without joff’s consent”

 “lord tywin harrenhal host you’d care take him” tyrion said politely “my lords perchance would permit private word sister”

 varys slithered feet smiling unctuous way “how must yearned sound sweet sister’s voice lords please let us give moments together woes troubled realm shall keep”

 janos slynt rose hesitantly grand maester pycelle ponderously yet rose littlefinger last “shall tell steward prepare chambers maegor’s holdfast”

 “my thanks lord petyr taking lord stark’s former quarters tower hand”

 littlefinger laughed “you’re braver man lannister know fate last two hands”

 “two mean frighten say four”

 “four” littlefinger raised eyebrow “did hands lord arryn meet dire end tower i’m afraid young pay much mind”

 “aerys targaryen’s last hand killed sack king’s landing though doubt he’d time settle tower hand fortnight one burned death came two others died landless penniless exile counted lucky believe lord father last hand depart king’s landing name properties parts intact”

 “fascinating” said littlefinger “and reason i’d sooner bed dungeon”

 perhaps you’ll get wish tyrion thought said “courage folly cousins i’ve heard whatever curse may linger tower hand pray i’m small enough escape notice”

 janos slynt laughed littlefinger smiled grand maester pycelle followed bowing gravely

 “i hope father send way plague us history lessons” sister said alone

 “how yearned sound sweet voice” tyrion sighed

 “how yearned eunuch’s tongue pulled hot pincers” cersei replied “has father lost senses forge letter” read mounting annoyance “why would inflict wanted come himself” crushed lord tywin’s letter fingers “i joffrey’s regent sent royal command”

 “and ignored you” tyrion pointed “he quite large army first he”

 cersei’s mouth tightened could see color rising “if name letter forgery tell throw dungeon one ignore promise you”

 walking rotten ice tyrion knew one false step would plunge “no one” agreed amiably “least father one army want throw dungeon sweet sister i’ve come long way help “

 “i require help father’s presence commanded”

 “yes” said quietly “but it’s jaime want”

 sister fancied subtle grown could read face like one favorite books read rage fear despair “jaime—”

 “—is brother less yours” tyrion interrupted “give support promise jaime freed returned us unharmed”

 “how” cersei demanded “the stark boy mother like forget beheaded lord eddard”

 “true” tyrion agreed “yet still hold daughters don’t saw older girl yard joffrey”

 “sansa” queen said “i’ve given younger brat well it’s lie sent meryn trant take hand robert died wretched dancing master interfered girl fled one seen since likely she’s dead great many people died day”

 tyrion hoped stark girls supposed one would “tell friends council”

 sister glanced door “what them”

 “father seems taken dislike left wondering heads might look wall beside lord stark’s” leaned forward across table “are certain loyalty trust them”

 “i trust one” cersei snapped “i need father believe playing us false”

 “suspects rather”

 “why know”

 tyrion shrugged “he knows son’s short reign long parade follies disasters suggests someone giving joffrey bad counsel”

 cersei gave searching look “joff lack good counsel he’s always strongwilled he’s king believes pleases he’s bid”

 “crowns queer things heads beneath them” tyrion agreed “this business eddard stark… joffrey’s work”

 queen grimaced “he instructed pardon stark allow take black man would way forever might made peace son joff took upon give mob better show called lord eddard’s head front half city janos slynt ser ilyn went ahead blithely shortened man without word me” hand tightened fist “the high septon claims profaned baelor’s sept blood lying intent”

 “it would seem point” said tyrion “so lord slynt part tell whose fine notion grant harrenhal name council”

 “littlefinger made arrangements needed slynt’s gold cloaks eddard stark plotting renly he’d written lord stannis offering throne might lost even close thing sansa hadn’t come told father’s plans…”

 tyrion surprised “truly daughter” sansa always seemed sweet child tender courteous

 “the girl wet love would done anything joffrey cut father’s head called mercy put end that”

 “his grace unique way winning hearts subjects” tyrion said crooked smile “was joffrey’s wish dismiss ser barristan selmy kingsguard too”

 cersei sighed “joff wanted someone blame robert’s death varys suggested ser barristan gave jaime command kingsguard seat small council allowed joff throw bone dog fond sandor clegane prepared offer selmy land towerhouse useless old fool deserved”

 “i hear useless old fool slew two slynt’s gold cloaks tried seize mud gate”

 sister looked unhappy “janos sent men competent might wished”

 “ser barristan lord commander robert baratheon’s kingsguard” tyrion reminded pointedly “he jaime survivors aerys targaryen’s seven smallfolk talk way talk serwyn mirror shield prince aemon dragonknight imagine they’ll think see barristan bold riding beside robb stark stannis baratheon”

 cersei glanced away “i considered that”

 “father did” said tyrion “that sent put end follies bring son heel”

 “joff tractable me”

 “he might”

 “why he”

 “he knows would never hurt him”

 cersei’s eyes narrowed “if believe i’d ever allow harm son you’re sick fever”

 tyrion sighed she’d missed point often “joffrey safe you” assured “but long boy feels threatened he’ll inclined listen” took hand “i brother know need whether care admit son needs he’s hope retaining ugly iron chair”

 sister seemed shocked would touch “you always cunning”

 “in small way” grinned

 “it may worth trying… make mistake tyrion accept shall king’s hand name hand truth share plans intentions act nothing without consent understand”

 “oh yes”

 “do agree”

 “certainly” lied “i sister” long need “so one purpose ought secrets us say joffrey lord eddard killed varys dismissed ser barristan littlefinger gifted us lord slynt murdered jon arryn “

 cersei yanked hand back “how know”

 “the grieving widow eyrie seems think come notion wonder”

 “i’m sure don’t know fool eddard stark accused thing hinted lord arryn suspected or… well believed…”

 “that fucking sweet jaime”

 slapped

 “did think blind father” tyrion rubbed cheek “who lie matter me… although doesn’t seem quite open legs one brother other”

 slapped

 “be gentle cersei i’m jesting truth told i’d sooner nice whore never understood jaime saw apart reflection”

 slapped

 cheeks red burning yet smiled “if keep may get angry”

 stayed hand “why care do”

 “i new friends” tyrion confessed “you won’t like kill robert”

 “he help lancel saw robert going boar gave strongwine favorite sour red fortified three times potent used great stinking fool loved could stopped swilling anytime cared drained one skin told lancel fetch another boar rest feast tyrion never boar delicious cooked mushrooms apples tasted like triumph”

 “truly sister born widow” tyrion rather liked robert baratheon great blustering oaf was… doubtless part sister loathed “now done slapping off” twisted legs around clambered awkwardly chair

 cersei frowned “i haven’t given leave depart want know intend free jaime”

 “i’ll tell know schemes like fruit require certain ripening right mind ride streets take measure city” tyrion rested hand head sphinx beside door “one parting request kindly make certain harm comes sansa stark would lose daughters”

 outside council chamber tyrion nodded ser mandon made way long vaulted hall bronn fell beside timett son timett sign “where’s red hand” tyrion asked

 “he felt urge explore kind made waiting halls”

 “i hope doesn’t kill anyone important” clansmen tyrion brought fastnesses mountains moon loyal fierce way proud quarrelsome well prone answer insults real imagined steel “try find see rest quartered fed want barracks beneath tower hand don’t let steward put stone crows near moon brothers tell burned men must hall themselves”

 “where be”

 “i’m riding back broken anvil”

 bronn grinned insolently “need escort talk streets dangerous”

 “i’ll call upon captain sister’s household guard remind less lannister needs recall oath casterly rock cersei joffrey”

 hour later tyrion rode red keep accompanied dozen lannister guardsmen crimson cloaks lioncrested halfhelms passed beneath portcullis noted heads mounted atop walls black rot old tar long since become unrecognizable “captain vylarr” called “i want taken morrow give silent sisters cleaning” would hell match bodies supposed yet must done even midst war certain decencies needed observed

 vylarr grew hesitant “his grace told us wishes traitors’ heads remain walls fills last three empty spikes end”

 “let hazard wild stab one robb stark others lords stannis renly would right”

 “yes lord”

 “my nephew thirteen years old today vylarr try recall i’ll heads morrow one empty spikes may different lodger take meaning captain”

 “i’ll see they’re taken lord”

 “good” tyrion put heels horse trotted away leaving red cloaks follow best could

 told cersei intended take measure city entirely lie tyrion lannister pleased much saw streets king’s landing always teeming raucous noisy reeked danger way recall past visits naked corpse sprawled gutter near street looms torn pack feral dogs yet one seemed care watchmen much evidence moving pairs alleys gold cloaks shirts black ringmail iron cudgels never far hands markets crowded ragged men selling household goods price could get… conspicuously empty farmers selling food little produce see three times costly year ago one peddler hawking rats roasted skewer “fresh rats” cried loudly “fresh rats” doubtless fresh rats preferred old stale rotten rats frightening thing rats looked appetizing butchers selling street flour tyrion saw guards every shop door times grew lean even bakers found sellswords cheaper bread reflected

 “there food coming there” said vylarr

 “little enough” captain admitted “with war riverlands lord renly raising rebels highgarden roads closed south west”

 “and good sister done this”

 “she taking steps restore king’s peace” vylarr assured “lord slynt tripled size city watch queen put thousand craftsmen work defenses stonemasons strengthening walls carpenters building scorpions catapults hundred fletchers making arrows smiths forging blades alchemists’ guild pledged ten thousand jars wildfire”

 tyrion shifted uncomfortably saddle pleased cersei idle wildfire treacherous stuff ten thousand jars enough turn king’s landing cinders “where sister found coin pay this” secret king robert left crown vastly debt alchemists seldom mistaken altruists

 “lord littlefinger always finds way lord imposed tax wishing enter city”

 “yes would work” tyrion said thinking clever clever cruel tens thousands fled fighting supposed safety king’s landing seen kingsroad troupes mothers children anxious fathers gazed horses wagons covetous eyes reached city would doubtless pay put high comforting walls war… though might think twice knew wildfire

 inn beneath sign broken anvil stood within sight walls near gate gods entered morning rode courtyard boy ran help tyrion horse “take men back castle” told vylarr “i’ll spending night here”

 captain looked dubious “will safe lord”

 “well captain left inn morning full black ears one never quite safe chella daughter cheyk about” tyrion waddled toward door leaving vylarr puzzle meaning

 gust merriment greeted shoved inn’s common room recognized chella’s throaty chuckle lighter music shae’s laughter girl seated hearth sipping wine round wooden table three black ears he’d left guard plump man whose back innkeeper assumed… shae called tyrion name intruder rose “my good lord pleased see you” gushed soft eunuch’s smile powdered face

 tyrion stumbled “lord varys thought see here” others take find quickly

 “forgive intrude” varys said “i taken sudden urge meet young lady”

 “young lady” shae repeated savoring words “you’re half right m’lord i’m young”

 eighteen tyrion thought eighteen whore quick wit nimble cat sheets large dark eyes fine black hair sweet soft hungry little mouth… mine damn eunuch “i fear i’m intruder lord varys” said forced courtesy “when came midst merriment”

 “m’lord varys complimented chella ears said must killed many men fine necklace” shae explained grated hear call varys m’lord tone called pillow play “and chella told cowards kill vanquished”

 “braver leave man alive chance cleanse shame winning back ear” explained chella small dark woman whose grisly neckware hung less fortysix dried wrinkled ears tyrion counted “only prove fear enemies”

 shae hooted “and m’lord says black ear he’d never sleep dreams oneeared men”

 “a problem never need face” tyrion said “i’m terrified enemies kill all”

 varys giggled “will take wine us lord”

 “i’ll take wine” tyrion seated beside shae understood happening chella girl varys delivering message said taken sudden urge meet young lady meant tried hide knew wondered betrayed innkeeper boy stable guard gate… one

 “i always like return city gate gods” varys told shae filled wine cups “the carvings gatehouse exquisite make weep time see eyes… expressive don’t think almost seem follow ride beneath portcullis”

 “i never noticed m’lord” shae replied “i’ll look morrow please you”

 don’t bother sweetling tyrion thought swirling wine cup cares whit carvings eyes boasts means watching knew moment passed gates

 “do careful child” varys urged “king’s landing wholly safe days know streets well yet almost feared come today alone unarmed lawless men everywhere dark time oh yes men cold steel colder hearts” come alone unarmed others come swords fists saying

 shae laughed “if try bother they’ll one ear short chella runs off”

 varys hooted funniest thing ever heard laughter eyes turned tyrion “your young lady amiable way take good care you”

 “i intend man tries harm her—well i’m small black ear make claims courage” see speak tongue eunuch hurt i’ll head

 “i leave you” varys rose “i know weary must wished welcome lord tell pleased arrival dire need council seen comet”

 “i’m short blind” tyrion said kingsroad seemed cover half sky outshining crescent moon

 “in streets call red messenger” varys said “they say comes herald king warn fire blood follow” eunuch rubbed powdered hands together “may leave bit riddle lord tyrion” wait answer “in room sit three great men king priest rich man gold stands sellsword little man common birth great mind great ones bids slay two ‘do it’ says king ‘for lawful ruler’ ‘do it’ says priest ‘for command names gods’ ‘do it’ says rich man ‘and gold shall yours’ tell me—who lives dies” bowing deeply eunuch hurried common room soft slippered feet

 gone chella gave snort shae wrinkled pretty face “the rich man lives doesn’t he”

 tyrion sipped wine thoughtful “perhaps would depend sellsword seems” set cup “come let’s go upstairs”

 wait top steps legs slim supple short stunted full aches smiling reached “did miss me” teased took hand

 “desperately” tyrion admitted shae stood shade five feet yet still must look her… case found mind sweet look

 “you’ll miss time red keep” said led room “all alone cold bed tower hand”

 “too true” tyrion would gladly kept lord father forbidden take whore court lord tywin commanded bringing city much defiance dared authority derived father girl understand “you won’t far” promised “you’ll house guards servants i’ll visit often i’m able”

 shae kicked shut door cloudy panes narrow window could make great sept baelor crowning visenya’s hill tyrion distracted different sight bending shae took gown hem drew head tossed aside believe smallclothes “you’ll never able rest” said stood pink nude lovely one hand braced hip “you’ll think every time go bed you’ll get hard you’ll one help you’ll never able sleep unless you”—she grinned wicked grin tyrion liked well—“is call tower hand m’lord”

 “be quiet kiss me” commanded

 could taste wine lips feel small firm breasts pressed fingers moved lacings breeches “my lion” whispered broke kiss undress “my sweet lord giant lannister” tyrion pushed toward bed entered screamed loud enough wake baelor blessed tomb nails left gouges back he’d never pain liked half well

 fool thought afterward lay center sagging mattress amidst rumpled sheets never learn dwarf she’s whore damn it’s coin loves cock remember tysha yet fingers trailed lightly one nipple stiffened touch could see mark breast he’d bitten passion

 “so m’lord you’re hand king” shae asked cupped warm sweet flesh

 “something cersei never expect” tyrion murmured softly slender neck “i’ll do… justice”





 bran

 bran preferred hard stone window seat comforts featherbed blankets abed walls pressed close ceiling hung heavy abed room cell winterfell prison yet outside window wide world still called

 could walk climb hunt fight wooden sword could still look liked watch windows begin glow winterfell candles hearth fires lit behind diamondshaped panes tower hall loved listen direwolves sing stars

 late often dreamed wolves talking brother brother told direwolves howled could almost understand them… quite truly almost… singing language known somehow forgotten walders might scared starks wolf blood old nan told “though stronger others” warned

 summer’s howls long sad full grief longing shaggydog’s savage voices echoed yards halls castle rang seemed though great pack direwolves haunted winterfell instead two… two six miss brothers sisters bran wondered calling grey wind ghost nymeria lady’s shade want come home pack together

 “who know mind wolf” ser rodrik cassel said bran asked howled bran’s lady mother named castellan winterfell absence duties left little time idle questions

 “it’s freedom they’re calling for” declared farlen kennelmaster love direwolves hounds “they don’t like walled who’s blame wild things belong wild castle”

 “they want hunt” agreed gage cook tossed cubes suet great kettle stew “a wolf smells better’n man like they’ve caught scent o’ prey”

 maester luwin think “wolves often howl moon howling comet see bright bran perchance think moon”

 bran repeated osha laughed aloud “your wolves wit maester” wildling woman said “they know truths grey man forgotten” way said made shiver asked comet meant answered “blood fire boy nothing sweet”

 bran asked septon chayle comet sorting scrolls snatched library fire “it sword slays season” replied soon white raven came oldtown bringing word autumn doubtless right

 though old nan think she’d lived longer “dragons” said lifting head sniffing near blind could see comet yet claimed could smell “it dragons boy” insisted bran got princes nan ever

 hodor said “hodor” ever said

 still direwolves howled guards walls muttered curses hounds kennels barked furiously horses kicked stalls walders shivered fire even maester luwin complained sleepless nights bran mind ser rodrik confined wolves godswood shaggydog bit little walder stones winterfell played queer tricks sound sometimes sounded yard right bran’s window times would sworn curtain walls loping round like sentries wished could see

 could see comet hanging guards hall bell tower farther back first keep squat round gargoyles black shapes bruised purple dusk bran known every stone buildings inside climbed scampering walls easily boys ran stairs rooftops secret places crows atop broken tower special friends

 fallen

 bran remember falling yet said supposed must true almost died saw weatherworn gargoyles atop first keep happened got queer tight feeling belly could climb walk run swordfight dreams he’d dreamed knighthood soured head

 summer howled day bran fallen long lay broken bed robb told went away war summer mourned shaggydog grey wind joined grief night bloody raven brought word father’s death wolves known bran maester’s turret rickon talking children forest summer shaggydog drowned luwin howls

 mourning enemy slain king north used brother robb bastard brother jon snow fallen wall mother died one sisters something else maester septon old nan seemed think

 truly direwolf would understand song thought wistfully wolf dreams could race sides mountains jagged icy mountains taller tower stand summit beneath full moon world way used

 “oooo” bran cried tentatively cupped hands around mouth lifted head comet “ooooooooooooooooooo ahooooooooooooooo” howled sounded stupid high hollow quavering little boy’s howl wolf’s yet summer gave answer deep voice drowning bran’s thin one shaggydog made chorus bran haroooed howled together last pack

 noise brought guard door hayhead wen nose peered saw bran howling window said “what’s prince”

 made bran feel queer called prince though robb’s heir robb king north turned head howl guard “oooooooo oooooooooooooooo”

 hayhead screwed face “now stop there”

 “oooooooooooo ooooooooooooooooooooooo”

 guardsman retreated came back maester luwin grey chain tight neck “bran beasts make sufficient noise without help” crossed room put hand boy’s brow “the hour grows late ought fast asleep”

 “i’m talking wolves” bran brushed hand away

 “shall hayhead carry bed”

 “i get bed myself” mikken hammered row iron bars wall bran could pull room arms slow hard made shoulders ache hated carried “anyway don’t sleep don’t want to”

 “all men must sleep bran even princes”

 “when sleep turn wolf” bran turned face away looked back night “do wolves dream”

 “all creatures dream think yet men do”

 “do dead men dream” bran asked thinking father dark crypts winterfell stonemason chiseling father’s likeness granite

 “some say yes no” maester answered “the dead silent matter”

 “do trees dream”

 “trees no…”

 “they do” bran said sudden certainty “they dream tree dreams dream tree sometimes weirwood like one godswood calls wolf dreams better smell things sometimes taste blood”

 maester luwin tugged chain chafed neck “if would spend time children—”

 “i hate children” bran said meaning walders “i commanded send away”

 luwin grew stern “the freys lady mother’s wards sent fostered express command expel kind turned would go”

 “home it’s fault won’t let summer”

 “the frey boy ask attacked” maester said “no did”

 “that shaggydog” rickon’s big black wolf wild even frightened bran times “summer never bit anyone”

 “summer ripped man’s throat chamber forgotten truth sweet pups brothers found snow grown dangerous beasts frey boys wise wary them”

 “we put walders godswood could play lord crossing want summer could sleep i’m prince won’t heed wanted ride dancer alebelly wouldn’t let past gate”

 “and rightly wolfswood full danger last ride taught would want outlaw take captive sell lannisters”

 “summer would save me” bran insisted stubbornly “princes allowed sail sea hunt boar wolfswood joust lances”

 “bran child torment one day may things boy eight”

 “i’d sooner wolf could live wood sleep wanted could find arya sansa i’d smell go save robb went battle i’d fight beside like grey wind i’d tear kingslayer’s throat teeth rip war would everyone would come back winterfell wolf…” howled “oooooooooooooooooo”

 luwin raised voice “a true prince would welcome—”

 “aahooooooo” bran howled louder “aahoooooooooooo”

 maester surrendered “as child” look part grief part disgust left bedchamber

 howling lost savor bran alone time quieted welcome told resentful lord winterfell true lord can’t say wasn’t walders arrived twins rickon wanted gone baby four screamed wanted mother father robb strangers bran soothe bid freys welcome offered meat mead seat fire even maester luwin said afterward he’d done well

 game

 game played log staff body water great deal shouting water important walder walder assured bran could use plank even series stones branch could staff didn’t shout without water game maester luwin ser rodrik let children go wandering wolfswood search stream made one murky pools godswood walder walder never seen hot water bubbling ground allowed would make game even better

 called walder frey big walder said bunches walders twins named boys’ grandfather lord walder frey “we names winterfell” rickon told haughtily heard

 way game played laid log across water one player stood middle stick lord crossing one players came say “i lord crossing goes there” player make speech allowed cross lord could make swear oaths answer questions didn’t tell truth oaths binding unless said “maybaps” trick say “mayhaps” lord crossing didn’t notice could try knock lord water got lord crossing you’d said “mayhaps” otherwise game lord got knock anyone water anytime pleased one got use stick

 practice game seemed come mostly shoving hitting falling water along lot loud arguments whether someone said “mayhaps” little walder lord crossing often

 little walder even though tall stout red face big round belly big walder sharpfaced skinny half foot shorter “he’s fiftytwo days older me” little walder explained “so bigger first grew faster”

 “we’re cousins brothers” added big walder little one “i’m walder son jammos father lord walder’s son fourth wife he’s walder son merrett grandmother lord walder’s third wife crakehall he’s ahead line succession even though i’m older”

 “only fiftytwo days” little walder objected “and neither us ever hold twins stupid”

 “i will” big walder declared “we’re walders either ser stevron grandson black walder he’s fourth line succession there’s red walder ser emmon’s son bastard walder isn’t line he’s called walder rivers walder frey plus there’s girls named walda”

 “and tyr always forget tyr”

 “he’s waltyr walder” big walder said airily “and he’s us doesn’t matter anyhow never liked him”

 ser rodrik decreed would share jon snow’s old bedchamber since jon night’s watch never coming back bran hated made feel freys trying steal jon’s place

 watched wistfully walders contested turnip cook’s boy joseth’s girls bandy shyra walders decreed bran judge decide whether people said “mayhaps” soon started playing forgot

 shouts splashes soon drew others palla kennel girl cayn’s boy calon tom whose father fat tom died bran’s father king’s landing long every one soaked muddy palla brown head heel moss hair breathless laughter bran heard much laughing since night bloody raven came legs i’d knock water thought bitterly one would ever lord crossing

 finally rickon came running godswood shaggydog heels watched turnip little walder struggle stick turnip lost footing went huge splash arms waving rickon yelled “me want play” little walder beckoned shaggydog started follow “no shaggy” brother commanded “wolves can’t play stay bran” did…

 …until little walder smacked rickon stick square across belly bran could blink black wolf flying plank blood water walders shrieking red murder rickon sat mud laughing hodor came lumbering shouting “hodor hodor hodor”

 oddly rickon decided liked walders never played lord crossing played games—monsters maidens rats cats comeintomycastle sorts things rickon side walders plundered kitchens pies honeycombs raced round walls tossed bones pups kennels trained wooden swords ser rodrik’s sharp eye rickon even showed deep vaults earth stonemason carving father’s tomb “you right” bran screamed brother heard “that place stark place” rickon never cared

 door bedchamber opened maester luwin carrying green jar time osha hayhead came “i’ve made sleeping draught bran”

 osha scooped bony arms tall woman wiry strong bore effortlessly bed

 “this give dreamless sleep” maester luwin said pulled stopper jar “sweet dreamless sleep”

 “it will” bran said wanting believe

 “yes drink”

 bran drank potion thick chalky honey went easy

 “come morn you’ll feel better” luwin gave bran smile pat took leave

 osha lingered behind “is wolf dreams again”

 bran nodded

 “you fight hard boy see talking heart tree might gods trying talk back”

 “the gods” murmured drowsy already osha’s face grew blurry grey sweet dreamless sleep bran thought

 yet darkness closed found godswood moving silently beneath greengrey sentinels gnarled oaks old time walking thought exulting part knew dream even dream walking better truth bedchamber walls ceiling door

 arya

 traveled dawn dusk past woods orchards neatly tended fields small villages crowded market towns stout holdfasts come dark would make camp eat light red sword men took turns standing watch arya would glimpse firelight flickering trees camps travelers seemed camps every night traffic kingsroad day

 morn noon night came old folks little children big men small ones barefoot girls women babes breasts drove farm wagons bumped along back ox carts rode draft horses ponies mules donkeys anything would walk run roll one woman led milk cow little girl back arya saw smith pushing wheelbarrow tools inside hammers tongs even anvil little later different man different wheelbarrow inside one two babies blanket came foot goods shoulders weary wary looks upon faces walked south toward city toward king’s landing one hundred spared much word yoren charges traveling north wondered one else going way

 many travelers armed arya saw daggers dirks scythes axes sword made clubs tree limbs carved knobby staffs fingered weapons gave lingering looks wagons rolled yet end let column pass thirty many matter wagons

 look eyes syrio said listen ears

 one day madwoman began scream side road “fools they’ll kill fools” scarecrow thin hollow eyes bloody feet

 next morning sleek merchant grey mare reined yoren offered buy wagons everything quarter worth “it’s war they’ll take want you’ll better selling friend” yoren turned away twist crooked shoulders spat

 arya noticed first grave day small mound beside road dug child crystal set soft earth lommy wanted take bull told he’d better leave dead alone leagues farther praed pointed graves whole row freshly dug day hardly passed without one

 one time arya woke dark frightened reason could name red sword shared sky half thousand stars night seemed oddly quiet though could hear yoren’s muttered snores crackle fire even muffled stirrings donkeys yet somehow felt though world holding breath silence made shiver went back sleep clutching needle

 come morning praed awaken arya realized coughing missed dug grave burying sellsword he’d slept yoren stripped valuables threw dirt one man claimed boots another dagger mail shirt helm parceled longsword yoren handed bull “arms like might learn use this” told boy called tarber tossed handful acorns top praed’s body oak might grow mark place

 evening stopped village ivycovered inn yoren counted coins purse decided enough hot meal “we’ll sleep outside ever got bathhouse feels need o’ hot water lick o’ soap”

 arya dare even though smelled bad yoren sour stinky creatures living clothes come way flea bottom didn’t seem right drown tarber hot pie bull joined line men headed tubs others settled front bathhouse rest crowded common room yoren even sent lommy tankards three fetters who’d left chained back wagon

 washed unwashed alike supped hot pork pies baked apples innkeeper gave round beer house “i brother took black years ago serving boy clever one day got seen filching pepper m’lord’s table liked taste pinch o’ pepper ser malcolm hard man get pepper wall” yoren shook head man sighed “shame lync loved pepper”

 arya sipped tankard cautiously spoonfuls pie still warm oven father sometimes let cup beer remembered sansa used make face taste say wine ever much finer arya liked well enough made sad think sansa father

 inn full people moving south common room erupted scorn yoren said traveling way “you’ll back soon enough” innkeeper vowed “there’s going north half fields burnt folks left walled inside holdfasts one bunch rides dawn another one shows dusk”

 “that’s nothing us” yoren insisted stubbornly “tully lannister makes matter watch takes part”

 lord tully grandfather arya thought mattered chewed lip kept quiet listening

 “it’s lannister tully” innkeeper said “there’s wild men mountains moon try telling take part starks young lord’s come dead hand’s son…”

 arya sat straight straining hear mean robb

 “i heard boy rides battle wolf” said yellowhaired man tankard hand

 “fool’s talk” yoren spat

 “the man heard saw wolf big horse swore”

 “swearing don’t make true hod” innkeeper said “you keep swearing you’ll pay owe i’ve yet see copper” common room erupted laughter man yellow hair turned red

 “it’s bad year wolves” volunteered sallow man travelstained green cloak “around gods eye packs grown bolder’n anyone remember sheep cows dogs makes matter kill like got fear men it’s worth life go woods night”

 “ah that’s tales true other”

 “i heard thing cousin she’s sort lie” old woman said “she says there’s great pack hundreds mankillers one leads shewolf bitch seventh hell”

 shewolf arya sloshed beer wondering gods eye near trident wished map near trident she’d left nymeria hadn’t wanted jory said choice wolf came back she’d killed biting joffrey even though he’d deserved they’d shout scream throw stones wasn’t arya’s stones struck home direwolf finally stopped following probably wouldn’t even know arya thought she’d hate

 man green cloak said “i heard hellbitch walked village one day… market day people everywhere walks bold please tears baby mother’s arms tale reached lord mooton sons swore they’d put end tracked lair pack wolfhounds barely escaped skins one dogs came back one”

 “that’s story” arya blurted could stop “wolves don’t eat babies”

 “and would know lad” asked man green cloak

 could think answer yoren arm “the boy’s greensick beer that’s is”

 “no i’m don’t eat babies…”

 “outside boy… see stay learn shut mouth men talking” gave stiff shove toward side door led back stables “go see stableboy watered horses”

 arya went outside stiff fury “they don’t” muttered kicking rock stalked went rolling fetched wagons

 “boy” friendly voice called “lovely boy”

 one men irons talking warily arya approached wagon one hand needle’s hilt

 prisoner lifted empty tankard chains rattling “a man could use another taste beer man thirst wearing heavy bracelets” youngest three slender finefeatured always smiling hair red one side white matted filthy cage travel “a man could use bath too” said saw way arya looking “a boy could make friend”

 “i friends” arya said

 “none see” said one without nose squat thick huge hands black hair covered arms legs chest even back reminded arya drawing seen book ape summer isles hole face made hard look long

 bald one opened mouth hissed like immense white lizard arya flinched back startled opened mouth wide waggled tongue stump tongue “stop that” blurted

 “a man choose companions black cells” handsome one redandwhite hair said something way talked reminded syrio yet different “these two courtesy man must ask forgiveness called arry so”

 “lumpyhead” said noseless one “lumpyhead lumpyface stickboy care lorath he’ll hit stick”

 “a man must ashamed company keeps arry” handsome one said “this man honor jaqen h’ghar free city lorath would home man’s illbred companions captivity named rorge”—he waved tankard noseless man—“and biter” biter hissed displaying mouthful yellowed teeth filed points “a man must name biter cannot speak biter cannot write yet teeth sharp man calls biter smiles charmed”

 arya backed away wagon “no” can’t hurt told they’re chained

 turned tankard upside “a man must weep”

 rorge noseless one flung drinking cup curse manacles made clumsy yet even would sent heavy pewter tankard crashing head arya hadn’t leapt aside “you get us beer pimple now”

 “you shut mouth” arya tried think syrio would done drew wooden practice sword

 “come closer” rorge said “and i’ll shove stick bunghole fuck bloody”

 fear cuts deeper swords arya made approach wagon every step harder one fierce wolverine calm still water words sang head syrio would afraid almost close enough touch wheel biter lurched feet grabbed irons clanking rattling manacles brought hands short half foot face hissed

 hit hard right little eyes

 screaming biter reeled back threw weight chains links slithered turned grew taut arya heard creak old dry wood great iron rings strained floorboards wagon huge pale hands groped veins bulged along biter’s arms bonds held finally man collapsed backward blood ran weeping sores cheeks

 “a boy courage sense” one named jaqen h’ghar observed

 arya edged backward away wagon felt hand shoulder whirled bringing stick sword bull “what doing”

 raised hands defensively “yoren said none us go near three”

 “they don’t scare me” arya said

 “then you’re stupid scare me” bull’s hand fell hilt sword rorge began laugh “let’s get away them”

 arya scuffed ground foot let bull lead around front inn rorge’s laughter biter’s hissing followed “want fight” asked bull wanted hit something

 blinked startled strands thick black hair still wet bathhouse fell across deep blue eyes “i’d hurt you”

 “you would not”

 “you don’t know strong am”

 “you don’t know quick am”

 “you’re asking arry” drew praed’s longsword “this cheap steel it’s real sword”

 arya unsheathed needle “this good steel it’s realer yours”

 bull shook head “promise cry cut you”

 “i’ll promise will” turned sideways water dancer’s stance bull move looking something behind “what’s wrong”

 “gold cloaks” face closed tight

 couldn’t arya thought glanced back riding kingsroad six black ringmail golden cloaks city watch one officer wore black enamel breastplate ornamented four golden disks drew front inn look eyes syrio’s voice seemed whisper eyes saw white lather saddles horses ridden long hard calm still water took bull arm drew back behind tall flowering hedge

 “what it” asked “what let go”

 “quiet shadow” whispered pulling

 yoren’s charges sitting front bathhouse waiting turn tub “you men” one gold cloaks shouted “you ones left take black”

 “we might be” came cautious answer

 “we’d rather join boys” old reysen said “we hear it’s cold wall”

 gold cloak officer dismounted “i warrant certain boy—”

 yoren stepped inn fingering tangled black beard “who wants boy”

 gold cloaks dismounting stand beside horses “why hiding” bull whispered

 “it’s want” arya whispered back ear smelled soap “you quiet”

 “the queen wants old man it’s concern” officer said drawing ribbon belt “here grace’s seal warrant”

 behind hedge bull shook head doubtfully “why would queen want arry”

 punched shoulder “be quiet”

 yoren fingered warrant ribbon blob golden wax “pretty” spit “thing boy’s night’s watch done back city don’t mean pissall”

 “the queen’s interested views old man neither i” officer said “i’ll boy”

 arya thought running knew wouldn’t get far donkey gold cloaks horses tired running she’d run ser meryn came killed father real water dancer would go needle kill never run anyone ever

 “you’ll one” yoren said stubbornly “there’s laws things”

 gold cloak drew shortsword “here’s law”

 yoren looked blade “that’s law sword happens got one too”

 officer smiled “old fool five men me”

 yoren spat “happens got thirty”

 gold cloak laughed “this lot” said big lout broken nose “who’s first” shouted showing steel

 tarber plucked pitchfork bale hay “i am”

 “no am” called cutjack plump stonemason pulling hammer leather apron always wore

 “me” kurz came ground skinning knife hand

 “me him” koss strung longbow

 “all us” said reysen snatching tall hardwood walking staff carried

 dobber stepped naked bathhouse clothes bundle saw happening dropped everything dagger “is fight” asked

 “i guess” said hot pie scrambling fours big rock throw arya could believe seeing hated hot pie would risk

 one broken nose still thought funny “you girls put away rocks sticks get spanked none knows end sword hold”

 “i do” arya wouldn’t let die like syrio wouldn’t shoving hedge needle hand slid water dancer’s stance

 broken nose guffawed officer looked “put blade away little girl one wants hurt you”

 “i’m girl” yelled furious wrong rode way smiling “i’m one want”

 “he’s one want” officer jabbed shortsword toward bull who’d come forward stand beside praed’s cheap steel hand

 mistake take eyes yoren even instant quick black brother’s sword pressed apple officer’s throat “neither’s one get less want see apple’s ripe yet got ten fifteen brothers inn still need convincing i’d let loose gutcutter spread cheeks fat little horse gallop back city” spat poked harder point sword “now”

 officer’s fingers uncurled sword fell dust

 “we’ll keep that” yoren said “good steel’s always needed wall”

 “as say men” gold cloaks sheathed mounted “you’d best scamper wall hurry old man next time catch believe i’ll head go bastard boy’s”

 “better men tried” yoren slapped rump officer’s horse flat sword sent reeling kingsroad men followed

 sight hot pie began whoop yoren looked angrier ever “fool think he’s done us next time won’t prance hand damn ribbon get rest o’ baths need moving ride night maybe stay ahead o’ bit” scooped shortsword officer dropped “who wants this”

 “me” hot pie yelled

 “don’t using arry” handed boy sword hilt first walked arya bull spoke “queen wants bad boy”

 arya lost “why want him”

 bull scowled “why want you’re nothing little gutter rat”

 “well you’re nothing bastard boy” maybe pretending bastard boy “what’s true name”

 “gendry” said like wasn’t quite sure

 “don’t see one wants neither o’ you” yoren said “but can’t regardless ride two coursers first sight gold cloak make wall like dragon’s tail rest o’ us don’t mean spit them”

 “except you” arya pointed “that man said he’d take head too”

 “well that” yoren said “if get shoulders he’s welcome it”





 jon

 “sam” jon called softly

 air smelled paper dust years tall wooden shelves rose dimness crammed leatherbound books bins ancient scrolls faint yellow glow filtered stacks hidden lamp jon blew taper carried preferring risk open flame amidst much old dry paper instead followed light wending way narrow aisles beneath barrelvaulted ceilings black shadow among shadows dark hair long face grey eye black moleskin gloves covered hands right burned left man felt half fool wearing one glove

 samwell tarly sat hunched table niche carved stone wall glow came lamp hung head looked sound jon’s steps

 “have night”

 “have i” sam looked startled

 “you didn’t break fast us bed hadn’t slept in” rast suggested maybe sam deserted jon never believed desertion required sort courage sam little enough

 “is morning there’s way know”

 “sam you’re sweet fool” jon said “you’ll miss bed we’re sleeping cold hard ground promise you”

 sam yawned “maester aemon sent find maps lord commander never thought… jon books ever seen like thousands”

 gazed “the library winterfell hundred find maps”

 “oh yes” sam’s hand swept table fingers plump sausages indicating clutter books scrolls “a dozen least” unfolded square parchment “the paint faded see mapmaker marked sites wildling villages there’s another book… reading moment ago” shoved scrolls aside reveal dusty volume bound rotted leather “this” said reverently “is account journey shadow tower way lorn point frozen shore written ranger named redwyn it’s dated mentions dorren stark king north must conquest jon fought giants redwyn even traded children forest it’s here” ever delicately turned pages finger “he drew maps well see…”

 “maybe could write account ranging sam”

 he’d meant sound encouraging wrong thing say last thing sam needed reminded faced morrow shuffled scrolls aimlessly “there’s maps time search… everything’s jumble could set order though know could would take time… well years truth”

 “mormont wanted maps little sooner that” jon plucked scroll bin blew worst dust corner flaked fingers unrolled “look one crumbling” said frowning faded script

 “be gentle” sam came around table took scroll hand holding wounded animal “the important books used copied needed oldest copied half hundred times probably”

 “well don’t bother copying one twentythree barrels pickled cod eighteen jars fish oil cask salt…”

 “an inventory” sam said “or perhaps bill sale”

 “who cares much pickled cod ate six hundred years ago” jon wondered

 “i would” sam carefully replaced scroll bin jon plucked “you learn much ledgers like truly tell many men night’s watch lived ate…”

 “they ate food” said jon “and lived live”

 “you’d surprised vault treasure jon”

 “if say so” jon doubtful treasure meant gold silver jewels dust spiders rotting leather

 “i do” fat boy blurted older jon man grown law hard think anything boy “i found drawings faces trees book tongue children forest… works even citadel doesn’t scrolls old valyria counts seasons written maesters dead thousand years…”

 “the books still return”

 “if return…”

 “the old bear taking two hundred seasoned men threequarters rangers qhorin halfhand bringing another hundred brothers shadow tower you’ll safe back lord father’s castle horn hill”

 samwell tarly managed sad little smile “i never safe father’s castle either”

 gods play cruel jests jon thought pyp toad lather part great ranging remain castle black samwell tarly selfproclaimed coward grossly fat timid near bad rider sword must face haunted forest old bear taking two cages ravens might send back word went maester aemon blind far frail ride steward must go place “we need ravens sam someone help keep grenn humble”

 sam’s chins quivered “you could care ravens grenn could anyone” said thin edge desperation voice “i could show know letters could write lord mormont’s messages well i”

 “i’m old bear’s steward i’ll need squire tend horse set tent won’t time watch birds well sam said words you’re brother night’s watch now”

 “a brother night’s watch shouldn’t scared”

 “we’re scared we’d fools weren’t” many rangers lost past two years even benjen stark jon’s uncle found two uncle’s men wood slain corpses risen chill night jon’s burnt fingers twitched remembered still saw wight dreams dead othor burning blue eyes cold black hands last thing sam needed reminded “there’s shame fear father told matters face come i’ll help gather maps”

 sam nodded unhappily shelves closely spaced walk single file left vault opened onto one tunnels brothers called wormwalks winding subterranean passages linked keeps towers castle black earth summer wormwalks seldom used save rats vermin winter different matter snows drifted forty fifty feet high ice winds came howling north tunnels held castle black together

 soon jon thought climbed he’d seen harbinger come maester aemon word summer’s end great raven citadel white silent ghost seen winter young everyone agreed short one mild one would different could feel bones

 steep stone steps sam puffing like blacksmith’s bellows time reached surface emerged brisk wind made jon’s cloak swirl snap ghost stretched asleep beneath wattleanddaub wall granary woke jon appeared bushy white tail held stiffly upright trotted

 sam squinted wall loomed icy cliff seven hundred feet high sometimes seemed jon almost living thing moods color ice wont change every shift light deep blue frozen rivers dirty white old snow cloud passed sun darkened pale grey pitted stone wall stretched east west far eye could see huge shrunk timbered keeps stone towers castle insignificance end world

 going beyond

 morning sky streaked thin grey clouds pale red line behind black brothers dubbed wanderer mormont’s torch saying half jest gods must sent light old man’s way haunted forest

 “the comet’s bright see day now” sam said shading eyes fistful books

 “a lord’s dungeon near gulltown” smith replied “a brigand barber beggar two orphans boy whore defend realms men”

 “they’ll do” jon gave sam private smile “we did”

 “aye man baratheon man smith armorer storm’s end lost arm i’m old enough remember lord steffon sea took knew three sons since got names tell this—robert never put crown men like swords made fighting hang go rust”

 “we will” jon promised

 lord commander mormont taken residence king’s tower fire gutted jon left ghost guards outside door “more stairs” said sam miserably started “i hate stairs”

 “well that’s one thing won’t face wood”

 thoren smallwood sinewy ranger weak chin weaker mouth hidden thin scraggle beard gave jon sam cool look one alliser thorne’s henchmen love either “the lord commander’s place castle black lording commanding” told mormont ignoring newcomers “it seems me”

 raven flapped big black wings “me me”

 “if ever lord commander may please” mormont told ranger “but seems died yet brothers put place”

 “i’m first ranger ben stark lost ser jaremy killed” smallwood said stubbornly “the command mine”

 mormont would none “i sent ben stark ser waymar mean send sit wondering long must wait give lost well” pointed “and stark remains first ranger know certainty dead day come names successor stop wasting time ride first light forgotten”

 smallwood pushed feet “as lord commands” way frowned jon somehow fault

 “first ranger” old bear’s eyes lighted sam “i’d sooner name first ranger effrontery tell face i’m old ride look old boy” hair retreated mormont’s spotted scalp regrouped beneath chin shaggy grey beard covered much chest thumped hard “do look frail”

 sam opened mouth gave little squeak old bear terrified “no lord” jon offered quickly “you look strong a… a…”

 “don’t cozen snow know won’t let look maps” mormont pawed brusquely giving glance grunt “was could find”

 “i… mmmy lord” sam stammered “there… bbbut… disdisorder…”

 “these old” mormont complained raven echoed sharp cry “old old”

 “the villages may come go hills rivers places” jon pointed

 “true enough chosen ravens yet tarly”

 “if happens we’re butchered mean successor know died”

 sam swallowed stepped back scurried quickly almost tripped rushes

 “is boy big fool seems” lord commander asked he’d gone “fool” raven complained mormont wait jon answer “his lord father stands high king renly’s councils half notion dispatch him… best renly like heed quaking fat boy i’ll send ser arnell he’s deal steadier mother one greenapple fossoways”

 “thorne wight’s hand show them” grisly pale thing black fingers twitched stirred jar still alive

 “would another hand send renly”

 “dywen says find anything beyond wall”

 “aye dywen says last time went ranging says saw bear fifteen feet tall” mormont snorted “my sister said taken bear lover i’d believe i’d believe one fifteen feet tall though world dead come walking… ah even man must believe eyes seen dead walk i’ve seen giant bears” gave jon long searching look “but speaking hands yours”

 “better” jon peeled moleskin glove showed scars covered arm halfway elbow mottled pink flesh still felt tight tender healing “it itches though maester aemon says that’s good gave salve take ride”

 “you wield longclaw despite pain”

 “well enough” jon flexed fingers opening closing fist way maester shown “i’m work fingers every day keep nimble maester aemon said”

 “blind may aemon knows he’s pray gods let us keep another twenty years know might king”

 jon taken surprise “he told father king not… thought perhaps younger son”

 “so father’s father daeron targaryen second name brought dorne realm part pact wed dornish princess gave four sons aemon’s father maekar youngest aemon third son mind happened long born ancient smallwood would make me”

 “maester aemon named dragonknight”

 “so say prince aemon king daeron’s true father aegon unworthy may aemon lacked dragonknight’s martial nature likes say slow sword quick wits small wonder grandfather packed citadel nine ten believe… ninth tenth line succession well”

 maester aemon counted hundred name days jon knew frail shrunken wizened blind hard imagine little boy older arya

 mormont continued “aemon books eldest uncles heir apparent slain tourney mishap left two sons followed grave long great spring sickness king daeron also taken crown passed daeron’s second son aerys”

 “the mad king” jon confused aerys king robert wasn’t long ago

 “no aerys first one robert deposed second name”

 “how long ago this”

 “eighty years close enough” old bear said “and still hadn’t born though aemon forged half dozen links maester’s chain aerys wed sister targaryens wont reigned ten twelve years aemon took vows left citadel serve lordling’s court… royal uncle died without issue iron throne passed last king daeron’s four sons maekar aemon’s father new king summoned sons court would made aemon part councils refused saying would usurp place rightly belonging grand maester instead served keep eldest brother another daeron well one died leaving feeblewitted daughter heir pox caught whore believe next brother aerion”

 “aerion monstrous” jon knew name “the prince thought dragon” one old nan’s gruesome tales little brother bran loved

 “the one though named aerion brightflame one night cups drank jar wildfire telling friends would transform dragon gods kind transformed corpse quite year king maekar died battle outlaw lord”

 jon entirely innocent history realm maester seen “that year great council” said “the lords passed prince aerion’s infant son prince daeron’s daughter gave crown aegon”

 “yes first offered quietly aemon quietly refused gods meant serve rule told sworn vow would break though high septon offered absolve well sane man wanted blood aerion’s throne daeron’s girl lackwit besides female choice turn aemon’s younger brother—aegon fifth name aegon unlikely called born fourth son fourth son aemon knew rightly remained court disliked brother’s rule would seek use came wall remained brother brother’s son son reigned died turn jaime lannister put end line dragonkings”

 “king” croaked raven bird flapped across solar land mormont’s shoulder “king” said strutting back forth

 “he likes word” jon said smiling

 “an easy word say easy word like”

 “king” bird said

 “i think means crown lord”

 “the realm three kings already that’s two many liking” mormont stroked raven beak finger eyes never left jon snow

 made feel odd “my lord told maester aemon”

 “must reason” mormont shifted seat frowning “your brother robb crowned king north aemon common king brother”

 “and too” said jon “a vow”

 old bear gave loud snort raven took flight flapping circle room “give man every vow i’ve seen broken wall never lack defenders”

 “i’ve always known robb would lord winterfell”

 mormont gave whistle bird flew settled arm “a lord’s one thing king’s another” offered raven handful corn pocket “they garb brother robb silks satins velvets hundred different colors live die black ringmail wed beautiful princess father sons you’ll wife ever hold child blood arms robb rule serve men call crow they’ll call grace singers praise every little thing greatest deeds go unsung tell none troubles jon… i’ll name liar know truth it”

 jon drew taut bowstring “and trouble might bastard am”

 “what do” mormont asked “bastard are”

 “be troubled” said jon “and keep vows”





 catelyn

 son’s crown fresh forge seemed catelyn stark weight pressed heavy robb’s head

 ancient crown kings winter lost three centuries ago yielded aegon conqueror torrhen stark knelt submission aegon done man could say lord hoster’s smith done work well robb’s crown looked much said looked tales told stark kings old open circlet hammered bronze incised runes first men surmounted nine black iron spikes wrought shape longswords gold silver gemstones none bronze iron metals winter dark strong fight cold

 waited riverrun’s great hall prisoner brought saw robb push back crown rested upon thick auburn mop hair moments later moved forward later gave quarter turn might make sit easily brow easy thing wear crown catelyn thought watching especially boy fifteen years

 guards brought captive robb called sword olyvar frey offered hilt first son drew blade laid bare across knees threat plain see “your grace man asked for” announced ser robin ryger captain tully household guard

 “kneel king lannister” theon greyjoy shouted ser robin forced prisoner knees

 look lion catelyn reflected ser cleos frey son lady genna sister lord tywin lannister none fabled lannister beauty fair hair green eyes instead inherited stringy brown locks weak chin thin face sire ser emmon frey old lord walder’s second son eyes pale watery could seem stop blinking perhaps light cells riverrun dark damp… days crowded well

 “rise ser cleos” son’s voice icy father’s would sound boy fifteen either war made man time morning light glimmered faintly edge steel across knees

 yet sword made ser cleos frey anxious beast grey wind son named direwolf large elkhound lean smokedark eyes like molten gold beast padded forward sniffed captive knight every man hall could smell scent fear ser cleos taken battle whispering wood grey wind ripped throats half dozen men

 knight scrambled edging away alacrity watchers laughed aloud “thank lord”

 “your grace” barked lord umber greatjon ever loudest robb’s northern bannermen… truest fiercest well insisted first proclaim son king north would brook slight honor newmade sovereign

 “your grace” ser cleos corrected hastily “pardons”

 bold man one catelyn thought frey lannister truth cousin kingslayer would much different matter would never gotten honorific ser jaime lannister’s perfect teeth

 “i brought cell carry message cousin cersei lannister king’s landing you’ll travel peace banner thirty best men escort you”

 ser cleos visibly relieved “then glad bring grace’s message queen”

 “understand” robb said “i giving freedom grandfather lord walder pledged support house frey many cousins uncles rode us whispering wood chose fight beneath lion banner makes lannister frey want pledge honor knight deliver message you’ll return queen’s reply resume captivity”

 ser cleos answered “i vow”

 “every man hall heard you” warned catelyn’s brother ser edmure tully spoke riverrun lords trident place dying father “if return whole realm know forsworn”

 “i pledged” ser cleos replied stiffly “what message “

 “an offer peace” robb stood longsword hand grey wind moved side hall grew hushed “tell queen regent meets terms sheath sword make end war us”

 back hall catelyn glimpsed tall gaunt figure lord rickard karstark shove rank guards door one else moved robb paid disruption mind “olyvar paper” commanded squire took longsword handed rolled parchment

 robb unrolled “first queen must release sisters provide transport sea king’s landing white harbor understood sansa’s betrothal joffrey baratheon end receive word castellan sisters returned unharmed winterfell release queen’s cousins squire willem lannister brother tion frey give safe escort casterly rock wheresoever desires delivered”

 catelyn stark wished could read thoughts hid behind face furrowed brow pair tightened lips

 “secondly lord father’s bones returned us may rest beside brother sister crypts beneath winterfell would wished remains men household guard died service king’s landing must also returned”

 living men gone south cold bones would return ned truth thought place winterfell said much would hear go told must robert’s hand good house sake children… mine other…

 “third father’s greatsword ice delivered hand riverrun”

 watched brother ser edmure tully stood thumbs hooked swordbelt face still stone

 “fourth queen command father lord tywin release knights lords bannermen mine took captive battle green fork trident shall release captives taken whispering wood battle camps save jaime lannister alone remain hostage father’s good behavior”

 studied theon greyjoy’s sly smile wondering meant young man way looking though knew secret jest privy catelyn never liked

 “lastly king joffrey queen regent must renounce claims dominion north henceforth part realm free independent kingdom old domain shall include stark lands north neck addition lands watered river trident vassal streams bounded golden tooth west mountains moon east”

 “the king north” boomed greatjon umber hamsized fist hammering air shouted “stark stark king north”

 robb rolled parchment “maester vyman drawn map showing borders claim shall copy queen lord tywin must withdraw beyond borders cease raiding burning pillage queen regent son shall make claims taxes incomes service people shall free lords knights oaths fealty vows pledges debts obligations owed iron throne houses baratheon lannister additionally lannisters shall deliver ten highborn hostages mutually agreed upon pledge peace treat honored guests according station long terms pact abided faithfully shall release two hostages every year return safely families” robb tossed rolled parchment knight’s feet “there terms meets i’ll give peace not”—he whistled grey wind moved forward snarling—“i’ll give another whispering wood”

 “stark” greatjon roared voices took cry “stark stark king north” direwolf threw back head howled

 ser cleos gone color curdled milk “the queen shall hear message my—your grace”

 “good” robb said “ser robin see good meal clean clothing he’s ride first light”

 “as command grace” ser robin ryger replied

 “then done” assembled knights lords bannermen bent knees robb turned leave grey wind heels olyvar frey scrambled ahead open door catelyn followed brother side

 “you well” told son gallery led rear hall “though business wolf japery befitting boy king”

 robb scratched grey wind behind ear “did see look face mother” asked smiling

 “what saw lord karstark walking out”

 “as i” robb lifted crown hands gave olyvar “take thing back bedchamber”

 “at grace” squire hurried

 “i’ll wager others felt lord karstark” brother edmure declared “how talk peace lannisters spread like pestilence father’s domains stealing crops slaughtering people say ought marching harrenhal”

 “we lack strength” robb said though unhappily

 edmure persisted “do grow stronger sitting host dwindles every day”

 “and whose that” catelyn snapped brother edmure’s insistence robb given river lords leave depart crowning defend lands ser marq piper lord karyl vance first go lord jonos bracken followed vowing reclaim burnt shell castle bury dead lord jason mallister announced intent return seat seagard still mercifully untouched fighting

 “you cannot ask river lords remain idle fields pillaged people put sword” ser edmure said “but lord karstark northman would ill thing leave us”

 “i’ll speak him” said robb “he lost two sons whispering wood blame want make peace killers… father’s killers…”

 “more bloodshed bring father back us lord rickard’s sons” catelyn said “an offer made—though wiser man might offered sweeter terms”

 “any sweeter would gagged” son’s beard grown redder auburn hair robb seemed think made look fierce royal… older bearded still youth fifteen wanted vengeance less rickard karstark easy thing convince make even offer poor

 “cersei lannister never consent trade sisters pair cousins it’s brother she’ll want know full well” told much catelyn finding kings listen half attentively sons

 “i can’t release kingslayer even wanted lords would never abide it”

 “your lords made king”

 “and unmake easy”

 “if crown price must pay arya sansa returned safe pay willingly half lords would like murder lannister cell die he’s prisoner men say—”

 “—that well deserved it” robb finished

 “and sisters” catelyn asked sharply “will deserve deaths well promise harm comes brother cersei pay us back blood blood—”

 “lannister won’t die” robb said “no one much speaks without warrant food water clean straw comfort right won’t free even arya sansa”

 son looking catelyn realized war made grow fast wondered crown put head “are afraid jaime lannister field truth it”

 grey wind growled sensed robb’s anger edmure tully put brotherly hand catelyn’s shoulder “cat don’t boy right this”

 “don’t call boy” robb said rounding uncle anger spilling poor edmure meant support “i’m almost man grown king—your king ser don’t fear jaime lannister defeated i’ll defeat must only…” pushed fall hair eyes gave shake head “i might able trade kingslayer father but…”

 “…but girls” voice icy quiet “girls important enough they”

 robb made answer hurt eyes blue eyes tully eyes eyes given wounded much father’s son admit

 unworthy told gods good become best trying hard know see yet… lost ned rock life built could bear lose girls well…

 “i’ll sisters” robb said “if queen sense she’ll accept terms i’ll make rue day refused me”

 plainly he’d enough subject “mother certain consent go twins would farther fighting could acquaint lord frey’s daughters help choose bride war done”

 wants gone catelyn thought wearily kings supposed mothers would seem tell things want hear “you’re old enough decide lord walder’s girls prefer without mother’s help robb”

 “then go theon leaves morrow he’ll help mallisters escort lot captives seagard take ship iron islands could find ship well back winterfell moon’s turn winds kind bran rickon need you”

 mean say “my lord father little enough time remaining long grandfather lives place riverrun him”

 “i could command go king could”

 catelyn ignored “i’ll say would sooner sent someone else pyke kept theon close you”

 “who better treat balon greyjoy son”

 “jason mallister” offered catelyn “tytos blackwood stevron frey anyone… theon”

 son squatted beside grey wind ruffling wolf’s fur incidentally avoiding eyes “theon’s fought bravely us told saved bran wildlings wolfswood lannisters won’t make peace i’ll need lord greyjoy’s longships”

 “you’ll sooner keep son hostage”

 “he’s hostage half life”

 “for good reason” catelyn said “balon greyjoy man trusted wore crown remember season may aspire wear one again”

 robb stood “i grudge i’m king north let king iron islands that’s desire i’ll give crown gladly long helps us bring lannisters”

 “robb—”

 “i’m sending theon good day mother grey wind come” robb walked briskly direwolf padding beside

 catelyn could watch go son king queer felt command told back moat cailin “i going visit father” announced abruptly “come edmure”

 “i need word new bowmen ser desmond training i’ll visit later”

 still lives catelyn thought said nothing brother would sooner face battle sickroom

 shortest way central keep father lay dying godswood grass wildflowers thick stands elm redwood wealth rustling leaves still clung branches trees ignorant word white raven brought riverrun fortnight past autumn come conclave declared gods seen fit tell winds woods yet catelyn duly grateful autumn always fearful time specter winter looming ahead even wisest man never knew whether next harvest would last

 hoster tully lord riverrun lay abed solar commanding view east rivers tumblestone red fork met beyond walls castle sleeping catelyn entered hair beard white featherbed portly frame turned small frail death grew within

 beside bed still dressed mail hauberk travelstained cloak sat father’s brother blackfish boots dusty spattered dried mud “does robb know returned uncle” ser brynden tully robb’s eyes ears commander scouts outriders

 “no came straight stables told king holding court grace want hear tidings private first i’d think” blackfish tall lean man grey hair precise movements cleanshaven face lined windburnt “how he” asked knew mean robb

 “much maester gives dreamwine milk poppy pain sleeps time eats little seems weaker day passes”

 “does speak”

 “yes… less less sense things says talks regrets unfinished tasks people long dead times long past sometimes know season called mother’s name”

 “he misses still” ser brynden answered “you face see cheekbones jaw…”

 “you remember long time” seated bed brushed away strand fine white hair fallen across father’s face

 “each time ride wonder shall find alive dead return” despite quarrels deep bond father brother disowned

 “at least made peace him”

 sat time silence catelyn raised head “you spoke tidings robb needed hear” lord hoster moaned rolled onto side almost heard

 brynden stood “come outside best wake him”

 followed onto stone balcony jutted threesided solar like prow ship uncle glanced frowning “you see day men call red messenger… message”

 catelyn raised eyes faint red line comet traced path across deep blue sky like long scratch across face god “the greatjon told robb old gods unfurled red flag vengeance ned edmure thinks it’s omen victory riverrun—he sees fish long tail tully colors red blue” sighed “i wish faith crimson lannister color”

 “that thing’s crimson” ser brynden said “nor tully red mud red river that’s blood child smeared across sky”

 “our blood theirs”

 “was ever war one side bled” uncle gave shake head “the riverlands awash blood flame around gods eye fighting spread south blackwater north across trident almost twins marq piper karyl vance small victories southron lordling beric dondarrion raiding raiders falling upon lord tywin’s foraging parties vanishing back woods it’s said ser burton crakehall boasting he’d slain dondarrion led column one lord beric’s traps got every man killed”

 “some ned’s guard king’s landing lord beric” catelyn recalled “may gods preserve them”

 “dondarrion red priest rides clever enough preserve tales true” uncle said “but father’s bannermen make sadder tale robb never let go they’ve scattered like quail man trying protect it’s folly cat folly jonos bracken wounded fighting amidst ruins castle nephew hendry slain tytos blackwood’s swept lannisters lands took every cow pig speck grain left nothing defend raventree hall scorched desert darry men recaptured lord’s keep held less fortnight gregor clegane descended put whole garrison sword even lord”

 catelyn horrorstruck “darry child”

 “aye last line well boy would brought fine ransom gold mean frothing dog like gregor clegane beast’s head would make noble gift people realm vow”

 catelyn knew ser gregor’s evil reputation yet still…“don’t speak heads uncle cersei mounted ned’s spike walls red keep left crows flies” even hard believe truly gone nights would wake darkness halfasleep instant expect find beside “clegane lord tywin’s catspaw” tywin lannister—lord casterly rock warden west father queen cersei ser jaime kingslayer tyrion imp grandfather joffrey baratheon newcrowned boy king—was true danger catelyn believed

 “true enough” ser brynden admitted “and tywin lannister man’s fool sits safe behind walls harrenhal feeding host harvest burning take gregor dog he’s loosed ser amory lorch field well sellsword qohor who’d sooner maim man kill i’ve seen leave behind whole villages put torch women raped mutilated butchered children left unburied draw wolves wild dogs… would sicken even dead”

 “when edmure hears rage”

 “and lord tywin desires even terror purpose cat lannister wants provoke us battle”

 “robb like give wish” catelyn said fretful “he restless cat sitting edmure greatjon others urge on” son two great victories smashing jaime lannister whispering wood routing leaderless host outside walls riverrun battle camps way bannermen spoke might aegon conqueror reborn

 brynden blackfish arched bushy grey eyebrow “more fool first rule war cat—never give enemy wish lord tywin would like fight field choosing wants us march harrenhal”

 “harrenhal” every child trident knew tales told harrenhal vast fortress king harren black raised beside waters gods eye three hundred years past seven kingdoms seven kingdoms riverlands ruled ironmen islands pride harren desired highest hall tallest towers westeros forty years taken rising like great shadow shore lake harren’s armies plundered neighbors stone lumber gold workers thousands captives died quarries chained sledges laboring five colossal towers men froze winter sweltered summer weirwoods stood three thousand years cut beams rafters harren beggared riverlands iron islands alike ornament dream last harrenhal stood complete day king harren took residence aegon conqueror come ashore king’s landing

 catelyn could remember hearing old nan tell story children back winterfell “and king harren learned thick walls high towers small use dragons” tale always ended “for dragons fly” harren line perished fires engulfed monstrous fortress every house held harrenhal since come misfortune strong might dark place cursed

 “i would robb fight battle shadow keep” catelyn admitted “yet must something uncle”

 “and soon” uncle agreed “i told worst child men sent west brought back word new host gathering casterly rock”

 another lannister army thought made ill “robb must told command”

 “ser stafford lannister it’s said” turned gaze rivers redandblue cloak stirring breeze

 “another nephew” lannisters casterly rock damnably large fertile house

 “cousin” ser brynden corrected “brother lord tywin’s late wife twice related old man bit dullard son ser daven formidable”

 “then let us hope father son takes army field”

 “we time yet must face lot sellswords freeriders green boys stews lannisport ser stafford must see armed drilled dare risk battle… make mistake lord tywin kingslayer rush heedless wait patiently ser stafford march stirs behind walls harrenhal”

 “unless…” said catelyn

 “yes” ser brynden prompted

 “unless must leave harrenhal” said “to face threat”

 uncle looked thoughtfully “lord renly”

 “king renly” would ask help man would need grant style claimed

 “perhaps” blackfish smiled dangerous smile “he’ll want something though”

 “he’ll want kings always want” said “homage”





 tyrion

 janos slynt butcher’s son laughed like man chopping meat “more wine” tyrion asked

 “i object” lord janos said holding cup built like keg similar capacity “i object that’s fine red arbor”

 “dornish” tyrion gestured serving man poured servants lord janos alone small hall small candlelit table surrounded darkness “quite find dornish wines often rich”

 “rich” said big frogfaced man taking healthy gulp man sipping janos slynt tyrion made note “yes rich that’s word searching word gift words lord tyrion might say tell droll tale droll yes”

 “i’m pleased think so… i’m lord simple tyrion suffice lord janos”

 “as wish” took another swallow dribbling wine front black satin doublet wearing clothofgold half cape fastened miniature spear point enameled dark red well truly drunk

 tyrion covered mouth belched politely unlike lord janos gone easy wine full first thing done taking residence tower hand inquire finest cook city take service evening supped oxtail soup summer greens tossed pecans grapes red fennel crumbled cheese hot crab pie spiced squash quails drowned butter dish come wine lord janos allowed never eaten half well “no doubt change take seat harrenhal” tyrion said

 “for certainty perhaps ask cook enter service say”

 “wars fought less” said good long laugh “you’re bold man take harrenhal seat grim place huge… costly maintain say cursed well”

 “should fear pile stone” hooted notion “a bold man said must bold rise harrenhal yes know bold man sense small mayhap bold”

 “you kind wine”

 “no truly i… oh gods damned yes bold man drinks fill”

 “truly” tyrion filled lord slynt’s cup brim “i glancing names put forward take place commander city watch”

 “good men fine men six i’d choose allar deem right arm good good man loyal pick won’t sorry pleases king”

 “to sure” tyrion took small sip wine “i considering ser jacelyn bywater he’s captain mud gate three years served valor balon greyjoy’s rebellion king robert knighted pyke yet name appear list”

 lord janos slynt took gulp wine sloshed around mouth moment swallowing “bywater well brave man sure yet… he’s rigid one queer dog men don’t like cripple lost hand pyke that’s got knighted poor trade ask hand ser” laughed “ser jacelyn thinks overmuch honor see you’ll better leaving one lor—tyrion allar deem’s man you”

 “deem little loved streets told”

 “he’s feared that’s better”

 “what heard trouble brothel”

 “that fault lor—tyrion never meant kill woman warned stand aside let duty”

 “still… mothers children might expected she’d try save babe” tyrion smiled “have cheese goes splendidly wine tell choose deem unhappy task”

 “a good commander knows men tyrion good one job another babe still tit takes certain sort every man’d even whore whelp”

 “i suppose that’s so” said tyrion hearing whore thinking shae tysha long ago women taken coin seed years

 slynt went oblivious “a hard man hard job deem he’s told never word afterward” cut slice cheese “this fine sharp give good sharp knife good sharp cheese i’m happy man”

 tyrion shrugged “enjoy riverlands flame renly king highgarden good cheese soon hard come sent whore’s bastard”

 lord janos gave tyrion wary look laughed wagged wedge cheese “you’re sly one tyrion thought could trick takes wine cheese make janos slynt tell pride never question never word afterward me”

 “as deem”

 “just make commander i’m harrenhal won’t regret it”

 tyrion broke nibble cheese sharp indeed veined wine choice “whoever king names easy time stepping armor tell lord mormont faces problem”

 lord janos looked puzzled “i thought lady mormont beds bears that’s one”

 “it brother speaking jeor mormont lord commander night’s watch visiting wall mentioned concerned finding good man take place watch gets good men days” tyrion grinned “he’d sleep easier man like imagine valiant allar deem”

 lord janos roared “small chance that”

 “one would think” tyrion said “but life take queer turns consider eddard stark lord don’t suppose ever imagined life would end steps baelor’s sept”

 “there damn did” lord janos allowed chuckling

 tyrion chuckled “a pity wasn’t see say even varys surprised”

 lord janos laughed hard gut shook “the spider” said “knows everything say well didn’t know that”

 “how could he” tyrion put first hint chill tone “he helped persuade sister stark pardoned condition take black”

 “eh” janos slynt blinked vaguely tyrion

 “my sister cersei” tyrion repeated shade strongly case fool doubt meant “the queen regent”

 “yes” slynt took swallow “as well… king commanded m’lord king himself”

 “the king thirteen” tyrion reminded

 “still king” slynt’s jowls quivered frowned “the lord seven kingdoms”

 “well one two least” tyrion said sour smile “might look spear”

 “my spear” lord janos blinked confusion

 tyrion pointed “the clasp fastens cape”

 hesitantly lord janos drew ornament handed tyrion

 “we goldsmiths lannisport better work” opined “the red enamel blood shade much don’t mind saying tell lord drive spear man’s back give command”

 “i gave command i’d give lord stark traitor” bald spot middle slynt’s head beetred clothofgold cape slithered shoulders onto floor “the man tried buy me”

 “little dreaming already sold”

 slynt slammed wine cup “are drunk think sit honor questioned…”

 “what honor admit made better bargain ser jacelyn lordship castle spear thrust back didn’t even need thrust spear” tossed golden ornament back janos slynt bounced chest clattered floor man rose

 “i mislike tone voice lo—imp lord harrenhal member king’s council chastise like this”

 tyrion cocked head sideways “i think know quite well many sons have”

 “what sons dwarf”

 “dwarf” anger flashed “you stopped imp tyrion house lannister someday sense gods gave sea slug drop knees thanks deal lord father many sons have”

 tyrion could see sudden fear janos slynt’s eyes “th—three m’lord daughter please m’lord—”

 janos slynt’s face gone red white “whwhat… you…” jowls quivering like mounds suet

 “what mean you” tyrion let oaf tremble moment answered “the carrack summer’s dream sails morning tide master tells call gulltown three sisters isle skagos eastwatchbythesea see lord commander mormont give fond regards tell forgotten needs night’s watch wish long life good service lord”

 janos slynt realized summarily executed color returned face thrust jaw “we see imp dwarf perhaps ship think perhaps wall” gave bark anxious laughter “you threats well see king’s friend know shall hear joffrey say littlefinger queen oh yes janos slynt good many friends see goes sailing promise indeed will”

 slynt spun heel like watchman he’d strode length small hall boots ringing stone clattered steps threw open door… came facetoface tall lanternjawed man black breastplate gold cloak strapped stump right wrist iron hand “janos” said deepset eyes glinting prominent brow ridge shock saltandpepper hair six gold cloaks moved quietly small hall behind janos slynt backed away

 “lord slynt” tyrion called “i believe know ser jacelyn bywater new commander city watch”

 “we litter waiting lord” ser jacelyn told slynt “the docks dark distant streets safe night men”

 gold cloaks ushered onetime commander tyrion called ser jacelyn side handed roll parchment “it’s long voyage lord slynt want company see six join summer’s dream”

 bywater glanced names smiled “as will”

 “there’s one” tyrion said quietly “deem tell captain would taken amiss one happen swept overboard reach eastwatch”

 “i’m told northern waters stormy lord” ser jacelyn bowed took leave cloak rippling behind trod slynt’s clothofgold cape way

 tyrion sat alone sipping remained fine sweet dornish wine servants came went clearing dishes table told leave wine done varys came gliding hall wearing flowing lavender robes matched smell “oh sweetly done good lord”

 “then bitter taste mouth” pressed fingers temples “i told throw allar deem sea sorely tempted you”

 “you might disappointed result” varys replied “the storms come go waves crash overhead big fish eat little fish keep paddling might trouble taste wine lord slynt enjoyed much”

 tyrion waved flagon frowning

 varys filled cup “ah sweet summer” took another sip “i hear grapes singing tongue”

 “i wondered noise tell grapes keep still head split sister ohsoloyal lord janos refused say cersei sent gold cloaks brothel”

 varys tittered nervously known along

 “you left part out” tyrion said accusingly

 “your sweet sister” varys said griefstricken looked close tears “it hard thing tell man lord fearful might take forgive me”

 “no” tyrion snapped “damn damn her” could touch cersei knew yet even he’d wanted far certain yet rankled sit make mummer’s show justice punishing sorry likes janos slynt allar deem sister continued savage course “in future tell know lord varys know”

 eunuch’s smile sly “that might take rather long time good lord know quite lot”

 “not enough save child would seem”

 “alas another bastard boy older took steps see removed harm’s way… confess never dreamed babe would risk baseborn girl less year old whore mother threat could pose”

 “she robert’s” tyrion said bitterly “that enough cersei would seem”

 “yes grievous sad must blame poor sweet babe mother young loved king”

 “did she” tyrion never seen dead girl’s face mind shae tysha “can whore truly love anyone wonder don’t answer things would rather know” settled shae sprawling stoneandtimber manse well stable garden given servants see wants white bird summer isles keep company silks silver gemstones adorn guards protect yet seemed restive wanted told wanted serve help “you help sheets” told one night loving lay beside head pillowed breast groin aching sweet soreness made reply save eyes could see she’d wanted hear

 sighing tyrion started reach wine remembered lord janos pushed flagon away “it seem sister telling truth stark’s death nephew thank madness”

 “king joffrey gave command janos slynt ser ilyn payne carried swiftly without hesitation…”

 “…almost expected yes ground without profit folly”

 “with city watch hand lord well placed see grace commits further… follies sure still queen’s household guard consider…”

 “the red cloaks” tyrion shrugged “vylarr’s loyalty casterly rock knows father’s authority cersei would find hard use men me… besides hundred half many men six thousand gold cloaks bywater man claim”

 “you find ser jacelyn courageous honorable obedient… grateful”

 “to wonder” tyrion trust varys though denying value knew things beyond doubt “why helpful lord varys” asked studying man’s soft hands bald powdered face slimy little smile

 “you hand serve realm king you”

 “as served jon arryn eddard stark”

 “i served lord arryn lord stark best could saddened horrified untimely deaths”

 “think feel i’m like next”

 “oh think not” varys said swirling wine cup “power curious thing lord perchance considered riddle posed day inn”

 “it crossed mind time two” tyrion admitted “the king priest rich man—who lives dies swordsman obey it’s riddle without answer rather many answers depends man sword”

 “and yet one” varys said “he neither crown gold favor gods piece pointed steel”

 “that piece steel power life death”

 “just so… yet swordsmen rule us truth pretend kings hold power strong man sword ever obey child king like joffrey winesodden oaf like father “

 “because child kings drunken oafs call strong men swords”

 “then swordsmen true power whence came swords obey” varys smiled “some say knowledge power tell us power comes gods others say derives law yet day steps baelor’s sept godly high septon lawful queen regent eversoknowledgeable servant powerless cobbler cooper crowd truly killed eddard stark think joffrey gave command ser ilyn payne swung sword or… another “

 tyrion cocked head sideways “did mean answer damned riddle make head ache worse”

 varys smiled “here power resides men believe resides less”

 “so power mummer’s trick”

 “a shadow wall” varys murmured “yet shadows kill ofttimes small man cast large shadow”

 tyrion smiled “lord varys growing strangely fond may kill yet think i’d feel sad it”

 “i take high praise”

 “what varys” tyrion found truly wanted know “a spider say”

 “spies informers seldom loved lord loyal servant realm”

 “and eunuch let us forget that”

 “i seldom do”

 “people called halfman yet think gods kinder small legs twisted women look upon great yearning… yet i’m still man shae first grace bed one day may take wife sire son gods good he’ll look like uncle think like father hope sustain dwarfs jape gods… men make eunuchs cut varys truly”

 eunuch’s smile never flickered eyes glittered something laughter “you kind ask lord tale long sad treasons discuss” drew parchment sleeve robe “the master king’s galley white hart plots slip anchor three days hence offer sword ship lord stannis”

 tyrion sighed “i suppose must make sort bloody lesson man”

 “ser jacelyn could arrange vanish trial king would help assure continued loyalty captains”

 keep royal nephew occupied well “as say put dose joffrey’s justice”

 varys made mark parchment “ser horas ser hobber redwyne bribed guard let postern gate night next arrangements made sail pentoshi galley moonrunner disguised oarsmen”

 “can keep oars years see fancy it” smiled “no sister would distraught lose treasured guests inform ser jacelyn seize man bribed explain honor serve brother night’s watch men posted around moonrunner case redwynes find second guard short coin”

 “as will” another mark parchment “your man timett slew wineseller’s son evening gambling den street silver accused cheating tiles”

 “was true”

 “oh beyond doubt”

 “then honest men city owe timett debt gratitude shall see king’s thanks”

 eunuch gave nervous giggle made another mark “we also sudden plague holy men comet brought forth manner queer priests preachers prophets would seem beg winesinks potshops foretell doom destruction anyone stops listen”

 tyrion shrugged “we close three hundredth year since aegon’s landing suppose expected let rant”

 “they spreading fear lord”

 “i thought job”

 varys covered mouth hand “you cruel say one last matter lady tanda gave small supper last night menu guest list inspection wine poured lord gyles rose lift cup king ser balon swann heard remark ‘we’ll need three cups that’ many laughed…”

 tyrion raised hand “enough ser balon made jest interested treasonous table talk lord varys”

 “you wise gentle lord” parchment vanished eunuch’s sleeve “we much shall leave you”

 eunuch departed tyrion sat long time watching candle wondering sister would take news janos slynt’s dismissal happily judge beyond sending angry protest lord tywin harrenhal see cersei could hope tyrion city watch plus hundredandahalf fierce clansmen growing force sellswords recruited bronn would seem well protected

 doubtless eddard stark thought

 red keep dark still tyrion left small hall bronn waiting solar “slynt” asked

 “lord janos sailing wall morning tide varys would believe replaced one joffrey’s men one likely replaced littlefinger’s man one belonging varys it”

 “you’d best know timett killed man—”

 “varys told me”

 sellsword seemed unsurprised “the fool figured oneeyed man would easier cheat timett pinned wrist table dagger ripped throat barehanded trick stiffens fingers—”

 “spare grisly details supper sitting badly belly” tyrion said “how goes recruiting”

 “well enough three new men tonight”

 “how know ones hire”

 “i look question learn they’ve fought well lie” bronn smiled “and give chance kill them”

 “have killed any”

 “no one could used”

 “and one kills you”

 “he’ll one you’ll want hire”

 tyrion little drunk tired “tell bronn told kill babe… infant girl say still mother’s breast… would without question”

 “without question no” sellsword rubbed thumb forefinger together “i’d ask much”

 arya

 road little two ruts weeds

 good part little traffic there’d one point finger say way they’d gone human flood flowed kingsroad trickle

 bad part road wound back forth like snake tangling even smaller trails sometimes seeming vanish entirely reappear half league farther given hope arya hated land gentle enough rolling hills terraced fields interspersed meadows woodlands little valleys willows crowded close slow shallow streams even path narrow crooked pace dropped crawl

 wagons slowed lumbering along axles creaking weight heavy loads dozen times day stop free wheel stuck rut double teams climb muddy slope middle dense stand oak came facetoface three men pulling load firewood ox cart way either get around nothing wait foresters unhitched ox led trees spun cart hitched ox started back way they’d come ox even slower wagons day hardly got anywhere

 arya could help looking shoulder wondering gold cloaks would catch night woke every noise grab needle’s hilt never made camp without putting sentries arya trust especially orphan boys might done well enough alleys king’s landing lost quiet shadow could sneak past flitting starlight make water woods one would see lommy greenhands watch shimmied oak moved tree tree right head never saw thing would jumped top knew scream would wake whole camp yoren might take stick

 lommy orphans treated bull like someone special queen wanted head though would none “i never nothing queen” said angrily “i work bellows tongs fetch carry s’posed armorer one day master mott says got join night’s watch that’s know” he’d go polish helm beautiful helm rounded curved slit visor two great metal bull’s horns arya would watch polish metal oilcloth shining bright could see flames cookfire reflected steel yet never actually put head

 “i bet he’s traitor’s bastard” lommy said one night hushed voice gendry would hear “the wolf lord one nicked baelor’s steps”

 “he not” arya declared father one bastard that’s jon stalked trees wishing could saddle horse ride home good horse chestnut mare white blaze forehead arya always good rider could gallop never see unless wanted she’d one scout ahead watch behind stand guard napped gold cloaks caught she’d alone safer stay yoren others

 roasted sweetcorn husk night turning ears long forked sticks ate hot right cob arya thought tasted wonderful yoren angry eat cloud seemed hang ragged black cloak paced camp restlessly muttering

 next day koss came racing back warn yoren camp ahead “twenty thirty men mail halfhelms” said “some cut bad one’s dying sound noise making got right close got spears shields one horse that’s lame think awhile stink place”

 arya saw men guarding fields turned north often stood silently beside road giving cold eye anyone passed elsewhere patrolled horses riding fence lines axes strapped saddles one place spotted man perched dead tree bow hand quiver hanging branch beside moment spied notched arrow bowstring never looked away last wagon sight yoren cursed “him tree let’s see well likes others come take he’ll scream watch will”

 day later dobber spied red glow evening sky “either road went turned sun’s setting north”

 yoren climbed rise get better look “fire” announced licked thumb held “wind blow away us still bears watching”

 watch world darkened fire seemed grow brighter brighter looked though whole north ablaze time time could even smell smoke though wind held steady flames never got closer dawn fire burned none slept well night

 midday arrived place village fields charred desolation miles around houses blackened shells carcasses burnt butchered animals dotted ground living blankets carrion crows rose cawing furiously disturbed smoke still drifted inside holdfast timber palisade looked strong afar proved strong enough

 riding front wagons horse arya saw burnt bodies impaled sharpened stakes atop walls hands drawn tight front faces fight flames consumed yoren called halt still distance told arya boys guard wagons murch cutjack went foot flock ravens rose inside walls climbed broken gate caged ravens wagons called quorks raucous shrieks

 “should go them” arya asked gendry yoren others gone long time

 “yoren said wait” gendry’s voice sounded hollow arya turned look saw wearing helm shiny steel great curving horns

 yoren fix woman place back wagon “and quick it” said “come dark there’ll wolves worse”

 “i’m scared” hot pie murmured saw onearmed woman thrashing wagon

 “me too” arya confessed

 arya waved vaguely woods

 “no you’re not” hot pie said gotten bolder sword belt even though shortsword handled like cleaver “the old man said everyone stay close tonight”

 “i need make water” arya explained

 “well use tree right there” pointed “you don’t know what’s arry heard wolves before”

 yoren wouldn’t like fought tried look afraid “wolves true”

 “nymeria direwolf” arya hugged “that’s different anyhow she’s gone jory threw rocks ran else queen would killed her” made sad talk “i bet she’d city wouldn’t let cut father’s head”

 “orphan boys got fathers” yoren said “or forget that” sourleaf turned spit red looked like mouth bleeding “the wolves got fear ones wear manskin like done village”

 “i wish home” said miserably tried hard brave fierce wolverine sometimes felt like little girl

 black brother peeled fresh sourleaf bale wagon stuffed mouth “might left found boy safer city seems me”

 davos

 morning air dark smoke burning gods

 afire maid mother warrior smith crone pearl eyes father gilded beard even stranger carved look animal human old dry wood countless layers paint varnish blazed fierce hungry light heat rose shimmering chill air behind gargoyles stone dragons castle walls seemed blurred davos seeing veil tears beasts trembling stirring…

 “an ill thing” allard declared though least sense keep voice low dale muttered agreement

 “silence” said davos “remember are” sons good men young allard especially rash stayed smuggler allard would ended wall stannis spared end something else owe him…

 hundreds come castle gates bear witness burning seven smell air ugly even soldiers hard feel uneasy affront gods worshiped lives

 red woman walked round fire three times praying speech asshai high valyrian common tongue davos understood last “r’hllor come us darkness” called “lord light offer false gods seven one enemy take cast light upon us night dark full terrors” queen selyse echoed words beside stannis watched impassively jaw hard stone blueblack shadow tightcropped beard dressed richly wont sept

 ragged wave shouts gave answer stannis’s glove began smolder cursing king thrust point sword damp earth beat flames leg

 “lord cast light upon us” melisandre called

 dragons men eat cooked meat said

 handmaids char horsemeat black dragons ripped eagerly heads striking like snakes long meat seared gulped several times weight every day last began grow larger stronger dany marveled smoothness scales heat poured palpable cold nights whole bodies seemed steam

 evenfall khalasar set would choose dragon ride upon shoulder irri jhiqui carried others cage woven wood slung mounts rode close behind dany never sight way keep quiescent

 “aegon’s dragons named gods old valyria” told bloodriders one morning long night’s journey “visenya’s dragon vhagar rhaenys meraxes aegon rode balerion black dread said vhagar’s breath hot could melt knight’s armor cook man inside meraxes swallowed horses whole balerion… fire black scales wings vast whole towns swallowed shadow passed overhead”

 dothraki looked hatchlings uneasily largest three shiny black scales slashed streaks vivid scarlet match wings horns “khaleesi” aggo murmured “there sits balerion come again”

 “it may say blood blood” dany replied gravely “but shall new name new life would name gods taken green one shall rhaegal valiant brother died green banks trident creamandgold call viserion viserys cruel weak frightened yet brother still dragon could not”

 “and black beast” asked ser jorah mormont

 “the black” said “is drogon”

 yet even dragons prospered khalasar withered died around land turned ever desolate even devilgrass grew scant horses dropped tracks leaving people must trudge along foot doreah took fever grew worse every league crossed lips hands broke blood blisters hair came clumps one evenfall lacked strength mount horse jhogo said must leave bind saddle dany remembered night dothraki sea lysene girl taught secrets drogo might love gave doreah water skin cooled brow damp cloth held hand died shivering would permit khalasar press

 “it end” answered wearily “i seen maps traders draw queen caravans come way yet great kingdoms east cities full wonders yi ti qarth asshai shadow…”

 “will live see them”

 “i lie way harder dared think” knight’s face grey exhausted wound taken hip night fought khal drogo’s bloodriders never fully healed could see grimaced mounted horse seemed slump saddle rode “perhaps doomed press on… know certainty doomed turn back”

 dany kissed lightly cheek heartened see smile must strong well thought grimly knight may blood dragon

 next day dawn broke crossing cracked fissured plain hard red earth dany command make camp outriders came racing back gallop “a city khaleesi” cried “a city pale moon lovely maid hour’s ride more”

 “show me” said

 city appeared walls towers shimmering white behind veil heat looked beautiful dany certain must mirage “do know place might ser jorah”

 exile knight gave weary shake head “no queen never traveled far east”

 distant white walls promised rest safety chance heal grow strong dany wanted nothing much rush toward instead turned bloodriders “blood blood go ahead us learn name city manner welcome expect”

 “ai khaleesi” said aggo

 jhiqui shuddered “when gods gone evil ghosts feast night places best shunned known”

 “it known” irri agreed

 “not me” dany put heels horse showed way trotting beneath shattered arch ancient gate silent street ser jorah bloodriders followed slowly rest dothraki

 long city deserted could know white walls beautiful afar cracked crumbling seen close inside maze narrow crooked alleys buildings pressed close facades blank chalky windowless everything white people lived known nothing color rode past heaps sunwashed rubble houses fallen elsewhere saw faded scars fire place six alleys came together dany passed empty marble plinth dothraki visited place would seem perhaps even missing statue stood among stolen gods vaes dothrak might ridden past hundred times never knowing shoulder viserion hissed

 jon

 whitetree village named sam’s old maps jon think much village four tumbledown oneroom houses unmortared stone surrounded empty sheepfold well houses roofed sod windows shuttered ragged pieces hide loomed pale limbs dark red leaves monstrous great weirwood

 biggest tree jon snow ever seen trunk near eight feet wide branches spreading far entire village shaded beneath canopy size disturb much face… mouth especially simple carved slash jagged hollow large enough swallow sheep

 sheep bones though sheep’s skull ashes

 “an old tree” mormont sat horse frowning “old” raven agreed shoulder “old old old”

 “and powerful” jon could feel power

 thoren smallwood dismounted beside trunk dark plate mail “look face small wonder men feared first came westeros i’d like take axe bloody thing myself”

 jon said “my lord father believed man could tell lie front heart tree old gods know men lying”

 “my father believed same” said old bear “let look skull”

 jon dismounted slung across back black leather shoulder sheath longclaw handandahalf bastard blade old bear given saving life bastard sword bastard men joked hilt fashioned new adorned wolf’shead pommel pale stone blade valyrian steel old light deadly sharp

 knelt reached gloved hand maw inside hollow red dried sap blackened fire beneath skull saw another smaller jaw broken halfburied ash bits bone

 brought skull mormont old bear lifted hands stared empty sockets “the wildlings burn dead we’ve always known wished i’d asked still around ask”

 jon snow remembered wight rising eyes shining blue pale dead face knew certain

 “would bones could talk” old bear grumbled “this fellow could tell us much died burned wildlings gone” sighed “the children forest could speak dead it’s said can’t” tossed skull back mouth tree landed puff fine ash “go houses giant get top tree look i’ll hounds brought perchance time trail fresher” tone suggest held much hope last

 two men went house make certain nothing missed jon paired dour eddison tollett squire grey hair thin pike brothers called dolorous edd “bad enough dead come walking” said jon crossed village “now old bear wants talking well good come i’ll warrant who’s say bones wouldn’t lie death make man truthful even clever dead likely dull fellows full tedious complaints—the ground’s cold gravestone larger get worms do…”

 jon stoop pass low door within found packed dirt floor furnishings sign people lived ashes beneath smoke hole roof “what dismal place live” said

 “i born house much like this” declared dolorous edd “those enchanted years later fell hard times” nest dry straw bedding filled one corner room edd looked longing “i’d give gold casterly rock sleep bed again”

 “you call bed”

 “if it’s softer ground roof call bed” dolorous edd sniffed air “i smell dung”

 smell faint “old dung” said jon house felt though empty time kneeling searched straw hands see anything concealed beneath made round walls take long “there’s nothing here”

 nothing expected whitetree fourth village passed people gone vanished scant possessions whatever animals may none villages showed signs attacked simply… empty “what think happened all” jon asked

 “something worse imagine” suggested dolorous edd “well might able imagine i’d sooner bad enough know you’re going come awful end without thinking aforetime”

 two hounds sniffing around door reemerged dogs ranged village chett cursing loudly voice thick anger never seemed put aside light filtering red leaves weirwood made boils face look even inflamed usual saw jon eyes narrowed love lost

 houses yielded wisdom “gone” cried mormont’s raven flapping weirwood perch “gone gone gone”

 “there wildlings whitetree year ago” thoren smallwood looked lord mormont clad ser jaremy rykker’s gleaming black mail embossed breastplate heavy cloak richly trimmed sable clasped crossed hammers rykkers wrought silver ser jaremy’s cloak once… wight claimed ser jaremy night’s watch wasted nothing

 “a year ago robert king realm peace” declared jarman buckwell square stolid man commanded scouts “much change year’s time”

 “one thing hasn’t changed” ser mallador locke insisted “fewer wildlings means fewer worries won’t mourn whatever’s become raiders murderers lot them”

 jon heard rustling red leaves two branches parted glimpsed little man moving limb limb easily squirrel bedwyck stood five feet tall grey streaks hair showed age rangers called giant sat fork tree heads said “there’s water north lake might flint hills rising west high nothing else see lords”

 “we might camp tonight” smallwood suggested

 old bear glanced searching glimpse sky pale limbs red leaves weirwood “no” declared “giant much daylight remains us”

 “three hours lord”

 “we’ll press north” mormont decided “if reach lake make camp shore perchance catch fish jon fetch paper it’s past time wrote maester aemon”

 jon found parchment quill ink saddlebag brought lord commander whitetree mormont scrawled fourth village empty wildlings gone “find tarly see gets way” said handed jon message whistled raven came flapping land horse’s head “corn” raven suggested bobbing horse whickered

 jon mounted garron wheeled trotted beyond shade great weirwood men night’s watch stood beneath lesser trees tending horses chewing strips salt beef pissing scratching talking command given move talk died climbed back saddles jarman buckwell’s scouts rode first vanguard thoren smallwood heading column proper came old bear main force ser mallador locke baggage train packhorses finally ser ottyn wythers rear guard two hundred men told half many mounts

 day followed game trails streambeds “ranger’s roads” led ever deeper wilderness leaf root night camped beneath starry sky gazed comet black brothers left castle black good spirits joking trading tales late brooding silence wood seemed sombered jests grown fewer tempers shorter one would admit afraid—they men night’s watch all—but jon could feel unease four empty villages wildlings anywhere even game seemingly fled haunted forest never seemed haunted even veteran rangers agreed

 rode jon peeled glove air burned fingers ugly things remembered suddenly used muss arya’s hair little stick sister wondered faring made little sad think might never muss hair began flex hand opening closing fingers let sword hand stiffen grow clumsy well might end knew man needed sword beyond wall

 jon found samwell tarly stewards watering horses three tend mount two packhorses bearing large wireandwicker cage full ravens birds flapped wings jon’s approach screamed bars shrieks sounded suspiciously like words “have teaching talk” asked sam

 “a words three say snow”

 “one bird croaking name bad enough” said jon “and snow’s nothing black brother wants hear about” snow often meant death north

 “was anything whitetree”

 “bones ashes empty houses” jon handed sam roll parchment “the old bear wants word sent back aemon”

 sam took bird one cages stroked feathers attached message said “fly home brave one home” raven quorked something unintelligible back sam tossed air flapping beat way skyward trees “i wish could carry him”

 “still”

 “well” said sam “yes but… i’m frightened truly first night every time heard someone getting make water thought wildlings creeping slit throat afraid closed eyes might never open only… well… dawn came all” managed wan smile “i may craven i’m stupid i’m sore back aches riding sleeping ground i’m hardly scared look” held hand jon see steady “i’ve working maps”

 world strange jon thought two hundred brave men left wall one growing fearful sam selfconfessed coward “we’ll make ranger yet” joked “next thing you’ll want outrider like grenn shall speak old bear”

 “don’t dare” sam pulled hood enormous black cloak clambered awkwardly back onto horse plow horse big slow clumsy better able bear weight little garrons rangers rode “i hoped might stay night village” said wistfully “it would nice sleep roof again”

 “too roofs us” jon mounted gave sam parting smile rode column well way swung wide around village avoid worst congestion seen enough whitetree

 ghost emerged undergrowth suddenly garron shied reared white wolf hunted well away line march much better fortune foragers smallwood sent game woods empty villages dywen told one night around fire “we’re large party” jon said “the game’s probably frightened away noise make march”

 “frightened away something doubt” dywen said

 horse settled ghost loped along easily beside jon caught mormont wending way around hawthorn thicket “is bird away” old bear asked

 “yes lord sam teaching talk”

 old bear snorted “he’ll regret damned things make lot noise never say thing worth hearing”

 rode silence jon said “if uncle found villages empty well—”

 “—he would made purpose learn why” lord mormont finished “and may well someone something want known well we’ll three hundred qhorin joins us whatever enemy waits find us easy deal find jon promise you”

 find us thought jon

 gendry climbed beside wearing helm “how many”

 arya tried count riding fast torches spinning air flung “a hundred” said “two hundred don’t know” roar flames could hear shouts “they’ll come us soon”

 “there” gendry said pointing

 column riders moved burning buildings toward holdfast firelight glittered metal helms spattered mail plate orange yellow highlights one carried banner tall lance thought red hard tell night fires roaring around everything seemed red black orange

 fire leapt one house another arya saw tree consumed flames creeping across branches stood night robes living orange everyone awake manning catwalks struggling frightened animals could hear yoren shouting commands something bumped leg glanced discover crying girl clutching “get away” wrenched leg free “what run hide someplace stupid” shoved girl away

 riders reined gates “you holdfast” shouted knight tall helm spiked crest “open name king”

 “aye king that” old reysen yelled back woth cuffed silence

 yoren climbed battlement beside gate faded black cloak tied wooden staff “you men hold here” shouted “the townfolk’s gone”

 “and old man one lord beric’s cravens” called knight spiked helm “if fat fool thoros ask likes fires”

 tyrion

 queen disposed wait varys “treason vile enough” declared furiously “but barefaced naked villainy need mincing eunuch tell must done villains”

 tyrion took letters sister’s hand compared side side two copies words exactly alike though written different hands

 “maester frenken received first missive castle stokeworth” grand maester pycelle explained “the second copy came lord gyles”

 littlefinger fingered beard “if stannis bothered it’s past certain every lord seven kingdoms saw copy well”

 “i want letters burned every one” cersei declared “no hint must reach son’s ears father’s”

 “i imagine father’s heard rather hint now” tyrion said dryly “doubtless stannis sent bird casterly rock another harrenhal burning letters point song sung wine spilled wench pregnant dire seems truth”

 cersei turned greeneyed fury “are utterly witless read says boy joffrey calls dares accuse incest adultery treason”

 you’re guilty astonishing see angry cersei could wax accusations knew perfectly well true lose war ought take mummery gift tyrion waited done said “stannis must pretext justify rebellion expect write ‘joffrey brother’s trueborn son heir mean take throne that’”

 “i suffer called whore”

 sister never claims jaime paid tyrion made show glancing writing niggling phrase…“done light lord” read “a queer choice words that”

 pycelle cleared throat “these words often appear letters documents free cities mean let us say written sight god god red priests usage believe”

 “varys told us years past lady selyse taken red priest” littlefinger reminded

 tyrion tapped paper “and would seem lord husband done use urge high septon reveal stannis turned gods well rightful king…”

 “yes yes” queen said impatiently “but first must stop filth spreading council must issue edict man heard speaking incest calling joff bastard lose tongue it”

 “a prudent measure” said grand maester pycelle chain office clinking nodded

 “a folly” sighed tyrion “when tear man’s tongue proving liar you’re telling world fear might say”

 “so would us do” sister demanded

 “very little let whisper they’ll grow bored tale soon enough man thimble sense see clumsy attempt justify usurping crown stannis offer proof could never happened” tyrion gave sister sweetest smile

 “that’s so” say “still…”

 “your grace brother right this” petyr baelish steepled fingers “if attempt silence talk lend credence better treat contempt like pathetic lie meantime fight fire fire”

 cersei gave measuring look “what sort fire”

 “a tale somewhat nature perhaps easily believed lord stannis spent marriage apart wife fault i’d married lady selyse nonetheless put daughter baseborn stannis cuckold well… smallfolk always eager believe worst lords particularly stern sour prickly proud stannis baratheon”

 “he never much loved that’s true” cersei considered moment “so pay back coin yes like name lady selyse’s lover two brothers believe one uncles dragonstone time…”

 “ser axell florent castellan” loath tyrion admit littlefinger’s scheme promise stannis never enamored wife bristly hedgehog honor concerned mistrustful nature could sow discord followers could help cause “the child florent ears i’m told”

 littlefinger gestured languidly “a trade envoy lys observed lord stannis must love daughter well since he’d erected hundreds statues along walls dragonstone ‘my lord’ tell ‘those gargoyles’” chuckled “ser axell might serve shireen’s father experience bizarre shocking tale apt repeated stannis keeps especially grotesque fool lackwit tattooed face”

 grand maester pycelle gaped aghast “surely mean suggest lady selyse would bring fool bed”

 “you’d fool want bed selyse florent” said littlefinger “doubtless patchface reminded stannis best lies contain within nuggets truth enough give listener pause happens fool utterly devoted girl follows everywhere even look somewhat alike shireen mottled halffrozen face well”

 pycelle lost “but greyscale near killed babe poor thing”

 “i like tale better” said littlefinger “and smallfolk believe woman eats rabbit pregnant child born long floppy ears”

 cersei smiled sort smile customarily reserved jaime “lord petyr wicked creature”

 “thank grace”

 “and accomplished liar” tyrion added less warmly one dangerous knew reflected

 littlefinger’s greygreen eyes met dwarf’s mismatched stare hint unease “we gifts lord”

 queen caught revenge take note exchange “cuckolded halfwit fool stannis laughed every winesink side narrow sea”

 “the story come us” tyrion said “or seen selfserving lie” sure

 littlefinger supplied answer “whores love gossip happens brothel three doubt varys plant seeds alehouses potshops”

 “varys” cersei said frowning “where varys”

 “i wondering grace”

 “the spider spins secret webs day night” grand maester pycelle said ominously “i mistrust one lords”

 “and speaks kindly you” tyrion pushed chair happened knew eunuch nothing councillors needed hear “pray excuse lords business calls”

 cersei instantly suspicious “king’s business”

 “nothing need trouble about”

 “i’ll judge that”

 “would spoil surprise” tyrion said “i’m gift made joffrey little chain”

 “what need another chain gold chains silver wear think moment buy joff’s love gifts—”

 “why surely king’s love mine chain believe may one day treasure others” little man bowed waddled door

 bronn waiting outside council chambers escort back tower hand “the smiths audience chamber waiting pleasure” said crossed ward

 one smiths knelt inspect object three immense steel links twisted together “a mighty chain”

 “mighty short” dwarf replied “somewhat like fancy one good deal longer name”

 “they call ironbelly m’lord” smith squat broad plainly dressed wool leather arms thick bull’s neck

 “i want every forge king’s landing turned making links joining work put aside want every man knows art working metal set task master journeyman apprentice ride street steel want hear hammers ringing night day want man strong man see done man goodman ironbelly”

 “might m’lord mail swords queen wanting”

 another smith spoke “her grace commanded us make chainmail armor swords daggers axes great numbers arming new gold cloaks m’lord”

 “that work wait” tyrion said “the chain first”

 “m’lord begging pardon grace said didn’t meet numbers would hands crushed” anxious smith persisted “smashed anvils said”

 sweet cersei always striving make smallfolk love us “no one hands smashed word it”

 “iron grown dear” ironbelly declared “and chain needing much coke beside fires”

 “lord baelish see coin need it” tyrion promised could count littlefinger much hoped “i command city watch help find iron melt every horseshoe city must”

 older man moved forward richly dressed damask tunic silver fastenings cloak lined foxfur knelt examine great steel links tyrion dumped floor “my lord” announced gravely “this crude work best art suitable labor common smiths doubt men bend horseshoes hammer kettles master armorer please lord work fellow masters make swords sharp song armor god might wear this”

 tyrion tilted head side gave man dose mismatched eyes “what name master armorer”

 demon’s head tyrion thought ruefully say “master salloreon plan fight rest battles chair it’s links need demon horns let put way make chains wear choice yours” rose took leave nary backward glance

 bronn waiting gate litter escort mounted black ears “you know we’re bound” tyrion told accepted hand litter done could feed hungry city—he’d set several hundred carpenters building fishing boats place catapults opened kingswood hunter dared cross river even sent gold cloaks foraging west south—yet still saw accusing eyes everywhere rode litter’s curtains shielded besides gave leisure think

 tyrion

 “i sleep younger” grand maester pycelle told way apology dawn meeting “i would sooner though world dark lie restless abed fretting tasks undone” said—though heavylidded eyes made look halfasleep said

 “commendable” tyrion admitted breaking large brown egg reminded unduly grand maester’s bald spotted head “i take different view food eat case none morrow” smiled “tell ravens early risers well”

 pycelle stroked snowy beard flowed chest “to sure shall send quill ink eaten”

 “no need” tyrion laid letters table beside porridge twin parchments tightly rolled sealed wax ends “send girl away talk”

 “i shall dispatch soon broken fast”

 “dispatch stewed plums keep realm may lord renly leading host roseroad one say lord stannis sail dragonstone”

 pycelle blinked “if lord prefers—”

 “oh yes” porridge thick tyrion felt wanted butter honey sure butter honey seldom seen king’s landing late though lord gyles kept well supplied castle half food ate days came lands lady tanda’s rosby stokeworth lay near city north yet untouched war

 “the prince dorne might ask…”

 “best not”

 “as say” pycelle’s curiosity ripe tyrion could almost taste “mayhaps… king’s council…”

 tyrion tapped wooden spoon edge bowl “the council exists advise king maester”

 “just so” said pycelle “and king—”

 “—is boy thirteen speak voice”

 “so indeed king’s hand yet… gracious sister queen regent she…”

 “…bears great weight upon lovely white shoulders wish add burdens you” tyrion cocked head gave grand maester inquiring stare

 pycelle dropped gaze back food something tyrion’s mismatched greenandblack eyes made men squirm knowing made good use “ah” old man muttered plums “doubtless right lord considerate to… spare this… burden”

 “that’s sort fellow am” tyrion returned unsatisfactory porridge “considerate cersei sweet sister all”

 podrick payne stood door solar studying floor “he’s inside” announced tyrion’s belt buckle “your solar lord sorry”

 tyrion sighed “look pod unnerves talk codpiece especially i’m wearing one inside solar”

 “lord littlefinger” podrick managed quick look face hastily dropped eyes “i meant lord petyr lord baelish master coin “

 “you make sound crowd” boy hunched struck making tyrion feel absurdly guilty

 lord petyr seated window seat languid elegant plush plumcolored doublet yellow satin cape one gloved hand resting knee “the king fighting hares crossbow” said “the hares winning come see”

 “invest pots” littlefinger advised “hares soon overrun castle we’ll eating hare thrice day”

 “better rats skewer” said tyrion “pod leave us unless lord petyr would care refreshment”

 “thank no” littlefinger flashed mocking smile “drink dwarf it’s said wake walking wall black brings unhealthy pallor”

 fear lord tyrion thought it’s wall mind seated high chair piled cushions said “you look elegant today lord”

 “i’m wounded strive look elegant every day”

 “is doublet new”

 “that’s handsome knife well”

 shout rang yard “ah grace killed hare” lord baelish observed

 “no doubt slow one” tyrion said “my lord fostered riverrun i’ve heard said grew close tullys”

 “you might say girls especially”

 “how close”

 “i maidenhoods close enough”

 lie—tyrion fairly certain lie—was delivered air nonchalance one could almost believe could catelyn stark lied defloration dagger well longer lived tyrion realized nothing simple little true “lord hoster’s daughters love me” confessed “i doubt would listen proposal might make yet coming words might fall sweetly ears “

 “that would depend words mean offer sansa return brother waste someone else’s time joffrey never surrender plaything lady catelyn great fool barter kingslayer slip girl”

 “i mean arya well men searching”

 “searching finding”

 “i’ll keep mind lord case lady lysa hoped might sway sweeter offer”

 “lysa tractable catelyn true… also fearful understand hates you”

 “she believes good reason guest eyrie insisted id murdered husband inclined listen denials” leaned forward “if gave jon arryn’s true killer might think kindly me”

 made littlefinger sit “true killer confess make curious propose”

 tyrion’s turn smile “gifts give friends freely lysa arryn would need understand that”

 “is friendship require swords”

 “both”

 littlefinger stroked neat spike beard “lysa woes clansmen raiding mountains moon greater numbers ever before… better armed”

 “distressing” said tyrion lannister armed “i could help word me…”

 “and would word cost her”

 “i want lady lysa son acclaim joffrey king swear fealty to—”

 “—make war starks tullys” littlefinger shook head “there’s roach pudding lannister lysa never send knights riverrun”

 “nor would ask lack enemies i’ll use power oppose lord renly lord stannis stir dragonstone return give justice jon arryn peace vale even name appalling child warden east father him” want see fly boy’s voice whispered faintly memory “and seal bargain give niece”

 “when comes age wed little lord robert time she’ll lady lysa’s ward eyrie”

 “and grace queen think ploy” tyrion shrugged littlefinger burst laughter “i thought you’re dangerous little man lannister yes could sing song lysa” sly smile mischief glance “if cared to”

 tyrion nodded waiting knowing littlefinger could never abide long silence

 “so” lord petyr continued pause utterly unabashed “what’s pot me”

 “harrenhal”

 interesting watch face lord petyr’s father smallest small lords grandfather landless hedge knight birth held stony acres windswept shore fingers harrenhal one richest plums seven kingdoms lands broad rich fertile great castle formidable realm… large dwarf riverrun petyr baelish fostered house tully brusquely expelled dared raise sights lord hoster’s daughter

 “then raze ground build anew suit you’ll lack coin mean make liege lord trident river lords proven cannot trusted let fealty lands”

 “even tullys”

 “if tullys left done”

 littlefinger looked like boy taken furtive bite honeycomb trying watch bees honey sweet “harrenhal lands incomes” mused “with stroke you’d make one greatest lords realm i’m ungrateful lord but—why”

 “you served sister well matter succession”

 “as janos slynt castle harrenhal quite recently bestowed—only snatched away longer use”

 tyrion laughed “you lord say need deliver lady lysa need janos slynt” gave crooked shrug “i’d sooner seated harrenhal renly seated iron throne could plainer”

 “what indeed realize may need bed lysa arryn get consent marriage”

 “i little doubt you’ll equal task”

 “i told ned stark find naked ugly woman thing close eyes get it” littlefinger steepled fingers gazed tyrion’s mismatched eyes “give fortnight conclude affairs arrange ship carry gulltown”

 “that nicely”

 guest rose “this quite pleasant morning lannister profitable… us trust” bowed cape swirl yellow strode door

 “is crow hear calling raven black would sooner hear i’ve proposed doran martell”

 varys giggled “perhaps little birds told me”

 “have indeed” wanted hear “go on”

 “the dornishmen thus far held aloof wars doran martell called banners hatred house lannister well known commonly thought join lord renly wish dissuade him”

 “all obvious” said tyrion

 “the puzzle might offered allegiance prince sentimental man still mourns sister elia sweet babe”

 “my father told lord never lets sentiment get way ambition… happens empty seat small council lord janos taken black”

 “a council seat despised” varys admitted “yet enough make proud man forget sister’s murder”

 “why forget” tyrion smiled “i’ve promised deliver sister’s killers alive dead prefers war done sure”

 varys gave shrewd look “my little birds tell princess elia cried a… certain name… came her”

 “is secret still secret everyone knows it” casterly rock common knowledge gregor clegane killed elia babe said raped princess son’s blood brains still hands

 “this secret lord father’s sworn man”

 “my father would first tell fifty thousand dornishmen worth one rabid dog”

 varys stroked powdered cheek “and prince doran demands blood lord gave command well knight deed…”

 “robert baratheon led rebellion commands came end”

 “robert king’s landing”

 “neither doran martell”

 “so blood pride chair ambition gold land goes without saying sweet offer… yet sweets poisoned prince something would require reach honeycomb token good faith sure safeguard betrayal” varys smiled slimiest smile “which one give wonder”

 tyrion sighed “you know don’t you”

 “since put way—yes tommen could scarcely offer myrcella doran martell lysa arryn both”

 “remind never play guessing games cheat “

 “prince tommen good boy”

 “if pry away cersei joffrey he’s still young may even grow good man”

 “and good king”

 “joffrey king”

 “and tommen heir anything ill befall grace tommen whose nature sweet notably… tractable”

 “you suspicious mind varys”

 “i shall take tribute lord case prince doran hardly insensible great honor deftly done would say… one small flaw”

 dwarf laughed “named cersei”

 “what avails statecraft love mother sweet fruit womb perhaps glory house safety realm queen might persuaded send away tommen myrcella surely not”

 “what cersei know never hurt me”

 “and grace discover intentions plans ripe”

 “why” said “then would know man told certain enemy” varys giggled thought three

 “only here” sansa said “i’ll remember”

 “and seem cruel mocking indifferent men watching forgive child role play must one misstep heads adorn walls father’s”

 nodded “i understand”

 “you need brave strong… patient patient all”

 “i be” promised “but… please… make soon i’m afraid…”

 “so i” ser dontos said smiling wanly “and must go missed”

 “you come me”

 “better never seen together”

 nodding sansa took step… spun back nervous softly laid kiss cheek eyes closed “my florian” whispered “the gods heard prayer”

 flew along river walk past small kitchen pig yard hurried footsteps lost beneath squealing hogs pens home thought home going take home he’ll keep safe florian songs florian jonquil favorites florian homely though old

 racing headlong serpentine steps man lurched hidden doorway sansa caromed lost balance iron fingers caught wrist could fall deep voice rasped “it’s long roll serpentine little bird want kill us both” laughter rough saw stone “maybe do”

 hound “no lord pardons i’d never” sansa averted eyes late he’d seen face “please you’re hurting me” tried wriggle free

 “and what’s joff’s little bird flying serpentine black night” answer shook “where you”

 “the gggodswood lord” said daring lie “praying… praying father and… king praying he’d hurt”

 “think i’m drunk i’d believe that” let go grip arm swaying slightly stood stripes light darkness falling across terrible burnt face “you look almost woman… face teats you’re taller almost… ah you’re still stupid little bird aren’t singing songs taught you… sing song don’t go sing song knights fair maids like knights don’t you”

 “fuck ser boros you’re knight i’m king’s dog remember “

 “the king looking dog earlier”

 “the dog drinking night shield ser brothers”

 ser boros turned sansa “how chambers hour lady”

 “i went godswood pray safety king” lie sounded better time almost true

 “you expect sleep noise” clegane said “what trouble”

 “fools gate” ser boros admitted “some loose tongues spread tales preparations tyrek’s wedding feast wretches got heads feasted grace led sortie sent scurrying”

 “a brave boy” clegane said mouth twitching

 let us see brave faces brother sansa thought hound escorted across drawbridge winding way steps said “why let people call dog won’t let anyone call knight”

 “i like dogs better knights father’s father kennelmaster rock one autumn year lord tytos came lioness prey lioness didn’t give shit lannister’s sigil bitch tore lord’s horse would done lord grandfather came hounds three dogs died running grandfather lost leg lannister paid lands towerhouse took son squire three dogs banner three died yellow autumn grass hound die never lie he’ll look straight face” cupped jaw raising chin fingers pinching painfully “and that’s little birds isn’t never got song”

 arya

 climbed way highest branch arya could see chimneys poking trees thatched roofs clustered along shore lake small stream emptied wooden pier jutted water beside low long building slate roof

 skinnied farther branch began sag weight boats tied pier could see thin tendrils smoke rising chimneys part wagon jutting behind stable

 someone’s arya chewed lip places they’d come upon empty desolate farms villages castles septs barns made matter could burn lannisters burned could die they’d killed even set woods ablaze could though leaves still green wet recent rains fires spread “they would burned lake could have” gendry said arya knew right night escape flames burning town shimmered brightly water seemed lake afire

 finally summoned nerve steal back ruins next night nothing remained blackened stones hollow shells houses corpses places wisps pale smoke still rose ashes hot pie pleaded go back lommy called fools swore ser amory would catch kill lorch men long gone time reached holdfast found gates broken walls partly demolished inside strewn unburied dead one look enough gendry “they’re killed every one” said “and dogs look”

 “or wolves”

 “dogs wolves makes matter it’s done here”

 arya would leave found yoren couldn’t killed told hard tough brother night’s watch besides said much gendry searched among corpses

 axe blow killed split skull apart great tangled beard could one else’s garb patched unwashed faded grey black ser amory lorch given thought burying dead murdered corpses four lannister menatarms heaped near yoren’s arya wondered many taken bring

 going take home thought dug old man’s hole many dead bury yoren least must grave arya insisted going bring safe winterfell promised part wanted cry part wanted kick

 gendry thought lord’s towerhouse three yoren sent hold come attack well round tower one entry secondstory door reached ladder pulled inside ser amory’s men could get lannisters piled brush around tower’s base set afire stone would burn lorch patience starve cutjack opened door gendry’s shout kurz said they’d better pressing north going back arya clung hope still might reach winterfell

 well village winterfell thatched roofs promised warmth shelter maybe even food bold enough risk unless it’s lorch horses would traveled faster us

 watched tree long time hoping might see something man horse banner anything would help know times glimpsed motion buildings far hard certain clearly heard whinny horse

 air full birds crows mostly afar larger flies wheeled flapped thatched roofs east gods eye sheet sunhammered blue filled half world days made slow way muddy shore gendry wanted part roads even hot pie lommy saw sense arya felt though lake calling wanted leap placid blue waters feel clean swim splash bask sun dare take clothes others could see even wash end day would often sit rock dangle feet cool water finally thrown away cracked rotted shoes walking barefoot hard first blisters finally broken cuts healed soles turned leather mud nice toes liked feel earth underfoot walked

 could see small wooded island northeast thirty yards shore three black swans gliding water serene… one told war come cared nothing burning towns butchered men stared yearning part wanted swan part wanted eat one broken fast acorn paste handful bugs bugs weren’t bad got used worms worse still bad pain belly days without food finding bugs easy kick rock arya eaten bug little make sansa screech hadn’t afraid eat another weasel wasn’t either hot pie retched beetle tried swallow lommy gendry wouldn’t even try yesterday gendry caught frog shared lommy days hot pie found blackberries stripped bush bare mostly living water acorns kurz told use rocks make kind acorn paste tasted awful

 wished poacher hadn’t died he’d known woods rest together he’d taken arrow shoulder pulling ladder towerhouse tarber packed mud moss lake day two kurz swore wound nothing even though flesh throat turning dark angry red welts crept jaw chest one morning couldn’t find strength get next dead

 buried mound stones cutjack claimed sword hunting horn tarber helped bow boots knife they’d taken left first thought two gone hunting they’d soon return game feed waited waited finally gendry made move maybe tarber cutjack figured would stand better chance without gaggle orphan boys herd along probably would didn’t stop hating leaving

 beneath tree hot pie barked like dog kurz told use animal sounds signal old poacher’s trick he’d said he’d died could teach make sounds right hot pie’s bird calls awful dog better much

 arya hopped high branch one beneath hands balance water dancer never falls lightfoot toes curled tight around branch walked feet hopped larger limb swung hand hand tangle leaves reached trunk bark rough beneath fingers toes descended quickly jumping final six feet rolling landed

 gendry gave hand pull “you long time could see”

 “a fishing village little place north along shore twentysix thatch roofs one slate counted saw part wagon someone’s there”

 sound voice weasel came creeping bushes lommy named said looked like weasel wasn’t true couldn’t keep calling crying girl finally stopped crying mouth filthy arya hoped hadn’t eating mud

 “did see people” asked gendry

 “mostly roofs” arya admitted “but chimneys smoking heard horse” weasel put arms around leg clutching tight sometimes

 “if there’s people there’s food” hot pie said loudly gendry always telling quiet never good “might they’d give us some”

 “might they’d kill us too” gendry said

 “not yielded” hot pie said hopefully

 “now sound like lommy”

 lommy greenhands sat propped two thick roots foot oak spear taken left calf fight holdfast end next day limp along onelegged arm around gendry couldn’t even they’d hacked branches trees make litter slow hard work carrying along whimpered every time jounced

 “we yield” said “that’s yoren done opened gates like said”

 arya sick lommy going yoren yielded talked carried leg empty belly

 hot pie agreed “they told yoren open gates told king’s name tell king’s name stinky old man’s fault he’d yielded would left us be”

 gendry frowned “knights lordlings take captive pay ransoms don’t care likes yield not” turned arya “what else see”

 “if it’s fishing village they’d sell us fish bet” said hot pie lake teemed fresh fish nothing catch arya tried use hands way she’d seen koss fish quicker pigeons water played tricks eyes

 “i don’t know fish” arya tugged weasel’s matted hair thinking might best hack “there’s crows water something’s dead there”

 “fish washed shore” hot pie said “if crows eat bet could”

 “we catch crows could eat them” said lommy “we could make fire roast like chickens”

 gendry looked fierce scowled beard grown thick black briar “i said fires”

 “lommy’s hungry” hot pie whined “and too”

 “we’re hungry” said arya

 “you’re not” lommy spat ground “worm breath”

 arya could kicked wound “i said i’d dig worms wanted”

 lommy made disgusted face “if wasn’t leg i’d hunt us boars”

 “some boars” mocked “you need boarspear hunt boars horses dogs men flush boar lair” father hunted boar wolfswood robb jon even took bran never arya even though older septa mordane said boar hunting ladies mother promised older might hawk older hawk she’d eat

 “what know hunting boars” said hot pie

 “more you”

 gendry mood hear “quiet need think do” always looked pained tried think like hurt something fierce

 “yield” lommy said

 “i told shut yielding don’t even know who’s maybe steal food”

 “lommy could steal wasn’t leg” said hot pie “he thief city”

 “a bad thief” arya said “or wouldn’t got caught”

 gendry squinted sun “evenfall best time sneak i’ll go scout come dark”

 “no i’ll go” arya said “you’re noisy”

 gendry got look face “we’ll go”

 “arry go” said lommy “he’s sneakier are”

 “we’ll go said”

 “but don’t come back hot pie can’t carry know can’t…”

 “and there’s wolves” hot pie said “i heard last night watch sounded close”

 arya heard she’d asleep branches elm howling woken she’d sat awake good hour listening prickles creeping spine

 “and won’t even let us fire keep off” hot pie said “it’s right leaving us wolves”

 “no one leaving you” gendry said disgust “lommy spear wolves come you’ll we’re going go see that’s we’re coming back”

 “whoever yield them” lommy whined “i need potion leg hurts bad”

 “if see leg potion we’ll bring it” gendry said “arry let’s go want get near sun hot pie keep weasel don’t want following”

 “last time kicked me”

 “i’ll kick don’t keep here” without waiting answer gendry donned steel helm walked

 arya scamper keep gendry five years older foot taller long leg well said nothing plowed trees angry look face making much noise finally stopped said “i think lommy’s going die”

 surprised kurz died wound he’d lot stronger lommy whenever arya’s turn help carry could feel warm skin smell stink leg “maybe could find maester…”

 “you find maesters castles even found one wouldn’t dirty hands likes lommy” gendry ducked lowhanging limb

 “that’s true” maester luwin would helped anyone came certain

 “he’s going die sooner better rest us leave like says hurt know he’d leave us” scrambled steep cut side using roots handholds “i’m sick carrying i’m sick talk yielding could stand i’d knock teeth lommy’s use anyone crying girl’s use either”

 “you leave weasel alone she’s scared hungry all” arya glanced back girl following hot pie must grabbed like gendry told

 “she’s use” gendry repeated stubbornly “her hot pie lommy they’re slowing us they’re going get us killed you’re one bunch who’s good anything even girl”

 arya froze steps “i’m girl”

 “yes think i’m stupid are”

 “no you’re stupider night’s watch doesn’t take girls everyone knows that”

 “that’s true don’t know yoren brought must reason you’re still girl”

 “i not”

 “then pull cock take piss go on”

 “i don’t need take piss wanted could”

 “liar can’t take cock don’t one never noticed thirty us always go woods make water don’t see hot pie neither you’re girl must eunuch”

 “you’re eunuch”

 “you know i’m not” gendry smiled “you want take cock prove don’t anything hide”

 “yes do” arya blurted desperate escape subject cock didn’t “those gold cloaks inn won’t tell us why”

 “i wish knew think yoren knew never told think though”

 arya bit lip remembered yoren said day hacked hair lot half o’ would turn queen quick spit pardon maybe silvers half’d they’d rape first gendry different queen wanted “i’ll tell you’ll tell me” said warily

 “i would knew arry… really you’re called girl’s name”

 arya glared gnarled root feet realized pretense done gendry knew nothing pants convince otherwise could draw needle kill stood else trust wasn’t certain she’d able kill even tried sword lot stronger left truth “lommy hot pie can’t know” said

 “they won’t” swore “not me”

 “arya” raised eyes “my name arya house stark”

 “of house…” took moment said “the king’s hand named stark one killed traitor”

 “he never traitor father”

 gendry’s eyes widened “so that’s thought…”

 nodded “yoren taking home winterfell”

 “i… you’re highborn a… you’ll lady…”

 arya looked ragged clothes bare feet cracked callused saw dirt nails scabs elbows scratches hands septa mordane wouldn’t even know bet sansa might she’d pretend “my mother’s lady sister never was”

 “yes lord’s daughter lived castle didn’t you… gods good never…” sudden gendry seemed uncertain almost afraid “all cocks never said pissing front everything i… beg pardon m’lady”

 “stop that” arya hissed mocking

 “i know courtesies m’lady” gendry said stubborn ever “whenever highborn girls came shop fathers master told bend knee speak spoke call m’lady”

 “if start calling m’lady even hot pie going notice better keep pissing way too”

 “as m’lady commands”

 arya slammed chest hands tripped stone sat thump “what kind lord’s daughter you” said laughing

 “this kind” kicked side made laugh harder “you laugh like i’m going see who’s village” sun already fallen trees dusk would time gendry hurry “you smell that” asked

 sniffed air “rotten fish”

 “you know it’s not”

 “we better careful i’ll go around west see there’s road must saw wagon take shore need help bark like dog”

 “that’s stupid need help i’ll shout help” darted away bare feet silent grass glanced back shoulder watching pained look face meant thinking he’s probably thinking shouldn’t letting m’lady go stealing food arya knew going stupid

 smell grew stronger got closer village smell like rotten fish stench ranker fouler wrinkled nose

 trees began thin used undergrowth slipping bush bush quiet shadow every yards stopped listen third time heard horses man’s voice well smell got worse dead man’s stink that’s smelled yoren others

 dense thicket brambles grew south village time reached long shadows sunset begun fade lantern bugs coming could see thatched roofs beyond hedge crept along found gap squirmed belly keeping well hidden saw made smell

 beside gently lapping waters gods eye long gibbet raw green wood thrown things men dangled feet chains crows pecked flesh flapped corpse corpse every crow hundred flies wind blew lake nearest corpse twisted chain ever slightly crows eaten face something else well something much larger throat chest torn apart glistening green entrails ribbons ragged flesh dangled belly opened one arm ripped right shoulder arya saw bones feet away gnawed cracked picked clean meat

 made look next man one beyond one beyond telling hard stone corpses savaged decayed took moment realize stripped hanged look like naked people hardly looked like people crows eaten eyes sometimes faces sixth long row nothing remained single leg still tangled chains swaying breeze

 fear cuts deeper swords dead men could hurt whoever killed could well beyond gibbet two men mail hauberks stood leaning spears front long low building water one slate roof pair tall poles driven muddy ground front banners drooping staff one looked red one paler white yellow maybe limp dusk settling could even certain red one lannister crimson don’t need see lion see dead people else would lannisters

 shout

 two spearmen turned cry third man came view shoving captive growing dark make faces prisoner wearing shiny steel helm arya saw horns knew gendry stupid stupid stupid stupid thought he’d would kicked

 guards talking loudly far away make words especially crows gabbling flapping closer hand one spearmen snatched helm gendry’s head asked question must liked answer smashed across face butt spear knocked one who’d captured gave kick second spearman trying bull’shead helm finally pulled feet marched toward storehouse opened heavy wooden doors small boy darted one guards grabbed arm flung back inside arya heard sobbing inside building shriek loud full pain made bite lip

 guards shoved gendry inside boy barred doors behind breath wind came sighing lake banners stirred lifted one tall staff bore golden lion she’d feared three sleek black shapes ran across field yellow butter dogs thought arya seen dogs

 didn’t matter thing mattered gendry even stubborn stupid get wondered knew queen wanted

 one guards took helm donned gendry’s instead made angry see wearing knew nothing could stop thought heard screams inside windowless storehouse muffled masonry hard certain

 stayed long enough see guard changed much besides men came went led horses stream drink hunting party returned wood carrying deer’s carcass slung pole watched clean gut build cookfire far side stream smell cooking meat mingled queerly stench corruption empty belly roiled thought might retch prospect food brought men houses near wearing bits mail boiled leather deer cooked choicest portions carried one houses

 thought dark might let crawl close free gendry guards kindled torches cookfire squire brought meat bread two guarding storehouse later two men joined passed skin wine hand hand empty others left two guards remained leaning spears

 arya’s arms legs stiff finally wriggled briar dark wood black night thin sliver moon appearing disappearing clouds blew past silent shadow told moved trees darkness dared run fear tripping unseen root losing way left gods eye lapped calmly shores right wind sighed branches leaves rustled stirred far heard howling wolves

 lommy hot pie almost shit stepped trees behind “quiet” told putting arm around weasel little girl came running

 hot pie stared big eyes “we thought left us” shortsword hand one yoren taken gold cloak “i scared wolf”

 “where’s bull” asked lommy

 “they caught him” arya whispered “we get hot pie got help we’ll sneak kill guards i’ll open door”

 hot pie lommy exchanged look “how many”

 “i couldn’t count” arya admitted “twenty least two door”

 hot pie looked going cry “we can’t fight twenty”

 “you need fight one i’ll we’ll get gendry run”

 “we yield” lommy said “just go yield”

 arya shook head stubbornly

 “then leave arry” lommy pleaded “they don’t know rest us hide they’ll go away know it’s fault gendry’s captured”

 “you’re stupid lommy” arya said angrily “you’ll die don’t get gendry who’s going carry you”

 “you hot pie”

 “all time one else help we’ll never gendry strong one anyhow don’t care say i’m going back him” looked hot pie “are coming”

 hot pie glanced lommy arya lommy “i’ll come” said reluctantly

 “lommy keep weasel here”

 grabbed little girl hand pulled close “what wolves come”

 “yield” arya suggested

 finding way back village seemed take hours hot pie kept stumbling dark losing way arya wait double back finally took hand led along trees “just quiet follow” could make first faint glow village fires sky said “there’s dead men hanging side hedge they’re nothing scared remember fear cuts deeper swords go real quiet slow” hot pie nodded

 wriggled briar first waited far side crouched low hot pie emerged pale panting face arms bloody long scratches started say something arya put finger lips hands knees crawled along gibbet beneath swaying dead hot pie never looked made sound

 crow landed back gave muffled gasp “who’s there” voice boomed suddenly dark

 hot pie leapt feet “i yield” threw away sword dozens crows rose shrieking complaining flap corpses arya grabbed leg tried drag back wrenched loose ran forward waving arms “i yield yield”

 bounced drew needle men around arya slashed nearest blocked steelclad arm someone else slammed dragged ground third man wrenched sword grasp tried bite teeth snapped shut cold dirty chainmail “oho fierce one” man said laughing blow ironclad fist near knocked head

 talked lay hurting arya could seem understand words ears rang tried crawl earth moved beneath took needle shame hurt worse pain pain hurt lot jon given sword syrio taught use

 finally someone grabbed front jerkin yanked knees hot pie kneeling tallest man arya ever seen monster one old nan’s stories never saw giant come three black dogs raced across faded yellow surcoat face looked hard cut stone suddenly arya knew seen dogs night tourney king’s landing knights hung shields outside pavilions “that one belongs hound’s brother” sansa confided passed black dogs yellow field “he’s even bigger hodor you’ll see call mountain rides”

 arya let head droop half aware going around hot pie yielding mountain said “you’ll lead us others” walked next stumbling past dead men gibbet hot pie told captors he’d bake pies tarts didn’t hurt four men went one carried torch one longsword two spears

 found lommy they’d left oak “i yield” called saw he’d flung away spear raised hands splotchy green old dye “i yield please”

 man torch searched around trees “are last baker boy said girl”

 “she ran heard coming” lommy said “you made lot noise” arya thought run weasel run far run hide never come back

 “tell us find whoreson dondarrion there’ll hot meal you”

 “who” said lommy blankly

 “i told lot don’t know cunts village waste o’bloody time”

 one spearmen drifted lommy “something wrong leg boy”

 “it got hurt”

 “can walk” sounded concerned

 “no” said lommy “you got carry me”

 “think so” man lifted spear casually drove point boy’s soft throat lommy never even time yield jerked man pulled spear loose blood sprayed dark fountain “carry says” muttered chuckling

 tyrion surprised see bronn standing beside litter well “what here”

 “delivering messages” bronn said “ironhand wants urgently gate gods won’t say you’ve summoned maegor’s too”

 “summoned” tyrion knew one person would presume use word “and cersei want me”

 bronn shrugged “the queen commands return castle attend chambers stripling cousin delivered message four hairs lip thinks he’s man”

 “four hairs knighthood he’s ser lancel never forget” tyrion knew ser jacelyn would send unless matter import “i’d best see bywater wants inform sister attend return”

 “she won’t like that” bronn warned

 “what news foe” tyrion turned attention back stark’s terms boy want much half realm release captives hostages father’s sword… oh yes sisters

 “the boy sits idle riverrun” ser cleos said “i think fears face father field strength grows less day river lords departed defend lands”

 cersei turned away window skirts swirling around slender hips “how dare ignore summons”

 “who admitted tower”

 “your tower son’s royal castle”

 “so tell me” tyrion amused crawn would even less moon brothers guard today “i come happens”

 “were you”

 swung door shut behind “you doubt me”

 “always good reason”

 “i’m hurt” tyrion waddled sideboard cup wine knew surer way work thirst talking cersei “if i’ve given offense would know how”

 “what disgusting little worm myrcella daughter truly imagine would allow sell like bag oats “

 myrcella thought well egg hatched let’s see color chick “hardly bag oats myrcella princess would say born plan marry tommen”

 hand lashed knocking wine cup hand spill floor “brother tongue joffrey’s regent say myrcella shipped dornishman way shipped robert baratheon”

 tyrion shook wine fingers sighed “why she’d deal safer dorne here”

 “are utterly ignorant simply perverse know well martells cause love us”

 “the martells every cause hate us nonetheless expect agree prince doran’s grievance house lannister goes back generation dornishmen warred storm’s end highgarden thousand years renly taken dorne’s allegiance granted myrcella nine trystane martell eleven proposed wed reaches fourteenth year time would honored guest sunspear prince doran’s protection”

 “small good ser arys doran martell decides daughter’s death would wash sister’s”

 “martell honorable murder nineyearold girl particularly one sweet innocent myrcella long holds reasonably certain we’ll keep faith side terms rich refuse myrcella least part i’ve also offered sister’s killer council seat castles marches…”

 “too much” cersei paced away restless lioness skirts swirling “you’ve offered much without authority consent”

 “this prince dorne speaking i’d offered less he’d likely spit face”

 “too much” cersei insisted whirling back

 “what would offered hole legs” tyrion said anger flaring

 time saw slap coming head snapped around crack “sweet sweet sister” said “i promise last time ever strike me”

 sister laughed “don’t threaten little man think father’s letter keeps safe piece paper eddard stark piece paper good him”

 cersei began cry

 “don’t touch me” said wrenching away hurt yet slap redfaced angry griefstricken cersei struggled breath “don’t look not… like this… you”

 politely tyrion turned back “i mean frighten promise nothing happen myrcella”

 “liar” said behind “i’m child soothed empty promises told would free jaime well “

 “in riverrun imagine safe guard find way free him”

 cersei sniffed “i born man would need none would allowed happen could jaime let captured boy father trusted fool he’s wanted doing”

 “making war”

 “from behind walls harrenhal” said scornfully “a curious way fighting looks suspiciously like hiding”

 “look again”

 “what else would call father sits one castle robb stark sits another one anything”

 “there sitting sitting” tyrion suggested “each one waits move lion still poised tail twitching fawn frozen fear bowels turned jelly matter way bounds lion knows it”

 “and you’re quite certain father lion”

 tyrion grinned “it’s banners”

 ignored jest “if father who’d taken captive jaime would sitting idly promise you”

 jaime would battering host bloody bits walls riverrun others take chances never patience sweet sister “not us bold jaime ways win wars harrenhal strong well situated”

 “and king’s landing know perfectly well father plays lion fawn stark boy renly marches roseroad could gates day now”

 “the city fall day harrenhal straight swift march kingsroad renly scarce unlimbered siege engines father takes rear host hammer city walls anvil makes lovely picture”

 cersei’s green eyes bored wary yet hungry reassurance feeding “and robb stark marches”

 “harrenhal close enough fords trident roose bolton cannot bring northern foot across join young wolf’s horse stark cannot march king’s landing without taking harrenhal first even bolton strong enough that” tyrion tried winning smile “meanwhile father lives fat riverlands uncle stafford gathers fresh levies rock”

 cersei regarded suspiciously “how could know father tell intentions sent here”

 “no glanced map”

 look turned disdain “you’ve conjured every word grotesque head haven’t imp”

 tyrion tsked “sweet sister ask weren’t winning would starks sued peace” drew letter ser cleos frey brought “the young wolf sent us terms see unacceptable terms sure still beginning would care see them”

 “yes” fast queen “how come come me”

 “what else hand hand things” tyrion handed letter cheek still throbbed cersei’s hand left mark let flay half face small price pay consent dornish marriage would could sense

 slept amidst rolling grasslands catelyn dreamt bran whole arya sansa held hands rickon still babe breast robb crownless played wooden sword safe asleep found ned bed smiling

 sweet sweet gone soon dawn came cruel dagger light woke aching alone weary weary riding weary hurting weary duty want weep thought want comforted i’m tired strong want foolish frightened small that’s all… day… hour…

 outside tent men stirring heard whicker horses shadd complaining stiffness back ser wendel calling bow catelyn wished would go away good men loyal yet tired children yearned one day promised lay abed one day would allow less strong

 today could today

 fingers seemed clumsy usual fumbled clothes supposed ought grateful use hands dagger valyrian steel valyrian steel bites deep sharp look scars remember

 outside shadd stirring oats kettle ser wendel manderly sat stringing bow “my lady” said catelyn emerged “there birds grass would fancy roast quail break fast morning”

 “oats bread sufficient… us think many leagues yet ride ser wendel”

 “as lady” knight’s moon face looked crestfallen tips great walrus mustache twitching disappointment “oats bread could better” one fattest men catelyn ever known howevermuch loved food loved honor

 “found nettles brewed tea” shadd announced “will m’lady take cup”

 “yes thanks”

 cradled tea scarred hands blew cool shadd one winterfell men robb sent twenty best see safely renly sent five lordlings well whose names high birth would add weight honor mission made way south staying well clear towns holdfasts seen bands mailed men glimpsed smoke eastern horizon none dared molest weak threat many easy prey across blackwater worst behind past four days seen signs war

 catelyn never wanted told robb much back riverrun “when last saw renly boy older bran know send someone else place father whatever time left”

 son looked unhappily “there one else cannot go father’s ill blackfish eyes ears dare lose brother need hold riverrun march—”

 “march” one said word marching

 “i cannot sit riverrun waiting peace makes look afraid take field battles fight men start think hearth harvest father told even northmen grow restless”

 northmen thought even starting talk like king “no one ever died restlessness rashness another matter we’ve planted seeds let grow”

 robb shook head stubbornly “we’ve tossed seeds wind that’s sister lysa coming aid us would heard many birds sent eyrie four want peace lannisters give anything sit army melts away around swift summer snow”

 “so rather look craven dance lord tywin’s pipes” threw back “he wants march harrenhal ask uncle brynden if—”

 “i said nothing harrenhal” robb said “now go renly must send greatjon”

 memory brought wan smile face obvious ploy yet deft boy fifteen robb knew illsuited man like greatjon umber would treat man like renly baratheon knew knew well could accede praying father would live return lord hoster well would gone knew still leavetaking hard hard even know came say farewell “minisa” called “where children little cat sweet lysa…” catelyn kissed brow told babes well “wait lord” said eyes closed “i waited oh many times must wait me”

 jon often heard black brothers tell tales craster keep would see eyes seven empty villages come dread finding craster’s dead desolate rest seemed would spared perhaps old bear finally get answers thought anyway we’ll rain

 thoren smallwood swore craster friend watch despite unsavory reputation “the man’s halfmad won’t deny it” he’d told old bear “but you’d you’d spent life cursed wood even he’s never turned ranger away fire love mance rayder he’ll give us good counsel”

 long gives us hot meal chance dry clothes i’ll happy dywen said craster kinslayer liar raper craven hinted trafficked slavers demons “and worse” old forester would add clacking wooden teeth “there’s cold smell one is”

 “jon” lord mormont commanded “ride back along column spread word remind officers want trouble craster’s wives men mind hands speak women little need be”

 “aye lord” jon turned horse back way they’d come pleasant rain face little everyone passed seemed weeping march strung half mile woods

 midst baggage train jon passed samwell tarly slumped saddle wide floppy hat riding one dray horse leading others drumming rain hoods cages ravens squawking fluttering “you put fox them” jon called

 water ran brim sam’s hat lifted head “oh hullo jon hate rain us”

 “how faring sam”

 “wetly” fat boy managed smile “nothing killed yet though”

 “good craster’s keep ahead gods good he’ll let us sleep fire”

 sam looked dubious “dolorous edd says craster’s terrible savage marries daughters obeys laws makes dywen told grenn he’s got black blood veins mother wildling woman lay ranger he’s bas…” suddenly realized say

 “a bastard” jon said laugh “you say sam i’ve heard word before” put spurs surefooted little garron “i need hunt ser ottyn careful around craster’s women” samwell tarly needed warning score “we’ll talk later we’ve made camp”

 jon carried word back ser ottyn wythers plodding along rear guard small prunefaced man age mormont ser ottyn always looked tired even castle black rain beaten unmercifully “welcome tidings” said “this wet soaked bones even saddle sores complain saddle sores”

 “buckwell’s found craster” jon told

 “had lost him” dywen chuckled “see young bucks don’t go nosing craster’s wives hear”

 jon smiled “want dywen”

 dywen clacked teeth “might craster’s got ten fingers one cock don’t count eleven he’d never miss couple”

 “how many wives truly” grenn asked

 “more’n ever brother well it’s hard breed there’s beast snow”

 jon remembered spray red blood white snow way theon greyjoy kicked dead man’s head man deserter way back winterfell jon robb raced found six direwolf pups snow thousand years ago

 “when ser waymar left bound”

 craster gave shrug “happens better things tend comings goings crows” drank pull beer set cup aside “had good southron wine bear’s night could use wine new axe mine’s lost bite can’t got women protect” gazed around scurrying wives

 “you isolated” mormont said “if like i’ll detail men escort south wall”

 raven seemed like notion “wall” screamed spreading black wings like high collar behind mormont’s head

 host gave nasty smile showing mouthful broken brown teeth “and would serve supper we’re free folk craster serves man”

 “these bad times dwell alone wild cold winds rising”

 “let rise roots sunk deep” craster grabbed passing woman wrist “tell wife tell lord crow well content are”

 woman licked thin lips “this place craster keeps us safe better die free live slave”

 “slave” muttered raven

 mormont leaned forward “every village passed abandoned first living faces we’ve seen since left wall people gone… whether dead fled taken could say animals well nothing left earlier found bodies two ben stark’s rangers leagues wall pale cold black hands black feet wounds bleed yet took back castle black rose night killed one slew ser jaremy rykker came tells remember knew lived human mercy left them”

 woman’s mouth hung open wet pink cave craster gave snort “we’ve troubles here… i’ll thank tell evil tales roof i’m godly man gods keep safe wights come walking i’ll know send back graves though could use sharp new axe” sent wife scurrying slap leg shout “more beer quick it”

 “no trouble dead” jarmen buckwell said “but living lord king”

 “king” cried mormont’s raven “king king king”

 “that mance rayder” craster spit fire “kingbeyondthewall free folk want kings” turned squint mormont “there’s much could tell o’ rayder doings mind o’ empty villages that’s work would found hall abandoned well man scrape sends rider tells must leave keep come grovel feet sent man back kept tongue it’s nailed wall there” pointed “might could tell seek mance rayder mind” brown smile “but we’ll time enough you’ll wanting sleep beneath roof belike eat pigs”

 “then you’ll guest night longer i’m fond o’ crows loft’s mine you’ll floor like i’ve meat beer twenty rest o’ black crows peck corn”

 “we’ve packed supplies lord” said old bear “we pleased share food wine”

 craster wiped drooping mouth back hairy hand “i’ll taste wine lord crow one thing man lays hand wives loses hand”

 “your roof rule” said thoren smallwood lord mormont nodded stiffly though looked none pleased

 “that’s settled then” craster grudged grunt “d’ya man draw map”

 “sam tarly can” jon pushed forward “sam loves maps”

 mormont beckoned closer “send he’s eaten bring quill parchment find tollett well tell bring axe guest gift host”

 “who’s one now” craster said jon could go “he look stark”

 “my steward squire jon snow”

 “a bastard it” craster looked jon “man wants bed woman seems like ought take wife that’s do” shooed jon wave “well run service bastard see axe good sharp i’ve use dull steel”

 jon snow bowed stiffly took leave ser ottyn wythers coming leaving almost collided deerhide door outside rain seemed slackened tents gone compound jon could see tops others trees

 dolorous edd feeding horses “give wildling axe not” pointed mormont’s weapon shorthafted battleaxe gold scrollwork inlaid black steel blade “he’ll give back vow buried old bear’s skull like give axes swords well mislike way clank rattle ride we’d travel faster without straight hell’s door rain hell wonder perhaps craster would like nice hat instead”

 jon smiled “he wants axe wine well”

 “see old bear’s clever get wildling well truly drunk perhaps he’ll cut ear tries slay us axe two ears one head”

 “smallwood says craster friend watch”

 “do know difference wildling who’s friend watch one who’s not” asked dour squire “our enemies leave bodies crows wolves friends bury us secret graves wonder long bear’s nailed gate craster came hallooing” edd looked axe doubtfully rain running long face “is dry there”

 “drier here”

 “if lurk close fire belike they’ll take note till morn ones roof first murders least we’ll die dry”

 jon laugh “craster’s one man we’re two hundred doubt he’ll murder anyone”

 “you cheer me” said edd sounding utterly morose “and besides there’s much said good sharp axe i’d hate murdered maul saw man hit brow maul scarce split skin head turned mushy swelled big gourd purplyred comely man died ugly it’s good we’re giving mauls” edd walked away shaking head sodden black cloak shedding rain behind

 jon got horses fed stopped think supper wondering find sam heard shout fear “wolf” sprinted around hall toward cry earth sucking boots one craster’s women backed mudspattered wall keep “keep away” shouting ghost “you keep away” direwolf rabbit mouth another dead bloody ground “get away m’lord” pleaded saw

 “bastard winterfell brother kings” mocked chett who’d left hounds see commotion

 “that wolf’s looking hungry girl” lark said “might fancies tender bit belly”

 jon amused “you’re scaring her”

 “warning like” chett’s grin ugly boils covered face

 “we’re talk you” girl remembered suddenly

 “wait” jon said late bolted ran

 lark made grab second rabbit ghost quicker bared teeth sisterman slipped mud went bony butt others laughed direwolf took rabbit mouth brought jon

 “i’ll fight brother we’re beyond wall” jon answered voice cooler felt

 lark got one knee “he’s afraid chett sisters name like him”

 “i know names save breath” walked away ghost side rain dwindled thin drizzle time reached gate dusk would soon followed another wet dark dismal night clouds would hide moon stars mormont’s torch turning woods black pitch every piss would adventure quite sort jon snow envisioned

 “it looks snug know sam is”

 “keep way come ser ottyn’s pavilion you’ve gone far” giant smiled “unless sam’s found tree tree would be”

 “take boots dry stockings i’ll find dry wood ground’s wet rock might able get fire burning” jon showed sam rabbit “and we’ll feast”

 “won’t attending lord mormont hall”

 “no old bear wants map craster says he’ll find mance rayder us”

 “oh” sam look anxious meet craster even meant warm fire

 “he said eat first though dry feet” jon went gather fuel digging deadfalls drier wood beneath peeling back layers sodden pine needles found likely kindling even seemed take forever spark catch hung cloak rock keep rain smoky little fire making small snug alcove

 jon spitted carcass banked fire pair rocks balanced meal atop rabbit scrawny thing cooked smelled like king’s feast rangers gave envious looks even ghost looked hungrily flames shining red eyes sniffed “you before” jon reminded

 “is craster savage rangers say” sam asked rabbit shade underdone tasted wonderful “what’s castle like”

 magic beyond wall found thinking sisters perhaps he’d dreamed last night sansa would call enchantment tears would fill eyes wonder arya would run laughing shouting wanting touch

 “lord snow” heard soft meek turned

 crouched atop rock sheltered night rabbit keeper wrapped black cloak large drowned sam’s cloak jon realized wearing sam’s cloak “the fat one told i’d find m’lord” said

 “we ate rabbit that’s came for” admission made feel absurdly guilty

 “old lord crow talking bird gave craster crossbow worth hundred rabbits” arms closed swell belly “is true m’lord brother king”

 “a half brother” admitted “i’m ned stark’s bastard brother robb king north here”

 “the fat one sam said see give cloak one would say didn’t belong”

 asks thought nothing

 “i’ll… i’ll wife like father he’s got nineteen one less won’t hurt none”

 “black brothers sworn never take wives don’t know we’re guests father’s hall besides”

 “not you” said “i watched never ate board slept fire never gave guestright you’re bound it’s baby go”

 “i don’t even know name”

 “gilly called gillyflower”

 “that’s pretty” remembered sansa telling say whenever lady told name could help girl perhaps courtesy would please “is craster frightens gilly”

 “for baby it’s girl that’s bad she’ll grow years he’ll marry nella says it’s boy she’s six knows things gives boys gods come white cold late comes often that’s started giving sheep even though taste mutton sheep’s gone next dogs till…” lowered eyes stroked belly

 “what gods” jon remembering they’d seen boys craster’s keep men either save craster

 “the cold gods” said “the ones night white shadows”

 suddenly jon back lord commander’s tower severed hand climbing calf pried point longsword lay writhing fingers opening closing dead man rose feet blue eyes shining gashed swollen face ropes torn flesh hung great wound belly yet blood

 fear plain face “you come back though warring’s done you’ll pass way again”

 “we may” us still live “that’s old bear say one call lord crow i’m squire choose road ride”

 “no” could hear defeat voice “sorry trouble m’lord only… said king keeps people safe thought…” despairing ran sam’s cloak flapping behind like great black wings

 “you not” grenn said scowling “i would seen”

 dywen whapped alongside ear back hand “you seen you’re blind maester aemon never even saw bear”

 “what bear bear”

 “there’s always bear” declared dolorous edd usual tone gloomy resignation “one killed brother young afterward wore teeth around neck leather thong good teeth better mine i’ve nothing trouble teeth”

 “did sam sleep hall last night” jon asked

 “i’d call sleeping ground hard rushes illsmelling brothers snore frightfully speak bears none ever growled fierce brown bernarr warm though dogs crawled atop night cloak almost dry one pissed perhaps brown bernarr noticed rain stopped instant roof start i’m back gods dogs alike delight piss me”

 “cold rain stopped”

 “very good see horse saddled ready mean us ride within hour eaten craster serves plain fare filling”

 found sam behind hall standing gilly broken rabbit hutch helping back cloak saw jon stole away sam gave look wounded reproach “i thought would help her”

 “and that” jon said sharply “take us wrapped cloak commanded to—”

 “i know” said sam guiltily “but afraid know afraid told her…” swallowed

 “what we’d take us”

 sam’s fat face blushed deep red “on way home” could meet jon’s eyes “she’s going baby”

 “sam taken leave sense may even return way think old bear going let pack one craster’s wives”

 “i thought… maybe could think way…”

 “i time horses groom saddle” jon walked away confused angry sam’s heart big rest reading could thick grenn times impossible dishonorable besides feel ashamed

 “my lord” jon said quietly wood closed around “craster sheep sons”

 mormont made answer

 “at winterfell one serving women told us stories” jon went “she used say wildlings would lay others birth halfhuman children”

 “hearth tales craster seem less human you”

 half hundred ways “he gives sons wood”

 long silence “yes” “yes” raven muttered strutting “yes yes yes”

 “you knew”

 “smallwood told long ago rangers know though talk it”

 “did uncle know”

 “all rangers” mormont repeated “you think ought stop kill need be” old bear sighed “were wished rid mouths i’d gladly send yoren conwys collect boys could raise black watch would much stronger wildlings serve crueler gods boys craster’s offerings prayers will”

 wives must offer different prayers jon thought

 “how came know this” old bear asked “from one craster’s wives”

 “yes lord” jon confessed “i would sooner tell frightened wanted help”

 “the wide world full people wanting help jon would could find courage help craster sprawls loft even stinking wine lost sense board lies sharp new axe i’d name ‘answered prayer’ make end”

 yes jon thought gilly sisters nineteen craster one but…

 “yet would ill day us craster died uncle could tell times craster’s keep made difference life death rangers”

 “my father…” hesitated

 “go jon say would say”

 “my father told men worth having” jon finished “a bannerman brutal unjust dishonors liege lord well himself”

 “craster man sworn us vows subject laws heart noble jon learn lesson cannot set world rights purpose night’s watch wars fight”

 wars yes must remember “jarman buckwell said might need sword soon”

 “did he” mormont seem pleased “craster said much last night confirmed enough fears condemn sleepless night floor mance rayder gathering people together frostfangs that’s villages empty tale ser denys mallister wildling men captured gorge craster added makes difference”

 “is making city army”

 “now question many wildlings many men fighting age one knows certainty frostfangs cruel inhospitable wilderness stone ice long sustain great number people see one purpose gathering mance rayder means strike south seven kingdoms”

 “wildlings invaded realm before” jon heard tales old nan maester luwin back winterfell “raymun redbeard led south time grandfather’s grandfather king named bael bard”

 “aye long came horned lord brother kings gendel gorne ancient days joramun blew horn winter woke giants earth man broke strength wall broken power winterfell far side… night’s watch shadow remains oppose wildlings besides us lord winterfell dead heir marched strength south fight lannisters wildlings may never chance knew mance rayder jon oathbreaker yes… eyes see man ever dared name faintheart”

 boy ridden scrawny little garron lord balon’s stable theon’s mount quite another sort beast “where find hellhorse” esgred asked saw way laughed knew impressed

 “lord botley bought lannisport year past proved much horse botley pleased sell” iron islands sparse rocky breeding good horses islanders indifferent riders best comfortable deck longship saddle even lords rode garrons shaggy harlaw ponies ox carts common drays smallfolk poor either one pulled plows thin stony soil

 theon spent ten years winterfell intend go war without good mount beneath lord botley’s misjudgment good fortune stallion temper black hide larger courser quite big destriers theon quite big knights suited admirably animal fire eyes he’d met new owner he’d pulled back lips tried bite face

 “my brothers long dead sister… well say asha’s favorite gown chainmail hauberk hangs past knees boiled leather smallclothes beneath men’s garb won’t make man though i’ll make good marriage alliance we’ve war find man take recall nose like vulture’s beak ripe crop pimples chest boy”

 “you marry sister” esgred observed “but uncles”

 “my uncles…” theon’s claim took precedence father’s three brothers woman touched sore point nonetheless islands scarce unheard strong ambitious uncle dispossess weak nephew rights usually murder bargain weak theon told mean stronger yet time father dies “my uncles pose threat me” declared “aeron drunk seawater sanctity lives god—”

 “his god yours”

 “mine well dead never die” smiled thinly “if make pious noises required damphair give trouble uncle victarion—”

 “lord captain iron fleet fearsome warrior heard sing alehouses”

 “during lord father’s rebellion sailed lannisport uncle euron burned lannister fleet lay anchor” theon recalled “the plan euron’s though victarion like great grey bullock strong tireless dutiful like win races doubt he’ll serve loyally served lord father neither wits ambition plot betrayal”

 “euron croweye lack cunning though i’ve heard men say terrible things one”

 theon shifted seat “my uncle euron seen islands close two years may dead” might best lord balon’s eldest brother never given old way even day silence black sails dark red hull infamous every port ibben asshai said

 “what shall wear great feast” reached back pushed face away

 “i’ll ask helya garb one lady mother’s gowns might harlaw expected return”

 “the cold winds worn away hear go see harlaw day’s sail surely lady greyjoy yearns last sight son”

 “would could kept busy father relies returned come peace perhaps…”

 “your coming might bring peace”

 “now sound woman” theon complained

 “i confess am… new child”

 somehow thought excited “so say body shows signs shall proven believe shall need see breasts grow ripe taste mother’s milk”

 “and husband say father’s sworn man servant”

 “we’ll give many ships build he’ll never know you’ve left him”

 laughed “it’s cruel lordling who’s seized promise one day may watch babe get suck tell war theon house greyjoy miles mountains still ahead us would hear wolf king served golden lions fights”

 lout paid mind face broke huge gaptoothed smile said “lady asha you’re back”

 “last night” said “i sailed great wyk lord goodbrother spent night inn little brother kind enough let ride lordsport” kissed one dogs nose grinned theon

 could stand gape asha cannot asha realized suddenly two ashas head one little girl known vaguely imagined looked something like mother neither looked bit like this… this… this…

 “the pimples went breasts came” explained tussled dog “but kept vulture’s beak”

 theon found voice “why didn’t tell me”

 asha let go hound straightened “i wanted see first did” gave mocking half bow “and little brother pray excuse need bathe dress feast wonder still chainmail gown like wear boiled leather smallclothes” gave evil grin crossed bridge walk he’d liked well half saunter half sway

 “i ask pardon” theon took empty seat beside asha leaning close hissed ear “you’re place”

 turned innocent eyes “brother surely mistaken place winterfell” smile cut “and pretty clothes heard fancied silk velvet skin” soft green wool simply cut fabric clinging slender lines body

 “your hauberk must rusted away sister” threw back “a great pity i’d like see iron”

 asha laughed “you may yet little brother… think sea bitch keep black wind” one father’s thralls came near bearing flagon wine “are drinking ale wine tonight theon” leaned close “or still taste mother’s milk thirst for”

 flushed “wine” told thrall asha turned away banged table shouting ale

 theon hacked loaf bread half hollowed trencher summoned cook fill fish stew smell thick cream made little ill forced eat he’d drunk enough wine float two meals retch “does father know you’ve married shipwright” asked sister

 “no sigrin does” gave shrug “esgred first ship built named mother would hardpressed say loves best”

 “every word spoke lie”

 “not every word remember told like top” asha grinned

 made angrier “all woman wed new child…”

 “oh part true enough” asha leapt feet “rolfe here” shouted one finger dancers holding hand saw spun suddenly axe came flying hand blade gleaming tumbled end end torchlight theon time choked gasp asha snatched axe air slammed table splitting trencher two splattering mantle drippings “there’s lord husband” sister reached inside gown drew dirk breasts “and here’s sweet suckling babe”

 “my little brother rush off” asha raised drinking horn beckoned ale

 “our lord father waiting”

 “and many year harm wait little longer… fear wrath scurry means ought trouble catching uncles” smiled “one drunk seawater great grey bullock dim he’ll probably get lost”

 theon sat back annoyed “i run man”

 “no man every woman”

 “it grabbed cock”

 “i don’t one remember grabbed every bit quick enough”

 “only shy maid” asha’s hand darted table give cock squeeze theon nearly jumped chair “what don’t want steer port brother”

 “marriage you” theon decided “when rule believe pack silent sisters” lurched feet strode unsteadily find father

 rain falling time reached swaying bridge sea tower stomach crashing churning like waves wine unsteadied feet theon gritted teeth gripped rope tightly made way across pretending asha’s neck clutching

 solar damp drafty ever buried sealskin robes father sat brazier brothers either side victarion talking tides winds theon entered lord balon waved silent “i made plans time heard them”

 “i suggestions—”

 “when require counsel shall ask it” father said “we bird old wyk dagmer bringing drumms stonehouses god grants us good winds sail arrive… mean strike first blow theon shall take eight longships north—”

 “eight” face reddened “what hope accomplish eight longships”

 “you harry stony shore raiding fishing villages sinking ships chance meet may draw northern lords behind stone walls aeron accompany dagmer cleftjaw”

 “may drowned god bless swords” priest said

 theon felt he’d slapped sent reaver’s work burning fishermen hovels raping ugly daughters yet seemed lord balon trust sufficiently even much bad enough suffer damphair’s scowls chidings dagmer cleftjaw along well command would purely nominal

 “asha daughter” lord balon went theon turned see sister slipped silently “you shall take thirty longships picked men round sea dragon point land upon tidal flats north deepwood motte march quickly castle may fall even know upon them”

 asha smiled like cat cream “i’ve always wanted castle” said sweetly

 “then take one”

 theon bite tongue deepwood motte stronghold glovers robett galbart warring south would lightly held castle fell ironmen would secure base heart north one sent take deepwood knew deepwood motte visited glovers several times eddard stark

 aeron damphair raised arms “and waters wrath rise high drowned god spread dominion across green lands”

 “what dead never die” victarion intoned lord balon asha echoed words theon choice mumble along done

 “not recall” tyrion admitted “it grieves disturb revels lancel happens matters import discuss sister”

 cersei regarded suspiciously “if begging brothers tyrion spare reproaches won’t spreading filthy treasons streets preach dungeons”

 “and count lucky gentle queen” added lancel “i would tongues out”

 “one even dared say gods punishing us jaime murdered rightful king” cersei declared “it borne tyrion gave ample opportunity deal lice ser jacelyn nothing commanded vylarr attend matter”

 “and did” tyrion annoyed red cloaks dragged half dozen scabrous prophets dungeons without consulting important enough battle “no doubt better little quiet streets came tidings know anxious hear sweet sister best spoken privily”

 “very well” harpist piper bowed hurried cersei kissed cousin chastely cheek “leave us lancel brother’s harmless he’s alone he’d brought pets we’d smell them”

 young knight gave cousin baleful glance pulled door shut forcefully behind “i’ll know make shagga bathe fortnight” tyrion said gone

 “you’re pleased aren’t why”

 “why not” tyrion said every day every night hammers rang along street steel great chain grew longer hopped onto great canopied bed “is bed robert died i’m surprised kept it”

 “it gives sweet dreams” said “now spit business waddle away imp”

 tyrion smiled “lord stannis sailed dragonstone”

 cersei bolted feet “and yet sit grinning like harvestday pumpkin bywater called city watch must send bird harrenhal once” laughing seized shoulders shook “stop mad drunk stop it”

 tyrion threw back head roared laughed together cersei pulled bed whirled around even hugged moment giddy girl time let go tyrion breathless dizzy staggered sideboard put hand steady

 “do think truly come battle come accord—”

 “they won’t” tyrion said “they different yet much alike neither could ever stomach other”

 “and stannis always felt cheated storm’s end” cersei said thoughtfully “the ancestral seat house baratheon rights… knew many times came robert singing dull song gloomy aggrieved tone robert gave place renly stannis clenched jaw tight thought teeth would shatter”

 “he took slight”

 “it meant slight” cersei said

 “shall raise cup brotherly love”

 “yes” answered breathless “oh gods yes”

 back filled two cups sweet arbor red easiest thing world sprinkle pinch fine powder “to stannis” said handed wine harmless i’m alone

 “to renly” replied laughing “may battle long hard others take both”

 “ser cleos” littlefinger said council table “you thanks bringing us peace offer lord stark”

 grand maester pycelle cleared throat “the queen regent king’s hand small council considered terms offered selfstyled king north sad say must tell northmen ser”

 “here terms” said tyrion “robb stark must lay sword swear fealty return winterfell must free brother unharmed place host jaime’s command march rebels renly stannis baratheon stark’s bannermen must send us son hostage daughter suffice son shall treated gently given high places court long fathers commit new treasons”

 “lord stark asked sisters father’s sword well” ser cleos reminded

 “as say sisters”

 tyrion glanced toward sansa felt stab pity said “until time frees brother jaime unharmed shall remain hostages well treated depends him” gods good bywater find arya alive robb learns she’s gone missing

 “i shall bring message lord”

 tyrion plucked one twisted blades sprang arm throne thrust “vylarr” called

 “my lord”

 “the men stark sent sufficient protect lord eddard’s bones lannister lannister escort” tyrion declared “ser cleos queen’s cousin mine shall sleep easily would see safely back riverrun”

 “as command many men take”

 “why them”

 vylarr stood like man made stone grand maester pycelle rose gasping “my lord hand cannot… father lord tywin sent good men city protect queen cersei children…”

 “the kingsguard city watch protect well enough gods speed way vylarr”

 council table varys smiled knowingly littlefinger sat feigning boredom pycelle gaped like fish pale confused herald stepped forward “if man matters set king’s hand let speak go forth hold silence”

 “i heard” slender man black pushed way redwyne twins

 “ser alliser” tyrion exclaimed “why notion you’d come court sent word”

 “i well know” thorne prickly name spare sharpfeatured man fifty hardeyed hardhanded black hair streaked grey “i shunned ignored left wait like baseborn servant”

 “truly bronn well done ser alliser old friends walked wall together”

 “sweet ser alliser” murmured varys “you must think harshly us many seek joffrey’s grace troubled tumultuous times”

 “more troubled know eunuch”

 “to face call lord eunuch” quipped littlefinger

 “how may help good brother” grand maester pycelle asked soothing tones

 “the lord commander sent grace king” thorne answered “the matter grave left servants”

 “the king playing new crossbow” tyrion said ridding joffrey required ungainly myrish crossbow threw three quarrels time nothing would try “you speak servants hold silence”

 “as will” ser alliser said displeasure every word “i sent tell found two rangers long missing dead yet brought corpses back wall rose night one slew ser jaremy rykker second tried murder lord commander”

 distantly tyrion heard someone snigger mean mock folly shifted uneasily glanced varys littlefinger pycelle wondering one role dwarf enjoyed best tenuous hold dignity court kingdom started laugh doomed yet… yet…

 tyrion remembered cold night stars he’d stood beside boy jon snow great white wolf atop wall end world gazing trackless dark beyond felt—what—something sure dread cut like frigid northern wind wolf howled night sound sent shiver

 don’t fool told wolf wind dark forest meant nothing yet… come liking old jeor mormont time castle black “i trust old bear survived attack”

 “he did”

 “and brothers killed ah dead men”

 “we did”

 “you’re certain dead time” tyrion asked mildly bronn choked snort laughter knew must proceed “truly truly dead”

 “they dead first time” ser alliser snapped “pale cold black hands feet brought jared’s hand torn corpse bastard’s wolf”

 littlefinger stirred “and charming token”

 ser alliser frowned uncomfortably “it… rotted pieces waited unheard there’s naught left show bones”

 titters echoed hall “lord baelish” tyrion called littlefinger “buy brave ser alliser hundred spades take back wall him”

 “spades” ser alliser narrowed eyes suspiciously

 “if bury dead won’t come walking” tyrion told court laughed openly “spades end troubles strong backs wield ser jacelyn see good brother pick city dungeons”

 ser jacelyn bywater said “as lord cells near empty yoren took likely men”

 “arrest then” tyrion told “or spread word there’s bread turnips wall they’ll go accord” city many mouths feed night’s watch perpetual need men tyrion’s signal herald cried end hall began empty

 “the cold winds rising wall must held”

 “and hold need men i’ve given you… might noted ears heard anything insults take thank begone i’m forced take crab fork give warm regards lord mormont… jon snow well” bronn seized ser alliser elbow marched forcefully hall

 grand maester pycelle already scuttled varys littlefinger watched start finish “i grow ever admiring lord” confessed eunuch “you appease stark boy father’s bones strip sister protectors one swift stroke give black brother men seeks rid city hungry mouths yet make seem mockery none may say dwarf fears snarks grumkins oh deftly done”

 littlefinger stroked beard “do truly mean send away guards lannister”

 “no mean send away sister’s guards”

 “the queen never allow that”

 “oh think may brother you’ve known longer you’ll learn mean everything say”

 “even lies”

 “especially lies lord petyr sense unhappy me”

 “i love much ever lord though relish played fool myrcella weds trystane martell scarcely wed robert arryn she”

 “not without causing great scandal” admitted “i regret little ruse lord petyr spoke could know dornishmen would accept offer”

 littlefinger appeased “i like lied lord leave next deception”

 you’ll tyrion thought glancing dagger sheathed littlefinger’s hip “if given offense deeply sorry men know much love lord much need you”

 “try remember that” littlefinger left

 “walk varys” said tyrion left king’s door behind throne eunuch’s slippers whisking lightly stone

 “lord baelish truth know queen never permit send away guard”

 “she you’ll see that”

 smile flickered across varys’s plump lips “will i”

 “oh certainty you’ll tell part scheme free jaime”

 varys stroked powdered cheek “this would doubtless involve four men man bronn searched diligently low places king’s landing thief poisoner mummer murderer”

 “put crimson cloaks lion helms they’ll look different guardsmen searched time ruse might get riverrun thought hide plain sight they’ll ride main gate flying lannister banners escorting lord eddard’s bones” smiled crookedly “four men alone would watched vigilantly four among hundred lose must send true guardsmen well false… you’ll tell sister”

 “hodor stand still” bran grasped wall sconce hands used pull basket hung moment arms hodor carried chair “meera says brother greensight”

 maester luwin scratched side nose writing quill “does now”

 nodded “you told children forest greensight remember”

 “some claimed power wise men called greenseers”

 “was magic”

 “call want better word must heart different sort knowledge”

 “what it”

 luwin set quill “no one truly knows bran children gone world wisdom faces trees think first men believed greenseers could see eyes weirwoods cut trees whenever warred upon children supposedly greenseers also power beasts wood birds trees even fish reed boy claim powers”

 “no don’t think dreams come true sometimes meera says”

 “all us dreams come true sometimes dreamed lord father crypts knew dead remember”

 “rickon dreamed dream”

 “call greensight wish… remember well tens thousands dreams rickon dreamed come true perchance recall taught chain collar every maester wears”

 bran thought moment trying remember “a maester forges chain citadel oldtown it’s chain swear serve it’s made different metals serve realm realm different sorts people every time learn something get another link black iron ravenry silver healing gold sums numbers don’t remember all”

 luwin slid finger collar began turn inch inch thick neck small man chain tight pulls way around “this valyrian steel” said link dark grey metal lay apple throat “only one maester hundred wears link signifies studied citadel calls higher mysteries—magic want better word fascinating pursuit small use maesters trouble

 “all study higher mysteries try hand spells soon late yielded temptation must confess well boy boy secretly wish find hidden powers got efforts thousand boys thousand since sad say magic work”

 “sometimes does” bran protested “i dream rickon mages warlocks east…”

 “or perhaps maester wrong”

 “he isn’t even father relied counsel”

 “the walders aren’t brothers”

 paid heed “you sitting supper instead servant maester luwin brought food served king’s cut roast meat rare bloody savory smell made everyone’s mouth water meat served freys old grey dead yet liked supper better liked yours”

 “i don’t understand”

 tyrion

 rushes scratchy soles bare feet “my cousin chooses queer hour come visiting” tyrion told sleepbefuddled podrick payne who’d doubtless expected well roasted waking “see solar tell i’ll shortly”

 well past midnight judged black outside window lancel think find drowsy slow wit hour wondered lancel scarce thinks cersei’s sister would disappointed even abed worked well morning—reading flickering light candle scrutinizing reports varys’s whisperers poring littlefinger’s books accounts columns blurred eyes ached

 splashed tepid water face basin beside bed took time squatting garderobe night air cold bare skin ser lancel sixteen known patience let wait grow anxious waiting bowels empty tyrion slipped bedrobe roughed thin flaxen hair fingers look wakened sleep

 lancel pacing ashes hearth garbed slashed red velvet black silk undersleeves jeweled dagger gilded scabbard hanging swordbelt “cousin” tyrion greeted “your visits owe undeserved pleasure”

 “her grace queen regent sent command release grand maester pycelle” ser lancel showed tyrion crimson ribbon bearing cersei’s lion seal impressed golden wax “here warrant”

 “so is” tyrion waved away “i hope sister overtaxing strength soon illness would great pity suffer relapse”

 “her grace quite recovered” ser lancel said curtly

 “music ears” though tune i’m fond given larger dose tyrion hoped days without cersei’s interference terribly surprised return health jaime’s twin made smile pleasantly “pod build us fire air chilly taste take cup lancel find mulled wine helps sleep”

 “i need help sleeping” ser lancel said “i come grace’s behest drink imp”

 knighthood made boy bolder tyrion reflected—that sorry part played murdering king robert “wine dangers” smiled poured “as grand maester pycelle… sweet sister concerned would thought she’d come instead sends make that”

 “make long release prisoner grand maester staunch friend queen regent personal protection” hint sneer played lad’s lips enjoying takes lessons cersei “her grace never consent outrage reminds joffrey’s regent”

 “as joffrey’s hand”

 “the hand serves” young knight informed airily “the regent rules king age”

 “perhaps ought write i’ll remember better” fire crackling merrily “you may leave us pod” tyrion told squire boy gone turn back lancel “there more”

 “yes grace bids inform ser jacelyn bywater defied command issued king’s name”

 means cersei already ordered bywater release pycelle rebuffed “i see”

 “she insists man removed office placed arrest treason warn you—”

 set aside wine cup “i’ll hear warnings boy”

 “ser” lancel said stiffly touched sword perhaps remind tyrion wore one “have care speak imp” doubtless meant sound threatening absurd wisp mustache ruined effect

 “oh unhand sword one cry shagga burst kill axe wineskin”

 lancel reddened fool believe part robert’s death gone unnoted “i knight—”

 “so i’ve noted tell me—did cersei knighted took bed”

 flicker lancel’s green eyes admission tyrion needed varys told true well one ever claim sister love family “what nothing say warnings ser”

 “you withdraw filthy accusations or—”

 “please given thought joffrey tell murdered father bed mother”

 “it like that” lancel protested horrified

 “no like pray”

 “the queen gave strongwine father lord tywin named king’s squire told obey everything”

 “did tell fuck too” look quite tall features fine hair sand instead spun gold yet still… even poor copy jaime sweeter empty bed suppose “no thought not”

 “i never meant… bid i…”

 “…hated every instant would believe high place court knighthood sister’s legs opening night oh yes must terrible you” tyrion pushed feet “wait grace want hear this”

 defiance went lancel young knight fell knees frightened boy “mercy lord beg you”

 “save joffrey likes good beg”

 “my lord sister’s bidding queen said grace… he’d never understand…”

 “would keep truth king”

 “for father’s sake i’ll leave city never happened swear end it…”

 hard laugh “i think not”

 lad looked lost “my lord”

 “you heard father told obey sister well obey stay close side keep trust pleasure often requires one need ever know… long keep faith want know cersei goes sees talk plans hatching one tell won’t you”

 “yes lord” lancel spoke without moment’s hesitation tyrion liked “i swear command”

 “rise” tyrion filled second cup pressed “drink understanding promise boars castle know of” lancel lifted cup drank albeit stiffly “smile cousin sister beautiful woman it’s good realm could well knighthood nothing you’re clever you’ll lordship you’re done” tyrion swirled wine cup “we want cersei every faith go back tell beg forgiveness tell frightened want conflict us henceforth shall nothing without consent”

 “but… demands…”

 “oh i’ll give pycelle”

 “you will” lancel seemed astonished

 tyrion smiled “i’ll release morrow could swear hadn’t harmed hair head wouldn’t strictly true case he’s well enough though won’t vouch vigor black cells healthy place man age cersei keep pet send wall don’t care won’t council”

 “and ser jacelyn”

 “tell sister believe win away given time ought content while”

 “as say” lancel finished wine

 “one last thing king robert dead would embarrassing grieving widow suddenly grow great child”

 “my lord i… we… queen commanded to…” ears turned lannister crimson “i spill seed belly lord”

 “a lovely belly doubt moisten often wish… see dew falls nowhere else want nephews clear”

 ser lancel made stiff bow took leave

 tyrion allowed moment feel sorry boy another fool weakling well deserve cersei kindness uncle kevan two sons one unlikely live year cersei would killed hand learned betraying grace gods lancel would never survive day jaime lannister returned king’s landing question would whether jaime cut jealous rage cersei murdered first keep jaime finding tyrion’s silver cersei

 restlessness tyrion knew full well would get back sleep tonight case found podrick payne asleep chair outside door solar shook shoulder “summon bronn run stables two horses saddled”

 squire’s eyes cloudy sleep “horses”

 “those big brown animals love apples i’m sure you’ve seen four legs tail bronn first”

 sellsword long appearing “who pissed soup” demanded

 “cersei ever you’d think i’d used taste never mind gentle sister seems mistaken ned stark”

 “i hear taller”

 “not joff took head ought dressed warmly night chill”

 “are going somewhere”

 “are sellswords clever you”

 city streets dangerous bronn beside tyrion felt safe enough guards let postern gate north wall rode shadowblack lane foot aegon’s high hill thence onto pigrun alley past rows shuttered windows tall timberandstone buildings whose upper stories leaned far street almost kissed moon seemed follow went playing peekandsneak among chimneys encountered one lone old crone carrying dead cat tail gave fearful look afraid might try steal dinner slunk shadows without word

 tyrion reflected men hand proved match sister’s wiles could men like that… honest live noble shit cersei devours fools every morning breaks fast way defeat sister play game something lords stark arryn would never small wonder dead tyrion lannister never felt alive stunted legs might make comic grotesque harvest ball dance knew

 despite hour brothel crowded chataya greeted pleasantly escorted common room bronn went upstairs darkeyed girl dorne alayaya busy entertaining “she pleased know you’ve come” said chataya “i see turret room made ready lord take cup wine waits”

 “i will” said

 wine poor stuff compared vintages arbor house normally served “you must forgive us lord” chataya said “i cannot find good wine price late”

 “you alone fear”

 chataya commiserated moment excused glided handsome woman tyrion reflected watched go seldom seen elegance dignity whore though sure saw kind priestess perhaps secret much somehow thought comforted

 patrons giving sideways looks last time ventured man spit him… well tried instead he’d spit bronn future would spitting without teeth

 “is milord feeling unloved” dancy slid lap nibbled ear “i cure that”

 smiling tyrion shook head “you beautiful words sweetling i’ve grown fond alayaya’s remedy”

 “you’ve never tried mine milord never chooses anyone ’yaya she’s good i’m better don’t want see”

 “next time perhaps” tyrion doubt dancy would lively handful pugnosed bouncy freckles mane thick red hair tumbled past waist shae waiting manse

 “dancy” alayaya stood doorway dark cool gauzy green silk “his lordship come visit me”

 tyrion gently disentangled girl stood dancy seem mind “next time” reminded put finger mouth sucked

 blackskinned girl led stairs said “poor dancy fortnight get lord choose elsewise loses black pearls marei”

 marei cool pale delicate girl tyrion noticed twice green eyes porcelain skin long straight silvery hair lovely solemn half “i’d hate poor child lose pearls account me”

 “then take upstairs next time”

 “maybe will”

 smiled “i think lord”

 she’s right tyrion thought won’t shae may whore faithful fashion

 turret room opened door wardrobe looked alayaya curiously “what i’m gone”

 raised arms stretched like sleek black cat “sleep much better rested since began visit us lord marei teaching us read perhaps soon able pass time book”

 “sleep good” said “and books better” gave quick kiss cheek shaft tunnel

 arya

 whatever names harren black meant give towers long forgotten called tower dread widow’s tower wailing tower tower ghosts kingspyre tower arya slept shallow niche cavernous vaults beneath wailing tower bed straw water wash whenever liked chunk soap work hard harder walking miles every day weasel need find worms bugs eat arry bread every day barley stews bits carrot turnip fortnight even bite meat

 hot pie ate even better belonged kitchens round stone building domed roof world unto arya took meals trestle table undercroft weese charges sometimes would chosen help fetch food hot pie could steal moment talk could never remember weasel kept calling arry even though knew girl tried slip hot apple tart made clumsy job two cooks saw took tart away beat big wooden spoon

 gendry sent forge arya seldom saw served even want know names made hurt worse died older content let alone

 harrenhal vast much far gone decay lady whent held castle bannerman house tully she’d used lower thirds two five towers let rest go ruin fled small household she’d left could begin tend needs knights lords highborn prisoners lord tywin brought lannisters must forage servants well plunder provender talk lord tywin planned restore harrenhal glory make new seat war done

 took three days earn place honor nightly prayers “weese” would whisper first “dunsen chiswyck polliver raff sweetling tickler hound ser gregor ser amory ser ilyn ser meryn king joffrey queen cersei” let forget even one would ever find kill

 road arya felt like sheep harrenbal turned mouse grey mouse scratchy wool shift like mouse kept crannies crevices dark holes castle scurrying way mighty

 sometimes thought mice within thick walls even knights great lords size castle made even gregor clegane seem small harrenhal covered thrice much ground winterfell buildings much larger could scarcely compared stables housed thousand horses godswood covered twenty acres kitchens large winterfell’s great hall great hall grandly named hall hundred hearths even though thirty arya tried count twice came thirtythree thirtyfive time cavernous lord tywin could feasted entire host though never walls doors halls steps everything built inhuman scale made arya remember stories old nan used tell giants lived beyond wall

 king robert’s brothers stannis renly joined fighting heard “and kings now” weese said “realm’s got kings castle’s got rats” even lannister men questioned long joffrey would hold iron throne “the lad’s got army gold cloaks he’s ruled eunuch dwarf woman” heard lordling mutter cups “what good likes comes battle” always talk beric dondarrion fat archer said bloody mummers slain others laughed “lorch killed man rushing falls mountain’s slain twice got silver stag says don’t stay dead time neither”

 arya know bloody mummers fortnight later queerest company men she’d ever seen arrived harrenhal beneath standard black goat bloody horns rode copper men bells braids lancers astride striped blackandwhite horses bowmen powdered cheeks squat hairy men shaggy shields brownskinned men feathered cloaks wispy fool greenandpink motley swordsmen fantastic forked beards dyed green purple silver spearmen colored scars covered cheeks slender man septon’s robes fatherly one maester’s grey sickly one whose leather cloak fringed long blond hair

 “you don’t want know lot weasel” weese said saw looking goathelmed man two drinking friends menatarms service lord lefford

 “who they” asked

 one soldiers laughed “the footmen girl toes goat lord tywin’s bloody mummers”

 “pease wits get flayed scrub bloody steps” said weese “they’re sellswords weasel girl call brave companions don’t use names hear they’ll hurt bad goathelm’s captain lord vargo hoat”

 “he’s fucking lord” said second soldier “i heard ser amory say he’s sellsword mouth full slobber high opinion hisself”

 “aye” said weese “but better call lord wants keep parts”

 arya looked vargo hoat many monsters lord tywin

 brave companions housed widow’s tower arya need serve glad night arrived fighting broke sellswords lannister men ser harys swyft’s squire stabbed death two bloody mummers wounded next morning lord tywin hanged gatehouse walls along one lord lydden’s archers weese said archer started trouble taunting sellswords beric dondarrion hanged men stopped kicking vargo hoat ser harys embraced kissed swore love always lord tywin looked arya thought funny way vargo hoat lisped slobbered knew better laugh

 bloody mummers linger long harrenhal rode arya heard one saying northern army roose bolton occupied ruby ford trident “if crosses lord tywin smash like green fork” lannister bowmen said fellows jeered “bolton’ll never cross till young wolf marches riverrun wild northmen wolves”

 arya known brother near riverrun much closer winterfell though certain lay relation harrenhal could find somehow know could could get away thought seeing robb’s face arya bite lip want see jon bran rickon mother even sansa… i’ll kiss beg pardons like proper lady she’ll like

 courtyard talk she’d learned upper chambers tower dread housed three dozen captives taken battle green fork trident given freedom castle return pledge attempt escape vowed escape arya told never swore help escape

 captives ate table hall hundred hearths could often seen grounds four brothers took exercise together every day fighting staves wooden shields flowstone yard three freys crossing fourth bastard brother short time though one morning two brothers arrived peace banner chest gold ransomed knights who’d captured six freys left together

 one morning spied three women cowled grey robes silent sisters loading corpse wagon body sewn cloak finest silk decorated battleaxe sigil arya asked one guards told lord cerwyn died words felt like kick belly could never helped anyway thought sisters drove wagon gate couldn’t even help stupid mouse

 back scrubbing scurrying listening doors lord tywin would soon march riverrun heard would drive south highgarden one would ever expect must defend king’s landing stannis greatest threat he’d sent gregor clegane vargo hoat destroy roose bolton remove dagger back he’d sent ravens eyrie meant wed lady lysa arryn win vale he’d bought ton silver forge magic swords would slay stark wargs writing lady stark make peace kingslayer would soon freed

 though ravens came went every day lord tywin spent days behind closed doors war council arya caught glimpses always afar—once walking walls company three maesters fat captive bushy mustache riding lords bannermen visit encampments often standing arch covered gallery watching men practice yard stood hands locked together gold pommel longsword said lord tywin loved gold even shit gold heard one squire jest lannister lord stronglooking old man stiff golden whiskers bald head something face reminded arya father even though looked nothing alike lord’s face that’s told remembered hearing lady mother tell father put lord’s face go deal matter father laughed could imagine lord tywin ever laughing anything

 one afternoon waiting turn draw pail water well heard hinges east gate groaning party men rode portcullis walk spied manticore crawling across shield leader stab hate shot

 arya dreaming wolves running wild wood strong hand clamped mouth like smooth warm stone solid unyielding woke squirming struggling “a girl says nothing” voice whispered close behind ear “a girl keeps lips closed one hears friends may talk secret yes”

 heart pounding arya managed tiniest nods

 jaqen h’ghar took hand away cellar black pitch could see face even inches away could smell though skin smelled clean soapy scented hair “a boy becomes girl” murmured

 “i always girl didn’t think saw me”

 catelyn

 meeting place grassy sward dotted pale grey mushrooms raw stumps felled trees

 “we first lady” hallis mollen said reined amidst stumps alone armies direwolf banner house stark flapped fluttered atop lance bore catelyn could see sea could feel close smell salt heavy wind gusting east

 “we risk” told perhaps sharply “do think wish ser” belong riverrun dying father winterfell sons “robb sent south speak speak shall” would easy thing forge peace brothers catelyn knew yet good realm must tried

 across rainsodden flelds stony ridges could see great castle storm’s end rearing sky back unseen sea beneath mass pale grey stone encircling army lord stannis baratheon looked small insignificant mice banners

 songs said storm’s end raised ancient days durran first storm king love fair elenei daughter sea god goddess wind night wedding elenei yielded maidenhood mortal’s love thus doomed mortal’s death grieving parents unleashed wrath sent winds waters batter durran’s hold friends brothers wedding guests crushed beneath collapsing walls blown sea elenei sheltered durran within arms took harm dawn came last declared war upon gods vowed rebuild

 “my lady” hal mollen called two riders emerged tidy little camp beneath castle coming toward slow walk “that king stannis”

 “no doubt” catelyn watched come stannis must yet baratheon banner bright yellow rich gold renly’s standards device bore red though could make shape

 renly would last arrive told much set propose mount horse saw brother well way first arrive must wait renly would waiting sort game kings play told well king need play catelyn practiced waiting

 “lady stark” stannis baratheon said chill courtesy reined inclined head balder remembered

 “lord stannis” returned

 beneath tighttrimmed beard heavy jaw clenched hard yet hector titles duly grateful “i thought find storm’s end”

 “i thought here”

 deepset eyes regarded uncomfortably man made easy courtesies “i sorry lord’s death” said “though eddard stark friend me”

 “he never enemy lord lords tyrell redwyne held prisoned castle starving eddard stark broke siege”

 “at brother’s command love me” stannis answered “lord eddard duty deny ever less robert’s hand”

 “that brother’s ned never wanted it”

 “yet took mine still give word shall justice murder”

 loved promise heads men would king “your brother promised truth told would sooner daughters back leave justice gods cersei still holds sansa arya word since day robert’s death”

 “if children found take city shall sent you” alive dead tone implied

 “and shall lord stannis king’s landing close dragonstone find instead”

 “you frank lady stark well i’ll answer frankly take city need power southron lords see across field brother must needs take him”

 “men give allegiance lord lords swore fealty robert house baratheon brother put aside quarrel—”

 “i quarrel renly prove dutiful elder king want mine rights renly owes loyalty obedience mean lords” stannis studied face “and cause brings field lady house stark cast lot brother way it”

 one never bend thought yet must try nonetheless much stake “my son reigns king north lords people bends knee man holds hand friendship all”

 “kings friends” stannis said bluntly “only subjects enemies”

 “and brothers” cheerful voice called behind catelyn glanced shoulder lord renly’s palfrey picked way stumps younger baratheon splendid green velvet doublet satin cloak trimmed vair crown golden roses girded temples jade stag’s head rising forehead long black hair spilling beneath jagged chunks black diamond studded swordbelt chain gold emeralds looped around neck

 renly chosen woman carry banner well though brienne hid face form behind plate armor gave hint sex atop twelvefoot lance crowned stag pranced blackongold wind sea rippled cloth

 brother’s greeting curt “lord renly”

 “king renly truly stannis”

 stannis frowned “who else be”

 renly gave easy shrug “when saw standard could certain whose banner bear”

 “mine own”

 redclad priestess spoke “the king taken sigil fiery heart lord light”

 renly seemed amused “all good use banner battle terribly confused”

 catelyn said “let us hope battle three share common foe would destroy us all”

 stannis studied unsmiling “the iron throne mine rights deny foes”

 “the whole realm denies brother” said renly “old men deny death rattle unborn children deny mothers’wombs deny dorne deny wall one wants king sorry”

 stannis clenched jaw face taut “i swore would never treat wore traitor’s crown would kept vow”

 “this folly” catelyn said sharply “lord tywin sits harrenhal twenty thousand swords remnants kingslayer’s army regrouped golden tooth another lannister host gathers beneath shadow casterly rock cersei son hold king’s landing precious iron throne name king yet kingdom bleeds one lifts sword defend son”

 renly shrugged “your son battles shall win war lannisters wait pleasure”

 “if proposals make make them” stannis said brusquely “or gone”

 “very well” said renly “i propose dismount bend knee swear allegiance”

 stannis choked back rage “that shall never have”

 “you served robert me”

 “robert elder brother younger”

 “younger bolder far comely…”

 “…and thief usurper besides”

 renly shrugged “the targaryens called robert usurper seemed able bear shame shall i”

 “listen sons mine would bang heads together lock bedchamber remembered brothers”

 stannis frowned “you presume much lady stark rightful king son less traitor brother day come well”

 naked threat fanned fury “you free name others traitor usurper lord yet different say alone rightful king yet seems robert two sons laws seven kingdoms prince joffrey rightful heir tornmen him… traitors however good reasons”

 renly laughed “you must forgive lady catelyn stannis she’s come way riverrun long way ahorse fear never saw little letter”

 “joffrey brother’s seed” stannis said bluntly “nor tommen bastards girl well three abominations born incest”

 would even cersei mad catelyn speechless

 “isn’t sweet story lady” renly asked “i camped horn hill lord tarly received letter must say took breath away” smiled brother “i never suspected clever stannis true would indeed robert’s heir”

 “were true name liar”

 “can prove word fable”

 stannis ground teeth

 robert could never known catelyn thought cersei would lost head instant “lord stannis” asked “if knew queen guilty monstrous crimes keep silent “

 “i keep silent” stannis declared “i brought suspicions jon arryn”

 “rather brother”

 “my brother’s regard never dutiful” said stannis “from accusations would seemed peevish selfserving means placing first line succession believed robert would disposed listen charges came lord arryn loved”

 “ah” said renly “so word dead man”

 “do think died happenstance purblind fool cersei poisoned fear would reveal lord jon gathering certain proofs—”

 “—which doubtless died inconvenient”

 catelyn remembering fitting pieces together “my sister lysa accused queen killing husband letter sent winterfell” admitted “later eyrie laid murder feet queen’s brother tyrion”

 stannis snorted “if step nest snakes matter one bites first”

 “all snakes incest droll changes nothing may well better claim stannis still larger army” renly’s hand slid inside cloak stannis saw reached hilt sword could draw steel brother produced… peach “would like one brother” renly asked smiling “from highgarden you’ve never tasted anything sweet promise you” took bite juice ran corner mouth

 “i come eat fruit” stannis fuming

 “my lords” catelyn said “we ought hammering terms alliance trading taunts”

 “a man never refuse taste peach” renly said tossed stone away “he may never get chance life short stannis remember starks say winter coming” wiped mouth back hand

 “i come threatened either”

 “nor you” renly snapped back “when make threats you’ll know truth told i’ve never liked stannis blood wish slay storm’s end want take it… brother’s gift robert gave give you”

 “it give mine rights”

 sighing renly half turned saddle “what brother mine brienne refuses peach refuses castle even shunned wedding…”

 “we know wedding mummer’s farce year ago scheming make girl one robert’s whores”

 “a year ago scheming make girl robert’s queen” renly said “but matter boar got robert got margaery you’ll pleased know came maid”

 “in bed she’s like die way”

 “oh expect i’ll get son within year pray many sons stannis oh yes—none” renly smiled innocently “as daughter understand wife looked like i’d send fool service well”

 “enough” stannis roared “i mocked face hear not” yanked longsword scabbard steel gleamed strangely bright wan sunlight red yellow blazing white air around seemed shimmer heat

 catelyn’s horse whinnied backed away step brienne moved brothers blade hand “put steel” shouted stannis

 cersei lannister laughing breathless catelyn thought wearily

 stannis pointed shining sword brother “i without mercy” thundered notoriously without mercy “nor wish sully lightbringer brother’s blood sake mother bore us give night rethink folly renly strike banners come dawn grant storm’s end old seat council even name heir son born otherwise shall destroy you”

 renly laughed “stannis that’s pretty sword i’ll grant think glow ruined eyes look across fields brother see banners”

 “do think bolts cloth make king”

 “tyrell swords make king rowan tarly caron make king axe mace warhammer tarth arrows penrose lances fossoway cuy mullendore estermont selmy hightower oakheart crane caswell blackbar morrigen beesbury shermer dunn footly… even house florent wife’s brothers uncles make king chivalry south rides least part power foot coming behind hundred thousand swords spears pikes destroy pray paltry rabble see huddled castle walls i’ll call five thousand generous codfish lords onion knights sellswords half like come battle starts fewer four hundred horse scouts tell me—freeriders boiled leather stand instant armored lances care seasoned warrior think stannis host won’t survive first charge vanguard”

 “we shall see brother” light seemed go world stannis slid sword back scabbard “come dawn shall see”

 “i hope new god’s merciful one brother”

 stannis snorted galloped away disdainful red priestess lingered moment behind “look sins lord renly” said wheeled horse around

 catelyn lord renly returned together camp thousands waited return “that amusing terribly profitable” commented “i wonder get sword like well doubtless loras make gift battle grieves must come this”

 “you cheerful way grieving” said catelyn whose distress feigned

 “do i” renly shrugged “so stannis never cherished brothers confess suppose tale true joffrey kingslayer’s get—”

 “—your brother lawful heir”

 “while lives” renly admitted “though it’s fool’s law wouldn’t agree oldest son bestfitted crown suit never suited robert would suit stannis great king strong yet generous clever diligent loyal friends terrible enemies yet capable forgiveness patient—”

 “—humble” catelyn supplied

 renly laughed “you must allow king flaws lady”

 catelyn felt tired nothing baratheon brothers would drown blood son faced lannisters alone nothing could say would stop past time went back riverrun close father’s eyes thought much least may poor envoy good mourner gods save

 camp well sited atop low stony ridge ran north south far orderly sprawling encampment mander though quarter large he’d learned brother’s assault storm’s end renly split forces much robb done twins great mass foot left behind bitterbridge young queen wagons carts draft animals cumbersome siege machinery renly led knights freeriders swift dash east

 like brother robert even that… robert always eddard stark temper boldness caution ned would surely prevailed upon robert bring whole force encircle stannis besiege besiegers choice renly denied headlong rush come grips brother outdistanced supply lines left food forage days behind wagons mules oxen must come battle soon starve

 catelyn sent hal mollen tend horses accompanied renly back royal pavilion heart encampment inside walls green silk captains lords bannermen waiting hear word parley “my brother changed” young king told brienne unfastened cloak lifted goldandjade crown brow “castles courtesies appease must blood well mind grant wish”

 “your grace see need battle here” lord mathis rowan put “the castle strongly garrisoned well provisioned ser cortnay penrose seasoned commander trebuchet built could breach walls storm’s end let lord stannis siege find joy whilst sits cold hungry profitless take king’s landing”

 “and men say feared face stannis”

 “only fools say that” lord mathis argued

 renly looked others “what say all”

 “i say stannis danger you” lord randyll tarly declared “leave unblooded grow stronger power diminished battle lannisters beaten day time done lord stannis may strong you… stronger”

 others chorused agreement king looked pleased “we shall fight then”

 failed robb failed ned catelyn thought “my lord” announced “if set battle purpose done ask leave return riverrun”

 “you it” renly seated camp chair

 stiffened “i hoped help make peace lord help make war”

 renly gave shrug “i daresay we’ll prevail without fiveandtwenty lady mean take part battle watch it”

 “i whispering wood lord seen enough butchery came envoy—”

 “and envoy shall leave” renly said “but wiser came shall see befalls rebels eyes son hear lips we’ll keep safe never fear” turned away make dispositions “lord mathis shall lead center main battle bryce you’ll left right mine lord estermont shall command reserve”

 “i shall fail grace” lord estermont replied

 lord mathis rowan spoke “who shall van”

 “your grace” said ser jon fossoway “i beg honor”

 “beg like” said ser guyard green “by rights one seven strikes first blow”

 “it takes pretty cloak charge shield wall” randyll tarly announced “i leading mace tyrell’s van still sucking mother’s teat guyard”

 clamor filled pavilion men loudly set forth claims knights summer catelyn thought renly raised hand “enough lords dozen vans one greatest glory rights belongs greatest knight ser loras shall strike first blow”

 “with glad heart grace” knight flowers knelt king “grant blessing knight ride beside banner let stag rose go battle side side”

 renly glanced “brienne”

 “your grace” still armored blue steel though taken helm crowded tent hot sweat plastered limp yellow hair broad homely face “my place side sworn shield…”

 “one seven” king reminded “never fear four fellows fight”

 brienne dropped knees “if must part grace grant honor arming battle”

 catelyn heard someone snigger behind loves poor thing thought sadly she’d play squire touch never care great fool think

 “granted” renly said “now leave even kings must rest battle”

 “my lord” catelyn said “there small sept last village passed permit depart riverrun grant leave go pray”

 “as ser robar give lady stark safe escort sept… see returns us dawn”

 “you might well pray yourself” catelyn added

 “for victory”

 “for wisdom”

 renly laughed “loras stay help pray it’s long i’ve quite forgotten rest want every man place first light armed armored horsed shall give stannis dawn soon forget”

 dusk falling catelyn left pavilion ser robar royce fell beside knew slightly—one bronze yohn’s sons comely roughhewn way tourney warrior renown renly gifted rainbow cloak suit blood red armor named one seven “you long way vale ser” told

 “and far winterfell lady”

 “i know brought come battle mine”

 “i made battle made renly king”

 “the royces bannermen house arryn”

 “my lord father owes lady lysa fealty heir second son must find glory can” ser robar shrugged “a man grows weary tourneys”

 catelyn’s small corner camp shadd slicing carrots kettle hal mollen dicing three winterfell men lucas blackwood sat sharpening dagger “lady stark” lucas said saw “mollen says battle dawn”

 “hal truth it” answered loose tongue well would seem

 “do fight flee”

 “we pray lucas” answered “we pray”





 sansa

 “the longer keep waiting worse go you” sandor clegane warned

 sansa tried hurry fingers fumbled buttons knots hound always roughtongued something way looked filled dread joffrey found meetings ser dontos please thought brushed hair ser dontos hope look pretty joff likes look pretty he’s always liked gown color smoothed cloth fabric tight across chest

 “not kingly brother”

 “robb’s traitor” sansa knew words rote “i part whatever did” gods good don’t let kingslayer robb harmed jaime lannister would mean life thought ser ilyn terrible pale eyes staring pitilessly gaunt pockmarked face

 hound snorted “they trained well little bird” conducted lower bailey crowd gathered around archery butts men moved aside let could hear lord gyles coughing loitering stablehands eyed insolently ser horas redwyne averted gaze passed brother hobber pretended see yellow cat dying ground mewling piteously crossbow quarrel ribs sansa stepped around feeling ill

 ser dontos approached broomstick horse since he’d drunk mount destrier tourney king decreed henceforth must always go horsed “be brave” whispered squeezing arm

 joffrey stood center throng winding ornate crossbow ser boros ser meryn sight enough tie insides knots

 “your grace” fell knees

 “kneeling won’t save now” king said “stand you’re answer brother’s latest treasons”

 “your grace whatever traitor brother done part know beg please—”

 “get up”

 hound pulled feet ungently

 “ser lancel” joff said “tell outrage”

 sansa always thought lancel lannister comely well spoken neither pity kindness look gave “using vile sorcery brother fell upon ser stafford lannister army wargs three days ride lannisport thousands good men butchered slept without chance lift sword slaughter northmen feasted flesh slain”

 horror coiled cold hands around sansa’s throat

 “you nothing say” asked joffrey

 “your grace poor child shocked witless” murmured ser dontos

 “silence fool” joffrey lifted crossbow pointed face “you starks unnatural wolves i’ve forgotten monster savaged me”

 “that arya’s wolf” said “lady never hurt killed anyway”

 “no father did” joff said “but killed father wish i’d done killed man last night bigger father came gate shouting name calling bread like baker taught better shot loudest one right throat”

 “and died” ugly iron head quarrel staring face hard think else say

 “of course died quarrel throat woman throwing rocks got well arm” frowning lowered crossbow “i’d shoot mother says they’d kill uncle jaime instead you’ll punished we’ll send word brother happen doesn’t yield dog hit her”

 “let beat her” ser dontos shoved forward tin armor clattering armed “morningstar” whose head melon florian could kissed blotchy skin broken veins trotted broomstick around shouting “traitor traitor” whacking head melon sansa covered hands staggering every time fruit pounded hair sticky second blow people laughing melon flew pieces laugh joffrey prayed juice ran face front blue silk gown laugh satisfied

 joffrey much snigger “boros meryn”

 ser meryn trant seized dontos arm flung brusquely away redfaced fool went sprawling broomstick melon ser boros seized sansa

 “leave face” joffrey commanded “i like pretty”

 boros slammed fist sansa’s belly driving air doubled knight grabbed hair drew sword one hideous instant certain meant open throat laid flat blade across thighs thought legs might break force blow sansa screamed tears welled eyes soon soon lost count blows

 “enough” heard hound rasp

 “no isn’t” king replied “boros make naked”

 boros shoved meaty hand front sansa’s bodice gave hard yank silk came tearing away baring waist sansa covered breasts hands could hear sniggers far cruel “beat bloody” joffrey said “we’ll see brother fancies—”

 “what meaning this”

 imp’s voice cracked like whip suddenly sansa free stumbled knees arms crossed chest breath ragged “is notion chivalry ser boros” tyrion lannister demanded angrily pet sellsword stood one wildlings one burned eye “what sort knight beats helpless maids”

 “the sort serves king imp” ser boros raised sword ser meryn stepped beside blade scraping clear scabbard

 “careful those” warned dwarf’s sellsword “you don’t want get blood pretty white cloaks”

 “someone give girl something cover with” imp said sandor clegane unfastened cloak tossed sansa clutched chest fists bunched hard white wool coarse weave scratchy skin velvet ever felt fine

 “this girl’s queen” imp told joffrey “have regard honor”

 “i’m punishing her”

 “for crime fight brother’s battle”

 “she blood wolf”

 “and wits goose”

 “you can’t talk way king likes”

 “aerys targaryen liked mother ever told happened him”

 ser boros blount harrumphed “no man threatens grace presence kingsguard”

 tyrion lannister raised eyebrow “i threatening king ser educating nephew bronn timett next time ser boros opens mouth kill him” dwarf smiled “now threat ser see difference”

 ser boros turned dark shade red “the queen hear this”

 “no doubt wait joffrey shall send mother “

 king flushed

 “nothing say grace” uncle went “good learn use ears mouth less reign shorter wanton brutality way win people’s love… queen’s”

 “fear better love mother says” joffrey pointed sansa “she fears me”

 imp sighed “yes see pity stannis renly aren’t twelveyearold girls well bronn timett bring her”

 sansa moved dream thought imp’s men would take back bedchamber maegor’s holdfast instead conducted tower hand set foot inside place since day father fell grace made feel faint climb steps

 serving girls took charge mouthing meaningless comforts stop shaking one stripped ruins gown smallclothes another bathed washed sticky juice face hair scrubbed soap sluiced warm water head could see faces bailey knights sworn defend weak protect women fight right none thing ser dontos tried help longer knight imp hound… hound hated knights… hate sansa thought true knights one

 clean plump gingerheaded maester frenken came see bid lie facedown mattress spread salve across angry red welts covered backs legs afterward mixed draught dreamwine honey might go easier “sleep bit child wake seem bad dream”

 won’t stupid man sansa thought drank drearnwine anyway slept

 dark woke quite knowing room strange strangely familiar rose stab pain went legs brought back tears filled eyes someone laid robe beside bed sansa slipped opened door outside stood hardfaced woman leathery brown skin three necklaces looped scrawny neck one gold one silver one made human ears “where think she’s going” woman asked leaning tall spear

 “the godswood” find ser dontos beg take home late

 “the halfman said you’re leave” woman said “pray gods hear”

 meekly sansa dropped eyes retreated back inside realized suddenly place seemed familiar they’ve put arya’s old bedchamber father hand king things gone furnishings moved around it’s same…

 short time later serving girl brought platter cheese bread olives flagon cold water “take away” sansa commanded girl left food table thirsty realized every step sent knives thighs made cross room drank two cups water nibbling olive knock came

 anxiously turned toward door smoothed folds robe “yes”

 door opened tyrion lannister stepped inside “my lady trust disturbing you”

 “am prisoner”

 “my guest” wearing chain office necklace linked golden hands “i thought might talk”

 “as lord commands” sansa found hard stare face ugly held queer fascination

 “the food garments satisfaction” asked “if anything else need ask”

 “you kind morning… good help me”

 “you right know joffrey wroth six nights gone brother fell upon uncle stafford encamped host village called oxcross three days ride casterly rock northerners crushing victory received word morning”

 robb kill thought exulting “it’s… terrible lord brother vile traitor”

 dwarf smiled wanly “well he’s fawn he’s made clear enough”

 “ser lancel said robb led army wargs…”

 imp gave disdainful bark laughter “ser lancel’s wineskin warrior wouldn’t know warg wart brother direwolf suspect that’s far went northmen crept uncle’s camp cut horse lines lord stark sent wolf among even wartrained destriers went mad knights trampled death pavilions rabble woke terror fled casting aside weapons run faster ser stafford slain chased horse lord rickard karstark drove lance chest ser rubert brax also dead along ser lymond vikary lord crakehall lord jast half hundred taken captive including jast’s sons nephew martyn lannister survived spreading wild tales swearing old gods north march brother”

 “then… sorcery”

 lannister snorted “sorcery sauce fools spoon failure hide flavor incompetence muttonheaded uncle even troubled post sentries would seem host raw—apprentice boys miners fieldhands fisherfolk sweepings lannisport mystery brother reached forces still hold stronghold golden tooth swear pass” dwarf gave irritated shrug “well robb stark father’s bane joffrey mine tell feel kingly nephew”

 “i love heart” sansa said

 “truly” sound convinced “even now”

 “my love grace greater ever been”

 imp laughed aloud “well someone taught lie well may grateful one day child child still flowered”

 sansa blushed rude question shame stripped half castle made seem like nothing “no lord”

 “that’s good gives solace intend ever wed joffrey marriage reconcile stark lannister happened fear more’s pity match one king robert’s better notions joffrey hadn’t mucked up”

 knew ought say something words caught throat

 “you grow quiet” tyrion lannister observed “is want end betrothal”

 “i…” sansa know say trick punish tell truth stared dwarf’s brutal bulging brow hard black eye shrewd green one crooked teeth wiry beard “i want loyal”

 “loyal” dwarf mused “and far lannisters scarce blame age wanted thing” smiled “they tell visit godswood every day pray sansa”

 pray robb’s victory joffrey’s death… home winterfell “i pray end fighting”

 “we’ll soon enough another battle brother robb lord father settle issue”

 robb beat sansa thought beat uncle brother jaime he’ll beat father

 face open book easily dwarf read hopes “do take oxcross much heart lady” told unkindly “a battle war lord father assuredly uncle stafford next time visit godswood pray brother wisdom bend knee north returns king’s peace mean send home” hopped window seat said “you may sleep tonight i’ll give men guard stone crows perhaps—”

 “no” sansa blurted aghast locked tower hand guarded dwarf’s men would ser dontos ever spirit away freedom

 “would prefer black ears i’ll give chella woman would make ease”

 “please lord wildlings frighten me”

 grinned “me well point frighten joffrey nest sly vipers lickspittle dogs calls kingsguard chella timett side one would dare offer harm”

 “i would sooner return bed” lie came suddenly seemed right blurted “this tower father’s men slain ghosts would give terrible dreams would see blood wherever looked”

 tyrion lannister studied face “i stranger nightmares sansa perhaps wiser knew permit least escort safely back chambers”





 catelyn

 full dark found village catelyn found wondering place name people taken knowledge fled along owned candles sept ser wendel lit torch led low door

 within seven walls cracked crooked god one septon osmynd taught girl seven aspects sept single building seven walls wealthy septs cities statues seven altar winterfell septon chayle hung carved masks wall catelyn found rough charcoal drawings ser wendel set torch sconce near door left wait outside robar royce

 catelyn studied faces father bearded ever mother smiled loving protective warrior sword sketched beneath face smith hammer maid beautiful crone wizened wise

 seventh face… stranger neither male female yet ever outcast wanderer far places less human unknown unknowable face black oval shadow stars eyes made catelyn uneasy would get scant comfort

 knelt mother “my lady look battle mother’s eyes sons every one spare spare sons well watch robb bran rickon would them”

 crack ran mother’s left eye made look crying catelyn could hear ser wendel’s booming voice ser robar’s quiet answers talked coming battle otherwise night still even cricket could heard gods kept silence old gods ever answer ned wondered knelt heart tree hear

 flickering torchlight danced across walls making faces seem half alive twisting changing statues great septs cities wore faces stonemasons given charcoal scratchings crude might anyone father’s face made think father dying bed riverrun warrior renly stannis robb robert jaime lannister jon snow even glimpsed arya lines instant gust wind door made torch sputter semblance gone washed away orange glare

 smoke making eyes burn rubbed heels scarred hands looked mother mother saw lady minisa tully died childbed trying give lord hoster second son baby perished afterward life gone father always calm catelyn thought remembering mother’s soft hands warm smile lived different lives might wondered lady minisa would make eldest daughter kneeling come many thousands leagues served lost daughters robb want bran rickon must surely think cold unnatural mother even ned died…

 head swam sept seemed move around shadows swayed shifted furtive animals racing across cracked white walls catelyn eaten today perhaps unwise told time truth food lost savor world without ned took head killed

 behind torch spit suddenly seemed sister’s face wall though eyes harder recalled lysa’s eyes cersei’s cersei mother matter fathered children felt kick inside brought forth pain blood nursed breast truly jaime’s…

 “does cersei pray lady” catelyn asked mother could see proud cold lovely features lannister queen etched upon wall crack still even cersei could weep children “each seven embodies seven” septon osmynd told much beauty crone maiden mother could fiercer warrior children danger yes…

 seen enough robert baratheon winterfell know king regard joffrey great warmth boy truly jaime’s seed robert would put death along mother would condemned bastards common enough incest monstrous sin old gods new children wickedness named abominations sept godswood alike dragon kings wed brother sister blood old valyria practices common like dragons targaryens answered neither gods men

 ned must known lord arryn small wonder queen killed would less catelyn clenched hands feeling tightness scarred fingers assassin’s steel cut bone fought save son “bran knows too” whispered lowering head gods good must seen something heard something tried kill bed

 lost weary catelyn stark gave gods knelt smith fixed things broken asked give sweet bran protection went maid beseeched lend courage arya sansa guard innocence father prayed justice strength seek wisdom know asked warrior keep robb strong shield battles lastly turned crone whose statues often showed lamp one hand “guide wise lady” prayed “show path must walk let stumble dark places lie ahead”

 finally footsteps behind noise door “my lady” ser robar said gently “pardon time end must back dawn breaks”

 catelyn rose stiffly knees ached would given much featherbed pillow “thank ser ready”

 rode silence sparse woodland trees leaned drunkenly away sea nervous whinny horses clank steel guided back renly’s camp long ranks man horse armored darkness black smith hammered night steel banners right banners left rank rank banners predawn gloom neither colors sigils could discerned grey army catelyn thought grey men grey horses beneath grey banners sat horses waiting renly’s shadow knights pointed lances upward rode forest tall naked trees bereft leaves life storm’s end stood deeper darkness wall black stars could shine could see torches moving across fields lord stannis made camp

 candles within renly’s pavilion made shimmering silken walls seem glow transforming great tent magical castle alive emerald light two rainbow guard stood sentry door royal pavilion green light shone strangely purple plums ser parmen’s surcoat gave sickly hue sunflowers covered every inch ser emmon’s enameled yellow plate long silken plumes flew helms rainbow cloaks draped shoulders

 within catelyn found brienne armoring king battle lords tarly rowan spoke dispositions tactics pleasantly warm inside heat shimmering coals dozen small iron braziers “i must speak grace” said granting king’s style anything make heed

 “in moment lady catelyn” renly replied brienne fit backplate breastplate quilted tunic king’s armor deep green green leaves summer wood dark drank candlelight gold highlights gleamed inlay fastenings like distant fires wood winking every time moved “pray continue lord mathis”

 “your grace” mathis rowan said sideways glance catelyn “as saying battles well drawn wait daybreak sound advance”

 “and said treachery unchivalrous attack dawn chosen hour”

 “chosen stannis” randyll tarly pointed “he’d us charge teeth rising sun we’ll halfblind”

 “only first shock” renly said confidently “ser loras break chaos” brienne tightened green leather straps buckled golden buckles “when brother falls see insult done corpse blood head paraded spear”

 “and yields” lord tarly asked

 “yields” lord rowan laughed “when mace tyrell laid siege storm’s end stannis ate rats rather open gates”

 “well remember” renly lifted chin allow brienne fasten gorget place “near end ser gawen wylde three knights tried steal postern gate surrender stannis caught ordered flung walls catapults still see gawen’s face strapped masteratarms”

 lord rowan appeared puzzled “no men hurled walls would surely remember that”

 “maester cressen told stannis might forced eat dead gain flinging away good meat” renly pushed back hair brienne bound velvet tie pulled padded cap ears cushion weight helm “thanks onion knight never reduced dining corpses close thing close ser gawen died cell”

 “your grace” catelyn waited patiently time grew short “you promised word”

 renly nodded “see battles lords… oh barristan selmy brother’s side want spared”

 “there’s word ser barristan since joffrey cast out” lord rowan objected

 “i know old man needs king guard yet never came lady catelyn says robb stark riverrun else stannis”

 “as say grace harm come him” lords bowed deeply departed

 “say say lady stark” renly said brienne swept cloak broad shoulders clothofgold heavy crowned stag baratheon picked flakes jet

 “the lannisters tried kill son bran thousand times asked brother gave answer hunt day fell robert ned men rode boar jaime lannister remained winterfell queen”

 renly slow take implication “so believe boy caught incest…”

 “i beg lord grant leave go brother stannis tell suspect”

 “to end”

 “robb set aside crown brother same” said hoping true would make true must robb would listen even lords would “let three call great council realm seen hundred years send winterfell bran may tell tale men may know lannisters true usurpers let assembled lords seven kingdoms choose shall rule them”

 renly laughed “tell lady direwolves vote lead pack” brienne brought king’s gauntlets greathelm crowned golden antlers would add foot half height “the time talk done see stronger” renly pulled lobstered greenandgold gauntlet left hand brienne knelt buckle belt heavy weight longsword dagger

 “i beg name mother” catelyn began sudden gust wind flung open door tent thought glimpsed movement turned head king’s shadow shifting silken walls heard renly begin jest shadow moving lifting sword black green candles guttering shivering something queer wrong saw renly’s sword still scabbard sheathed still shadowsword…

 “cold” said renly small puzzled voice heartbeat steel gorget parted like cheesecloth beneath shadow blade time make small thick gasp blood came gushing throat

 “your gr—no” cried brienne blue saw evil flow sounding scared little girl king stumbled arms sheet blood creeping front armor dark red tide drowned green gold candles guttered renly tried speak choking blood legs collapsed brienne’s strength held threw back head screamed wordless anguish

 shadow something dark evil happened knew something could begin understand renly never cast shadow death came door blew life swift wind snuffed candles

 instants passed robar royce emmon cuy came bursting though felt like half night pair menatarms crowded behind torches saw renly brienne’s arms drenched king’s blood ser robar gave cry horror “wicked woman” screamed ser emmon sunflowered steel “away vile creature”

 “gods good brienne why” asked ser robar

 brienne looked king’s body rainbow cloak hung shoulders turned red king’s blood soaked cloth “i… i…”

 “you’ll die this” ser emmon snatched longhandled battleaxe weapons piled near door “you’ll pay king’s life own”

 “no” catelyn stark screamed finding voice last late blood madness rushed forward shouts drowned softer words

 brienne moved faster catelyn would believed sword hand snatched renly’s scabbard raised catch emmon’s axe downswing spark flashed bluewhite steel met steel rending crash brienne sprang feet body dead king thrust rudely aside ser emmon stumbled tried close brienne’s blade sheared wooden haft send axehead spinning another man thrust flaming torch back rainbow cloak sodden blood burn brienne spun cut torch hand went flying flames crept across carpet maimed man began scream ser emmon dropped axe fumbled sword second manatarms lunged brienne parried swords danced clanged emmon cuy came wading back brienne forced retreat yet somehow held bay ground renly’s head rolled sickeningly one side second mouth yawned wide blood coming slow pulses

 ser robar hung back uncertain reaching hilt “robar listen” catelyn seized arm “you wrong help hear stannis” name lips could think got said knew true “i swear know stannis killed him”

 young rainbow knight stared madwoman pale frightened eyes “stannis how”

 “i know sorcery dark magic shadow shadow” voice sounded wild crazed words poured rush blades continued clash behind “a shadow sword swear saw blind girl loved help her” glanced back saw second guardsman fall blade dropping limp fingers outside shouting angry men would bursting instant knew “she innocent robar word husband’s grave honor stark”

 resolved “i hold them” ser robar said “get away” turned went

 fire reached wall creeping side tent ser emmon pressing brienne hard enameled yellow steel wool forgotten catelyn iron brazier came crashing back head helmed blow lasting harm sent knees “brienne me” catelyn commanded girl slow see chance slash green silk parted stepped darkness chill dawn loud voices came side pavilion “this way” catelyn urged “and slowly must run ask walk easy nothing amiss”

 brienne thrust sword blade belt fell beside catelyn night air smelled rain behind king’s pavilion well ablaze flames rising high dark one made move stop men rushed past shouting fire murder sorcery others stood small groups spoke low voices praying one young squire knees sobbing openly

 renly’s battles already coming apart rumors spread mouth mouth nightfires burned low east began lighten immense mass storm’s end emerged like dream stone wisps pale mist raced across field flying sun wings wind morning ghosts heard old nan call spirits returning graves renly one gone like brother robert like dear ned

 “i never held died” brienne said quietly walked spreading chaos voice sounded might break instant “he laughing one moment suddenly blood everywhere… lady understand see you…”

 “i saw shadow thought renly’s shadow first brother’s”

 jon

 hill jutted dense tangle forest rising solitary sudden windswept heights visible miles wildlings called fist first men rangers said look like fist jon snow thought punching earth wood bare brown slopes knuckled stone

 rode top lord mormont officers leaving ghost trees direwolf run three times climbed twice returning reluctantly jon’s whistle third time lord commander lost patience snapped “let go boy want reach crest dusk find wolf later”

 way steep stony summit crowned chesthigh wall tumbled rocks circle distance west found gap large enough admit horses “this good ground thoren” old bear proclaimed last attained top “we could scarce hope better we’ll make camp await halfhand” lord commander swung saddle dislodging raven shoulder complaining loudly bird took air

 views atop hill bracing yet ringwall drew jon’s eye weathered grey stones white patches lichen beards green moss said fist ringfort first men dawn age “an old place strong” thoren smallwood said

 “old” mormont’s raven screamed flapped noisy circles heads “old old old”

 “quiet” mormont growled bird old bear proud admit weakness jon deceived strain keeping younger men taking toll

 “these heights easy defend need be” thoren pointed walked horse along ring stones sabletrimmed cloak stirring wind

 “yes place do” old bear lifted hand wind raven landed forearm claws scrabbling black ringmail

 “what water lord” jon wondered

 “we crossed brook foot hill”

 “a long climb drink” jon pointed “and outside ring stones”

 thoren said “are lazy climb hill boy”

 lord mormont said “we’re like find another place strong we’ll carry water make certain well supplied” jon knew better argue command given brothers night’s watch raised camp behind stone ring first men made black tents sprouted like mushrooms rain blankets bedrolls covered bare ground stewards tethered garrons long lines saw fed watered foresters took axes trees waning afternoon light harvest enough wood see night score builders set clearing brush digging latrines untying bundles firehardened stakes “i every opening ringwall ditched staked dark” old bear commanded

 he’d put lord commander’s tent seen horses jon snow descended hill search ghost direwolf came silence one moment jon striding beneath trees whistling shouting alone green pinecones fallen leaves feet next great white direwolf walking beside pale morning mist

 reached ringfort ghost balked padded forward warily sniff gap stones retreated like he’d smelled jon tried grab scruff neck haul bodily inside ring easy task wolf weighed much stronger far “ghost what’s wrong you” like unsettled end jon give “as will” told wolf “go hunt” red eyes watched made way back mossy stones

 ought safe hill offered commanding views slopes precipitous north west slightly gentle east yet dusk deepened darkness seeped hollows trees jon’s sense foreboding grew haunted forest told maybe ghosts spirits first men place

 “stop acting boy” told clambering atop piled rocks jon gazed toward setting sun could see light shimmering like hammered gold surface milkwater curved away south upriver land rugged dense forest giving way series bare stony hills rose high wild north west horizon stood mountains like great shadow range range receding bluegrey distance jagged peaks sheathed eternally snow even afar looked vast cold inhospitable

 closer hand trees ruled south east wood went far jon could see vast tangle root limb painted thousand shades green patch red weirwood shouldered pines sentinels blush yellow broadleafs begun turn wind blew could hear creak groan branches older thousand leaves fluttered moment forest seemed deep green sea stormtossed heaving eternal unknowable

 ghost like alone thought anything could moving sea creeping toward ringfort dark wood concealed beneath trees anything would ever know stood long time sun vanished behind sawtoothed mountains darkness began creep forest

 “jon” samwell tarly called “i thought looked like well”

 “well enough” jon hopped “how fare today”

 “well fared well truly”

 jon share disquiet friend samwell tarly last beginning find courage “the old bear means wait qhorin halfhand men shadow tower”

 “it seems strong place” said sam “a ringfort first men think battles fought here”

 “no doubt you’d best get bird ready mormont want send back word”

 “i wish could send hate caged”

 “you would could fly”

 “if could fly i’d back castle black eating pork pie” said sam

 jon clapped shoulder burned hand walked back camp together cookfires lit around overhead stars coming long red tail mormont’s torch burned bright moon jon heard ravens saw calling name birds shy came making noise

 feel “i’d best see old bear” said “he gets noisy isn’t fed well”

 found mormont talking thoren smallwood half dozen officers “there are” old man said gruffly “bring us hot wine would night chilly”

 “yes lord” jon built cookfire claimed small cask mormont’s favorite robust red stores poured kettle hung kettle flames gathered rest ingredients old bear particular hot spiced wine much cinnamon much nutmeg much honey drop raisins nuts dried berries lemon rankest sort southron heresy—which queer since always took lemon morning beer drink must hot warm man properly lord commander insisted wine must never allowed come boil jon kept careful eye kettle

 worked could hear voices inside tent jarman buckwell said “the easiest road frostfangs follow milkwater back source yet go path rayder know approach certain sunrise”

 “the giant’s stair might serve” said ser mallador locke “or skirling pass it’s clear”

 wine steaming jon lifted kettle fire filled eight cups carried tent old bear peering crude map sam drawn night back craster’s keep took cup jon’s tray tried swallow wine gave brusque nod approval raven hopped arm “corn” said “corn corn”

 ser ottyn wythers waved wine away “i would go mountains all” said thin tired voice “the frostfangs cruel bite even summer now… caught storm…”

 “i mean risk frostfangs unless must” said mormont “wildlings live snow stone emerge heights soon host size route along milkwater strongly placed cannot hope slip us”

 “they may wish thousands three hundred halfhand reaches us” ser mallador accepted cup jon

 “if comes battle could hope better ground here” declared mormont “we’ll strengthen defenses pits spikes caltrops scattered slopes every breach mended jarman i’ll want sharpest eyes watchers ring around us along river warn approach hide trees best start bringing water need we’ll dig cisterns keep men occupied may prove needful later”

 “my rangers—” started thoren smallwood

 “your rangers limit ranging side river halfhand reaches us we’ll see lose men”

 “mance rayder might massing host day’s ride we’d never know” smallwood complained

 “we know wildlings massing” mormont came back “we craster mislike man think lied us this”

 “as say” smallwood took sullen leave others finished wine followed courteously

 “shall bring supper lord” jon asked

 “corn” raven cried mormont answer said “did wolf find game today”

 “he’s back yet”

 “we could fresh meat” mormont dug sack offered raven handful corn “you think i’m wrong keep rangers close”

 “that’s say lord”

 “it you’re asked”

 “if rangers must stay sight fist don’t see hope find uncle” jon admitted

 “they can’t” raven pecked kernels old bear’s palm “two hundred men ten thousand country vast” corn gone mormont turned hand

 “you would give search”

 “maester aemon thinks clever” mormont moved raven shoulder bird tilted head one side little eyes aglitter

 answer “is it… seems might easier one man find two hundred two hundred find one”

 raven gave cackling scream old bear smiled grey beard “this many men horses leave trail even aemon could follow hill fires ought visible far foothills frostfangs ben stark alive free come us doubt”

 “yes” said jon “but… if…”

 “…he’s dead” mormont asked unkindly

 jon nodded reluctantly

 “dead” raven said “dead dead”

 “he may come us anyway” old bear said “as othor jafer flowers dread much jon must admit possibility”

 “dead” raven cawed ruffling wings voice grew louder shrill “dead”

 mormont stroked bird’s black feathers stifled sudden yawn back hand “i forsake supper believe rest serve better wake first light”

 “sleep well lord” jon gathered empty cups stepped outside heard distant laughter plaintive sound pipes great blaze crackling center camp could smell stew cooking old bear might hungry jon drifted toward fire

 dywen holding forth spoon hand “i know wood well man alive tell wouldn’t care ride alone tonight can’t smell it”

 grenn staring wide eyes dolorous edd said “all smell shit two hundred horses stew similar aroma come sniff it”

 “i’ve got similar aroma right here” hake patted dirk grumbling filled jon’s bowl kettle

 stew thick barley carrot onion ragged shred salt beef softened cooking

 “what smell dywen” asked grenn

 forester sucked spoon moment taken teeth face leathery wrinkled hands gnarled old roots “seems like smells… well… cold”

 “your head’s wooden teeth” hake told “there’s smell cold”

 thought jon remembering night lord commander’s chambers smells like death suddenly hungry anymore gave stew grenn looked need extra supper warm night

 wind blowing briskly left morning frost would cover ground tent ropes would stiff frozen fingers spiced wine sloshed bottom kettle jon fed fresh wood fire put kettle flames reheat flexed fingers waited squeezing spreading hand tingled first watch taken stations around perimeter camp torches flickered along ringwall night moonless thousand stars shone overhead

 sound rose darkness faint distant unmistakable howling wolves voices rose fell chilly song lonely made hairs rise along back neck across fire pair red eyes regarded shadows light flames made glow

 “ghost” jon breathed surprised “so came inside eh” white wolf often hunted night expected see till daybreak “was hunting bad” asked “here ghost”

 direwolf circled fire sniffing jon sniffing wind never still seem meat right dead came walking ghost knew woke warned alarmed got feet “is something ghost scent” dywen said smelled cold

 direwolf loped stopped looked back wants follow pulling hood cloak jon walked away tents away warmth fire past lines shaggy little garrons one horses whickered nervously ghost padded jon soothed word paused stroke muzzle could hear wind whistling cracks rocks neared ringwall voice called challenge jon stepped torchlight “i need fetch water lord commander”

 jon slipped sideways two sharpened stakes ghost slid beneath torch thrust crevice flames flying pale orange banners gusts came snatched squeezed gap stones ghost went racing hill jon followed slowly torch thrust made descent camp sounds faded behind night black slope steep stony uneven moment’s inattention would sure way break ankle… neck asked picked way

 trees stood beneath warriors armored bark leaf deployed silent ranks awaiting command storm hill black seemed… torchlight brushed jon glimpsed flash green faintly heard sound water flowing rocks ghost vanished underbrush jon struggled listening call brook leaves sighing wind branches clutched cloak overhead thick limbs twined together shut stars

 found ghost lapping stream “ghost” called “to now” direwolf raised head eyes glowed red baleful water streamed jaws like slaver something fierce terrible instant bounding past jon racing trees “ghost stay” shouted wolf paid heed lean white shape swallowed dark jon two choices—to climb hill alone follow

 followed angry holding torch low could see rocks threatened trip every step thick roots seemed grab feet holes man could twist ankle every feet called ghost night wind swirling amongst trees drank words madness thought plunged deeper trees turn back glimpsed flash white ahead right back toward hill jogged cursing breath

 quarter way around fist chased wolf lost finally stopped catch breath amidst scrub thorns tumbled rocks base hill beyond torchlight dark pressed close

 soft scrabbling noise made turn jon moved toward sound stepping carefully among boulders thornbushes behind fallen tree came ghost direwolf digging furiously kicking dirt

 “what found” jon lowered torch revealing rounded mound soft earth grave thought whose

 bran

 alebelly found forge working bellows mikken “maester wants turret m’lord prince there’s bird king”

 “from robb” excited bran wait hodor let alebelly carry steps big man though big hodor nowhere near strong time reached maester’s turret redfaced puffing rickon walder freys well

 maester luwin sent alebelly away closed door “my lords” said gravely “we message grace good news ill great victory west shattering lannister army place named oxcross taken several castles well writes us ashemark formerly stronghold house marbrand”

 rickon tugged maester’s robe “is robb coming home”

 “not yet fear battles yet fight”

 “was lord tywin defeated” asked bran

 “no” said maester “ser stafford lannister commanded enemy host slain battle”

 bran never even heard ser stafford lannister found agreeing big walder said “lord tywin one matters”

 “tell robb want come home” said rickon “he bring wolf home mother father” though knew lord eddard dead sometimes rickon forgot… willfully bran suspected little brother stubborn boy four

 bran glad robb’s victory disquieted well remembered osha said day brother led army winterfell he’s marching wrong way wildling woman insisted

 “sadly victory without cost” maester luwin turned walders “my lords uncle ser stevron frey among lost lives oxcross took wound battle robb writes thought serious three days later died tent asleep”

 big walder shrugged “he old fiveandsixty think old battles always saying tired”

 little walder hooted “tired waiting grandfather die mean mean ser emmon’s heir now”

 “don’t stupid” cousin said “the sons first son come second son ser ryman next line edwyn black walder petyr pimple aegon sons”

 “ryman old too” said little walder “past forty bet bad belly think he’ll lord”

 “i’ll lord don’t care is”

 maester luwin cut sharply “you ought ashamed talk lords grief uncle dead”

 “yes” said little walder “we’re sad”

 weren’t though bran got sick feeling belly like taste dish better asked maester luwin excused

 “very well” maester rang help hodor must busy stables osha came stronger alebelly though trouble lifting bran arms carrying steps

 “osha” bran asked crossed yard “do know way north wall and… even past”

 “the way’s easy look ice dragon chase blue star rider’s eye” backed door started winding steps

 “and still giants and… rest… others children forest too”

 “the giants i’ve seen children i’ve heard tell white walkers… want know”

 “did ever see threeeyed crow”

 “no” laughed “and can’t say i’d want to” osha kicked open door bedchamber set window seat could watch yard

 seemed heartbeats took leave door opened jojen reed entered unbidden sister meera behind “you heard bird” bran asked boy nodded “it wasn’t supper like said letter robb didn’t eat but—”

 “the green dreams take strange shapes sometimes” jojen admitted “the truth always easy understand”

 “tell bad thing dreamed” bran said “the bad thing coming winterfell”

 “does lord prince believe trust words matter queer sound ears”

 bran nodded

 “it sea comes”

 “the sea”

 “i dreamed sea lapping around winterfell saw black waves crashing gates towers salt water came flowing walls filled castle drowned men floating yard first dreamed dream back greywater didn’t know faces alebelly one guard called names feast septon’s another smith well”

 “mikken” bran confused dismayed “but sea hundreds hundreds leagues away winterfell’s walls high water couldn’t get even come”

 “in dark night salt sea flow walls” said jojen “i saw dead bloated drowned”

 “we tell them” bran said “alebelly mikken septon chayle tell drown”

 “it save them” replied boy green

 meera came window seat put hand shoulder “they believe bran did”

 jojen sat bran’s bed “tell dream”

 scared even sworn trust stark winterfell keeps sworn word “there’s different kinds” said slowly “there’s wolf dreams aren’t bad others run hunt kill squirrels there’s dreams crow comes tells fly sometimes tree dreams calling name frightens worst dreams fall” looked yard feeling miserable “i never used fall climbed went everyplace roofs along walls used feed crows burned tower mother afraid would fall knew never would sleep fall time”

 meera gave shoulder squeeze “is all”

 “i guess”

 “warg” said jojen reed

 bran looked eyes wide “what”

 “warg shapechanger beastling call ever hear wolf dreams”

 names made afraid “who call me”

 “your folk fear hate know even try kill you”

 old nan told scary stories beastlings shapechangers sometimes stories always evil “i’m like that” bran said “i’m it’s dreams”

 “the wolf dreams true dreams eye closed tight whenever you’re awake drift flutters open soul seeks half power strong you”

 “i don’t want want knight”

 “a knight want warg can’t change bran can’t deny push away winged wolf never fly” jojen got walked window “unless open eye” put two fingers together poked bran forehead hard

 raised hand spot bran felt smooth unbroken skin eye even closed one “how open it’s there”

 “you never find eye fingers bran must search heart” jojen studied bran’s face strange green eyes “or afraid”

 “maester luwin says there’s nothing dreams man need fear”

 “there is” said jojen

 “what”

 “the past future truth”

 left muddled ever alone bran tried open third eye didn’t know matter wrinkled forehead poked couldn’t see different he’d done days followed tried warn others jojen seen didn’t go wanted mikken thought funny “the sea happens always wanted see sea never got could go though it’s coming gods good take trouble poor smith”

 “the gods take see fit” septon chayle said quietly “though scarcely think likely i’ll drown bran grew banks white knife know i’m quite strong swimmer”

 alebelly one paid warning heed went talk jojen afterward stopped bathing refused go near well finally stank bad six guards threw tub scalding water scrubbed raw screamed going drown like frogboy said thereafter scowled whenever saw bran jojen castle muttered breath

 days alebelly’s bath ser rodrik returned winterfell prisoner fleshy young man fat moist lips long hair smelled like privy even worse alebelly “reek he’s called” hayhead said bran asked “i never heard true name served bastard bolton helped murder lady hornwood say”

 bastard dead bran learned evening supper ser rodrik’s men caught hornwood land something horrible bran wasn’t quite sure seemed something without clothes shot arrows tried ride away came late poor lady hornwood though wedding bastard locked tower neglected feed bran heard men saying ser rodrik smashed door found mouth bloody fingers chewed

 “the monster tied us thorny knot” old knight told maester luwin “like lady hornwood wife made say vows septon heart tree bedded night witnesses signed naming heir fixed seal it”

 “vows made sword point valid” maester argued

 “roose bolton may agree land issue” ser rodrik looked unhappy “would could take serving man’s head well he’s bad master fear must keep alive robb returns wars witness worst bastard’s crimes perhaps lord bolton hears tale abandon claim meantime manderly knights dreadfort men killing one another hornwood forests lack strength stop them” old knight turned seat gave bran stern look “and i’ve away lord prince commanding guardsmen wash want smelling like reek it”

 “the sea coming here” bran said “jojen saw green dream alebelly going drown”

 maester luwin tugged chain collar “the reed boy believes sees future dreams ser rodrik i’ve spoken bran uncertainty prophecies truth told trouble along stony shore raiders longships plundering fishing villages raping burning leobald tallhart sent nephew benfred deal expect they’ll take ships flee first sight armed men”

 “aye strike somewhere else others take cowards would never dare bastard bolton main strength thousand leagues south” ser rodrik looked bran “what else lad tell you”

 “he said water would flow walls saw alebelly drowned mikken septon chayle too”

 ser rodrik frowned “well happen need ride raiders shan’t take alebelly didn’t see drowned good”

 heartened bran hear maybe won’t drown thought stay away sea

 meera thought later night joien met bran room play threesided game tiles brother shook head “the things see green dreams can’t changed”

 made sister angry “why would gods send warning can’t heed change what’s come”

 “i don’t know” joien said sadly

 “if alebelly you’d probably jump well done fight bran too”

 “me” bran felt suddenly afraid “what fight going drown too”

 meera looked guiltily “i shouldn’t said…”

 could tell hiding something “did see green dream” asked jojen nervously “was drowned”

 “not drowned” jojen spoke every word pained “i dreamed man came today one call reek brother lay dead feet skinning faces long red blade”

 meera rose feet “if went dungeon could drive spear right heart could murder bran dead”

 “the gaolers stop you” joien said “the guards tell want dead they’ll never believe”

 “i guards too” bran reminded “alebelly poxy tym hayhead rest”

 jojen’s mossy eyes full pity “they won’t able stop bran couldn’t see saw end saw rickon crypts dark dead kings stone wolves”

 bran thought “if went away… greywater crow someplace far couldn’t find me…”

 “it matter dream green bran green dreams lie”





 tyrion

 vrys stood brazier warming soft hands “it would appear renly murdered fearfully midst army throat opened ear ear blade passed steel bone soft cheese”

 “murdered whose hand” cersei demanded

 “have ever considered many answers answer informers always highly placed might like king dies fancies sprout like mushrooms dark groom says renly slain knight rainbow guard washerwoman claims stannis stole heart brother’s army magic sword several menatarms believe woman fell deed cannot agree woman maid renly spurned claims one camp follower brought serve pleasure eve battle says second third ventures might lady catelyn stark”

 queen pleased “must waste time every rumor fools care tell”

 “you pay well rumors gracious queen”

 “we pay truth lord varys remember small council may grow smaller still”

 varys tittered nervously “you noble brother leave grace council continue”

 “i daresay realm could survive less councillors” said littlefinger smile

 “dear dear petyr” said varys “are concerned might next name hand’s little list”

 “before varys never dream it”

 “mayhaps brothers wall together i” varys giggled

 “sooner you’d like next words mouth something useful eunuch” look eyes cersei prepared castrate varys

 “might ruse” asked littlefinger

 “if ruse surpassing cleverness” said varys “it certainly hoodwinked me”

 tyrion heard enough “joff disappointed” said “he saving nice spike renly’s head whoever deed must assume stannis behind gain clearly his” like news counted brothers baratheon decimating bloody battle could feel elbow throbbing morningstar laid open sometimes damp squeezed uselessly hand asked “what renly’s host”

 “the greater part foot remains bitterbridge” varys abandoned brazier take seat table “most lords rode lord renly storm’s end gone bannerandblade stannis chivalry”

 “led florents i’d wager” said littlefinger

 varys gave simpering smile “you would win lord lord alester indeed first bend knee many others followed”

 “many” tyrion said pointedly “but all”

 “not all” agreed eunuch “not loras tyrell randyll tarly mathis rowan storm’s end yielded ser cortnay penrose holds castle renly’s name believe liege dead demands see mortal remains opens gates seems renly’s corpse unaccountably vanished carried away likely fifth renly’s knights departed ser loras rather bend knee stannis it’s said knight flowers went mad saw king’s body slew three renly’s guards wrath among emmon cuy robar royce”

 pity stopped three thought tyrion

 “ser loras likely making bitterbridge” varys went “his sister renly’s queen well great many soldiers suddenly find kingless side take ticklish question many serve lords remained storm’s end lords belong stannis”

 tyrion leaned forward “there chance seems win loras tyrell cause lord mace tyrell bannermen might join us well may sworn swords stannis moment yet cannot love man would start”

 “is love us greater” asked cersei

 “scarcely” said tyrion “they loved renly clearly renly slain perhaps give good sufficient reasons prefer joffrey stannis… move quickly”

 “what sort reasons mean give them”

 “gold reasons” littlefinger suggested

 varys made tsking sound “sweet petyr surely mean suggest puissant lords noble knights could bought like many chickens market”

 “have markets late lord varys” asked littlefinger “you’d find easier buy lord chicken daresay course lords cluck prouder chickens take ill offer coin like tradesman seldom adverse taking gifts… honors lands castles…”

 “bribes might sway lesser lords” tyrion said “but never highgarden”

 “true” littlefinger admitted “the knight flowers key mace tyrell two older sons loras always favorite win highgarden yours”

 yes tyrion thought “it seems take lesson late lord renly win tyrell alliance marriage”

 varys understood quickest “you think wed king joffrey margaery tyrell”

 “i do” renly’s young queen fifteen sixteen seemed recall… older joffrey years nothing neat sweet could taste

 “joffrey betrothed sansa stark” cersei objected

 “marriage contracts broken advantage wedding king daughter dead traitor”

 littlefinger spoke “you might point grace tyrells much wealthier starks margaery said lovely… beddable besides”

 “yes” said tyrion “joff ought like well enough”

 “my son young care things”

 “you think so” asked tyrion “he’s thirteen cersei age married”

 “you shamed us sorry episode joffrey made finer stuff”

 “so fine ser boros rip sansa’s gown”

 “he angry girl”

 “he angry cook’s boy spilled soup last night well didn’t strip naked”

 “this matter spilled soup—”

 matter pretty teats business yard tyrion spoken varys might arrange joffrey visit chataya’s taste honey might sweeten boy hoped might even grateful gods forbid tyrion could shade gratitude sovereign would need done secretly course tricky bit would parting hound “the dog never far master’s heels” he’d observed varys “but men sleep gamble whore visit winesinks well”

 “the hound things question”

 “no” said tyrion “my question when”

 varys laid finger cheek smiling enigmatically “my lord suspicious man might think wished find time sandor clegane protecting king joffrey better boy harm”

 “surely know better lord varys” tyrion said “why want joffrey love me”

 eunuch promised look matter war made demands though joffrey’s initiation manhood would need wait “doubtless know son better do” made tell cersei “but regardless there’s still much said tyrell marriage may way joffrey lives long enough reach wedding night”

 littlefinger agreed “the stark girl brings joffrey nothing body sweet may margaery tyrell brings fifty thousand swords strength highgarden”

 “indeed” varys laid soft hand queen’s sleeve “you mother’s heart know grace loves little sweetling yet kings must learn put needs realm desires say offer must made”

 queen pulled free eunuch’s touch “you would speak women say lords joffrey proud settle renly’s leavings never consent”

 tyrion shrugged “when king comes age three years may give withhold consent pleases regent hand marry whomever tell marry leavings no”

 cersei’s quiver empty “make offer gods save joff like girl”

 “i’m pleased agree” tyrion said “now us shall go bitterbridge must reach ser loras offer blood cool”

 “you mean send one council”

 “i scarcely expect knight flowers treat bronn shagga tyrells proud”

 sister wasted time trying twist situation advantage “ser jacelyn bywater nobly born send him”

 tyrion shook head “we need someone repeat words fetch back reply envoy must speak king council settle matter quickly”

 “the hand speaks king’s voice” candlelight gleamed green wildfire cersei’s eyes “if send tyrion joffrey went better wield words skillfully jaime wields sword”

 eager get city cersei “you kind sister seems boy’s mother better fitted arrange marriage uncle gift winning friends could never hope match”

 eyes narrowed “joff needs side”

 “your grace lord hand” said littlefinger “the king needs let go stead”

 “you” gain see tyrion wondered

 “i king’s council yet king’s blood would make poor hostage knew ser loras passing well court gave cause mislike mace tyrell bears enmity know flatter unskilled negotiation”

 us tyrion trust petyr baelish want man sight yet choice left must littlefinger tyrion knew full well left king’s landing length time managed accomplish would undone “there fighting bitterbridge” said cautiously “and past certain lord stannis dispatching shepherds gather brother’s wayward lambs”

 “i’ve never frightened shepherds it’s sheep trouble still suppose escort might order”

 “i spare hundred gold cloaks” tyrion said

 “five hundred”

 “three hundred”

 “and forty more—twenty knights many squires arrive without knightly tail tyrells think small account”

 true enough “agreed”

 “i’ll include horror slobber party send lord father afterward gesture goodwill need paxter redwyne he’s mace tyrell’s oldest friend great power right”

 “and traitor” queen said balking “the arbor would declared renly rest except redwyne knew full well whelps would suffer it”

 “renly dead grace” littlefinger pointed “and neither stannis lord paxter forgotten redwyne galleys closed sea siege storm’s end restore twins perchance may win redwyne’s love”

 cersei remained unconvinced “the others keep love want swords sails holding tight twins best way make certain we’ll them”

 tyrion answer “then let us send ser hobber back arbor keep ser horas lord paxter ought clever enough riddle meaning think”

 suggestion carried without protest littlefinger done “we’ll want horses swift strong fighting make remounts hard come goodly supply gold also needed gifts spoke earlier”

 “take much require city falls stannis steal anyway”

 “i’ll want commission writing document leave mace tyrell doubt authority granting full power treat concerning match arrangements might required make binding pledges king’s name signed joffrey every member council bear seals”

 tyrion shifted uncomfortably “done remind there’s long road bitterbridge”

 “i’ll riding dawn breaks” littlefinger rose “i trust return king see suitably rewarded valiant efforts cause”

 varys giggled “joffrey grateful sovereign i’m certain cause complain good brave lord”

 queen direct “what want petyr”

 littlefinger glanced tyrion sly smile “i shall need give consideration doubt i’ll think something” sketched airy bow took leave casual one brothels

 tyrion glanced window fog thick could even see curtain wall across yard dim lights shone indistinct greyness foul day travel thought envy petyr baelish “we best see drawing documents lord varys send parchment quill someone need wake joffrey”

 still grey dark meeting finally ended varys scurried alone soft slippers whisking along floor lannisters lingered moment door “how comes chain brother” queen asked ser preston fastened vairlined clothofsilver cloak shoulders

 “link link grows longer thank gods ser cortnay penrose stubborn stannis never march north storm’s end untaken rear”

 “tyrion know always agree policy seems wrong big fool imagined truth realize great help thank must forgive spoken harshly past”

 “must i” gave shrug smile “sweet sister said nothing requires forgiveness”

 “today mean” laughed… cersei leaned planted quick soft kiss brow

 astonished words tyrion could watch stride hall ser preston side “have lost wits sister kiss me” asked bronn gone

 “was sweet”

 “it was… unanticipated” cersei behaving queerly late tyrion found unsettling “i trying recall last time kissed could six seven jaime dared it”

 “the woman’s finally taken note charms”

 “no” tyrion said “no woman hatching something best find bronn know hate surprises”

 “your lord father commanded us harry coast more” eyes pale sea foam watched theon shaggy white eyebrows disapproval saw spark interest latter thought… hoped…

 “you father’s man”

 “to strike terror heart foe one name could you’ll take great part force march torrhen’s square helman tallhart took best men south benfred died sons uncle leobald remain small garrison” able question benfred would know small “make secret approach sing brave songs like want close gates”

 “is torrhen’s square strong keep”

 “strong enough walls stone thirty feet high square towers corner square keep within”

 “stone walls cannot fired take numbers storm even small castle”

 “you make camp outside walls set building catapults siege engines”

 “that old way forgotten ironmen fight swords axes flinging rocks glory starving foeman”

 “leobald know sees raising siege towers old woman’s blood run cold bleat help stay archers uncle let raven fly castellan winterfell brave man age stiffened wits well limbs learns one king’s bannermen attack fearsome dagmer cleftjaw summon strength ride tallhart’s aid duty ser rodrik nothing dutiful”

 “any force summons larger mine” dagmer said “and old knights cunning think would never lived see first grey hair set us battle cannot hope win theon torrhen’s square never fall”

 theon smiled “it’s torrhen’s square mean take”

 catelyn

 two days ride riverrun scout spied watering horses beside muddy steam catelyn never glad see twin tower badge house frey

 asked lead uncle said “the blackfish gone west king lady martyn rivers commands outriders stead”

 “i see” met rivers twins baseborn son lord walder frey half brother ser perwyn surprise learn robb struck heart lannister power clearly contemplating sent away treat renly “where rivers now”

 “his camp two hours ride lady”

 “take us him” commanded brienne helped back saddle set

 “have come bitterbridge lady” scout asked

 “no” dared renly dead catelyn uncertain reception might receive young widow protectors instead ridden heart war fertile riverlands turned blackened desert fury lannisters night scouts brought back tales made ill “lord renly slain” added

 “we’d hoped tale lannister lie or—”

 “would brother commands riverrun”

 “yes lady grace left ser edmure hold riverrun guard rear”

 gods grant strength catelyn thought wisdom well “is word robb west”

 “you heard” man seemed surprised “his grace great victory oxcross ser stafford lannister dead host scattered”

 ser wendel manderly gave whoop pleasure catelyn nodded tomorrow’s trials concerned yesterday’s triumphs

 martyn rivers made camp shell shattered holdfast beside roofless stable hundred fresh graves went one knee catelyn dismounted “well met lady brother charged us keep eye party escort back riverrun haste come upon you”

 catelyn scarce liked sound “is father”

 “no lady lord hoster unchanged” rivers ruddy man scant resemblance half brothers “it feared might chance upon lannister scouts lord tywin left harrenhal marches west power”

 “rise” told rivers frowning stannis baratheon would soon march well gods help “how long lord tywin upon us”

 “three days perhaps four hard know eyes along roads would best linger”

 rivers broke camp quickly saddled beside set near fifty strong flying beneath direwolf leaping trout twin towers

 men wanted hear robb’s victory oxcross rivers obliged “there’s singer come riverrun calls rymund rhymer he’s made song fight doubtless you’ll hear sung tonight lady ‘wolf night’ rymund calls it” went tell remnants ser stafford’s host fallen back lannisport without siege engines way storm casterly rock young wolf paying lannisters back kind devastation they’d inflicted riverlands lords karstark glover raiding along coast lady mormont captured thousands cattle driving back toward riverrun greatjon seized gold mines castamere nunn’s deep pendric hills ser wendel laughed “nothing’s like bring lannister running threat gold”

 “how king ever take tooth” ser perwyn frey asked bastard brother “that’s hard strong keep commands hill road”

 “he never took slipped around night it’s said direwolf showed way grey wind beast sniffed goat track wound defile along beneath ridge crooked stony way yet wide enough men riding single file lannisters watchtowers got much glimpse them” rivers lowered voice “there’s say battle king cut stafford lannister’s heart fed wolf”

 “i would believe tales” catelyn said sharply “my son savage”

 “as say lady still it’s beast deserved common wolf one greatjon’s heard say old gods north sent direwolves children”

 catelyn remembered day boys found pups late summer snows five three male two female five trueborn children house stark… sixth white fur red eye ned’s bastard son jon snow common wolves thought indeed

 night made camp brienne sought tent “my lady safely back among day’s ride brother’s castle give leave go”

 catelyn surprised homely young woman kept journey spending time horses brushing coats pulling stones shoes helped shadd cook clean game well soon proved could hunt well task catelyn asked turn hand brienne performed deftly without complaint spoken answered politely never chattered wept laughed ridden every day slept among every night without ever truly becoming one

 renly catelyn thought feast melee even renly’s pavilion brothers rainbow guard walls around one higher winterfell’s

 “if left us would go” catelyn asked

 “back” brienne said “to storm’s end”

 “alone” question

 broad face pool still water giving hint might live depths “yes”

 “you mean kill stannis”

 brienne closed thick callused fingers around hilt sword

 sword “i swore vow three times swore heard me”

 “i did” catelyn admitted girl kept rainbow cloak discarded rest bloodstained clothing knew brienne’s things left behind flight forced clothe odd bits ser wendel’s spare garb since one else party garments large enough fit “vows kept agree stannis great host around guards sworn keep safe”

 “i afraid guards good never fled”

 “is troubles fool might call craven” sighed “renly’s death fault youts served valiantly seek follow earth serve one” stretched hand give comfort touch could give “i know hard is—”

 brienne shook hand “no one knows”

 “you’re wrong” catelyn said sharply “every morning wake remember ned gone skill swords mean dream riding king’s landing wrapping hands around cersei lannister’s white throat squeezing face turns black”

 beauty raised eyes part truly beautiful “if dream would seek hold back stannis said parley”

 catelyn glanced across camp two men walking sentry spears hand “i taught good men must fight evil world renly’s death evil beyond doubt yet also taught gods make kings swords men stannis rightful king—”

 “he’s robert never rightful king either even renly said much jaime lannister murdered rightful king robert killed lawful heir trident gods gods don’t care men kings care peasants”

 “a good king care”

 “lord renly… grace he… would best king lady good he…”

 “he gone brienne” said gently could “stannis joffrey remain… son”

 “he wouldn’t… you’d never make peace stannis would bend knee wouldn’t…”

 “i tell true brienne know son may king queen… mother would keep children safe however could”

 “i made mother need fight”

 “then fight… living dead renly’s enemies robb’s enemies well”

 brienne stared ground shuffled feet “i know son lady” looked “i could serve would me”

 catelyn startled “why me”

 question seemed trouble brienne “you helped pavilion… thought had… had…”

 “you innocent”

 “even could let kill nothing you”

 perhaps want one knew dark truth happened catelyn thought “brienne taken many wellborn ladies service years never one like battle commander”

 “no courage battle courage perhaps but… don’t know… kind woman’s courage think time comes try hold back promise hold back stannis”

 catelyn could still hear stannis saying robb’s turn would come time like cold breath back neck “when time comes hold back”

 tall girl knelt awkwardly unsheathed renly’s longsword laid feet “then lady liege man or… whatever would shield back keep counsel give life need swear old gods new”

 “and vow shall always place hearth meat mead table pledge ask service might bring dishonor swear old gods new arise” clasped woman’s hands catelyn could help smile many times watch ned accept man’s oath service wondered would think could see

 forded red fork late next day upstream riverrun river made wide loop waters grew muddy shallow crossing guarded mixed force archers pikemen wearing eagle badge mallisters saw catelyn’s banners emerged behind sharpened stakes sent man far bank lead party across “slow careful like milady” warned took bridle horse “we’ve planted iron spikes water y’see there’s caltrops scattered among rocks it’s fords brother’s command”

 edmure thinks fight realization gave queasy feeling bowels held tongue

 red fork tumblestone joined stream smallfolk making safety riverrun driving animals others pulling wayns made way catelyn rode past cheered cries “tully” “stark” half mile castle passed large encampment scarlet banner blackwoods waved lord’s tent lucas took leave seek father lord tytos rest rode

 catelyn spied second camp strung along bank north tumblestone familiar standards flapping wind—marq piper’s dancing maiden darry’s plowman twining redandwhite snakes paeges father’s bannermen lords trident left riverrun defend lands could mean edmure called back gods save us it’s true means offer battle lord tywin

 something dark dangling walls riverrun catelyn saw distance rode close saw dead men hanging battlements slumped ends long ropes hempen nooses tight around necks faces swollen black crows crimson cloaks still showed bright sandstone walls

 “they hanged lannisters” hal mollen observed

 “a pretty sight” ser wendel manderly said cheerfully

 “our friends begun without us” perwyn frey jested others laughed brienne gazed row bodies unblinking neither spoke smiled

 slain kingslayer daughters dead well catelyn spurred horse canter hal mollen robin flint raced past gallop halooing gatehouse guards walls doubtless spied banners time ago portcullis approached

 edmure rode castle meet surrounded three father’s sworn men—greatbellied ser desmond grell masteratarms utherydes wayn steward ser robin ryger riverrun’s big bald captain guards three age lord hoster men spent lives father’s service old men catelyn realized

 edmure wore blueandred cloak tunic embroidered silver fish look shaved since rode south beard fiery bush “cat good safely back heard renly’s death feared life lord tywin march well”

 “so told fares father”

 “one day seems stronger next…” shook head “he’s asked know tell him”

 “i go soon” vowed “has word storm’s end since renly died bitterbridge” ravens came men road catelyn anxious know happened behind

 “nothing bitterbridge storm’s end three birds castellan ser cortnay penrose carrying plea stannis surrounded land sea offers allegiance whatsoever king break siege fears boy says boy would know”

 “edric storm” brienne told “robert’s bastard son”

 edmure looked curiously “stannis sworn garrison might go free unharmed provided yield castle within fortnight deliver boy hands ser cortnay consent”

 risks baseborn boy whose blood even catelyn thought “did send answer”

 edmure shook head “why neither help hope offer stannis enemy ours”

 ser robin ryger spoke “my lady tell us manner lord renly’s death tales we’ve heard queer”

 “cat” brother said “some say killed renly others claim southron woman” glance lingered brienne

 “my king murdered” girl said quietly “and lady catelyn swear sword gods old new”

 “this brienne tarth daughter lord selwyn evenstar served renly’s rainbow guard” catelyn told “brienne honored acquaint brother ser edmure tully heir riverrun steward utherydes wayn ser robin ryger ser desmond grell”

 “honored” said ser desmond others echoed girl flushed embarrassed even commonplace courtesy edmure thought curious sort lady least grace say

 “brienne renly killed i” said catelyn “but part death” care speak shadow open men around waved hand bodies “who men you’ve hanged”

 edmure glanced uncomfortably “they came ser cleos brought queen’s answer peace offer”

 catelyn shocked “you’ve killed envoys”

 “false envoys” edmure declared “they pledged peace surrendered weapons allowed freedom castle three nights ate meat drank mead whilst talked ser cleos fourth night tried free kingslayer” pointed “that big brute killed two guards naught ham hands caught throats smashed skulls together skinny lad beside opening lannister’s cell bit wire gods curse one end sort damned mummer used voice command river gate opened guardsmen swear enger delp long lew three ask man sounded nothing like yet oafs raising portcullis same”

 imp’s work catelyn suspected stank sort cunning displayed eyrie would named tyrion least dangerous lannisters certain “how caught them”

 “ah happened castle i’d crossed tumblestone ah…”

 “you whoring wenching get tale”

 edmure’s cheeks flamed red beard “it hour dawn returning long lew saw boat recognized finally thought wonder standing barking commands raised cry”

 “tell kingslayer retaken”

 “yes though easily jaime got hold sword slew poul pernford ser desmond’s squire myles wounded delp badly maester vyman fears he’ll soon die well bloody mess sound steel red cloaks rushed join barehand hanged beside four freed threw rest dungeons jaime we’ll escapes one he’s dark time chained hand foot bolted wall”

 “and cleos frey”

 “he swears knew naught plot say man half lannister half frey liar put jaime’s old tower cell”

 “you say brought terms”

 “if call you’ll like promise”

 “can hope help south lady stark” asked utherydes wayn father’s steward “this charge incest… lord tywin suffer slights lightly seek wash stain daughter’s name blood accuser lord stannis must see choice make common cause us”

 stannis made common cause power greater darker “let us speak matters later” catelyn trotted drawbridge putting grisly row dead lannisters behind brother kept pace rode bustle riverrun’s upper bailey naked toddler ran front horses catelyn jerked reins hard avoid glancing dismay hundreds smallfolk admitted castle allowed erect crude shelters walls children everywhere underfoot yard teemed cows sheep chickens “who folk”

 “my people” edmure answered “they afraid”

 sweet brother would crowd useless mouths castle might soon siege catelyn knew edmure soft heart sometimes thought head even softer loved yet still…

 “can robb reached raven”

 “he’s field lady” ser desmond replied “the bird would way find him”

 utherydes wayn coughed “before left us young king instructed us send twins upon return lady stark asks learn lord walder’s daughters help select bride time comes”

 “we’ll provide fresh mounts provisions” brother promised “you’ll want refresh before—”

 “i’ll want stay” catelyn said dismounting intention leaving riverrun dying father pick robb’s wife robb wants safe cannot fault pretext growing threadbare “boy” called urchin stables ran take reins horse

 edmure swung saddle head taller would always little brother “cat” said unhappily “lord tywin coming—”

 “he making west defend lands close gates shelter behind walls watch pass safety”

 “this tully land” edmure declared “if tywin lannister thinks cross unbloodied mean teach hard lesson”

 lesson taught son brother could stubborn river rock pride touched neither likely forget ser jaime cut edmure’s host bloody pieces last time offered battle “we nothing gain everything lose meeting lord tywin field” catelyn said tactfully

 “the yard place discuss battle plans”

 “as shall go”

 brother’s face darkened moment thought lose temper finally snapped “the godswood insist”

 followed along gallery godswood gate edmure’s anger always sulky sullen thing catelyn sorry wounded matter important concern pride alone beneath trees edmure turned face

 “you strength meet lannisters field” said bluntly

 “when strength marshaled eight thousand foot three thousand horse” edmure said

 “which means lord tywin near twice numbers”

 “robb’s battles worse odds” edmure replied “and plan you’ve forgotten roose bolton lord tywin defeated green fork failed pursue lord tywin went harrenhal bolton took ruby ford crossroads ten thousand men i’ve sent word helman tallhart join garrison robb left twins—”

 “edmure robb left men hold twins make certain lord walder keeps faith us”

 “he has” edmure said stubbornly “the freys fought bravely whispering wood old ser stevron died oxcross hear ser ryman black walder rest robb west martyn great service scouting ser perwyn helped see safe renly gods good much ask robb’s betrothed one lord walder’s daughters roose bolton wed another hear haven’t taken two grandsons fostered winterfell”

 “a ward easily become hostage need be” known ser stevron dead bolton’s marriage

 “if we’re two hostages good reason lord walder dare play us false bolton needs frey’s men ser helman’s well i’ve commanded retake harrenhal”

 “that’s like bloody business”

 “yes castle falls lord tywin safe retreat levies defend fords red fork crossing attacks across river he’ll end rhaegar tried cross trident holds back he’ll caught riverrun harrenhal robb returns west finish good all”

 brother’s voice full brusque confidence catelyn found wishing robb taken uncle brynden west blackfish veteran half hundred battles edmure veteran one one lost

 “the plan’s good one” concluded “lord tytos says lord jonos well blackwood bracken agree anything certain ask you”

 “be may” suddenly weary perhaps wrong oppose perhaps splendid plan misgivings woman’s fears wished ned uncle brynden or…“have asked father this”

 “father state weigh strategies two days ago making plans marriage brandon stark go see believe plan work cat you’ll see”

 “i hope edmure truly do” kissed cheek let know meant went find father

 lord hoster tully much left him—abed haggard flesh pale clammy room smelled sickness cloying odor made equal parts stale sweat medicine pulled back drapes father gave low moan eyes fluttered open stared could comprehend wanted

 “father” kissed “i returned”

 seemed know “you’ve come” whispered faintly lips barely moving

 “yes” said “robb sent south hurried back”

 “south… where… eyrie south sweetling don’t recall… oh dear heart afraid… forgiven child” tears ran cheeks

 “you’ve done nothing needs forgiveness father” stroked limp white hair felt brow fever still burned within despite maester’s potions

 “it best” father whispered “jon’s good man good… strong kind… take care you… will… well born listen must i’m father… father… you’ll wed cat yes will…”

 thinks i’m lysa catelyn realized gods good talks married yet

 father’s hands clutched fluttering like two frightened white birds “that stripling… wretched boy… speak name duty… mother would…” lord hoster cried spasm pain washed “oh gods forgive forgive forgive medicine…”

 maester vyman holding cup lips lord hoster sucked thick white potion eager babe breast catelyn could see peace settle “he’ll sleep lady” maester said cup empty milk poppy left thick white film around father’s mouth maester vyman wiped away sleeve

 catelyn could watch hoster tully strong man proud hurt see reduced went terrace yard crowded refugees chaotic noises beyond walls rivers flowed clean pure endless rivers soon return last voyage

 maester vyman followed “my lady” said softly “i cannot keep end bay much longer ought send rider brother ser brynden would wish here”

 “yes” catelyn said voice thick grief

 “and lady lysa well perhaps”

 “lysa come”

 “if wrote perhaps…”

 “i put words paper please you” wondered lysa’s “wretched stripling” young squire hedge knight like not… though vehemence lord hoster opposed might tradesman’s son baseborn apprentice even singer lysa always fond singers must blame jon arryn twenty years older father however noble

 tower brother set aside use lysa shared maids would feel good sleep featherbed warm fire hearth rested world would seem less bleak

 outside chambers found utherydes wayn waiting two women clad grey faces cowled save eyes catelyn knew “ned”

 sisters lowered gaze utherydes said “ser cleos brought king’s landing lady”

 “take him” commanded

 laid trestle table covered banner white banner house stark grey direwolf sigil “i would look him” catelyn said

 “only bones remain lady”

 “i would look him” repeated

 one silent sisters turned banner

 bones catelyn thought ned man loved father children hands clasped together chest skeletal fingers curled hilt longsword ned’s hands strong full life dressed bones ned’s surcoat fine white velvet direwolf badge heart nothing remained warm flesh pillowed head many nights arms held head rejoined body fine silver wire one skull looks much like another empty hollows found trace lord’s dark grey eyes eyes could soft fog hard stone gave eyes crows remembered

 catelyn turned away “that sword”

 “ice returned us lady” utherydes said “only lord eddard’s bones”

 “i suppose must thank queen even much”

 “thank imp lady doing”

 one day thank “i grateful service sisters” catelyn said “but must lay another task upon lord eddard stark bones must laid rest beneath winterfell” make statue stone likeness sit dark direwolf feet sword across knees “make certain sisters fresh horses aught else need journey” told utherydes wayn “hal mollen escort back winterfell place captain guards” gazed bones remained lord love “now leave would alone ned tonight”

 women grey bowed heads silent sisters speak living catelyn remembered dully say talk dead envied that…

 “to go north must journey south reach west must go east go forward must go back touch light must pass beneath shadow”

 asshai dany thought would go asshai “will asshai’i give army” demanded “will gold asshai ships asshai find qarth”

 “truth” said woman mask bowing faded back crowd

 “he asked marry again”

 “yes know why” knight frowned heavy black brows joined together deepset eyes

 “he dreams day night” laughed

 “one thing” repeated “and may denied”

 “with one dragon xaro xhoan daxos would rule city one ship cause little”

 dany nibbled onion reflected ruefully faithlessness men “we passed bazaar way back hall thousand thrones” told ser jorah “quaithe there” told firemage fiery ladder woman red mask told

 “i would glad leave city truth told” knight said done “but asshai”

 “where then”

 “even illyrio friend think him” knight said stubbornly “he powerful enough enthrone could brother”

 “sellswords uses” ser jorah admitted “but win father’s throne sweepings free cities nothing knits broken realm together quick invading army soil”

 “i rightful queen” dany protested

 “you stranger means land shores army outlanders cannot even speak common tongue lords westeros know every reason fear mistrust must win sail least”

 “and go east counsel”

 “we held city today lord make promises morrow kettle close boiling many thieves murderers abroad man’s house safe bloody flux spreading stews along pisswater bend there’s food copper silver heard mutterings gutter there’s open talk treason guildhalls markets”

 “do need men”

 “i trust half men slynt tripled size watch takes gold cloak make watchman good men loyal among new recruits also brutes sots cravens traitors you’d care know they’re halftrained undisciplined loyalty skins comes battle they’ll hold fear”

 “i never expected to” said tyrion “once walls breeched lost i’ve known start”

 “my men largely drawn smallfolk walk streets drink winesinks spoon bowls brown potshops eunuch must told small love lannisters king’s landing many still remember lord father sacked city aerys opened gates whisper gods punishing us sins house—for brother’s murder king aerys butchery rhaegar’s children execution eddard stark savagery joffrey’s justice talk openly much better things robert king hint times would better stannis throne potshops winesinks brothels hear things—and barracks guardhalls well fear”

 “they hate family telling me”

 “aye… turn chance comes”

 “me well”

 “ask eunuch”

 “i’m asking you”

 bywater’s deepset eyes met dwarf’s mismatched ones blink “you lord”

 “most all” injustice like choke “it joffrey told eat dead joffrey set dog could blame me”

 “his grace boy streets said evil councillors queen never known friend commons lord varys called spider love… blame sister eunuch times better king robert say you’ve filled city swaggering sellswords unwashed savages brutes take want follow laws say exiled janos slynt found bluff honest liking say threw wise gentle pycelle dungeons dared raise voice even claim mean seize iron throne own”

 “yes monster besides hideous misshapen never forget that” hand coiled fist “i’ve heard enough work attend leave me”

 perhaps lord father right despise years best achieve tyrion thought alone stared remains supper belly roiling sight cold greasy capon disgusted pushed away shouted pod sent boy running summon varys bronn trusted advisers eunuch sellsword lady’s whore say

 bronn complained gloom arrived insisted fire hearth blazing time varys made appearance “where been” tyrion demanded

 “about king’s business sweet lord”

 “ah yes king” tyrion muttered “my nephew fit sit privy let alone iron throne”

 varys shrugged “an apprentice must taught trade”

 “half ’prentices reeking lane could rule better king yours” bronn seated across table pulled wing capon

 tyrion made practice ignoring sellsword’s frequent insolences tonight found galling “i don’t recall giving leave finish supper”

 “you didn’t look eating it” bronn said mouthful meat “city’s starving it’s crime waste food wine”

 next he’ll want pour tyrion thought darkly “you go far” warned

 “and never go far enough” bronn tossed wingbone rushes “ever think easy life would one born first” thrust fingers inside capon tore handful breast “the weepy one tommen seems like he’d whatever told good king should”

 chill crept tyrion’s spine realized sellsword hinting tommen king…

 one way tommen would become king could even think joffrey blood jaime’s son much cersei’s “i could head saying that” told bronn sellsword laughed

 “friends” said varys “quarreling serve us beg take heart”

 “whose” asked tyrion sourly could think several tempting choices





 davos

 shares pavilion davos wondered pray another way soothe sleep unworthy question one dared ask even son devan good boy wore flaming heart proudly doublet father seen nightfires dusk fell beseeching lord light bring dawn king’s squire told expected would take king’s god

 davos almost forgotten high thick walls storm’s end loomed close king stannis halted beneath feet ser cortnay standardbearer “ser” said stiff courtesy made move dismount

 “my lord” less courteous unexpected

 “it customary grant king style grace” announced lord florent red gold fox poked shining snout breastplate circle lapis lazuli flowers tall courtly rich lord brightwater keep first renly’s bannermen declare stannis first renounce old gods take lord light stannis left queen dragonstone along uncle axell queen’s men numerous powerful ever alester florent foremost

 ser cortnay penrose ignored preferring address stannis “this notable company great lords estermont errol varner ser jon greenapple fossoways ser bryan red lord caron ser guyard king renly’s rainbow guard… puissant lord alester florent brightwater sure onion knight spy rear well met ser davos fear know lady”

 “i named melisandre ser” alone came unarmored flowing red robes throat great ruby drank daylight “i serve king lord light”

 “i wish well lady” ser cortnay answered “but bow gods different king”

 “there one true king one true god” announced lord florent

 “are dispute theology lord known would brought septon”

 “you know full well here” said stannis “you fortnight consider offer sent ravens help come storm’s end stands alone patience one last time ser command open gates deliver mine rights”

 “and terms” asked ser cortnay

 “remain before” said stannis “i pardon treason pardoned lords see behind men garrison free enter service return unmolested homes may keep weapons much property man carry require horses pack animals however”

 “and edric storm”

 “my brother’s bastard must surrendered me”

 “then answer still lord”

 king clenched jaw said nothing

 melisandre spoke instead “may lord light protect darkness ser cortnay”

 “may others bugger lord light” penrose spat back “and wipe arse rag bear”

 lord alester florent cleared throat “ser cortnay mind tongue grace means boy harm child blood mine well niece delena mother men know trust king trust know man honor—”

 “i know man ambition” ser cortnay broke “a man changes kings gods way change boots turncloaks see me”

 angry clamor went king’s men far wrong davos thought short time fossoways guyard morrigen lords caron varner errol estermont belonged renly sat pavilion helped make battle plans plotted stannis might brought low lord florent them—he might queen selyse’s uncle kept lord brightwater bending knee renly renly’s star rising

 bryce caron walked horse forward paces long rainbowstriped cloak twisting wind bay “no man turncloak ser fealty belongs storm’s end king stannis rightful lord… true king last house baratheon robert’s heir renly’s”

 “if knight flowers among mathis rowan randyll tarly lady oakheart company loved renly best brienne tarth ask you”

 “that one” ser guyard morrigen laughed harshly “she ran well might hand slew king”

 “a lie” ser cortnay said “i knew brienne girl playing father’s feet evenfall hall knew still better evenstar sent storm’s end loved renly baratheon first moment laid eyes blind man could see it”

 “to sure” declared lord florent airily “and would scarcely first maid maddened murder man spurned though part believe lady stark slew king journeyed way riverrun plead alliance renly refused doubt saw danger son removed him”

 “it brienne” insisted lord caron “ser emmon cuy swore much died oath ser cortnay”

 contempt thickened ser cortnay’s voice “and worth wear cloak many colors see one renly gave swore oath protect dead not” turned scorn guyard morrigen “i might ask ser guyard green yes rainbow guard sworn give life king’s cloak would ashamed wear it”

 morrigen bristled “be glad parley penrose would tongue words”

 “and cast fire left manhood”

 “enough” stannis said “the lord light willed brother die treason deed matters not”

 “not perhaps” said ser cortnay “i heard proposal lord stannis mine” pulled glove flung full king’s face “single combat sword lance weapon care name fear hazard magic sword royal skin old man name champion shall same” gave guyard morrigen bryce caron scathing look “either pups would nicely think”

 ser guyard morrigen grew dark fury “i take gage please king”

 “as would i” bryce caron looked stannis

 king ground teeth “no”

 ser cortnay seem surprised “is justice cause doubt lord strength arm afraid i’ll piss burning sword put out”

 “do take utter fool ser” asked stannis “i twenty thousand men besieged land sea would choose single combat eventual victory certain” king pointed finger “i give fair warning force take castle storm may expect mercy hang traitors every one you”

 “as gods bring storm lord—and recall name castle” ser cortnay gave pull reins rode back toward gate

 stannis said word turned horse around started back toward camp others followed “if storm walls thousands die” fretted ancient lord estermont king’s grandfather mother’s side “better hazard single life surely cause righteous gods must surely bless champion’s arms victory”

 god old man thought davos forget one melisandre’s lord light

 ser jon fossoway said “i would gladly take challenge though i’m half swordsman lord caron ser guyard renly left notable knights storm’s end garrison duty old men green boys”

 lord caron agreed “an easy victory sure glory win storm’s end single stroke”

 stannis raked look “you chatter like magpies less sense quiet” king’s eyes fell davos “ser ride me” spurred horse away followers melisandre kept pace bearing great standard fiery heart crowned stag within swallowed whole

 davos saw looks passed lordlings rode past join king onion knights proud men houses whose names old honor somehow knew renly never chided fashion youngest baratheons born gift easy courtesy brother sadly lacked

 eased back slow trot horse came beside king’s “your grace” seen close hand stannis looked worse davos realized afar face grown haggard dark circles eyes

 “a smuggler must fair judge men” king said “what make ser cortnay penrose”

 “a stubborn man” said davos carefully

 “hungry death call throws pardon face aye throws life away bargain lives every man inside walls single combat” king snorted derision “no doubt mistook robert”

 “more like desperate hope have”

 “none castle fall quickly” stannis brooded moment steady clopclop hooves davos could hear faint sound king grinding teeth “lord alester urges bring old lord penrose ser cortnay’s father know man believe”

 “when came envoy lord penrose received courteously most” davos said “he old done man sire sickly failing”

 “florent would fail visibly son’s sight noose neck”

 dangerous oppose queen’s men davos vowed always tell king truth “i think would ill done liege ser cortnay watch father die would ever betray trust would gain us nothing bring dishonor cause”

 “what dishonor” stannis bristled “would spare lives traitors”

 “you spared lives behind us”

 “do scold smuggler”

 “it place” davos feared said much

 king relentless “you esteem penrose lords bannermen why”

 “he keeps faith”

 “a misplaced faith dead usurper”

 “yes” davos admitted “but still keeps faith”

 “as behind us not”

 davos come far stannis play coy “last year robert’s men moon ago renly’s morning whose morrow”

 stannis laughed sudden gust rough full scorn “i told melisandre” said red woman “my onion knight tells truth”

 “i see know well grace” red woman said

 “davos missed sorely” king said “aye tail traitors nose deceive lords bannermen inconstant even treasons need know sickens pardon punished better men lesser crimes every right reproach ser davos”

 “you reproach ever could grace must great lords win throne—”

 “fingers seems” stannis smiled grimly

 unthinking davos raised maimed hand pouch throat felt fingerbones within luck

 king saw motion “are still onion knight lost them”

 “no”

 “why keep often wondered”

 “they remind came remind justice liege”

 “it justice” stannis said “a good act wash bad bad act good reward hero smuggler” glanced behind lord florent others rainbow knights turncloaks following distance “these pardoned lords would well reflect good men true fight joffrey wrongly believing true king northman might even say robb stark lords flocked brother’s banners knew usurper turned backs rightful king better reason dreams power glory marked pardoned yes forgiven forgotten” fell silent moment brooding plans justice abruptly said “what smallfolk say renly’s death”

 “they grieve brother well loved”

 “fools love fool” grumbled stannis “but grieve well boy man grew be” silent time said “how commons take news cersei’s incest”

 “while among shouted king stannis cannot speak said sailed”

 “so think believed”

 “when smuggling learned men believe everything nothing met sorts another tale spread well—”

 “yes” stannis bit word “selyse given horns tied fool’s bells end daughter fathered halfwit jester tale vile absurd renly threw teeth met parley would need mad patchface believe thing”

 “that may liege… whether believe story delight tell it” many places come poisoning well true tale

 “robert could piss cup men would call wine offer pure cold water squint suspicion mutter queer tastes” stannis ground teeth “if someone said magicked boar kill robert likely would believe well”

 “you cannot stop talking liege” davos said “but take vengeance brothers’ true killers realm know tales lies”

 stannis seemed half hear “i doubt cersei hand robert’s death justice aye ned stark jon arryn well”

 “and renly” words davos could stop consider

 long time king speak softly said “i dream sometimes renly’s dying green tent candles woman screaming blood” stannis looked hands “i still abed died devan tell tried wake dawn nigh lords waiting fretting ahorse armored knew renly would attack break day devan says thrashed cried matter dream tent renly died woke hands clean”

 ser davos seaworth could feel phantom fingertips start itch something wrong onetime smuggler thought yet nodded said “i see”

 “renly offered peach parley mocked defied threatened offered peach thought drawing blade went mine purpose make show fear one pointless jests spoke sweet peach words hidden meaning” king gave shake head like dog shaking rabbit snap neck “only renly could vex piece fruit brought doom treason love davos know swear go grave thinking brother’s peach”

 amongst camp riding past ordered rows tents blowing banners stacks shields spears stink horse dung heavy air mingled woodsmoke smell cooking meat stannis reined long enough bark brusque dismissal lord florent others commanding attend pavilion one hour hence council war bowed heads dispersed davos melisandre rode king’s pavilion

 tent large since lords bannermen came council yet nothing grand soldier’s tent heavy canvas dyed dark yellow sometimes passed gold royal banner streamed atop center pole marked king’s guards without queen’s men leaning tall spears badge fiery heart sewn

 grooms came help dismount one guards relieved melisandre cumbersome standard driving staff deep soft ground devan stood one side door waiting lift flap king older squire waited beside stannis took crown handed devan “cold water cups two davos attend lady shall send require you”

 “as king commands” melisandre bowed

 brightness morning interior pavilion seemed cool dim stannis seated plain wooden camp stool waved davos another “one day may make lord smuggler irk celtigar florent thank though mean must suffer councils feign interest braying mules”

 “why serve purpose”

 “the mules love sound braying else need haul cart oh sure great useful notion put forth today think—ah here’s son water”

 devan set tray table filled two clay cups king sprinkled pinch salt cup drank davos took water straight wishing wine “you speaking council”

 “let tell go lord velaryon urge storm castle walls first light grapnels scaling ladders arrows boiling oil young mules think splendid notion estermont favor settling starve tyrell redwyne tried might take year old mules patient lord caron others like kick want take ser cortnay’s gauntlet hazard upon single combat one imagining champion win undying fame” king finished water “what would smuggler”

 davos considered moment answered “strike king’s landing once”

 king snorted “and leave storm’s end untaken”

 “ser cortnay power harm lannisters siege would take long single combat chancy assault would cost thousands lives certainty success need dethrone joffrey castle must come rest said camp lord tywin lannister rushes west rescue lannisport vengeance northmen…”

 “you passing clever father devan” king told boy standing elbow “he makes wish smugglers service fewer lords though wrong one respect davos need leave storm’s end untaken rear said defeated cannot permit men love loved brothers follow fear me… defeat death fear castle must fall” jaw ground side side “aye quickly doran martell called banners fortified mountain passes dornishmen poised sweep onto marches highgarden far spent brother left greater part power bitterbridge near sixty thousand foot sent wife’s brother ser errol ser parmen crane take command returned fear ser loras tyrell reached bitterbridge envoys took host own”

 “all reason take king’s landing soon may salladhor saan told me—”

 “salladhor saan thinks gold” stannis exploded “his head full dreams treasure fancies lies red keep let us hear salladhor saan day need military counsel lysene brigand day put crown take black” king made fist “are serve smuggler vex arguments”

 “i yours” davos said

 “then hear ser cortnay’s lieutenant cousin fossoways lord meadows green boy twenty ill chance strike penrose command storm’s end would pass stripling cousins believe would accept terms yield castle”

 “i remember another stripling given command storm’s end could much twenty”

 “lord meadows stonehead stubborn was”

 “stubborn craven matter ser cortnay penrose seemed hale hearty me”

 “so brother day death night dark full terrors davos”

 davos seaworth felt small hairs rising back neck “my lord understand you”

 “i require understanding service ser cortnay dead within day melisandre seen flames future death manner die knightly combat needless say” stannis held cup devan filled flagon “her flames lie saw renly’s doom well dragonstone saw told selyse lord velaryon friend salladhor saan would sail joffrey melisandre told went storm’s end would win best part brother’s power right”

 “bbut” davos stammered “lord renly came laid siege castle marching toward king’s landing lannisters would have—”

 stannis shifted seat frowning “was would came banners peaches doom… well melisandre saw another day flames well morrow renly rode south green armor smash host beneath walls king’s landing met brother might died place him”

 “or might joined strength bring lannisters” davos protested “why saw two futures well… cannot true”

 king stannis pointed finger “there err onion knight lights cast one shadow stand nightfire you’ll see flames shift dance never still shadows grow tall short every man casts dozen fainter others that’s well men cast shadows across future well one shadow many melisandre sees

 “you love woman know davos blind lords mislike estermont thinks flaming heart illchosen begs fight beneath crowned stag old ser guyard says woman standardbearer others whisper place war councils ought send back asshai sinful keep tent night aye whisper… serves”

 “serves how” davos asked dreading answer

 “as needed” king looked “and you”

 “i…” davos licked lips “i command would do”

 “nothing done land boat beneath castle unseen black night that”

 “yes tonight”

 king gave curt nod “you need small boat black betha one must know do”

 davos wanted protest knight longer smuggler never assassin yet opened mouth words would come stannis lord owed sons consider well gods good done

 “you quiet” stannis observed

 remain davos told yet instead said “my liege must castle see surely ways cleaner ways let ser cortnay keep bastard boy may well yield”

 “i must boy davos must melisandre seen flames well”

 davos groped answer “storm’s end holds knight match ser guyard lord caron hundred others sworn service single combat… could ser cortnay seeks way yield honor even means life”

 troubled look crossed king’s face like passing cloud “more like plans treachery combat champions ser cortnay dead ever threw glove flames lie davos”

 yet require make true thought long time since davos seaworth felt sad

 found crossing shipbreaker bay dark night steering tiny boat black sail sky sea salt smell air water chuckling hull remembered thousand flickering campfires burned around castle fires tyrells redwynes sixteen years rest different

 last time life brought storm’s end shaped look like onions time death shape melisandre asshai sixteen years ago sails cracked snapped every shift wind he’d pulled gone muffled oars even heart gullet men redwyne galleys grown lax long however slipped cordon smooth black satin time ships sight belonged stannis danger would come watchers castle walls even davos taut bowstring

 melisandre huddled upon thwart lost folds dark red cloak covered head heels face paleness beneath cowl davos loved water slept best deck rocking beneath sighing wind rigging sweeter sound singer could make harp strings even sea brought comfort tonight though “i smell fear ser knight” red woman said softly

 “someone told night dark full terrors tonight knight tonight davos smuggler would onion”

 laughed “is fear do”

 “what i’ll part it”

 “your hand raised sail hand holds tiller”

 silent davos tended course shore snarl rocks taking well across bay would wait tide turn coming storm’s end dwindled behind red woman seemed unconcerned “are good man davos seaworth” asked

 would good man “i man” said “i kind wife known women tried father sons help make place world aye i’ve broken laws never felt evil tonight would say parts mixed m’lady good bad”

 “a grey man” said “neither white black partaking ser davos”

 “what seems men grey”

 “if half onion black rot rotten onion man good evil”

 fires behind melted one vague glow black sky land almost sight time come “watch head lady” pushed tiller small boat threw curl black water turned melisandre leaned swinging yard one hand gunwale calm ever wood creaked canvas cracked water splashed loudly man might swear castle sure hear davos knew better endless crash wave rock sound ever penetrated massive seaward walls storm’s end faintly

 rippling wake spread behind swung back toward shore “you speak men onions” davos said melisandre “what women good evil lady”

 made chuckle “oh good knight sorts sweet ser champion light life”

 “yet mean kill man tonight” said “as killed maester cressen”

 “your maester poisoned meant poison protected greater power not”

 “and renly baratheon killed him”

 head turned beneath shadow cowl eyes burned like pale red candle flames “not i”

 “liar” davos certain

 melisandre laughed “you lost darkness confusion ser davos”

 “and good thing” davos gestured distant lights flickering along walls storm’s end “feel cold wind guards huddle close torches little warmth little light they’re comfort night like yet blind see us pass” hope “the god darkness protects us lady even you”

 flames eyes seemed burn little brighter “speak name ser lest draw black eye upon us protects man promise enemy lives torches hide us said fire bright gift lord light”

 “have way”

 “his way rather”

 wind shifting davos could feel see way black canvas rippled reached halyards “help bring sail i’ll row us rest way”

 together tied sail boat rocked beneath davos unshipped oars slid choppy black water said “who rowed renly”

 “there need” said “he unprotected here… storm’s end old place spells woven stones dark walls shadow pass—ancient forgotten yet still place”

 “shadow” davos felt flesh prickling “a shadow thing darkness”

 “you ignorant child ser knight shadows dark shadows servants light children fire brightest flame casts darkest shadows”

 frowning davos hushed coming close shore voices carried across water rowed faint sound oars lost rhythm waves seaward side storm’s end perched upon pale white cliff chalky stone sloping steeply half height massive curtain wall mouth yawned cliff davos steered sixteen years tunnel opened cavern castle storm lords old built landing

 passage navigable high tide never less treacherous smuggler’s skills deserted davos threaded way deftly jagged rocks cave mouth loomed let waves carry inside crashed around slamming boat way soaking skin halfseen finger rock came rushing gloom snarling foam davos barely kept oar

 past engulfed darkness waters smoothed

 little boat slowed swirled sound breathing echoed seemed surround davos expected blackness last time torches burned along tunnel eyes starving men peered murder holes ceiling portcullis somewhere ahead knew davos used oars slow drifted almost gently

 “this far go unless man inside lift gate us” whispers scurried across lapping water like line mice soft pink feet

 “have passed within walls”

 “yes beneath go farther portcullis goes way bottom bars closely spaced even child squeeze through”

 answer soft rustling light bloomed amidst darkness

 davos raised hand shield eyes breath caught throat melisandre thrown back cowl shrugged smothering robe beneath naked huge child swollen breasts hung heavy chest belly bulged near bursting “gods preserve us” whispered heard answering laugh deep throaty eyes hot coals sweat dappled skin seemed glow light melisandre shone

 panting squatted spread legs blood ran thighs black ink cry might agony ecstasy davos saw crown child’s head push way two arms wriggled free grasping black fingers coiling around melisandre’s straining thighs pushing whole shadow slid world rose taller davos tall tunnel towering boat instant look gone twisting bars portcullis racing across surface water instant long enough

 “not strong” said mormont

 “belike shall die dying buy time brothers wall time garrison empty castles freeze shut gates time summon lords kings aid time hone axes repair catapults lives coin well spent”

 “die” raven muttered pacing along mormont’s shoulders “die die die die” old bear sat slumped silent burden speech grown heavy bear last said “may gods forgive choose men”

 qhorin halfhand turned head eyes met jon’s held long moment “very well choose jon snow”

 mormont blinked “he hardly boy steward besides even ranger”

 “tollett care well lord” qhorin lifted maimed twofingered hand “the old gods still strong beyond wall gods first men… starks”

 mormont looked jon “what this”

 “to go” said

 old man smiled sadly “i thought might be”

 dawn broken jon stepped tent beside qhorin halfhand wind swirled around stirring black cloaks sending scatter red cinders flying fire

 tyrion

 “the queen intends send prince tommen away” knelt alone hushed dimness sept surrounded shadows flickering candles even lancel kept voice low “lord gyles take rosby conceal guise page plan darken hair tell everyone son hedge knight”

 “is mob fears me”

 “both” said lancel

 “ah” tyrion known nothing ploy varys’s little birds failed even spiders must nod supposed… eunuch playing deeper subtle game knew “you thanks ser”

 “will grant boon asked you”

 “perhaps” lancel wanted command next battle splendid way die finished growing mustache young knights always think invincible

 tyrion lingered cousin slipped away warrior’s altar used one candle light another watch brother bloody bastard he’s one lit second candle stranger

 “what say” bronn could read asked impudent questions

 “that he’s take fifty best swords scout roseroad” tyrion pressed seal soft wax

 “stannis like come kingsroad”

 “oh know tell bywater disregard what’s letter take men north he’s lay trap along rosby road lord gyles depart castle day two dozen menatarms servants nephew prince tommen may dressed page”

 “you want boy brought back it”

 “no want taken castle” removing boy city one sister’s better notions tyrion decided rosby tommen would safe mob keeping apart brother also made things difficult stannis even took king’s landing executed joffrey he’d still lannister claimant contend “lord gyles sickly run craven fight he’ll command castellan open gates inside walls bywater expel garrison hold tommen safe ask likes sound lord bywater”

 “lord bronn would sound better could grab boy well i’ll dandle knee sing nursery songs there’s lordship it”

 “i need here” said tyrion don’t trust nephew ill befall joffrey lannister claim iron throne would rest tommen’s young shoulders ser jacelyn’s gold cloaks would defend boy bronn’s sellswords apt sell enemies

 “what new lord old one”

 “whatever pleases long remembers feed don’t want dying” tyrion pushed away table “my sister send one kingsguard prince”

 bronn concerned “the hound joffrey’s dog won’t leave ironhand’s gold cloaks able handle others easy enough”

 “if comes killing tell ser jacelyn won’t done front tommen” tyrion donned heavy cloak dark brown wool “my nephew tenderhearted”

 “are certain he’s lannister”

 “i’m certain nothing winter battle” said “come i’m riding part way”

 tyrion rode toward chataya’s suddenly patience deserted twisted saddle scanning street behind signs followers every window dark tightly shuttered heard nothing wind swirling alleys cersei someone stalking tonight must disguised rat “bugger all” muttered sick caution wheeling horse around dug spurs anyone’s we’ll see well ride flew moonlight streets clattering cobbles darting narrow alleys twisty wynds racing love

 hammered gate heard music wafting faintly spiked stone walls one ibbenese ushered inside tyrion gave man horse said “who that” diamondshaped panes longhall windows shone yellow light could hear man singing

 ibbenese shrugged “fatbelly singer”

 sound swelled walked stable house tyrion never fond singers liked one even less run breed sight unseen pushed open door man broke “my lord hand” knelt balding kettlebellied murmuring “an honor honor”

 “m’lord” shae smiled sight liked smile quick unthinking way came pretty face girl wore purple silk belted clothofsilver sash colors favored dark hair smooth cream skin

 “sweetling” called “and this”

 singer raised eyes “i called symon silver tongue lord player singer taleteller—”

 “and great fool” tyrion finished “what call entered”

 “call only…” silver symon’s tongue seemed turned lead “my lord hand said honor…”

 “a wiser man would pretended recognize would fooled ought tried know sweet shae know dwells know visit night alone”

 “i swear i’ll tell one…”

 “on much agree good night you” tyrion led shae stairs

 “my singer may never sing now” teased “you’ve scared voice him”

 closed door bedchamber “you won’t hurt you” lit scented candle knelt pull boots “his songs cheer nights don’t come”

 “better good others”

 tyrion opened robe buried face breasts always smelled clean even reeking sty city “keep like keep close won’t wandering city spreading tales potshops”

 “he won’t—” started

 tyrion covered mouth he’d talk enough needed sweet simplicity pleasure found shae’s thighs least welcome wanted

 afterward eased arm head slipped tunic went garden halfmoon silvered leaves fruit trees shone surface stone bathing pond tyrion seated beside water somewhere right cricket chirping curiously homey sound peaceful thought long

 whiff something rank made turn head shae stood door behind dressed silvery robe he’d given loved maid white winter moonglow hair behind stood one begging brothers portly man filthy patched robes bare feet crusty dirt bowl hung neck leather thong septon would worn crystal smell would gagged rat

 “lord varys come see you” shae announced

 begging brother blinked astonished tyrion laughed “to sure knew not”

 shrugged “it’s still dressed different”

 “a different look different smell different way walking” said tyrion “most men would deceived”

 “and women maybe whores whore learns see man garb turns dead alley”

 varys looked pained false scabs feet tyrion chuckled “shae would bring us wine” might need drink whatever brought eunuch dead night like good

 “i almost fear tell i’ve come lord” varys said shae left “i bring dire tidings”

 “you ought dress black feathers varys you’re bad omen raven” awkwardly tyrion pushed feet half afraid ask next question “is jaime” harmed nothing save

 “no lord different matter ser cortnay penrose dead storm’s end opened gates stannis baratheon”

 dismay drove thoughts tyrion’s mind shae returned wine took one sip flung cup away explode side house raised hand shield shards wine ran stones long fingers black moonlight “damn him” tyrion said

 varys smiled showing mouth full rotted teeth “who lord ser cortnay lord stannis”

 “both them” storm’s end strong able hold half year more… time enough father finish robb stark “how happen”

 varys glanced shae “my lord must trouble sweet lady’s sleep grim bloody talk”

 “a lady might afraid” said shae “but i’m not”

 “you be” tyrion told “with storm’s end fallen stannis soon turn attention toward king’s landing” regretted flinging away wine “lord varys give us moment i’ll ride back castle you”

 “i shall wait stables” bowed stomped

 tyrion drew shae beside “you safe here”

 “i walls guards gave me”

 “sellswords” tyrion said “they like gold well enough die walls man could stand another’s shoulders heartbeat manse much like one burned riots killed goldsmith owned crime full larder tore high septon pieces raped lollys half hundred times smashed ser aron’s skull think would got hands hand’s lady”

 “the hand’s whore mean” looked big bold eyes “though would lady m’lord i’d dress beautiful things gave satin samite clothofgold i’d wear jewels hold hand sit feasts could give sons know could… vow i’d never shame you”

 love shames enough “a sweet dream shae put aside beg never be”

 “because queen i’m afraid either”

 “i am”

 “then kill done it’s love you”

 tyrion sighed “she’s sister man kills blood cursed forever sight gods men moreover whatever may think cersei father brother hold dear scheme man seven kingdoms gods equipped face jaime swords hand”

 “the young wolf lord stannis swords don’t scare you”

 little know sweetling “against power house lannister jaime father twisted back pair stunted legs”

 “you me” shae kissed arms sliding around neck pressed body

 kiss aroused kisses always time tyrion gently disentangled “not sweetling have… well call seed plan think might able bring castle kitchens”

 shae’s face went still “the kitchens”

 “yes act varys one wiser”

 giggled “m’lord i’d poison every man who’s tasted cooking told good whore am”

 “the red keep sufficient cooks butchers bakers you’d need pose scullion”

 “a pot girl” said “in scratchy brown roughspun m’lord wants see me”

 “m’lord wants see alive” tyrion said “you scarcely scour pots silk velvet”

 “has m’lord grown tired me” reached hand tunic found cock two quick strokes hard “he still wants me” laughed “would like fuck kitchen wench m’lord dust flour suck gravy titties you…”

 “stop it” way acting reminded dancy tried hard win wager yanked hand away keep mischief “this time bed sport shae life may stake”

 grin gone “if i’ve displeased m’lord never meant only… couldn’t give guards”

 tyrion breathed deep sigh remember young told took hand “your gems replaced new gowns sewn twice lovely old you’re precious thing within walls red keep safe either it’s deal safer want there”

 “in kitchens” voice flat “scouring pots”

 “for short while”

 “my father made kitchen wench” said mouth twisting “that ran off”

 “you told ran father made whore” reminded

 “that didn’t like scouring pots liked cock me” tossed head “why can’t keep tower half lords court keep bedwarmers”

 “i expressly forbidden take court”

 “by stupid father” shae pouted “you’re old enough keep whores want take beardless boy could spank you”

 slapped hard hard enough “damn you” said “damn never mock you”

 moment shae speak sound cricket chirping chirping “beg pardon m’lord” said last heavy wooden voice “i never meant impudent”

 never meant strike gods good turning cersei “that ill done” said “on parts shae understand” words never meant speak came tumbling like mummers hollow horse “when thirteen wed crofter’s daughter thought blind love thought felt father rubbed face truth bride whore jaime hired give first taste manhood” believed fool “to drive lesson home lord tywin gave wife barracks guardsmen use pleased commanded watch” take one last time rest done one last time trace love tenderness remaining “so remember truly is” said defied cock betrayed bid “after done father marriage undone never wed septons said” squeezed hand “please let’s talk tower hand kitchens little we’re done stannis you’ll another manse silks soft hands”

 shae’s eyes grown large could read lay behind “my hands won’t soft clean ovens scrape plates day still want touching they’re red raw cracked hot water lye soap”

 “more ever” said “when look they’ll remind brave were”

 could say believed lowered eyes “i command m’lord”

 much acceptance could give tonight saw plain enough kissed cheek he’d struck take sting blow “i send you”

 varys waiting stables promised horse looked spavined halfdead tyrion mounted one sellswords opened gates rode silence tell tysha gods help asked suddenly afraid secrets never spoken shames man take grave want forgiveness way looked mean hate thought scouring pots much confession could tell still think would love part said another part mocked saying fool dwarf gold jewels whore loves

 scarred elbow throbbing jarred every time horse set hoof sometimes could almost fancy heard bones grinding together inside perhaps see maester get potion pain… since pycelle revealed tyrion lannister mistrusted maesters gods knew conspiring mixed potions gave “varys” said “i need bring shae castle without cersei becoming aware” briefly sketched kitchen scheme

 done eunuch made little clucking sound “i lord commands course… must warn kitchens full eyes ears even girl falls particular suspicion subject thousand questions born parents come king’s landing truth never must lie… lie lie” glanced tyrion “and pretty young kitchen wench incite lust well curiosity touched pinched patted fondled pot boys crawl blankets night lonely cook may seek wed bakers knead breasts floured hands”

 “i’d sooner fondled stabbed” said tyrion

 varys rode paces said “it might another way happens maidservant attends lady tanda’s daughter filching jewels inform lady tanda would forced dismiss girl daughter would require new maidservant”

 “i see” possibilities tyrion saw lady’s bedmaid wore finer garb scullion often even jewel two shae pleased cersei thought lady tanda tedious hysterical lollys bovine lackwit like pay friendly calls

 “lollys timid trusting” varys said “she accept tale told since mob took maidenhood afraid leave chambers shae sight… conveniently close need comfort”

 “the tower hand watched know well cersei would certain grow curious lollys’s bedmaid starting paying calls”

 “i might able slip child bedchamber unseen chataya’s house boast hidden door”

 “a secret access chambers” tyrion annoyed surprised else would maegor cruel ordered death builders worked castle except preserve secrets “yes suppose would find door solar bedchamber”

 “my friend would force reveal little secrets would you”

 “henceforth think little secrets varys” tyrion glanced eunuch smelly mummer’s garb “assuming side…”

 “can doubt it”

 “why trust implicitly” bitter laugh echoed shuttered windows “i trust like one blood truth tell cortnay penrose died”

 “it said threw tower”

 “threw believe that”

 “his guards saw man enter chambers find within afterward”

 “then killer entered earlier hid bed” tyrion suggested “or climbed roof rope perhaps guards lying who’s say thing themselves”

 “doubtless right lord”

 smug tone said otherwise “but think done then”

 long moment varys said nothing sound stately clack horseshoes cobbles finally eunuch cleared throat “my lord believe old powers”

 “magic mean” tyrion said impatiently “bloodspells curses shapeshifting sorts things” snorted “do mean suggest ser cortnay magicked death”

 “ser cortnay challenged lord stannis single combat morning died ask act man lost despair matter lord renly’s mysterious fortuitous murder even battle lines forming sweep brother field” eunuch paused moment “my lord asked cut”

 “i recall” said tyrion “you want talk it”

 “nor but…” pause longer one varys spoke voice different somehow “i orphan boy apprenticed traveling folly master owned fat little cog sailed narrow sea performing free cities time time oldtown king’s landing

 “yet still dream night lord sorcerer blade even way manhood shriveled burned dream voice voice flames god demon conjurer’s trick could tell know tricks say certainty called answered since day hated magic practice lord stannis one mean see dead”

 done rode silence time finally tyrion said “a harrowing tale i’m sorry”

 eunuch sighed “you sorry believe lord need apologize drugged pain long time ago far across sea doubt dreamed voice i’ve told much thousand times”

 “i believe steel swords gold coins men’s wits” said tyrion “and believe dragons i’ve seen skulls all”

 “let us hope worst thing ever see lord”

 “on agree” tyrion smiled “and ser cortnay’s death well know stannis hired sellsails free cities perhaps bought skilled assassin well”

 “a skilled assassin”

 “there used dream one day i’d rich enough send faceless man sweet sister”

 “regardless ser cortnay died” said varys “he dead castle fallen stannis free march”

 “any chance might convince dornishmen descend marches” asked tyrion

 “none”

 “a pity well threat may serve keep marcher lords close castles least news father”

 “if lord tywin across red fork word reached yet hasten may trapped foes oakheart leaf rowan tree seen north mander”

 “no word littlefinger”

 “perhaps never reached bitterbridge perhaps he’s died lord tarly seized renly’s stores put great many sword florents chiefly lord caswell shut castle”

 tyrion threw back head laughed

 varys reined nonplussed “my lord”

 “don’t see jest lord varys” tyrion waved hand shuttered windows sleeping city “storm’s end fallen stannis coming fire steel gods alone know dark powers good folk don’t jaime protect robert renly rhaegar precious knight flowers one hate” laughed “the dwarf evil counselor twisted little monkey demon i’m stands chaos”





 catelyn

 “tell father gone make proud” brother swung saddle every inch lord bright mail flowing mudandwater cloak silver trout ornamented crest greathelm twin one painted shield

 last edmure’s foot shuffled portcullis brienne asked “what shall lady”

 “our duty” catelyn’s face drawn started across yard always done duty thought perhaps lord father always cherished best children two older brothers died infancy son well daughter lord hoster edmure born mother died father told must lady riverrun done lord hoster promised brandon stark thanked making splendid match

 gave brandon favor wear never comforted petyr wounded bid farewell father sent brandon murdered father told must wed brother gladly though never saw ned’s face wedding day gave maidenhood solemn stranger sent war king woman bore bastard always duty

 catelyn’s knees stiff time rose though felt wiser perhaps would go godswood tonight pray ned’s gods well older seven

 outside found song different sort rymund rhymer sat brewhouse amidst circle listeners deep voice ringing sang lord deremond bloody meadow

 stood sword hand

 last darry’s ten…

 brienne paused listen moment broad shoulders hunched thick arms crossed chest mob ragged boys raced screeching flailing sticks boys love play war catelyn wondered rymund answer singer’s voice swelled neared end song

 red grass beneath feet

 red banners bright

 red glow setting sun

 bathed light

 “come come on” great lord called

 “my sword hungry still”

 cry savage rage

 swarmed across rill…

 “fighting better waiting” brienne said “you don’t feel helpless fight sword horse sometimes axe you’re armored it’s hard anyone hurt you”

 “knights die battle” catelyn reminded

 brienne looked blue beautiful eyes “as ladies die childbed one sings songs them”

 “children battle different sort” catelyn started across yard “a battle without banners warhorns less fierce carrying child bringing world… mother told pain…”

 “i never knew mother” brienne said “my father ladies… different lady every year but…”

 “those ladies” catelyn said “as hard birth brienne comes even harder times feel though torn apart would five one child might keep safe”

 “and would keep safe lady”

 smile wan tired “why men house lady mother taught lord father brother uncle husband keep safe… away suppose must fill place brienne”

 brienne bowed head “i shall try lady”

 later day maester vyman brought letter saw hoping word robb ser rodrik winterfell message proved one lord meadows named castellan storm’s end addressed father brother son “or whoever holds riverrun” ser cortnay penrose dead man wrote storm’s end opened gate stannis baratheon trueborn rightful heir castle garrison sworn swords cause one man suffered harm

 “save cortnay penrose” catelyn murmured never met man yet grieved hear passing “robb know once” said “do know is”

 “at last word marching toward crag seat house westerling” said maester vyman “if dispatched raven ashemark may could send rider him”

 “do so”

 catelyn read letter maester gone “lord meadows says nothing robert’s bastard” confided brienne “i suppose yielded boy rest though confess understand stannis wanted badly”

 “perhaps fears boy’s claim”

 “a bastard’s claim it’s something else… child look like”

 “he seven eight comely black hair bright blue eyes visitors oft thought lord renly’s son”

 “and renly favored robert” catelyn glimmer understanding “stannis means parade brother’s bastard realm men might see robert face wonder likeness joffrey”

 “would mean much”

 “those favor stannis call proof support joffrey say means nothing” children tully stark arya one show much ned features jon snow never mine found thinking jon’s mother shadowy secret love husband would never speak grieve ned hate leaving bed mine pray son prayed mine

 uncomfortable thoughts futile jon born ashara dayne starfall whispered lady long dead catelyn clue mother might made matter ned gone loves secrets died

 still struck strangely men behaved came bastards ned always fiercely protective jon ser cortnay penrose given life edric storm yet roose bolton’s bastard meant less one dogs judge tone queer cold letter edmure gotten three days past crossed trident marching harrenhal commanded wrote “a strong castle well garrisoned grace shall must kill every living soul within make so” hoped grace would weigh crimes bastard son ser rodrik cassel put death “a fate doubt earned” bolton written “tainted blood ever treacherous ramsay’s nature sly greedy cruel count well rid trueborn sons young wife promised would never safe lived”

 sound hurrying footsteps drove morbid thoughts head ser desmond’s squire dashed panting room knelt “my lady… lannisters… across river”

 “take long breath lad tell slowly”

 bid “a column armored men” reported “across red fork flying purple unicorn lion lannister”

 son lord brax brax come riverrun girl propose wedding one sons lysa wondered whether son leading attack

 lannisters ridden southeast beneath blaze banners ser desmond told ascended battlements join “a outriders more” assured “the main strength lord tywin’s host well south danger here”

 south red fork land stretched away open flat watchtower catelyn could see miles even nearest ford visible edmure entrusted lord jason mallister defense well three others farther upriver lannister riders milling uncertainly near water crimson silver banners flapping wind “no fifty lady” ser desmond estimated

 catelyn watched riders spread long line lord jason’s men waited receive behind rocks grass hillocks trumpet blast sent horsemen forward ponderous walk splashing current moment made brave show bright armor streaming banners sun flashing points lances

 “now” heard brienne mutter

 ser desmond slapped belly “would lord hoster could seen would made dance”

 “my father’s dancing days past fear” catelyn said “and fight begun lannisters come lord tywin twice brother’s numbers”

 “he could ten times would matter” ser desmond said “the west bank red fork higher east lady well wooded bowmen good cover clear field shafts… breach occur edmure best knights reserve ready ride wherever sorely needed river hold them”

 “i pray right” catelyn said gravely

 night came commanded wake enemy returned well midnight serving girl touched gently shoulder catelyn sat “what it”

 “the ford lady”

 wrapped bedrobe catelyn climbed roof keep could see walls moonlit river battle raged defenders built watchfires along bank perhaps lannisters thought find nightblind unwary folly darkness chancy ally best waded breast way across men stepped hidden pools went splashing others stumbled stones gashed feet hidden caltrops mallister bowmen sent storm fire arrows hissing across river strangely beautiful afar one man pierced dozen times clothes afire danced whirled kneedeep water last fell swept downstream time body came bobbing past riverrun fires life extinguished

 small victory catelyn thought fighting ended surviving foemen melted back night yet victory nonetheless descended winding turret steps catelyn asked brienne thoughts “that brush lord tywin’s fingertip lady” girl said “he probing feeling weak point undefended crossing find one curl fingers fist try make one” brienne hunched shoulders “that’s i’d him” hand went hilt sword gave little pat make certain still

 may gods help us catelyn thought yet nothing could edmure’s battle river inside castle

 next morning broke fast sent father’s aged steward utherydes wayn “have ser cleos frey brought flagon wine mean question soon want tongue well loosened”

 “as command lady”

 long rider mallister eagle sewn breast arrived message lord jason telling another skirmish another victory ser flement brax tried force crossing different ford six leagues south time lannisters shortened lances advanced across river behind foot mallister bowmen rained high arcing shots shields scorpions edmure mounted riverbank sent heavy stones crashing break formation “they left dozen dead water two reaching shallows dealt briskly” rider reported also told fighting farther upstream lord karyl vance held fords “those thrusts turned aside grievous cost foes”

 perhaps edmure wiser knew catelyn thought lords saw sense battle plans blind brother little boy remember robb

 waited evening going pay call upon ser cleos frey reasoning longer delayed drunker likely entered tower cell ser cleos stumbled knees “my lady knew naught escape imp said lannister must needs lannister escort oath knight—”

 “arise ser” catelyn seated “i know grandson walder frey would oathbreaker” unless served purpose “you brought peace terms brother said”

 “i did” ser cleos lurched feet pleased see unsteady

 “tell me” commanded

 done catelyn sat frowning edmure right terms except…“lannister exchange arya sansa brother”

 “yes sat iron throne swore it”

 “before witnesses”

 “before court lady gods well said much ser edmure told possible grace robb would never consent”

 “he told true” could even say robb wrong arya sansa children kingslayer alive free dangerous man realm road led nowhere “did see girls treated well”

 ser cleos hesitated “i… yes seemed…”

 fumbling lie catelyn realized wine fuddled wits “ser cleos” said coolly “you forfeited protection peace banner men played us false lie you’ll hang walls beside believe shall ask more—did see daughters”

 brow damp sweat “i saw sansa court day tyrion told terms looked beautiful lady perhaps bit wan drawn were”

 sansa arya might mean anything arya always harder tame perhaps cersei reluctant parade open court fear might say might locked safely sight might killed catelyn shoved thought away “his terms said… yet cersei queen regent”

 “tyrion spoke queen indisposed day told”

 “curious” catelyn thought back terrible trek mountains moon way tyrion lannister somehow seduced sellsword service dwarf clever half could imagine survived high road lysa sent vale yet surprise part ned’s murder least came defense clansmen attacked us could trust word…

 opened hands look scars across fingers dagger’s marks reminded dagger hand killer paid open bran’s throat though dwarf denied sure even lysa locked one sky cells threatened moon door still denied “he lied” said rising abruptly “the lannisters liars every one dwarf worst killer armed knife”

 ser cleos stared “i know nothing any—”

 “you know nothing” agreed sweeping cell brienne fell beside silent simpler catelyn thought pang envy like man men answer always never farther away nearest sword woman mother way stonier harder know

 took late supper great hall garrison give encouragement could rymund rhymer sang courses sparing need talk closed song written robb’s victory oxcross “and stars night eyes wolves wind song” verses rymund threw back head howled end half hall howling along even desmond grell well cups voices rang rafters

 let songs makes brave catelyn thought toying silver goblet

 “there always singer evenfall hall girl” brienne said quietly “i learned songs heart”

 “sansa though singers ever cared make long journey north winterfell” told would singers king’s court though told would hear music sorts father could find master help learn high harp oh gods forgive me…

 brienne said “i remember woman… came place across narrow sea could even say language sang voice lovely eyes color plums waist tiny father could put hands around hands almost big mine” closed long thick fingers hide

 “did sing father” catelyn asked

 brienne shook head staring trencher find answer gravy

 “for lord renly”

 girl reddened “never i… fool made cruel japes sometimes i…”

 “someday must sing me”

 “i… please gift” brienne pushed back table “forgive lady leave go”

 catelyn nodded tall ungainly girl left hall long strides almost unnoticed amidst revelry may gods go thought returned listlessly supper

 three days later hammer blow brienne foretold fell five days heard catelyn sitting father edmure’s messenger arrived man’s armor dinted boots dusty ragged hole surcoat look face knelt enough tell news good “victory lady” handed edmure’s letter hand trembled broke seal

 “i’ll hear songs fighting’s done” catelyn said perhaps sharply yet allowed ser desmond spread word agreed suggested breaking open casks honor stone mill mood within riverrun strained somber would better little drink hope

 sound faintest clinks scraping steel stone lifted head paws listening sniffing night

 evening’s rain woken hundred sleeping smells made ripe strong grass thorns blackberries broken ground mud worms rotting leaves rat creeping bush caught shaggy black scent brother’s coat sharp coppery tang blood squirrel he’d killed squirrels moved branches smelling wet fur fear little claws scratching bark noise sounded something like

 heard clink scrape brought feet ears pricked tail rose howled long deep shivery cry howl wake sleepers piles manrock dark dead still wet night night drive men holes rain stopped men still hid damp huddled fires caves piled stone

 brother came sliding trees moving almost quiet another brother remembered dimly long ago white one eyes blood brother’s eyes pools shadow fur back neck bristling heard sounds well known meant danger

 time clink scrape followed slithering soft swift patter skinfeet stone wind brought faintest whiff mansmell know stranger danger death

 ran toward sound brother racing beside stone dens rose walls slick wet bared teeth manrock took notice gate loomed black iron snake coiled tight bar post crashed gate shuddered snake clanked slithered held bars could look long stone burrow ran walls stony field beyond way could force muzzle bars many time brother tried crack black bones gate teeth would break tried dig great flat stones beneath halfcovered earth blown leaves

 snarling paced back forth front gate threw moved little slammed back locked something whispered chained voice hear scent without smell ways closed well doors opened walls manrock wood thick strong way

 whisper came seemed could see shadow great tree covered needles slanting black earth ten times height man yet looked side godswood sentinel hurry hurry…

 gloom night came muffled shout cut short

 swiftly swiftly whirled bounded back trees wet leaves rustling beneath paws branches whipping rushed past could hear brother following close plunged heart tree around cold pool blackberry bushes tangle oaks ash hawthorn scrub far side wood… shadow he’d glimpsed without seeing slanting tree pointing rooftops sentinel came thought

 remembered climb needles everywhere scratching bare face falling back neck sticky sap hands sharp piney smell easy tree boy climb leaning crooked branches close together almost made ladder slanting right roof

 growling sniffed around base tree lifted leg marked stream urine low branch brushed face snapped twisting pulling wood cracked tore mouth full needles bitter taste sap shook head snarled

 seem surprised see “you abed girl” breastplate hissed like cat dipped cold water “what noise”

 “vargo hoat’s come back prisoners saw badges there’s glover deepwood motte he’s father’s man rest mostly” sudden arya knew feet brought “you help get out”

 gendry laughed “and that”

 “ser amory sent dungeon one widow’s tower that’s one big cell could smash door open hammer—”

 “while guards watch make bets many swings take maybe”

 arya chewed lips “we’d need kill guards”

 “how supposed that”

 “maybe won’t lot them”

 “if there’s two that’s many never learned nothing village try vargo hoat cut hands feet way does” gendry took tongs

 “you’re afraid”

 “gendry there’s hundred northmen maybe couldn’t count that’s many ser amory well counting bloody mummers get take castle escape”

 “well can’t get more’n could save lommy” gendry turned breastplate tongs look closely “and escape would go”

 “winterfell” said “i’d tell mother helped could stay—”

 “would m’lady permit could shoe horses make swords lordly brothers”

 sometimes made angry “you stop that”

 “why wager feet chance sweat winterfell place harrenhal know old ben blackthumb came boy smithed lady whent father father even lord lothston held harrenhal whents smiths lord tywin know says sword’s sword helm’s helm reach fire get burned matter you’re serving lucan’s fair enough master i’ll stay here”

 pinkeye awake dared go back bed knowing else hide made godswood liked sharp smell pines sentinels feel grass dirt toes sound wind made leaves slow little stream meandered wood one spot eaten ground away beneath deadfall

 beneath rotting wood twisted splintered branches found hidden sword

 gendry stubborn make one made breaking bristles broom blade much light proper grip liked sharp jagged splintery end

 whenever free hour stole away work drills syrio taught moving barefoot fallen leaves slashing branches whacking leaves sometimes even climbed trees danced among upper branches toes gripping limbs moved back forth teetering little less every day balance returned night best time one ever bothered night

 arya climbed kingdom leaves unsheathed time forgot ser amory mummers father’s men alike losing feel rough wood beneath soles feet swish sword air broken branch became joffrey struck fell away queen ser ilyn ser meryn hound leaves killed well slashing wet green ribbons arm grew weary sat legs high limb catch breath cool dark air listening squeak bats hunted leafy canopy could see bonewhite branches heart tree looks like one winterfell been… climbed would home maybe find father sitting weirwood always sat

 shoving sword belt slipped branch branch back ground light moon painted limbs weirwood silvery white made way toward fivepointed red leaves turned black night arya stared face carved trunk terrible face mouth twisted eyes flaring full hate god looked like could gods hurt people pray thought suddenly

 arya went knees wasn’t sure begin clasped hands together help old gods prayed silently help get men dungeon kill ser amory bring home winterfell make water dancer wolf afraid ever

 enough maybe pray aloud wanted old gods hear maybe pray longer sometimes father prayed long time remembered old gods never helped remembering made angry “you saved him” scolded tree “he prayed time don’t care help don’t think could even wanted to”

 “gods mocked girl”

 voice startled leapt feet drew wooden sword jaqen h’ghar stood still darkness seemed one trees “a man comes hear name one two comes three man would done”

 arya lowered splintery point toward ground “how know here”

 “a man sees man hears man knows”

 regarded suspiciously gods sent “how’d make dog kill weese call rorge biter hell jaqen h’ghar true name”

 “some men many names weasel arry arya”

 backed away pressed heart tree “did gendry tell”

 “a man knows” said “my lady stark”

 maybe gods sent answer prayers “i need help get men dungeons glover others kill guards open cell somehow—”

 “a girl forgets” said quietly “two three owed guard must die needs speak name”

 “but one guard won’t enough need kill open cell” arya bit lip hard stop crying “i want save northmen like saved you”

 looked pitilessly “three lives snatched god three lives must repaid gods mocked” voice silk steel

 “i never mocked” thought moment “the name… name anyone you’ll kill him”

 jaqen h’ghar inclined head “a man said”

 “anyone” repeated “a man woman little baby lord tywin high septon father”

 “a man’s sire long dead live know name would die command”

 “swear it” arya said “swear gods”

 “by gods sea air even fire swear it” placed hand mouth weirwood “by seven new gods old gods beyond count swear it”

 sworn “even named king…”

 “speak name death come morrow turn moon year day come man fly like bird one foot moves another one day man king dies” knelt beside facetoface “a girl whispers fears speak aloud whisper joffrey”

 arya put lips ear “it’s jaqen h’ghar”

 even burning barn walls flame towering around chains seemed distraught “a girl… makes jest”

 “you swore gods heard swear”

 “the gods hear” knife hand suddenly blade thin little finger whether meant arya could say “a girl weep girl lose friend”

 “you’re friend friend would help me” stepped away balanced balls feet case threw knife “i’d never kill friend”

 jaqen’s smile came went “a girl might… name another name friend help”

 “a girl might” said “if friend help”

 knife vanished “come”

 “now” never thought would act quickly

 “a man hears whisper sand glass man sleep girl unsays certain name evil child”

 “the hungry gods feast blood tonight man would thing” jaqen said “sweet girl kind gentle unsay one name say another cast mad dream aside”

 “i won’t”

 “just so” seemed resigned “the thing done girl must obey man time talk”

 “a girl obey” arya said “what do”

 “a hundred men hungry must fed lord commands hot broth girl must run kitchens tell pie boy”

 second guard waved past “bring then”

 inside door winding stair led dungeons rorge led way jaqen arya bringing rear “a girl stay way” told

 steps opened onto dank stone vault long gloomy windowless torches burned sconces near end group ser amory’s guards sat around scarred wooden table talking playing tiles heavy iron bars separated captives crowded together dark smell broth brought many bars

 arya counted eight guards smelled broth well “there’s ugliest serving wench ever saw” captain said rorge “what’s kettle”

 “your cock balls want eat not”

 one guards pacing one standing near bars third sitting floor back wall prospect food drew table

 “about bloody time fed us”

 “that onions smell”

 “so where’s bread”

 “fuck need bowls cups spoons—”

 “no don’t” rorge heaved scalding hot broth across table full faces jaqen h’ghar biter threw kettles swinging underarm spun across dungeon raining soup one caught captain temple tried rise went like sack sand lay still rest screaming agony praying trying crawl

 freed captives stripped dead guards weapons darted steps steel hand fellows crowded barehanded went swiftly scarcely word none seemed quite badly wounded vargo hoat marched gates harrenhal “this soup clever” man glover saying “i expect lord hoat’s idea”

 rorge began laugh laughed hard snot flew hole nose biter sat top one dead men holding limp hand gnawed fingers bones cracked teeth

 “who men” crease appeared robett glover’s brows “you hoat came lord bolton’s encampment brave companions”

 rorge wiped snot chin back hand “we now”

 “this man honor jaqen h’ghar free city lorath man’s discourteous companions named rorge biter lord know biter” waved hand toward arya “and here—”

 “i’m weasel” blurted could tell really want name said rorge might hear biter others know

 climbed back winding stair found door guards lying pools blood northmen running across ward arya heard shouts door barracks hall burst open wounded man staggered screaming three others ran silenced spear sword fighting around gatehouse well rorge biter rushed glover jaqen h’ghar knelt beside arya “a girl understand”

 “yes do” said though didn’t truly

 lorathi must seen face “a goat loyalty soon wolf banner raised think first man would hear certain name unsaid”

 “i take back name” arya chewed lip “do still third death”

 “a girl greedy” jaqen touched one dead guards showed bloody fingers “here three four eight lie dead debt paid”

 “the debt paid” arya agreed reluctantly felt little sad mouse

 “a god due man must die” strange smile touched lips jaqen h’ghar

 “die” said confused mean “but unsaid name don’t need die now”

 “i time done” jaqen passed hand face forehead chin went changed cheeks grew fuller eyes closer nose hooked scar appeared right cheek scar shook head long straight hair half red half white dissolved away reveal cap tight black curls

 arya’s mouth hung open “who you” whispered astonished afraid “how hard”

 grinned revealing shiny gold tooth “no harder taking new name know way”

 “show me” blurted “i want too”

 “if would learn must come me”

 arya grew hesitant “where”

 “far away across narrow sea”

 “i can’t go home winterfell”

 “then must part” said “for duties too” lifted hand pressed small coin palm “here”

 “what it”

 “a coin great value”

 arya bit hard could iron “is worth enough buy horse”

 “it meant buying horses”

 “then good it”

 “as well ask good life good death day comes would find give coin man braavos say words him—valar morghulis”

 “valar morghulis” arya repeated wasn’t hard fingers closed tight coin across yard could hear men dying “please don’t go jaqen”

 “jaqen dead arry” said sadly “and promises keep valar morghulis arya stark say again”

 “valar morghulis” said stranger jaqen’s clothes bowed stalked darkness cloak swirling alone dead men deserved die arya told remembering ser amory lorch killed holdfast lake

 cellars kingspyre empty returned bed straw whispered names pillow done added “valar morghulis” small soft voice wondering meant

 come dawn pinkeye others back one boy who’d killed fighting reason anyone could say pinkeye went alone see matters stood light day complaining old bones could abide steps returned told harrenhal taken “them bloody mummers killed ser amory’s lot beds rest table good drunk new lord day’s whole host he’s wild north wall say he’s hard one lord lord there’s still work done foolery i’ll whip skin back” looked arya said never said word night

 morning watched bloody mummers strip dead valuables drag corpses flowstone yard pyre laid dispose shagwell fool hacked heads two dead knights pranced castle swinging hair making talk “what die of” one head asked “hot weasel soup” replied second

 “some kinds lord”

 thin smile twitched across lips “but lions would seem manticores”

 “heed wisdom love best” said xaro xhoan daxos lounging inside palanquin “warlocks bitter creatures eat dust drink shadows give naught naught give”

 aggo put hand arakh “khaleesi said many go palace dust come out”

 “it said” jhogo agreed

 “we blood blood” said aggo “sworn live die let us walk dark place keep safe harm”

 “some places even khal must walk alone” dany said

 “take then” ser jorah urged “the risk—”

 “queen daenerys must enter alone all” warlock pyat pree stepped trees along dany wondered “should turn away doors wisdom shall closed forevermore”

 “my pleasure barge awaits even now” xaro xhoan daxos called “turn away folly stubborn queens flutists soothe troubled soul sweet music small girl whose tongue make sigh melt”

 ser jorah mormont gave merchant prince sour look “your grace remember mirri maz duur”

 “i do” dany said suddenly decided “i remember knowledge maegi”

 pyat pree smiled thinly “the child speaks sagely crone take arm let lead you”

 “i child” dany took arm nonetheless

 darker would thought black trees way longer though path seemed run straight street door palace pyat pree soon turned aside questioned warlock said “the front way leads never heed words queen house undying ones made mortal men value soul take care tell you”

 “i say” dany promised

 “when enter find room four doors one come three others take door right time door right come upon stairwell climb never go never take door first door right”

 “the door right” dany repeated “i understand leave opposite”

 “by means” pyat pree said “leaving coming always always door right doors may open within see many things disturb visions loveliness visions horror wonders terrors sights sounds days gone days come days never dwellers servitors may speak go answer ignore choose enter room reach audience chamber”

 “i understand”

 “when come chamber undying patient little lives flicker moth’s wing listen well write word upon heart”

 reached door—a tall oval mouth set wall fashioned likeness human face—the smallest dwarf dany ever seen waiting threshold stood higher knee faced pinched pointed snoutish dressed delicate livery purple blue tiny pink hands held silver tray upon rested slender crystal glass filled thick blue liquid shade evening wine warlocks “take drink” urged pyat pree

 “will turn lips blue”

 “one flute serve unstop ears dissolve caul eyes may hear see truths laid you”

 dany raised glass lips first sip tasted like ink spoiled meat foul swallowed seemed come life within could feel tendrils spreading chest like fingers fire coiling around heart tongue taste like honey anise cream like mother’s milk drogo’s seed like red meat hot blood molten gold tastes ever known none them… glass empty

 “now may enter” said warlock dany put glass back servitor’s tray went inside

 found stone anteroom four doors one wall never hesitation went door right stepped second room twin first turned righthand door pushed open faced yet another small antechamber four doors presence sorcery

 fourth room oval rather square walled wormeaten wood place stone six passages led place four dany chose rightmost entered long dim highceilinged hall along right hand row torches burning smoky orange light doors left drogon unfolded wide black wings beat stale air flew twenty feet thudding undignified crash dany strode

 moldeaten carpet feet gorgeously colored whorls gold could still seen fabric glinting broken amidst faded grey mottled green remained served muffle footfalls good dany could hear sounds within walls faint scurrying scrabbling made think rats drogon heard head moved followed sounds stopped gave angry scream sounds even disturbing came closed doors one shook thumped someone trying break another came dissonant piping made dragon lash tail wildly side side dany hurried quickly past

 doors closed look dany told temptation strong

 one room beautiful woman sprawled naked floor four little men crawled rattish pointed faces tiny pink hands like servitor brought glass shade one pumping thighs another savaged breasts worrying nipples wet red mouth tearing chewing

 farther came upon feast corpses savagely slaughtered feasters lay strewn across overturned chairs hacked trestle tables asprawl pools congealing blood lost limbs even heads severed hands clutched bloody cups wooden spoons roast fowl heels bread throne sat dead man head wolf wore iron crown held leg lamb one hand king might hold scepter eyes followed dany mute appeal

 fled far next open door know room thought remembered great wooden beams carved animal faces adorned outside window lemon tree sight made heart ache longing house red door house braavos sooner thought old ser willem came room leaning heavily stick “little princess are” said gruff kind voice “come” said “come lady you’re home you’re safe now” big wrinkled hand reached soft old leather dany wanted take hold kiss wanted much ever wanted anything foot edged forward thought he’s dead he’s dead sweet old bear died long time ago backed away ran

 long hall went endless doors left torches right ran past doors could count closed doors open ones doors wood doors iron carved doors plain ones doors pulls doors locks doors knockers drogon lashed back urging dany ran could run

 finally great pair bronze doors appeared left grander rest swung open neared stop look beyond loomed cavernous stone hall largest ever seen skulls dead dragons looked walls upon towering barbed throne sat old man rich robes old man dark eyes long silvergrey hair “let king charred bones cooked meat” said man “let king ashes” drogon shrieked claws digging silk skin king throne never heard dany moved

 viserys first thought next time paused second glance told otherwise man brother’s hair taller eyes dark indigo rather lilac “aegon” said woman nursing newborn babe great wooden bed “what better name king”

 “will make song him” woman asked

 “he song” man replied “he prince promised song ice fire” looked said eyes met dany’s seemed saw standing beyond door “there must one more” said though whether speaking woman bed could say “the dragon three heads” went window seat picked harp ran fingers lightly silvery strings sweet sadness filled room man wife babe faded like morning mist music lingering behind speed way

 seemed though walked another hour long hall finally ended steep stone stair descending darkness every door open closed left dany looked back behind torches going realized start fear perhaps twenty still burned thirty one guttered even watched darkness came little farther hall creeping toward listened seemed heard something else coming shuffling dragging slowly along faded carpet terror filled could go back afraid stay could go door right steps went

 yet another torch went stood pondering sounds grew faintly louder drogon’s long neck snaked opened mouth scream steam rising teeth hears dany turned blank wall nothing could secret door door cannot see another torch went another first door right said always first door right first door right…

 came suddenly… last door left

 flung beyond another small room four doors right went right right right right right right dizzy breath

 stopped found yet another dank stone chamber… time door opposite round shaped like open mouth pyat pree stood outside grass beneath trees “can undying done soon” asked disbelief saw

 “so soon” said confused “i’ve walked hours still found them”

 “you taken wrong turning come lead you” pyat pree held hand

 dany hesitated door right still closed…

 “that’s way” pyat pree said firmly blue lips prim disapproval “the undying ones wait forever”

 “our little lives flicker moth’s wing them” dany said remembering

 “stubborn child lost never found”

 walked away door right

 “no” pyat screeched “no come meeeeeee” face crumbled inward changing something pale wormlike

 dany left behind entering stairwell began climb long legs aching recalled house undying ones seemed towers

 finally stair opened right set wide wooden doors thrown open fashioned ebony weirwood black white grains swirling twisting strange interwoven patterns beautiful yet somehow frightening blood dragon must afraid dany said quick prayer begging warrior courage dothraki horse god strength made walk forward

 beyond doors great hall splendor wizards wore sumptuous robes ermine ruby velvet cloth gold others fancied elaborate armor studded gemstones tall pointed hats speckled stars women among dressed gowns surpassing loveliness shafts sunlight slanted windows stained glass air alive beautiful music ever heard

 kingly man rich robes rose saw smiled “daenerys house targaryen welcome come share food forever undying qarth”

 “long awaited you” said woman beside clad rose silver breast left bare qartheen fashion perfect breast could

 “we knew come us” wizard king said “a thousand years ago knew waiting time sent comet show way”

 “we knowledge share you” said warrior shining emerald armor “and magic weapons arm passed every trial come sit us questions shall answered”

 took step forward drogon leapt shoulder flew top ebonyandweirwood door perched began bite carved wood

 “a willful beast” laughed handsome young man “shall teach secret speech dragonkind come come”

 doubt seized great door heavy took dany’s strength budge finally began move behind another door hidden old grey wood splintery plain… stood right door she’d entered wizards beckoning voices sweeter song ran drogon flying back narrow door passed chamber awash gloom

 long stone table filled room floated human heart swollen blue corruption yet still alive beat deep ponderous throb sound pulse sent wash indigo light figures around table blue shadows dany walked empty chair foot table stir speak turn face sound slow deep beat rotting heart

 …mother dragons… came voice part whisper part moan… dragons… dragons… dragons… voices echoed gloom male female one spoke timbre child floating heart pulsed dimness darkness hard summon speak recall words practiced assiduously “i daenerys stormborn house targaryen queen seven kingdoms westeros” hear don’t move sat folding hands lap “grant counsel speak wisdom conquered death”

 indigo murk could make wizened features undying one right old old man wrinkled hairless flesh ripe violetblue lips nails bluer still dark almost black even whites eyes blue stared unseeing ancient woman opposite side table whose gown pale silk rotted body one withered breast left bare qartheen manner show pointed blue nipple hard leather

 breathing dany listened silence none breathing move eyes see nothing could undying ones dead

 answer whisper thin mouse’s whisker… live… live… live… sounded myriad voices whispered echoes… know… know… know… know…

 “i come gift truth” dany said “in long hall things saw… true visions lies past things things come mean”

 …the shape shadows… morrows yet made… drink cup ice… drink cup fire…

 …mother dragons… child three…

 “three” understand

 …three heads dragon… ghost chorus yarnmered inside skull never lip moving never breath stirring still blue air… mother dragons… child storm… whispers became swirling song… three fires must light… one life one death one love… heart beating unison one floated blue corrupt… three mounts must ride… one bed one dread one love… voices growing louder realized seemed heart slowing even breath… three treasons know… blood gold love…

 “i don’t…” voice whisper almost faint happening “i don’t understand” said loudly hard talk “help show me”

 …help her… whispers mocked… show her…

 phantoms shivered murk images indigo viserys screamed molten gold ran cheeks filled mouth tall lord copper skin silvergold hair stood beneath banner fiery stallion burning city behind rubies flew like drops blood chest dying prince sank knees water last breath murmured woman’s name… mother dragons daughter death… glowing like sunset red sword raised hand blueeyed king cast shadow cloth dragon swayed poles amidst cheering crowd smoking tower great stone beast took wing breathing shadow fire… mother dragons slayer lies… silver trotting grass darkling stream beneath sea stars corpse stood prow ship eyes bright dead face grey lips smiling sadly blue flower grew chink wall ice filled air sweetness… mother dragons bride fire…

 faster faster visions came one seemed air come alive shadows whirled danced inside tent boneless terrible little girl ran barefoot toward big house red door mirri maz duur shrieked flames dragon bursting brow behind silver horse bloody corpse naked man bounced dragged white lion ran grass taller man beneath mother mountains line naked crones crept great lake knelt shivering grey heads bowed ten thousand slaves lifted bloodstained hands raced silver riding like wind “mother” cried “mother mother” reaching touching tugging cloak hem skirt foot leg breast wanted needed fire life dany gasped opened arms give them…

 black wings buffeted round head scream fury cut indigo air suddenly visions gone ripped away dany’s gasp turned horror undying around blue cold whispering reached pulling stroking tugging clothes touching dry cold hands twining fingers hair strength left limbs could move even heart ceased beat felt hand bare breast twisting nipple teeth found soft skin throat mouth descended one eye licking sucking biting…

 indigo turned orange whispers turned screams heart pounding racing hands mouths gone heat washed skin dany blinked sudden glare perched dragon spread wings tore terrible dark heart ripping rotten flesh ribbons head snapped forward fire flew open jaws bright hot could hear shrieks undying burned high thin papery voices crying tongues long dead flesh crumbling parchment bones dry wood soaked tallow danced flames consumed staggered writhed spun raised blazing hands high fingers bright torches

 dany pushed feet bulled light air husks fell touch whole room ablaze time reached door “drogon” called flew fire

 outside long dim passageway stretched serpentine lit flickering orange glare behind dany ran searching door door right door left door nothing twisty stone walls floor seemed move slowly feet writhing trip kept feet ran faster suddenly door ahead door like open mouth

 spilled sun bright light made stumble pyat pree gibbering unknown tongue hopping one foot dany looked behind saw thin tendrils smoke forcing way cracks ancient stone walls palace dust rising black tiles roof

 howling curses pyat pree drew knife danced toward drogon flew face heard crack jhogo’s whip never sound sweet knife went flying instant later rakharo slamming pyat ground ser jorah mormont knelt beside dany cool green grass put arm around shoulder





 tyrion

 “if die stupidly i’m going feed body goats” tyrion threatened first load stone crows pushed quay

 shagga laughed “the halfman goats”

 “i’ll get you”

 dawn breaking pale ripples light shimmered surface river shattering poles reforming ferry passed timett taken burned men kingswood two days yesterday black ears moon brothers followed today stone crows

 “whatever don’t try fight battle” tyrion said “strike camps baggage train ambush scouts hang bodies trees ahead line march loop around cut stragglers want night attacks many sudden they’ll afraid sleep—”

 shagga laid hand atop tyrion’s head “all learned dolf son holger beard grown way war mountains moon”

 “the kingswood mountains moon won’t fighting milk snakes painted dogs listen guides i’m sending know wood well know mountains heed counsel they’ll serve well”

 “shagga listen halfman’s pets” clansman promised solemnly time lead garron onto ferry tyrion watched push pole toward center blackwater felt queer twinge pit stomach shagga faded morning mist going feel naked without clansmen

 still bronn’s hirelings near eight hundred sellswords notoriously fickle tyrion done could buy continued loyalty promising bronn dozen best men lands knighthoods battle they’d drunk wine laughed jests called ser staggering… bronn who’d smiled insolent dark smile afterward said “they’ll kill knighthood don’t ever think they’ll die it”

 tyrion delusion

 gold cloaks almost uncertain weapon six thousand men city watch thanks cersei quarter could relied upon “there’s outandout traitors though there’s even spider hasn’t found all” bywater warned “but there’s hundreds greener spring grass men joined bread ale safety man likes look craven sight fellows they’ll fight brave enough start it’s warhorns blowing banners battle looks going sour they’ll break they’ll break bad first man throw spear run thousand trodding heels”

 sure seasoned men city watch core two thousand who’d gotten gold cloaks robert cersei yet even those… watchman truly soldier lord tywin lannister fond saying knights squires menatarms tyrion three hundred soon enough must test truth another father’s sayings one man wall worth ten beneath

 bronn escort waiting foot quay amidst swarming beggars strolling whores fishwives crying catch fishwives business rest combined buyers flocked around barrels stalls haggle winkles clams river pike food coming city price fish ten times war still rising coin came riverfront morning evening hopes bringing home eel pot red crabs slipped stalls hoping steal stood gaunt forlorn beneath walls

 gold cloaks cleared path press shoving people aside shafts spears tyrion ignored muttered curses best could fish came sailing crowd slimy rotten landed feet flew pieces stepped gingerly climbed saddle children swollen bellies already fighting pieces stinking fish

 mounted gazed along riverfront hammers rang morning air carpenters swarmed mud gate extending wooden hoardings battlements coming well deal less pleased clutter ramshackle structures allowed grow behind quays attaching city walls like barnacles hull ship bait shacks potshops warehouses merchants’ stalls alehouses cribs cheaper sort whores spread legs go every bit stannis would hardly need scaling ladders storm walls

 called bronn side “assemble hundred men burn everything see water’s edge city walls” waved stubby fingers taking waterfront squalor “i want nothing left standing understand”

 blackhaired sellsword turned head considering task “them won’t like much”

 “i never imagined would they’ll something else curse evil monkey demon for”

 “some may fight”

 “see lose”

 “what live here”

 “let reasonable time remove property move try kill they’re enemy rapes keep men line damn it”

 “they’re sellswords septons” said bronn “next you’ll telling want sober”

 “it couldn’t hurt”

 tyrion wished could easily make city walls twice tall three times thick though perhaps matter massive walls tall towers saved storm’s end harrenhal even winterfell

 remembered winterfell last seen grotesquely huge harrenhal solid impregnable look storm’s end yet great strength stones sense within walls man might feel safe news castle’s fall come wrenching shock “the gods give one hand take other” muttered breath varys told given starks harrenhal taken winterfell dismal exchange

 doubt rejoicing robb stark would turn north could defend home hearth sort king meant reprieve west house lannister yet…

 tyrion vaguest memory theon greyjoy time starks callow youth always smiling skilled bow hard imagine lord winterfell lord winterfell would always stark

 remembered godswood tall sentinels armored greygreen needles great oaks hawthorn ash soldier pines center heart tree standing like pale giant frozen time could almost smell place earthy brooding smell centuries remembered dark wood even day wood winterfell north never felt place walked much unwelcome intruder wondered greyjoys would feel castle might well never godswood year ten fifty

 tyrion lannister walked horse slowly toward mud gate winterfell nothing reminded glad place fallen look walls gate open inside three great trebuchets stood side side market square peering battlements like three huge birds throwing arms made trunks old oaks banded iron keep splitting gold cloaks named three whores they’d giving lord stannis lusty welcome hope

 tyrion put heels horse trotted mud gate breasting human tide beyond whores press grew thinner street opened around

 ride back red keep uneventful tower hand found dozen angry trader captains waiting audience chamber protest seizure ships gave sincere apology promised compensation war done little appease “what lose lord” one braavosi asked

 “then apply king stannis compensation”

 time rid bells ringing tyrion knew would late installation waddled across yard almost run crowded back castle sept joffrey fastened white silk cloaks shoulders two newest members kingsguard rite seemed require everyone stand tyrion saw nothing wall courtly arses hand new high septon finished leading two knights solemn vows anointing names seven would well positioned first doors

 approved sister’s choice ser balon swann take place slain preston greenfield swanns marcher lords proud powerful cautious pleading illness lord gulian swann remained castle taking part war eldest son ridden renly stannis balon younger served king’s landing he’d third son tyrion suspected he’d robb stark perhaps honorable course showed good sense whoever iron throne swanns intended survive addition well born young ser balon valiant courtly skilled arms good lance better morningstar superb bow would serve honor courage

 alas tyrion could say cersei’s second choice ser osmund kettleblack looked formidable enough stood six feet six inches sinew muscle hook nose bushy eyebrows spadeshaped brown beard gave face fierce aspect long smile lowborn hedge knight kettleblack utterly dependent cersei advancement doubtless she’d picked “ser osmund loyal brave” she’d told joffrey put forward name true unfortunately good ser osmund selling secrets bronn since day she’d hired tyrion could scarcely tell

 supposed ought complain appointment gave another ear close king unbeknownst sister even ser osmund proved utter craven would worse ser boros blount currently residing dungeon rosby ser boros escorting tommen lord gyles ser jacelyn bywater gold cloaks surprised yielded charge alacrity would enraged old ser barristan selmy much cersei knight kingsguard supposed die defense king royal family sister insisted joffrey strip blount white cloak grounds treason cowardice replaces another man hollow

 praying vowing anointing seemed take morning tyrion’s legs soon began ache shifted weight one foot restless lady tanda stood several rows saw daughter half hoping catch glimpse shae varys said well would prefer see

 “better lady’s maid pot girl” shae said tyrion told eunuch’s scheme “can take belt silver flowers gold collar black diamonds said looked like eyes won’t wear say shouldn’t”

 loath disappoint tyrion point lady tanda means clever woman even might wonder daughter’s bedmaid seemed jewelry daughter “choose two three dresses more” commanded “good wool silk samite fur rest i’ll keep chambers visit me” answer shae wanted least safe

 investiture finally done joffrey marched ser balon ser osmund new white cloaks tyrion lingered word new high septon choice wise enough know put honey bread “i want gods side” tyrion told bluntly “tell stannis vowed burn great sept baelor”

 “is true lord” asked high septon small shrewd man wispy white beard wizened face

 tyrion shrugged “it may stannis burned godswood storm’s end offering lord light he’d offend old gods spare new tell tell man thinks give aid usurper betrays gods well rightful king”

 “i shall lord shall command pray health king hand well”

 hallyne pyromancer waiting tyrion returned solar maester frenken brought messages let alchemist wait little longer read ravens brought old letter doran martell warning storm’s end fallen much intriguing one balon greyjoy pyke styled king isles north invited king joffrey send envoy iron islands fix borders realms discuss possible alliance

 tyrion read letter three times set aside lord balon’s longships would great help fleet sailing storm’s end thousands leagues away wrong side westeros tyrion far certain wanted give away half realm perhaps spill one cersei’s lap take council

 admit hallyne latest tallies alchemists “this cannot true” said tyrion pored ledgers “almost thirteen thousand jars take fool i’m pay king’s gold empty jars pots sewage sealed wax warn you”

 “no no” hallyne squeaked “the sums accurate swear hmmm fortunate lord hand another cache lord rossart’s found three hundred jars dragonpit whores using ruins entertain patrons one fell patch rotted floor cellar felt jars mistook wine drunk broke seal drank some”

 “there prince tried once” said tyrion dryly “i haven’t seen dragons rising city would seem didn’t work time either” dragonpit atop hill rhaenys abandoned century half supposed good place store wildfire better would nice late lord rossart told someone “three hundred jars say still account totals several thousand jars ahead best estimate gave last met”

 “yes yes that’s so” hallyne mopped pale brow sleeve blackandscarlet robe “we working hard lord hand hmmm”

 “that would doubtless explain making much substance before” smiling tyrion fixed pyromancer mismatched stare “though raise question begin working hard now”

 hallyne complexion mushroom hard see could turn paler yet somehow managed “we lord hand brothers laboring day night first assure hmmm made much substance become hmmm practiced also”—the alchemist shifted uncomfortably—“certain spells hmmm ancient secrets order delicate troublesome necessary substance hmmm be…”

 tyrion growing impatient ser jacelyn bywater likely ironhand misliked waiting “yes secret spells splendid them”

 “they hmmm seem working better were” hallyne smiled weakly “you don’t suppose dragons you”

 “not unless found one dragonpit why”

 “oh pardon remembering something old wisdom pollitor told acolyte i’d asked many spells seemed well effectual scrolls would us believe said magic begun go world day last dragon died”

 “sorry disappoint i’ve seen dragons noticed king’s justice lurking however fruits you’re selling turn filled anything wildfire you’ll seeing well”

 hallyne fled quickly almost bowled ser jacelyn—no lord jacelyn must remember ironhand mercifully direct ever he’d returned rosby deliver fresh levy spearmen recruited lord gyles’s estates resume command city watch “how nephew fare” tyrion asked done discussing city’s defenses

 “prince tommen hale happy lord adopted fawn men brought home hunt one says joffrey skinned jerkin asks mother sometimes often begins letters princess myrcella though never seems finish brother however seem miss all”

 “you made suitable arrangements battle lost”

 “my men instructions”

 “which are”

 “you commanded tell one lord”

 made smile “i’m pleased remember” king’s landing fall might well taken alive better know joffrey’s heir might found

 varys appeared long lord jacelyn left “men faithless creatures” said way greeting

 tyrion sighed “who’s traitor today”

 eunuch handed scroll “so much villainy sings sad song age honor die fathers”

 “my father dead yet” tyrion scanned list “i know names rich men traders merchants craftsmen conspire us”

 “it seems believe lord stannis must win wish share victory call antler men crowned stag”

 “someone tell stannis changed sigil hot hearts” matter jests though appeared antler men armed several hundred followers seize old gate battle joined admit enemy city among names list master armorer salloreon “i suppose means won’t getting terrifying helm demon horns” tyrion complained scrawled order man’s arrest





 theon

 one moment asleep next awake

 kyra nestled one arm draped lightly breasts brushing back could hear breathing soft steady sheet tangled black night bedchamber dark still

 hear something someone

 wind sighed faintly shutters somewhere far heard yowl cat heat nothing else sleep greyjoy told castle quiet guards posted door gates armory

 might put bad dream remember dreaming kyra worn theon sent lived eighteen years winter town without ever setting foot inside walls castle came wet eager lithe weasel certain undeniable spice fucking common tavern wench lord eddard stark’s bed

 murmured sleepily theon slid arm got feet embers still smoldered hearth wex slept floor foot bed rolled inside cloak dead world nothing moved theon crossed window threw open shutters night touched cold fingers gooseprickles rose bare skin leaned stone sill looked dark towers empty yards black sky stars man could ever count lived hundred halfmoon floated bell tower cast reflection roof glass gardens heard alarms voices much footfall

 all’s well greyjoy hear quiet ought drunk joy took winterfell fewer thirty men feat sing theon started back bed he’d roll kyra back fuck ought banish phantoms gasps giggles would make welcome respite silence

 stopped grown used howling direwolves scarcely heard anymore… part hunter’s instinct heard absence

 urzen stood outside door sinewy man round shield slung back “the wolves quiet” theon told “go see they’re come straight back” thought direwolves running loose gave queasy feeling remembered day wolfswood wildlings attacked bran summer grey wind torn pieces

 prodded wex toe boot boy sat rubbed eyes “make certain bran stark little brother beds quick it”

 “m’lord” kyra called sleepily

 “go back sleep concern you” theon poured cup wine drank time listening hoping hear howl men thought sourly men asha come…

 wex returned quickest shaking head side side cursing theon found tunic breeches floor dropped haste get kyra tunic donned jerkin ironstudded leather belted longsword dagger waist hair wild wood larger concerns

 urzen back “the wolves gone”

 theon told must cold deliberate lord eddard “rouse castle” said “herd yard everyone we’ll see who’s missing lorren make round gates wex me”

 wondered stygg reached deepwood motte yet man skilled rider claimed—none ironmen much good saddle—but there’d time enough asha might well way learns lost starks… bear thinking

 bran’s bedchamber empty rickon’s half turn theon cursed kept guard he’d deemed important men walking walls protecting gates nursemaid couple children one cripple

 outside heard sobbing castle folk pulled beds driven yard i’ll give reason sob i’ve used gently repay he’d even two men whipped bloody raping kennel girl show meant still blame rape though rest deemed unfair mikken killed mouth benfred chayle give someone drowned god men expected “i bear ill will” he’d told septon threw well “but gods place now” you’d think others might grateful hadn’t chosen one wondered many part plot

 urzen returned black lorren “the hunter’s gate” lorren said “best come see”

 hunter’s gate conveniently sited close kennels kitchens opened directly fields forests allowing riders come go without first passing winter town favored hunting parties “who guard here” theon demanded

 “drennan squint”

 drennan one men who’d raped palla “if they’ve let boys escape i’ll little skin back time swear it”

 “no need that” black lorren said curtly

 found squint floating facedown moat entrails drifting behind like nest pale snakes drennan lay half naked gatehouse snug room drawbridge worked throat opened ear ear ragged tunic concealed halfhealed scars back boots scattered amidst rushes breeches tangled feet cheese small table near door beside empty flagon two cups

 theon picked one sniffed dregs wine bottom “squint wallwalk no”

 “aye” said lorren

 theon flung cup hearth “i’d say drennan pulling breeches stick woman stuck cheese knife look someone find pike fish fool moat”

 fool deal worse shape drennan black lorren drew water saw one arms wrenched elbow half neck missing ragged hole navel groin pike tore bowels lorren pulling stench awful

 “the direwolves” theon said “both guess” disgusted walked back drawbridge winterfell encircled two massive granite walls wide moat outer wall stood eighty feet high inner hundred lacking men theon forced abandon outer defenses post guards along higher inner walls dared risk wrong side moat castle rise

 two decided woman entertaining drennan others freed wolves

 theon called torch led steps wallwalk swept flame low looking for… inside rampart wide crenel two upthrust merlons “blood” announced “clumsily mopped guess woman killed drennan lowered drawbridge squint heard clank chains came look got far pushed corpse crenel moat wouldn’t found another sentry”

 urzen peered along walls “the watch turrets far see torches burning—”

 “torches guards” theon said testily “winterfell turrets men”

 “four guards main gate” said black lorren “and five walking walls beside squint”

 urzen said “if sounded horn—”

 served fools “try imagine urzen it’s dark cold walking sentry hours looking forward end watch hear noise move toward gate suddenly see eyes top stair glowing green gold torchlight two shadows come rushing toward faster believe catch glimpse teeth start level spear slam open belly tearing leather cheesecloth” gave urzen hard shove “and you’re back guts spilling one teeth around neck” theon grabbed man’s scrawny throat tightened fingers smiled “tell moment stop blow fucking horn” shoved urzen away roughly sending stumbling back merlon man rubbed throat beasts put day took castle thought angrily i’d seen kill knew dangerous

 “we must go them” black lorren said

 “not dark” theon relish idea chasing direwolves wood night hunters could easily become hunted “we’ll wait daylight best go speak loyal subjects”

 yard uneasy crowd men women children pushed wall many given time dress covered woolen blankets huddled naked cloaks bedrobes dozen ironmen hemmed torches one hand weapons wind gusting flickering orange light reflected dully steel helms thick beards unsmiling eyes

 theon walked prisoners studying faces looked guilty “how many missing”

 “six” reek stepped behind smelling soap long hair moving wind “both starks bog boy sister halfwit stables wildling woman”

 osha suspected moment saw second cup known better trust one she’s unnatural asha even names sound alike

 “has anyone look stables”

 “aggar says horses missing”

 “dancer still stall”

 “dancer” reek frowned “aggar says horses halfwit missing”

 they’re afoot best news he’d heard since woke bran would riding basket hodor’s back doubt osha would need carry rickon little legs wouldn’t take far theon confident he’d soon back hands “bran rickon fled” told castle folk watching eyes “who knows they’ve gone” one answered “they could escaped without help” theon went “without food clothing weapons” locked away every sword axe winterfell doubt hidden “i’ll names aided turned blind eye” sound wind “come first light mean bring back” hooked thumbs swordbelt “i need huntsmen wants nice warm wolfskin see winter gage” cook always greeted cheerfully returned hunt ask whether he’d brought anything choice table nothing say theon walked back way come searching faces least sign guilty knowledge “the wild place cripple rickon young long last nan think frightened must be” old woman nattered ten years telling endless stories gaped stranger “i might killed every man given women soldiers pleasure instead protected thanks offer” joseth who’d groomed horses farlen who’d taught knew hounds barth brewer’s wife who’d first—not one would meet eyes hate realized

 reek stepped close “strip skins” urged thick lips glistening “lord bolton used say naked man secrets flayed man’s got none”

 flayed man sigil house bolton theon knew ages past certain lords gone far cloak skins dead enemies number starks ended thus supposedly stopped thousand years ago boltons bent knees winterfell say old ways die hard well know

 “there flaying north long rule winterfell” theon said loudly protection likes wanted scream could blatant perhaps clever enough take lesson

 sky greying castle walls dawn could far “joseth saddle smiler horse murch gariss poxy tym you’ll come well” murch gariss best huntsmen castle tym fine bowman “aggar rednose gelmarr reek wex” needed watch back “farlen i’ll want hounds handle them”

 grizzled kennelmaster crossed arms “and would care hunt trueborn lords babes that”

 theon moved close “i trueborn lord man keeps palla safe”

 saw defiance die farlen’s eyes “aye m’lord”

 stepping back theon glanced see else might add “maester luwin” announced

 “i know nothing hunting”

 don’t trust castle absence “then it’s past time learned”

 “let come want wolfskin cloak” boy stepped forward older bran took theon moment remember “i’ve hunted lots times before” walder frey said “red deer elk even boar”

 cousin laughed “he rode boar hunt father never let near boar”

 theon look boy doubtfully “come like can’t keep don’t think i’ll nurse along” turned back black lorren “winterfell absence return will” bloody well ought praying success

 assembled hunter’s gate first pale rays sun brushed top bell tower breath frosting cold morning air gelmarr equipped longaxe whose reach would allow strike wolves blade heavy enough kill single blow aggar wore steel greaves reek arrived carrying boar spear overstuffed washerwoman’s sack bulging god knows theon bow needed nothing else saved bran’s life arrow hoped would need take another came would

 eleven men two boys dozen dogs crossed moat beyond outer wall tracks plain read soft ground pawprints wolves hodor’s heavy tread shallower marks left feet two reeds trees stony ground fallen leaves made trail harder see farlen’s red bitch scent rest dogs close behind hounds sniffing barking pair monstrous mastiffs bringing rear size ferocity might make difference cornered direwolf

 he’d guessed osha might run south ser rodrik trail led north northwest heart wolfswood theon like one bit would bitter irony starks made deepwood motte delivered right asha’s hands i’d sooner dead thought bitterly better seen cruel foolish

 wisps pale mist threaded trees sentinels soldier pines grew thick nothing dark gloomy evergreen forest ground uneven fallen needles disguised softness turf made footing treacherous horses go slowly slowly man carrying cripple though bony harridan fouryearold back told patient he’d day

 maester luwin trotted following game trail along lip ravine “thus far hunting seems indistinguishable riding woods lord”

 theon smiled “there similarities hunting there’s blood end”

 “must flight great folly merciful foster brothers seek”

 “no stark robb ever brotherly toward bran rickon value living dead”

 “the true reeds moat cailin sits edge bogs lord howland make uncle’s occupation visit hell chooses long hold heirs must stay hand”

 theon considered truth scarcely considered mudmen beyond eyeing meera twice wondering still maiden “you may right spare can”

 “and hodor hope boy simple know told many times groomed horse soaped saddle scoured mail”

 “there’s one trail lord swear it” said gariss defensively “and direwolves would never parted boys long”

 that’s theon thought summer shaggydog might gone hunt soon late would return bran rickon “gariss murch take four dogs double back find lost aggar watch i’ll trickery farlen follow direwolves give blast horn pick trail two blasts catch sight beasts find went they’ll lead us back masters”

 yet theon wondered beasts wolves skinned cursed things

 jon

 could see fire night glimmering side mountain like fallen star burned redder stars twinkle though sometimes flared bright sometimes dwindled distant spark dull faint

 half mile ahead two thousand feet jon judged perfectly placed see anything moving pass

 “watchers skirling pass” wondered oldest among spring youth squire king black brothers still called squire dalbridge “what mance rayder fears wonder”

 “if knew they’d lit fire he’d flay poor bastards” said ebben squat bald man muscled like bag rocks

 “fire life here” said qhorin halfhand “but death well” command they’d risked open flames since entering mountains ate cold salt beef hard bread harder cheese slept clothed huddled beneath pile cloaks furs grateful other’s warmth made jon remember cold nights long ago winterfell he’d shared bed brothers men brothers though bed shared stone earth

 “they’ll horn” said stonesnake

 halfhand said “a horn must blow”

 “that’s long cruel climb night” ebben said eyed distant spark cleft rocks sheltered sky cloudless jagged mountains rising black black top cold crowns snow ice shone palely moonlight

 “and longer fall” said qhorin halfhand “two men think like two sharing watch”

 “me” ranger called stonesnake already shown best climber among would

 “and me” said jon snow

 qhorin halfhand looked jon could hear wind keening shivered high pass one garrons whickered pawed thin stony soil hollow taken shelter “the wolf remain us” qhorin said “white fur seen easily moonlight” turned stonesnake “when it’s done throw burning brand we’ll come see fall”

 “no better time start now” said stonesnake

 took long coil rope stonesnake carried bag iron spikes well small hammer head wrapped thick felt garrons left behind along helms mail ghost jon knelt let direwolf nuzzle set “stay” commanded “i’ll back you”

 stonesnake took lead short wiry man near fifty grey beard stronger seemed best night eyes anyone jon ever known needed tonight day mountains bluegrey brushed frost sun vanished behind jagged peaks turned black rising moon linmed white silver

 black brothers moved black shadows amidst black rocks working way steep twisting trail breath frosted black air jon felt almost naked without mail miss weight hard going slow hurry risk broken ankle worse stonesnake seemed know put feet instinct jon needed careful broken uneven ground

 skirling pass really series passes long twisting course went around succession icy windcarved peaks hidden valleys seldom saw sun apart companions jon glimpsed living man since they’d left wood behind begun make way upward frostfangs cruel place gods made inimical men wind cut like knife shrilled night like mother mourning slain children trees saw stunted grotesque things growing sideways cracks fissures tumbled shelves rock often overhung trail fringed hanging icicles looked like long white teeth distance

 long way stayed trail following twists turns snaked along side mountain upward ever upward sometimes mountain folded back lost sight fire soon late would always reappear path stonesnake chose would never served horses places jon put back cold stone shuffle along sideways like crab inch inch even track widened treacherous cracks big enough swallow man’s leg rubble stumble hollow places water pooled day froze hard night one step another jon told one step another fall

 soon high enough looking best considered nothing yawning blackness nothing moon stars “the mountain mother” stonesnake told easier climb days past “cling press face teats won’t drop you” jon made joke saying he’d always wondered mother never thought find frostfangs seem nearly amusing one step another thought clinging tight

 narrow track ended abruptly massive shoulder black granite thrust side mountain bright moonlight shadow black felt like stepping cave “straight here” ranger said quiet voice “we want get them” peeled gloves tucked belt tied one end rope around waist end around jon “follow rope grows taut” ranger wait answer started moving upward fingers feet faster jon would believed long rope unwound slowly jon watched closely making note went found handhold last loop hemp uncoiled took gloves followed much slowly

 wildlings built watchfire shallow depression narrowest part pass sheer drop rock behind shelter worst wind windbreak allowed black brothers crawl within feet creeping along bellies looking men must kill

 one asleep curled tight buried beneath great mound skins jon could see nothing hair bright red firelight second sat close flames feeding twigs branches complaining wind querulous tone third watched pass though little see vast bowl darkness ringed snowy shoulders mountains watcher wore horn

 hand froze “a girl”

 “a watcher” said stonesnake “a wildling finish her”

 jon could see fear fire eyes blood ran white throat point dirk pricked one thrust it’s done told close could smell onion breath older something made think arya though looked nothing alike “will yield” asked giving dirk half turn doesn’t

 “i yield” words steamed cold air

 “you’re captive then” pulled dirk away soft skin throat

 “qhorin said nothing taking captives” said stonesnake

 “he never said to” jon let go grip girl’s hair scuttled backward away

 “she’s spearwife” stonesnake gestured longhafted axe lay beside sleeping furs “she reaching grabbed give half chance she’ll bury eyes”

 “i won’t give half chance” jon kicked axe well girl’s reach “do name”

 “ygritte” hand rubbed throat came away bloody stared wetness

 sheathing dirk wrenched longclaw free body man he’d killed “you captive ygritte”

 “i gave name”

 “i’m jon snow”

 flinched “an evil name”

 “a bastard name” said “my father lord eddard stark winterfell”

 girl watched warily stonesnake gave mordant chuckle “it’s captive supposed tell things remember” ranger thrust long branch fire “not i’ve known wildlings bite tongues they’d answer question” end branch blazing merrily took two steps flung pass fell night spinning lost sight

 “you ought burn killed” said ygritte

 “need bigger fire big fires burn bright” stonesnake turned eyes scanning black distance spark light “are wildlings close it”

 “burn them” girl repeated stubbornly “or might you’ll need swords again”

 jon remembered dead othor cold black hands “maybe says”

 “there ways” stonesnake knelt beside man he’d slain stripped cloak boots belt vest hoisted body one thin shoulder carried edge grunted tossed moment later heard wet heavy smack well ranger second body skin dragging arms jon took feet together flung dead man blackness night

 ygritte watched said nothing older he’d thought first jon realized maybe old twenty short age bandylegged round face small hands pug nose shaggy mop red hair stuck directions looked plump crouched layers fur wool leather underneath could skinny arya

 “were sent watch us” jon asked

 “you others”

 stonesnake warmed hands fire “what waits beyond pass”

 “the free folk”

 “how many”

 “hundreds thousands ever saw crow” smiled teeth crooked white

 doesn’t know many “why come here”

 ygritte fell silent

 “what’s frostfangs king could want can’t stay there’s food”

 turned face away

 “do mean march wall when”

 stared flames could hear

 “do know anything uncle benjen stark”

 ygritte ignored stonesnake laughed “if spits tongue don’t say didn’t warn you”

 low rumbling growl echoed rock shadowcat jon knew rose heard another closer hand pulled sword turned listening

 “they won’t trouble us” ygritte said “it’s dead they’ve come cats smell blood six miles they’ll stay near bodies till they’ve eaten every last stringy shred o’ meat cracked bones marrow”

 jon could hear sounds feeding echoing rocks gave uneasy feeling warmth fire made realize bonetired dared sleep taken captive guard “were kin” asked quietly “the two killed”

 “no are”

 “me” frowned “what mean”

 “you said bastard o’ winterfell”

 “i am”

 “who mother”

 “some woman are” someone said remember

 smiled flash white teeth “and never sung song o’ winter rose”

 “i never knew mother song”

 “bael bard made it” said ygritte “he kingbeyondthewall long time back free folk know songs might don’t sing south”

 “winterfell’s south” jon objected

 “yes everything wall’s south us”

 never thought way “i suppose it’s you’re standing”

 “aye” ygritte agreed “it always is”

 “tell me” jon urged would hours qhorin came story would help keep awake “i want hear tale yours”

 “might won’t like much”

 “i’ll hear same”

 “brave black crow” mocked “well long king free folk bael great raider”

 stonesnake gave snort “a murderer robber raper mean”

 “that’s you’re standing too” ygritte said “the stark winterfell wanted bael’s head never could take taste o’ failure galled one day bitterness called bael craven preyed weak word o’ got back bael vowed teach lord lesson scaled wall skipped kingsroad walked winterfell one winter’s night harp hand naming sygerrik skagos sygerrik means ‘deceiver’ old tongue first men spoke giants still speak

 “north south singers always find ready welcome bael ate lord stark’s table played lord high seat half night gone old songs played new ones he’d made played sang well done lord offered let name reward ‘all ask flower’ bael answered ‘the fairest flower blooms gardens o’ winterfell’

 “now happened winter roses come bloom flower rare precious stark sent glass gardens commanded beautiful o’ winter roses plucked singer’s payment done morning come singer vanished… lord brandon’s maiden daughter bed found empty pale blue rose bael left pillow head lain”

 jon never heard tale “which brandon supposed brandon builder lived age heroes thousands years bael brandon burner father brandon shipwright but—”

 “this brandon daughterless” ygritte said sharply “would hear tale no”

 scowled “go on”

 “lord brandon children behest black crows flew forth castles hundreds nowhere could find sign o’ bael maid year searched till lord lost heart took bed seemed though line o’ starks end one night lay waiting die lord brandon heard child’s cry followed sound found daughter back bedchamber asleep babe breast”

 “bael brought back”

 “no winterfell time hiding dead beneath castle maid loved bael dearly bore son song says… though truth told maids love bael songs wrote may what’s certain bael left child payment rose he’d plucked unasked boy grew next lord stark is—you bael’s blood me”

 “it never happened” jon said

 shrugged “might might didn’t good song though mother used sing woman jon snow like yours” rubbed throat dirk cut “the song ends find babe darker end story thirty years later bael kingbeyondthewall led free folk south young lord stark met frozen ford… killed bael would harm son met sword sword”

 “so son slew father instead” said jon

 “aye” said “but gods hate kinslayers even kill unknowing lord stark returned battle mother saw bael’s head upon spear threw tower grief son long outlive one o’ lords peeled skin wore cloak”

 “your bael liar” told certain

 “no” ygritte said “but bard’s truth different mine anyway asked story told it” turned away closed eyes seemed sleep

 dawn qhorin halfhand arrived together black stones turned grey eastern sky gone indigo stonesnake spied rangers wending way upward jon woke captive held arm descended meet thankfully another way mountain north west along paths much gentler one brought waiting narrow defile brothers appeared leading garrons ghost raced ahead first scent jon squatted let direwolf close jaws around wrist tugging hand back forth game played glanced saw ygritte watching eyes wide white hen’s eggs

 qhorin halfhand made comment saw prisoner “there three” stonesnake told

 “we passed two” ebben said “or cats left them” eyed girl sourly suspicion plain face

 “she yielded” jon felt compelled say

 qhorin’s face impassive “do know am”

 “qhorin halfhand” girl looked half child beside faced boldly

 “tell true fell hands people yielded would win me”

 “a slower death elsewise”

 big ranger looked jon “we food feed spare man watch her”

 “the way us perilous enough lad” said squire dalbridge “one shout need silence every man us doomed”

 ebben drew dagger “a steel kiss keep quiet”

 jon’s throat raw looked helplessly “she yielded me”

 “then must needs done” qhorin halfhand said “you blood winterfell man night’s watch” looked others “come brothers leave go easier watch” led steep twisting trail toward pale pink glow sun broke mountain cleft long jon ghost remained wildling girl

 thought ygritte might try run stood waiting looking “you never killed woman you” shook head said “we die men don’t need mance would take know would there’s secret ways crows would never catch us”

 “i’m much crow are” jon said

 nodded resigned “will burn after”

 “i can’t smoke might seen”

 “that’s so” shrugged “well there’s worse places end belly shadowcat”

 pulled longclaw shoulder “aren’t afraid”

 “last night was” admitted “but sun’s up” pushed hair aside bare neck knelt “strike hard true crow i’ll come back haunt you”

 longclaw long heavy sword father’s ice valyrian steel touched edge blade mark blow must fall ygritte shivered “that’s cold” said “go quick it”

 raised longclaw head hands tight around grip one cut weight behind could give quick clean death least father’s son wasn’t wasn’t

 “do it” urged moment “bastard can’t stay brave forever” blow fall turned head look

 jon lowered sword “go” muttered

 ygritte stared

 “now” said “before wits return go”

 “everyone wants loved”

 dark skirling pass great stone flanks mountains hid sun day rode shadow breath man horse steaming cold air icy fingers water trickled snowpack small frozen pools cracked broke beneath hooves garrons sometimes would see weeds struggling crack rock splotch pale lichen grass trees

 track steep narrow wending way ever upward pass constricted rangers go single file squire dalbridge would take lead scanning heights went longbow ever close hand said keenest eyes night’s watch

 ghost padded restlessly jon’s side time time would stop turn ears pricked heard something behind jon think shadowcats would attack living men unless starving loosened longclaw scabbard even

 windcarved arch grey stone marked highest point pass way broadened began long descent toward valley milkwater qhorin decreed would rest shadows began grow “shadows friends men black” said

 jon saw sense would pleasant ride light time let bright mountain sun soak cloaks chase chill bones dared three watchers might others waiting sound alarm

 stonesnake curled ragged fur cloak asleep almost jon shared salt beef ghost ebben squire dalbridge fed horses qhorin halfhand sat back rock honing edge longsword long slow strokes jon watched ranger moments summoned courage went “my lord” said “you never asked went girl”

 “i lord jon snow” qhorin slid stone smoothly along steel twofingered hand

 “she told mance would take ran her”

 “she told true”

 “she even claimed kin told story…”

 “…of bael bard rose winterfell stonesnake told happens know song mance would sing old came back ranging passion wildling music aye women well”

 “you knew him”

 “we knew him” voice sad

 friends well brothers jon realized sworn foes “why desert”

 “for wench say crown others would it” qhorin tested edge sword ball thumb “he liked women mance man whose knees bent easily that’s true loved wild better wall blood wildling born taken child raiders put sword left shadow tower going home again”

 “was good ranger”

 “he best us” said halfhand “and worst well fools like thoren smallwood despise wildlings brave jon strong quick clever discipline name free folk one thinks good king wiser maester mance never learned obey”

 “no me” said jon quietly

 qhorin’s shrewd grey eyes seemed see right “so let go” sound least surprised

 “you know”

 “now tell spared her”

 hard put words “my father never used headsman said owed men killed look eyes hear last words looked ygritte’s eyes i…” jon stared hands helplessly “i know enemy evil her”

 “no two”

 “it lives jon said “if seen us sounded horn…”

 “the wildlings would hunt us slay us true enough”

 “stonesnake horn though took ygritte’s knife axe she’s behind us afoot unarmed…”

 “and like threat” qhorin agreed “if needed dead would left ebben done thing myself”

 “then command me”

 “i command told needed done left decide would be” qhorin stood slid longsword back scabbard “when want mountain scaled call stonesnake need put arrow eye foe across windy battlefield summon squire dalbridge ebben make man give secrets lead men must know jon snow know morning”

 “and slain her” asked jon

 “she would dead would know better enough talk ought sleeping leagues go dangers face need strength”

 jon think sleep would come easily knew halfhand right found place wind beneath overhang rock took cloak use blanket “ghost” called “here me” always slept better great white wolf beside comfort smell welcome warmth shaggy pale fur time though ghost look turned away padded around garrons quick gone wants hunt jon thought perhaps goats mountains shadowcats must live something “just don’t try bring ’cat” muttered even direwolf would dangerous tugged cloak stretched beneath rock

 closed eyes dreamed direwolves

 five six scattered apart others felt deep ache emptiness sense incompleteness forest vast cold small lost brothers somewhere sister lost scent sat haunches lifted head darkening sky cry echoed forest long lonely mournful sound died away pricked ears listening answer sound sigh blowing snow

 jon

 call came behind softer whisper strong shout silent turned head searching brother glimpse lean grey shape moving beneath trees nothing only…

 weirwood

 seemed sprout solid rock pale roots twisting myriad fissures hairline cracks tree slender compared weirwoods seen sapling yet growing watched limbs thickening reached sky wary circled smooth white trunk came face red eyes looked fierce eyes yet glad see weirwood brother’s face brother always three eyes

 always came silent shout crow

 sniffed bark smelled wolf tree boy behind scents rich brown smell warm earth hard grey smell stone something else something terrible death knew smelling death cringed back hair bristling bared fangs

 don’t afraid like dark one see see first open eyes see like tree reached touched

 suddenly back mountains paws sunk deep drift snow stood upon edge great precipice skirling pass opened airy emptiness long veeshaped valley lay spread beneath like quilt awash colors autumn afternoon

 vast bluewhite wall plugged one end vale squeezing mountains shouldered aside moment thought dreamed back castle black realized looking river ice several thousand feet high glittering cold cliff great lake deep cobalt waters reflecting snowcapped peaks ringed men valley saw many men thousands huge host tearing great holes halffrozen ground others trained war watched swarming mass riders charged shield wall astride horses larger ants sound mock battle rustling steel leaves drifting faintly wind encampment plan saw ditches sharpened stakes neat rows horse lines everywhere crude earthen shelters hide tents sprouted haphazardly like pox face earth spied untidy mounds hay smelled goats sheep horses pigs dogs great profusion tendrils dark smoke rose thousand cookfires

 army town whole people come together

 across long lake one mounds moved watched closely saw dirt alive shaggy lumbering beast snake nose tusks larger greatest boar ever lived thing riding huge well shape wrong thick leg hips man

 sudden gust cold made fur stand air thrilled sound wings lifted eyes icewhite mountain heights shadow plummeted sky shrill scream split air glimpsed bluegrey pinions spread wide shutting sun…

 “ghost” jon shouted sitting could still feel talons pain “ghost me”

 ebben appeared grabbed shook “quiet mean bring wildlings us what’s wrong boy”

 “a dream” said jon feebly “i ghost edge mountain looking frozen river something attacked bird… eagle think…”

 squire dalbridge smiled “it’s always pretty women dreams would dreamed often”

 qhorin came beside “a frozen river say”

 “the milkwater flows great lake foot glacier” stonesnake put

 “there tree brother’s face wildlings… thousands ever knew existed giants riding mammoths” way light shifted jon judged asleep four five hours head ached back neck talons burned dream

 “tell remember first last” said qhorin halfhand

 jon confused “it dream”

 “a wolf dream” halfhand said “craster told lord commander wildlings gathering source milkwater may dreamed may saw waits us hours farther tell me” made feel half fool talk things qhorin rangers commanded none black brothers laughed however time done even squire dalbridge longer smiling

 “skinchanger” said ebben grimly looking halfhand mean eagle jon wondered skinchangers wargs belonged old nan’s stories world lived life yet strange bleak wilderness rock ice hard believe

 “the cold winds rising mormont feared much benjen stark felt well dead men walk trees eyes balk wargs giants”

 “does mean dreams true well” asked squire dalbridge “lord snow keep mammoths want women”

 “man boy i’ve served watch ranged far any” said ebben “i’ve seen bones giants heard many queer tale want see eyes”

 “be careful don’t see ebben” stonesnake said

 ghost reappear set shadows covered floor pass sun sinking fast toward jagged twin peaks huge mountain rangers named forktop dream true… even thought scared could eagle hurt ghost knocked precipice weirwood brother’s face smelled death darkness

 last ray sun vanished behind peaks forktop twilight filled skirling pass seemed grow colder almost longer climbing fact ground begun descend though yet sharply littered cracks broken boulders tumbled heaps rock dark soon still sight ghost tearing jon apart yet dare shout direwolf would liked things might listening well

 “qhorin” squire dalbridge called softly “there look”

 eagle perched spine rock far outlined darkening sky we’ve seen eagles jon thought need one dreamed

 even ebben would loosed shaft squire stopped “the bird’s well bowshot”

 “i don’t like watching us”

 squire shrugged “nor won’t stop waste good arrow”

 qhorin sat saddle studying eagle long time “we press on” finally said rangers resumed descent

 ghost jon wanted shout

 follow qhorin others glimpsed flash white two boulders patch old snow thought saw stir horse went knees ghost lifted head neck glistened wetly made sound jon peeled glove touched talons torn bloody path fur flesh bird able snap neck

 qhorin halfhand standing “how bad”

 answer ghost struggled feet

 “the wolf strong” ranger said “ebben water stonesnake skin wine hold still jon”

 together washed caked blood direwolf’s fur ghost struggled bared teeth qhorin poured wine ragged red gashes eagle left jon wrapped arms around murmured soothing words soon enough wolf quieted time they’d ripped strip jon’s cloak wrap wounds full dark settled dusting stars set black sky apart black stone “do press on” stonesnake wanted know

 qhorin went garron “back on”

 “back” jon taken surprise

 “eagles sharper eyes men seen run” halfhand wound long black scarf around face swung saddle

 rangers exchanged look man thought argue one one mounted turned mounts toward home “ghost come” called direwolf followed pale shadow moving night

 night rode feeling way twisting pass stretches broken ground wind grew stronger sometimes dark dismounted went ahead foot man leading garron ebben suggested torches might serve well qhorin said “no fire” end reached stone bridge summit began descend darkness shadowcat screamed fury voice bouncing rocks seemed though dozen ’cats giving answer jon thought saw pair glowing eyes ledge overhead big harvest moons

 black hour dawn stopped let horses drink fed handful oats twist two hay “we far place wildlings died” said qhorin “from one man could hold hundred right man” looked squire dalbridge

 squire bowed head “leave many arrows spare brothers” stroked longbow “and see garron apple you’re home he’s earned poor beastie”

 he’s staying die jon realized

 qhorin clasped squire’s forearm gloved hand “if eagle flies look you…”

 “…he’ll sprout new feathers”

 last jon saw squire dalbridge back clambered narrow path heights

 dawn broke jon looked cloudless sky saw speck moving blue ebben saw cursed qhorin told quiet “listen”

 jon held breath heard far away behind call hunting horn echoed mountains

 “and come” said qhorin

 catelyn

 great hall riverrun lonely place two sit supper deep shadows draped walls one torches guttered leaving three catelyn sat staring wine goblet vintage tasted thin sour tongue brienne across father’s high seat empty rest hall even servants gone given leave join celebration

 walls keep thick yet even could hear muffled sounds revelry yard outside ser desmond brought twenty casks cellars smallfolk celebrating edmure’s imminent return robb’s conquest crag hoisting horns nutbrown ale

 cannot blame catelyn thought know care never knew sons never watched bran climb hearts throats pride terror mingled seemed one never heard laugh never smiled see rickon trying fiercely like older brothers stared supper set trout wrapped bacon salad turnip greens red fennel sweetgrass pease onions hot bread brienne eating methodically supper another chore accomplished become sour woman catelyn thought take joy mead meat song laughter become suspicious strangers creature grief dust bitter longings empty place within heart

 sound woman’s eating become intolerable “brienne fit company go join revels would drink horn ale dance rymund’s harping”

 “i made revels lady” big hands tore apart heel black bread brienne stared chunks forgotten “if command i…”

 catelyn could sense discomfort “i thought might enjoy happier company mine”

 “i’m well content” girl used bread sop bacon grease trout fried

 “there another bird morning” catelyn know said “the maester woke dutiful kind kind all” meant tell brienne one knew maester vyman meant keep way until… until…

 foolish woman holding secret heart make less true never tell never speak become dream less dream nightmare halfremembered oh gods would good

 “is news king’s landing” asked brienne

 “would bird came castle cerwyn ser rodrik castellan” dark wings dark words “he gathered power could marching winterfell take castle back” unimportant sounded “but said… wrote… told he…”

 “my lady news sons”

 simple question would answer could simple catelyn tried speak words caught throat “i sons robb” managed terrible words without sob much glad

 brienne looked horror “my lady”

 “bran rickon tried escape taken mill acorn water theon greyjoy mounted heads walls winterfell theon greyjoy ate table since boy ten” said gods forgive said made true

 brienne’s face watery blur reached across table fingers stopped short catelyn’s touch might unwelcome “i… words lady good lady sons they… they’re gods now”

 “are they” catelyn said sharply “what god would let happen rickon baby could deserve death bran… left north opened eyes since fall go woke never return hear laugh again” showed brienne palms fingers “these scars… sent man cut bran’s throat lay sleeping would died bran’s wolf tore man’s throat” gave moment’s pause “i suppose theon killed wolves must elsewise… certain boys would safe long direwolves like robb grey wind daughters wolves now”

 abrupt shift topic left brienne bewildered “your daughters…”

 “sansa lady three always courteous eager please loved nothing well tales knightly valor men would say look grow woman far beautiful ever see often sent away maid could brush hair auburn hair lighter mine thick soft… red would catch light torches shine like copper

 “and arya well… ned’s visitors would oft mistake stableboy rode yard unannounced arya trial must said half boy half wolf pup forbid anything became heart’s desire ned’s long face brown hair always looked though bird nesting despaired ever making lady collected scabs girls collect dolls would say anything came head think must dead too” said felt though giant hand squeezing chest “i want dead brienne theon greyjoy first jaime lannister cersei imp every one every one girls… girls will…”

 “the queen… little girl own” brienne said awkwardly “and sons age hears perhaps she… may take pity and…”

 “send daughters back unharmed” catelyn smiled sadly “there sweet innocence child could wish… robb avenge brothers ice kill dead fire ice ned’s greatsword valyrian steel marked ripples thousand foldings sharp feared touch robb’s blade dull cudgel compared ice easy get theon’s head fear starks use headsmen ned always said man passes sentence swing blade though never took joy duty would oh yes” stared scarred hands opened closed slowly raised eyes “i’ve sent wine”

 “wine” brienne lost “robb or… theon greyjoy”

 “the kingslayer” ploy served well cleos frey hope you’re thirsty jaime hope throat dry tight “i would like come me”

 “i command lady”

 “good” catelyn rose abruptly “stay finish meal peace send later midnight”

 “so late lady”

 “the dungeons windowless one hour much like another hours midnight” footsteps rang hollowly catelyn left hall climbed lord hoster’s solar could hear outside shouting “tully” “a cup cup brave young lord” father dead wanted shout sons dead father lives damn lord still

 lord hoster deep sleep “he cup drearnwine long ago lady” maester vyman said “for pain know here”

 “it makes matter” catelyn said dead alive yet alive poor sweet sons

 “my lady aught might sleeping draught perhaps”

 “thank maester sleep away grief bran rickon deserve better go join celebration sit father time”

 “as lady” vyman bowed left

 lord hoster lay back mouth open breath faint whistling sigh one hand hung edge mattress pale frail fleshless thing warm touched slid fingers closed matter tightly hold cannot keep thought sadly let go yet fingers would seem unbend

 “i one talk father” told “i pray gods answer” lightly kissed hand skin warm blue veins branching like rivers beneath pale translucent skin outside greater rivers flowed red fork tumblestone would flow forever rivers father’s hand soon current would grow still “last night dreamed time lysa got lost riding back seagard remember strange fog came fell behind rest party everything grey could see foot past nose horse lost road branches trees like long skinny arms reaching grab us passed lysa started cry shouted fog seemed swallow sound petyr knew rode back found us…

 “but there’s one find time find way hard hard

 “i keep remembering stark words winter come father robb must fight greyjoys well lannisters gold hat iron chair surely land bled enough want girls back want robb lay sword pick homely daughter walder frey make happy give sons want bran rickon back want…” catelyn hung head “i want” said words gone

 time candle guttered went moonlight slanted slats shutters laying pale silvery bars across father’s face could hear soft whisper labored breathing endless rush waters faint chords love song drifting yard sad sweet “i loved maid red autumn” rymund sang “with sunset hair”

 catelyn never noticed singing ended hours passed yet seemed heartbeat brienne door “my lady” announced softly “midnight come”

 midnight come father thought must duty let go hand

 gaoler furtive little man broken veins nose found bent tankard ale remains pigeon pie little drunk squinted suspiciously “begging forgiveness m’lady lord edmure says one see kingslayer without writing seal upon it”

 “lord edmure father died one told me”

 gaoler licked lips “no m’lady knows”

 “you open cell come lord hoster’s solar tell saw fit defy me”

 eyes fell “as m’lady says” keys chained studded leather belt girdled waist muttered breath sorted found one fit door kingslayer’s cell

 “go back ale leave us” commanded oil lamp hung hook low ceiling catelyn took turned flame “brienne see disturbed”

 nodding brienne took position outside cell hand resting pommel sword “my lady call need me”

 catelyn shouldered aside heavy woodandiron door stepped foul darkness bowels riverrun smelled part old straw crackled underfoot walls discolored patches nitre stone could hear faint rush tumblestone lamplight revealed pail overflowing feces one corner huddled shape another flagon wine stood beside door untouched much ploy ought thankful gaoler drink suppose

 jaime raised hands cover face chains around wrists clanking “lady stark” said voice hoarse disuse “i fear condition receive you”

 “look ser”

 “the light hurts eyes moment would” jaime lannister allowed razor since night taken whispering wood shaggy beard covered face like queen’s glinting gold lamplight whiskers made look like great yellow beast magnificent even chains unwashed hair fell shoulders ropes tangles clothes rotting body face pale wasted… even power beauty man still apparent

 “i see taste wine sent you”

 “such sudden generosity seemed somewhat suspect”

 “i head anytime want would need poison you”

 “death poison seem natural harder claim head simply fell off” squinted floor catgreen eyes slowly becoming accustomed light “i’d invite sit brother neglected provide chair”

 “i stand well enough”

 “can look terrible must say though perhaps it’s light here” fettered wrist ankle cuff chained others could neither stand lie comfortably ankle chains bolted wall “are bracelets heavy enough come add i’ll rattle prettily like”

 “you brought yourself” reminded “we granted comfort tower cell befitting birth station repaid us trying escape”

 “a cell cell casterly rock make one seem sunlit garden one day perhaps i’ll show you”

 cowed hides well catelyn thought “a man chained hand foot keep courteous tongue mouth ser come threatened”

 “no surely pleasure it’s said widows grow weary empty beds kingsguard vow never wed suppose could still service that’s need pour us wine slip gown we’ll see i’m it”

 catelyn stared revulsion ever man beautiful vile one “if said son’s hearing would kill it”

 “only long wearing these” jaime lannister rattled chains “we know boy afraid face single combat”

 “my son may young take fool sadly mistaken… seems quick make challenges army back”

 “did old kings winter hide behind mothers’ skirts well”

 “i grow weary ser things must know”

 “why tell anything”

 “to save life”

 “you think fear death” seemed amuse

 “you crimes earned place torment deepest seven hells gods just”

 “what gods lady catelyn trees husband prayed well serve sister took head off” jaime gave chuckle “if gods world full pain injustice”

 “because men like you”

 “there men like there’s me”

 nothing arrogance pride empty courage madman wasting breath one ever spark honor long dead “if speak drink wine piss ser makes matter me”

 hand door pull said “lady stark” turned waited “things go rust damp” jaime went “even man’s courtesies stay shall answers… price”

 shame “captives set prices”

 “oh you’ll find mine modest enough turnkey tells nothing vile lies cannot even keep straight one day says cersei flayed next it’s father answer questions i’ll answer yours”

 “truthfully”

 “oh it’s truth want careful lady tyrion says people often claim hunger truth seldom like taste it’s served up”

 “i strong enough hear anything care say”

 “as first you’d kind… wine throat raw”

 catelyn hung lamp door moved cup flagon closer jaime sloshed wine around mouth swallowed “sour vile” said “but do” put back wall drew knees chest stared “your first question lady catelyn”

 knowing long game might continue catelyn wasted time “are joffrey’s father”

 “you would never ask unless knew answer”

 “i want lips”

 shrugged “joffrey mine rest cersei’s brood suppose”

 “you admit sister’s lover”

 “i’ve always loved sister owe two answers kin still live”

 “ser stafford lannister slain oxcross told”

 jaime unmoved “uncle dolt sister called it’s cersei tyrion concern well lord father”

 “they live three” long gods good

 jaime drank wine “ask next”

 catelyn wondered would dare answer next question anything lie “how son bran come fall”

 “i flung window”

 easy way said took voice away instant knife would kill thought remembered girls throat constricted said “you knight sworn defend weak innocent”

 “he weak enough perhaps innocent spying us”

 “bran would spy”

 “then blame precious gods brought boy window gave glimpse something never meant see”

 “blame gods” said incredulous “yours hand threw meant die”

 chains chinked softly “i seldom fling children towers improve health yes meant die”

 “and knew danger worse ever gave catspaw bag silver make certain bran would never wake”

 “did now” jaime lifted cup took long swallow “i won’t deny talked boy day night maester lord eddard attended frequently guards even damned direwolves… would required cutting way half winterfell bother boy seemed like die accord”

 “if lie session end” catelyn held hands show fingers palms “the man came slit bran’s throat gave scars swear part sending him”

 “on honor lannister”

 “your honor lannister worth less this” kicked waste pail foulsmelling brown ooze crept across floor cell soaking straw

 jaime lannister backed away spill far chains would allow “i may indeed shit honor won’t deny never yet hired anyone killing believe lady stark wanted bran dead would slain myself”

 gods merciful he’s telling truth “if send killer sister did”

 “if i’d know cersei keeps secrets me”

 “then imp”

 “tyrion innocent bran wasn’t climbing around outside anyone’s window spying”

 “then assassin dagger”

 “what dagger this”

 “it long” said holding hands apart “plain finely made blade valyrian steel dragonbone hilt brother lord baelish tourney prince joffrey’s name day”

 lannister poured drank poured stared wine cup “this wine seems improving drink imagine seem remember dagger describe say how”

 “wagering tilted knight flowers” yet heard words catelyn knew gotten wrong “no… way”

 “tyrion always backed lists” jaime said “but day ser loras unhorsed mischance took boy lightly matter whatever brother wagered lost… dagger change hands recall robert showed night feast grace loved salt wounds especially drunk drunk”

 tyrion lannister said much thing rode mountains moon catelyn remembered refused believe petyr sworn otherwise petyr almost brother petyr loved much fought duel hand… yet jaime tyrion told tale mean brothers seen since departing winterfell year ago “are trying deceive me” somewhere trap

 “i’ve admitted shoving precious urchin window would gain lie knife” tossed another cup wine “believe i’m past caring people say it’s turn robert’s brothers taken field”

 “they have”

 “now there’s niggardly response give next answer poor”

 “stannis marches king’s landing” said grudgingly “renly dead murdered bitterbridge brother black art understand”

 “a pity” jaime said “i rather liked renly though stannis quite another tale side tyrells taken”

 “renly first could say”

 “your boy must feeling lonely”

 “robb sixteen days past… man grown king he’s every battle he’s fought last word taken crag westerlings”

 “he hasn’t faced father yet he”

 “when he’ll defeat you”

 “he took unawares craven’s trick”

 “you dare talk tricks brother tyrion sent us cutthroats envoy’s garb peace banner”

 “if one sons cell wouldn’t brothers much him”

 son brothers thought would share pain creature

 jaime drank wine “what’s brother’s life honor stake eh” another sip “tyrion clever enough realize son never consent ransom me”

 catelyn could deny “robb’s bannermen would sooner see dead rickard karstark particular slew two sons whispering wood”

 “the two white sunburst they” jaime gave shrug “if truth told son trying slay others got way killed fair fight heat battle knight would done same”

 “how still count knight forsaken every vow ever swore”

 jaime reached flagon refill cup “so many vows… make swear swear defend king obey king keep secrets bidding life obey father love sister protect innocent defend weak respect gods obey laws it’s much matter you’re forsaking one vow other” took healthy swallow wine closed eyes instant leaning head back patch nitre wall “i youngest man ever wear white cloak”

 “and youngest betray stood kingslayer”

 “kingslayer” pronounced carefully “and king was” lifted cup “to aerys targaryen second name lord seven kingdoms protector realm sword opened throat golden sword don’t know blood ran red blade lannister colors red gold”

 laughed realized wine done work jaime drained flagon drunk “only man like would proud act”

 “i told men like answer lady stark—did ned ever tell manner father’s death brother’s”

 “they strangled brandon father watched killed lord rickard well” ugly tale sixteen years old asking

 “killed yes how”

 “the cord axe suppose”

 jaime took swallow wiped mouth “no doubt ned wished spare sweet young bride quite maiden well wanted truth ask made bargain deny nothing ask”

 “dead dead” want know

 “brandon different brother wasn’t blood veins instead cold water like me”

 “brandon nothing like you”

 “if say wed”

 “he way riverrun when…” strange telling still made throat grow tight years “…when heard lyanna went king’s landing instead rash thing do” remembered father raged news brought riverrun gallant fool called brandon

 jaime poured last half cup wine “he rode red keep companions shouting prince rhaegar come die rhaegar wasn’t aerys sent guards arrest plotting son’s murder others lords’ sons seems me”

 “ethan glover brandon’s squire” catelyn said “he one survive others jeffory mallister kyle royce elbert arryn jon arryn’s nephew heir” queer still remembered names many years “aerys accused treason summoned fathers court answer charge sons hostages came murdered without trial fathers sons both”

 “there trials sort lord rickard demanded trial combat king granted request stark armored battle thinking duel one kingsguard perhaps instead took throne room suspended rafters two aerys’s pyromancers kindled blaze beneath king told fire champion house targaryen lord rickard needed prove innocent treason was… well burn

 “when fire blazing brandon brought hands chained behind back around neck wet leathern cord attached device king brought tyrosh legs left free though longsword set beyond reach

 “the pyromancers roasted lord rickard slowly banking fanning fire carefully get nice even heat cloak caught first surcoat soon wore nothing metal ashes next would start cook aerys promised… unless son could free brandon tried struggled tighter cord constricted around throat end strangled

 “as lord rickard steel breastplate turned cherryred end gold melted spurs dripped fire stood foot iron throne white armor white cloak filling head thoughts cersei gerold hightower took aside said ‘you swore vow guard king judge him’ white bull loyal end better man agree”

 “aerys…” catelyn could taste bile back throat story hideous suspected true “aerys mad whole realm knew would believe slew avenge brandon stark…”

 “i made claim starks nothing say think passing odd loved one kindness never reviled many finest act robert’s coronation made kneel royal feet beside grand maester pycelle varys eunuch might forgive us crimes took us service ned kissed hand slew aerys preferred scorn arse found sitting robert’s throne think ned stark loved robert better ever loved brother father… even lady never unfaithful robert he” jaime gave drunken laugh “come lady stark don’t find terribly amusing”

 “i find nothing amusing kingslayer”

 “that name don’t think i’ll fuck littlefinger first didn’t never eat another man’s trencher besides you’re half lovely sister” smile cut “i’ve never lain woman cersei way truer ned ever poor old dead ned shit honor ask name bastard fathered”

 catelyn took step backward “brienne”

 “no wasn’t it” jaime lannister upended flagon trickle ran onto face bright blood “snow one white name… like pretty cloaks give us kingsguard swear pretty oaths”

 brienne pushed open door stepped inside cell “you called lady”

 “give sword” catelyn held hand

 tyrion

 motionless gargoyle tyrion lannister hunched one knee atop merlon beyond mud gate desolation fishmarket wharves river seemed taken fire half stannis’s fleet ablaze along joffrey’s kiss wildfire turned proud ships funeral pyres men living torches air full smoke arrows screams

 downstream commoners highborn captains alike could see hot green death swirling toward rafts carracks ferries borne current blackwater long white oars myrish galleys flashed like legs maddened centipedes fought come good centipedes place run

 dozen great fires raged city walls casks burning pitch exploded wildfire reduced candles burning house orange scarlet pennons fluttering insignificantly jade holocaust low clouds caught color burning river roofed sky shades shifting green eerily beautiful terrible beauty like dragonfire tyrion wondered aegon conqueror felt like flew field fire

 furnace wind lifted crimson cloak beat bare face yet could turn away dimly aware gold cloaks cheering hoardings voice join half victory enough

 saw another hulks he’d stuffed full king aerys’s fickle fruits engulfed hungry flames fountain burning jade rose river blast bright shield eyes plumes fire thirty forty feet high danced upon waters crackling hissing moments washed screams hundreds water drowning burning little

 hear shrieking stannis see burning work much mine somewhere seething mass men south blackwater stannis watching tyrion knew he’d never brother robert’s thirst battle would command rear reserve much lord tywin lannister wont like sitting warhorse right clad bright armor crown upon head crown red gold varys says points fashioned shapes flames

 “my ships” joffrey’s voice cracked shouted wallwalk huddled guards behind ramparts golden circlet kingship adorned battle helm “my kingslander’s burning queen cersei loyal man look that’s seaflower there” pointed new sword green flames licking seaflower’s golden hull creeping oars captain turned upriver quickly enough evade wildfire

 doomed tyrion knew way come forth meet stannis would sensed trap arrow could aimed spear even stone catapult wildfire loosed beyond control mere men “it could helped” told nephew “our fleet doomed case”

 even atop merlon—he short see ramparts he’d boost up—the flames smoke chaos battle made impossible tyrion see happening downriver castle seen thousand times mind’s eye bronn would whipped oxen motion moment stannis’s flagship passed red keep chain ponderous heavy great winches turned slowly creaking rumbling whole usurper’s fleet would passed time first glimmer metal could seen beneath water links would emerge dripping wet glistening mud link link link whole great chain stretched taut king stannis rowed fleet blackwater would row

 even getting away river’s current tricky thing wildfire spreading evenly hoped main channel aflame good many myrmen made south bank looked escape unscathed least eight ships landed city walls landed wrecked comes thing they’ve put men ashore worse good part south wing enemy’s first two battle lines well upstream inferno hulks went stannis would left thirty forty galleys guess enough bring whole host across regained courage

 might take bit time even bravest would dismayed watching thousand fellows consumed wildfire hallyne said sometimes substance burned hot flesh melted like tallow yet even so…

 tyrion illusions men concerned battle looks going sour they’ll break they’ll break bad jacelyn bywater warned way win make certain battle stayed sweet start finish

 could see dark shapes moving charred ruins riverfront wharfs time another sortie thought men never vulnerable first staggered ashore must give foe time form north bank

 scrambled merlon “tell lord jacelyn we’ve got enemy riverfront” said one runners bywater assigned another said “bring compliments ser arneld ask swing whores thirty degrees west” angle would allow throw farther far water

 “mother promised could whores” joffrey said tyrion annoyed see king lifted visor helm doubtless boy cooking inside heavy steel… last thing needed stray arrow punching nephew’s eye

 clanged visor shut “keep closed grace sweet person precious us all” don’t want spoil pretty face either “the whores yours” good time flinging firepots onto burning ships seemed pointless joff antler men trussed naked square antlers nailed heads they’d brought iron throne justice promised send stannis man heavy boulder cask burning pitch could thrown deal farther gold cloaks wagering whether traitors would fly way across blackwater “be quick grace” told joffrey “we’ll want trebuchets throwing stones soon enough even wildfire burn forever”

 joffrey hurried happy escorted ser meryn tyrion caught ser osmund wrist could follow “whatever happens keep safe keep understood”

 “as command” ser osmund smiled amiably

 tyrion warned trant kettleblack would happen harm come king joffrey dozen veteran gold cloaks waiting foot steps i’m protecting wretched bastard well cersei thought bitterly see alayaya

 sooner joff runner came panting steps “my lord hurry” threw one knee “they’ve landed men tourney grounds hundreds they’re bringing ram king’s gate”

 tyrion cursed made steps rolling waddle podrick payne waited horses galloped river row pod ser mandon moore coming hard behind shuttered houses steeped green shadow traffic get way tyrion commanded street kept clear defenders could move quickly one gate next even time reached king’s gate could hear booming crash wood wood told battering ram brought play groaning great hinges sounded like moans dying giant gatehouse square littered wounded saw lines horses well hurt sellswords gold cloaks enough form strong column “form up” shouted leapt ground gate moved impact another blow “who commands you’re going out”

 “no” shadow detached shadow wall become tall man dark grey armor sandor clegane wrenched helm hands let fall ground steel scorched dented left ear snarling hound sheared gash one eye sent wash blood across hound’s old burn scars masking half face

 “yes” tyrion faced

 clegane’s breath came ragged “bugger you”

 sellsword stepped beside “we three times half men killed hurt wildfire bursting around us horses screaming like men men like horses—”

 “did think hired fight tourney shall bring nice iced milk bowl raspberries get fucking horse dog”

 blood clegane’s face glistened red eyes showed white drew longsword

 afraid tyrion realized shocked hound frightened tried explain need “they’ve taken ram gate hear need disperse them—”

 “open gates rush inside surround kill them” hound thrust point longsword ground leaned upon pommel swaying “i’ve lost half men horse well i’m taking fire”

 ser mandon moore moved tyrion’s side immaculate enameled white plate “the king’s hand commands you”

 “bugger king’s hand” hound’s face sticky blood pale milk “someone bring drink” gold cloak officer handed cup clegane took swallow spit flung cup away “water fuck water bring wine”

 dead feet tyrion could see wound fire… he’s done need find someone else ser mandon looked men knew would clegane’s fear shaken without leader would refuse well ser mandon… dangerous man jaime said yes man men would follow

 distance tyrion heard another great crash walls darkening sky awash sheets green orange light long could gate hold

 madness thought sooner madness defeat defeat death shame “very well i’ll lead sortie”

 thought would shame hound back valor wrong clegane laughed “you”

 tyrion could see disbelief faces “me ser mandon you’ll bear king’s banner pod helm” boy ran obey hound leaned notched bloodstreaked sword looked wide white eyes ser mandon helped tyrion mount “form up” shouted

 big red stallion wore crinet chamfron crimson silk draped hindquarters coat mail high saddle gilded podrik payne handed helm shield heavy oak emblazoned golden hand red surrounded small golden lions walked horse circle looking little force men handful responded command twenty sat horses eyes white hound’s looked contemptuously others knights sellswords ridden clegane “they say i’m half man” said “what make lot you”

 shamed well enough knight mounted helmetless rode join others pair sellswords followed king’s gate shuddered moments size tyrion’s command doubled trapped fight must less dwarfs

 “you won’t hear shout joffrey’s name” told “you won’t hear yell casterly rock either city stannis means sack that’s gate he’s bringing come kill son bitch” tyrion unsheathed axe wheeled stallion around trotted toward sally port thought following never dared look

 “with mud gate assault folly tell ser osmund want it’s dangerous fetch back castle”

 “the imp said—”

 sansa lifted cup lips took sip wine cloyingly sweet strong

 sansa backed away window retreating toward safety bed i’ll go sleep told wake new day sky blue fighting done someone tell whether i’m live die “lady” whimpered softly wondering would meet wolf dead

 something stirred behind hand reached dark grabbed wrist

 sansa opened mouth scream another hand clamped face smothering fingers rough callused sticky blood “little bird knew you’d come” voice drunken rasp

 outside swirling lance jade light spit stars filling room green glare saw moment black green blood face dark tar eyes glowing like dog’s sudden glare light faded hulking darkness stained white cloak

 “if scream i’ll kill believe that” took hand mouth breath coming ragged hound flagon wine bedside table took long pull “don’t want ask who’s winning battle little bird”

 “who” said frightened defy

 hound laughed “i know who’s lost me”

 “going” tried wriggle free grasp iron

 “the little bird repeats whatever hears going yes”

 “where go”

 “away away fires go iron gate suppose north somewhere anywhere”

 “you won’t get out” sansa said “the queen’s closed maegor’s city gates shut well”

 “not white cloak this” patted pommel sword “the man tries stop dead man unless he’s fire” laughed bitterly

 “why come here”

 “you promised song little bird forgotten”

 didn’t know meant couldn’t sing sky aswirl fire men dying hundreds thousands “i can’t” said “let go you’re scaring me”

 “everything scares look look me”

 blood masked worst scars eyes white wide terrifying burnt corner mouth twitched twitched sansa could smell stink sweat sour wine stale vomit reek blood blood blood

 arya

 heads dipped tar slow rot every morning arya went well draw fresh water roose bolton’s basin pass beneath faced outward never saw faces liked pretend one joffrey’s tried picture pretty face would look dipped tar crow could fly peck stupid fat pouty lips

 heads never lacked attendants carrion crows wheeled gatehouse raucous unkindness quarreled upon ramparts every eye screaming cawing taking air whenever sentry passed along battlements sometimes maester’s ravens joined feast well flapping rookery wide black wings ravens came crows would scatter return moment larger birds gone

 ravens remember maester tothmure arya wondered sad quork wonder doesn’t answer perhaps dead could speak secret tongue living could hear

 tothmure sent axe dispatching birds casterly rock king’s landing night harrenhal fallen lucan armorer making weapons lannisters goodwife harra telling lady whent’s household serve steward giving lord tywin keys treasure vault cook spared said he’d made weasel soup stocks hammered together pretty pia women who’d shared favors lannister soldiers stripped shaved left middle ward beside bear pit free use man wanted

 “what want” arya squirmed grasp amabel halfcrazed since they’d cut harra’s head

 “see there” arnabel pointed across yard pia “when northman falls you’ll is”

 “let go” tried wrench free amabel tightened fingers

 “he fall harrenhal pulls end lord tywin’s he’ll marching back power turn punish disloyal don’t think won’t know did” old woman laughed “i may turn harra old broom i’ll save handle’s cracked splintery—”

 arya swung bucket weight water made turn hands didn’t smash amabel’s head wanted woman let go anyway water came drenched “don’t ever touch me” arya shouted “or i’ll kill get away”

 sopping goodwife amabel jabbed thin finger flayed man front arya’s tunic “you think you’re safe little bloody man teat you’re lannisters coming see happens get here”

 threequarters water splashed ground arya return well told lord bolton said head would next harra’s got dark thought drew bucket wouldn’t though

 half many heads gendry caught arya looking “admiring work” asked

 angry he’d liked lucan knew still wasn’t fair “it’s steelshanks walton’s work” said defensively “and mummers lord bolton”

 “and gave us weasel soup”

 arya punched arm “it hot broth hated ser amory too”

 “you it” elmar could friendly needed help afterward would always remember squire serving girl liked boast son lord crossing nephew bastard grandson trueborn son account going marry princess

 arya didn’t care precious princess didn’t like giving commands “i bring m’lord water basin he’s bedchamber leeched regular black leeches big pale ones”

 elmar’s eyes got big boiled eggs leeches terrified especially big pale ones looked like jelly filled blood “i forgot you’re skinny push heavy barrel”

 “i forgot you’re stupid” arya picked pail “maybe get leeched there’s leeches neck big pigs” left barrel

 lord’s bedchamber crowded entered qyburn attendance dour walton mail shirt greaves plus dozen freys brothers half brothers cousins roose bolton lay abed naked leeches clung inside arms legs dotted pallid chest long translucent things turned glistening pink fed bolton paid mind arya

 “i mean besieged here” roose bolton’s voice soft men strain hear chambers always strangely hushed

 “what then” demanded ser jared frey lean balding pockmarked “is edmure tully drunk victory thinks give lord tywin battle open field”

 he’ll beat arya thought he’ll beat red fork you’ll see unnoticed went stand qyburn

 “lord tywin many leagues here” bolton said calmly “he many matters yet settle king’s landing march harrenhal time”

 ser aenys shook head stubbornly “you know lannisters lord king stannis thought lord tywin thousand leagues away well undid him”

 ser harys haigh frey mother’s side nodded vigorously “if lord tywin could defeat seasoned man like stannis baratheon chance boy king him” looked round brothers cousins support several muttered agreement

 “someone must courage say it” ser hosteen said “the war lost king robb must made see that”

 roose bolton studied pale eyes “his grace defeated lannisters every time faced battle”

 “he lost north” insisted hosteen frey “he lost winterfell brothers dead…”

 “gods good theon know must attack sworn…”

 “if host still arms gate sun sets beth hang” said theon “another hostage follow grave first light another sunset every dawn every dusk mean death gone lack hostages” wait reply wheeled smiler around rode back toward castle went slowly first thought archers back soon drove canter small heads watched come spikes tarred flayed faces looming larger every yard stood little beth cassel noosed crying theon put heel smiler broke hard gallop smiler’s hooves clattered drawbridge like drumbeats

 yard dismounted handed reins wex “it may stay them” told black lorren “we’ll know sunset take girl till keep somewhere safe” layers leather steel wool slick sweat “i need cup wine vat wine would even better”

 fire laid ned stark’s bedchamber theon sat beside filled cup heavybodied red castle vaults wine sour mood attack thought gloomily staring flames ser rodrik loves daughter still castellan knight theon noose around neck lord balon commanding army without warhorns would already sounded attack doubt thank gods ser rodrik ironborn men green lands made softer stuff though certain would prove soft enough

 old man gave command storm castle regardless winterfell would fall theon entertained delusions count seventeen might kill three four five times number end would overwhelmed

 theon stared flames rim wine goblet brooding injustice “i rode beside robb stark whispering wood” muttered frightened night like one thing go battle surrounded friends another perish alone despised mercy thought miserably

 wine brought solace theon sent wex fetch bow took old inner ward stood loosing shaft shaft archery butts shoulders ached fingers bloody pausing long enough pull arrows targets another round saved bran’s life bow reminded would could save women came well linger whatever saw theon’s face sent away quickly

 behind broken tower stood summit jagged crown fire collapsed upper stories long ago sun moved shadow tower moved well gradually lengthening black arm reaching theon greyjoy time sun touched wall grasp hang girl northmen attack thought loosed shaft hang know threats empty knocked another arrow bow way none

 “if hundred archers good might chance hold castle” voice said softly

 turned maester luwin behind “go away” theon told “i enough counsel”

 “and life enough lord prince”

 raised bow “one word i’ll put shaft heart”

 “you won’t”

 theon bent bow drawing grey goose feathers back cheek “care make wager”

 “i last hope theon”

 hope thought yet lowered bow half inch said “i run”

 “i speak running take black”

 “the night’s watch” theon let bow unbend slowly pointed arrow ground

 “ser rodrik served house stark life house stark always friend watch deny open gates lay arms accept terms must let take black”

 brother night’s watch meant crown sons wife… meant life life honor ned stark’s brother chosen watch jon snow well

 black garb aplenty tear krakens even horse black could rise high watch—chief rangers likely even lord commander let asha keep bloody islands they’re dreary served eastwatch could command ship there’s fine hunting beyond wall women wildling woman wouldn’t want prince bed slow smile crept across face black cloak can’t turned i’d good man…

 “prince theon” sudden shout shattered daydream kromm loping across ward “the northmen—”

 felt sudden sick sense dread “is attack”

 maester luwin clutched arm “there’s still time raise peace banner—”

 “they’re fighting” kromm said urgently “more men came hundreds first made join others they’ve fallen them”

 “is asha” come save

 kromm gave shake head “no northmen tell bloody man banner”

 flayed man dreadfort reek belonged bastard bolton capture theon recalled hard believe vile creature like could sway boltons change allegiance nothing else made sense “i’ll see myself” theon said

 maester luwin trailed time reached battlements dead men dying horses strewn market square outside gates saw battle lines swirling chaos banners blades shouts screams rang cold autumn air ser rodrik seemed numbers dreadfort men better led taken others unawares theon watched charge wheel charge chopping larger force bloody pieces every time tried form houses could hear crash iron axeheads oaken shields terrified trumpeting maimed horse inn burning saw

 black lorren appeared beside stood silently time sun low west painting fields houses glowing red thin wavering cry pain drifted walls warhorn sounded beyond burning houses theon watched wounded man drag painfully across ground smearing life’s blood dirt struggled reach well stood center market square died got wore leather jerkin conical halfhelm badge tell side he’d fought

 crows came blue dust evening stars “the dothraki believe stars spirits valiant dead” theon said maester luwin told long time ago

 “dothraki”

 “the horselords across narrow sea”

 “oh them” black lorren frowned beard “savages believe manner foolish things”

 night grew darker smoke spread harder make happening din steel gradually diminished nothing shouts warhorns gave way moans piteous wailing finally column mounted men rode drifting smoke head knight dark armor rounded helm gleamed sullen red pale pink cloak streamed shoulders outside main gate reined one men shouted castle open

 “are friend foe” black lorren bellowed

 “would foe bring fine gifts” red helm waved hand three corpses dumped front gates torch waved bodies defenders upon walls might see faces dead

 “the old castellan” said black lorren

 “with leobald tallhart cley cerwyn” boy lord taken arrow eye ser rodrik lost left arm elbow maester luwin gave wordless cry dismay turned away battlements fell knees sick

 “the great pig manderly craven leave white harbor would brought well” shouted red helm

 saved theon thought feel empty victory sweet victory deliverance prayed glanced maester luwin think close came yielding taking black…

 “open gates friends” perhaps tonight theon would sleep without fear dreams might bring

 dreadfort men made way across moat inner gates theon descended black lorren maester luwin meet yard pale red pennons trailed ends lances many carried battleaxes greatswords shields hacked half splinters “how many men lose” theon asked red helm dismounted

 “twenty thirty” torchlight glittered chipped enamel visor helm gorget wrought shape man’s face shoulders skinless bloody mouth open silent howl anguish

 “ser rodrik fivetoone”

 “aye thought us friends common mistake old fool gave hand took half arm instead let see face” man put hands helm lifted head holding crook arm

 “reek” theon said disquieted serving man get fine armor

 man laughed “the wretch dead” stepped closer “the girl’s fault run far horse would lamed might able flee gave mine saw riders ridge done liked take turn still warm pull shove clothes hands—calfskin boots velvet doublet silverchased swordbelt even sable cloak ride dreadfort told bring help take horse he’s swifter wear ring father gave they’ll know came he’d learned better question time put arrow back i’d smeared girl’s filth dressed rags might hanged anyway chance saw” rubbed back hand across mouth “and sweet prince woman promised brought two hundred men well brought three times many green boys fieldhands neither father’s garrison”

 theon given word time flinch pay pound flesh deal later “harrag” said “go kennels bring palla for…”

 “ramsay” smile plump lips none pale pale eyes “snow wife called ate fingers say bolton” smile curdled “so you’d offer kennel girl good service way it”

 tone voice theon like liked insolent way dreadfort men looking “she promised”

 “she smells dogshit i’ve enough bad smells happens think i’ll bedwarmer instead call kyra”

 “are mad” theon said angrily “i’ll you—”

 bastard’s backhand caught square cheekbone shattered sickening crunch beneath lobstered steel world vanished red roar pain

 sometime later theon found ground rolled onto stomach swallowed mouthful blood close gates tried shout late dreadfort men cut red rolfe kenned pouring river mail sharp swords ringing ears horror around black lorren sword already four pressing saw ulf go crossbow bolt belly ran great hall maester luwin trying reach knight warhorse planted spear shoulders swung back ride another man whipped torch round round head lofted toward thatched roof stables “save freys” bastard shouting flames roared upward “and burn rest burn burn all”

 last thing theon greyjoy saw smiler kicking free burning stables mane ablaze screaming rearing…





 tyrion

 dreamed cracked stone ceiling smells blood shit burnt flesh air full acrid smoke men groaning whimpering around time time scream would pierce air thick pain tried move found fouled bedding smoke air made eyes water crying must let father see lannister casterly rock lion must lion live lion die lion hurt much though weak groan lay filth shut eyes nearby someone cursing gods heavy monotonous voice listened blasphemies wondered dying time room faded

 found outside city walking world without color ravens soared grey sky wide black wings carrion crows rose feasts furious clouds wherever set steps white maggots burrowed black corruption wolves grey silent sisters together stripped flesh fallen corpses strewn tourney fields sun hot white penny shining upon grey river rushed around charred bones sunken ships pyres dead rose black columns smoke whitehot ashes work thought tyrion lannister died command

 first sound world time began hear voices dead soft terrible wept moaned begged end pain cried help wanted mothers tyrion never known mother wanted shae walked alone amidst grey shadows trying remember…

 silent sisters stripping dead men armor clothes bright dyes leached surcoats slain garbed shades white grey blood black crusty watched naked bodies lifted arm leg carried swinging pyres join fellows metal cloth thrown back white wooden wagon pulled two tall black horses

 many dead many corpses hung limply faces slack stiff swollen gas unrecognizable hardly human garments sisters took decorated black hearts grey lions dead flowers pale ghostly stags armor dented gashed chainmail riven broken slashed kill known somehow forgotten

 dark woke first could see nothing time vague outlines bed appeared around drapes drawn could see shape carved bedposts droop velvet canopy head yielding softness featherbed pillow beneath head goose bed bed bedchamber

 warm inside drapes great heap furs blankets covered sweating fever thought groggily felt weak pain stabbed struggled lift hand gave effort head felt enormous big bed heavy raise pillow body could scarcely feel come tried remember battle came back fits flashes fight along river knight who’d offered gauntlet bridge ships…

 ser mandon saw dead empty eyes reaching hand green fire shining white enamel plate fear swept cold rush beneath sheets could feel bladder letting go would cried he’d mouth dream thought head pounding help someone help jaime shae mother someone… tysha…

 woke darkness cold empty room draperies drawn something felt wrong turned around though could said alone pushing back blankets tried sit pain much soon subsided breathing raggedly face least part right side one huge ache stab pain went chest whenever lifted arm what’s happened even battle seemed half dream tried think back hurt badly knew ser mandon…

 memory frightened tyrion made hold turn head stare hard tried kill mistake part dream would cut half pod not… pod where’s pod

 gritting teeth grabbed hold bed hangings yanked drapes ripped free canopy overhead tumbled half rushes half even small effort dizzied room whirled around bare walls dark shadows single narrow window saw chest he’d owned untidy pile clothing battered armor bedchamber realized even tower hand someone moved shout anger came muffled moan moved die thought gave struggle closed eyes room dank cold burning

 would kiss hours spend whole days lolling bed listening waves touching body wonder seemed find delight sometimes would sing loved maid fair summer sunlight hair “i love tyrion” would whisper went sleep night “i love lips love voice words say treat gentle love face”

 “my face”

 “yes yes love hands touch cock love cock love feels it’s me”

 “it loves lady”

 “i love say name tyrion lannister goes mine lannister t’other part tyrion tysha tysha tyrion tyrion lord tyrion…”

 lies thought feigned gold whore jaime’s whore jaime’s gift lady lie face seemed fade away dissolving behind veil tears even gone could still hear faint faroff sound voice calling name “…my lord hear lord tyrion lord lord”

 haze poppied sleep saw soft pink face leaning back dank room torn bed hangings face wrong round brown fringe beard “do thirst lord milk good milk must fight don’t try move need rest” copper funnel one damp pink hand flask

 man leaned close tyrion’s fingers slid underneath chain many metals grabbed pulled maester dropped flask spilling milk poppy blanket tyrion twisted could feel links digging flesh man’s fat neck “no more” croaked hoarse certain even spoken must maester choked reply “unhand please lord… need milk pain… chain don’t unhand no…”

 pink face beginning purple tyrion let go maester reeled back sucking air reddened throat showed deep white gouges links pressed eyes white tyrion raised hand face made ripping motion hardened mask

 “you… want bandages it” maester said last “but i’m to… would be… unwise lord yet healed queen would…”

 mention sister made tyrion growl one pointed finger maester coiled hand fist crushing choking promise unless fool bid

 thankfully understood “i… lord commands sure but… unwise wounds…”

 “do it” louder time

 bowing man left room return moments later bearing long knife slender sawtooth blade basin water pile soft cloths several flasks tyrion managed squirm backward inches half sitting pillow maester bade still slid tip knife chin beneath mask slip hand cersei free thought could feel blade sawing stiffened linen inches throat

 fortunately soft pink man one sister’s braver creatures moment felt cool air cheeks pain well best ignore maester discarded bandages still crusty potion “be still must wash wound” touch gentle water warm soothing wound tyrion thought remembering sudden flash bright silver seemed pass eyes “this like sting some” maester warned wet cloth wine smelled crushed herbs sting traced line fire way across tyrion’s face twisted burning poker nose fingers clawed bedclothes sucked breath somehow managed scream maester clucking like old hen “it would wiser leave mask place flesh knit lord still looks clean good good found cellar among dead dying wounds filthy one ribs broken doubtless feel blow mace perhaps fall it’s hard say took arrow arm joins shoulder showed signs mortification time feared might lose limb treated boiling wine maggots seems healing clean…”

 “name” tyrion breathed “name”

 maester blinked “why tyrion lannister lord brother queen remember battle sometimes head wounds—”

 “your name” throat raw tongue forgotten shape words

 “i maester ballabar”

 “ballabar” tyrion repeated “bring looking glass”

 “my lord” maester said “i would counsel… might ah unwise were… wound…”

 “bring it” say mouth stiff sore punch split lip “and drink wine poppy”

 maester rose flushfaced hurried came back flagon pale amber wine small silvered looking glass ornate golden frame sitting edge bed poured half cup wine held tyrion’s swollen lips trickle went cool though could hardly taste “more” said cup empty maester ballabar poured end second cup tyrion lannister felt strong enough face face

 maester stood beside bed like goose take flight “my lord like scar…”

 “most like” snort laughter turned wince pain would scar sure likely nose would growing back anytime soon face ever fit look “teach play axes” grin felt tight “where place” hurt talk tyrion long silence

 “ah maegor’s holdfast lord chamber queen’s ballroom grace wanted kept close might watch herself”

 i’ll wager “return me” tyrion commanded “own bed chambers” men maester find one trust

 “your own… lord would possible king’s hand taken residence former chambers”

 “i king’s hand” growing exhausted effort speaking confused hearing

 maester ballabar looked distressed “no lord i… wounded near death lord father taken duties lord tywin he…”

 “here”

 “since night battle lord tywin saved us smallfolk say king renly’s ghost wiser men know better father lord tyrell knight flowers lord littlefinger rode ashes took usurper stannis rear great victory lord tywin settled tower hand help grace set realm rights gods praised”

 “gods praised” tyrion repeated hollowly bloody father bloody littlefinger renly’s ghost “i want…” want could tell pink ballabar fetch shae could send could trust varys bronn ser jacelyn “…my squire” finished “pod payne” pod bridge boats lad saved life

 “the boy odd boy”

 “odd boy podrick payne go send him”

 “as lord” maester ballabar bobbed head hurried tyrion could feel strength seeping waited wondered long asleep cersei would sleep forever won’t obliging

 podrick payne entered bedchamber timid mouse “my lord” crept close bed boy bold battle frightened sickroom tyrion wondered “i meant stay maester sent away”

 “send away hear talk’s hard need dreamwine dreamwine milk poppy go frenken frenken ballabar watch make bring here” pod stole glance tyrion’s face quickly averted eyes well cannot blame “i want” tyrion went “mine guard bronn where’s bronn”

 “they made knight”

 even frowning hurt “find bring him”

 “as say lord bronn”

 tyrion seized lad’s wrist “ser mandon”

 boy flinched “i nnever meant kkkk—”

 “dead you’re certain dead”

 shuffled feet sheepish “drowned”

 “good say nothing nothing”

 time squire left last tyrion’s strength gone well lay back closed eyes perhaps would dream tysha wonder she’d like face thought bitterly





 jon

 qhorin halfhand told find brush fire jon knew end near

 good feel warm little told hacked bare branches trunk dead tree ghost sat haunches watching silent ever howl i’m dead bran’s wolf howled fell jon wondered shaggydog howl far winterfell grey wind nymeria wherever might

 moon rising behind one mountain sun sinking behind another jon struck sparks flint dagger finally wisp smoke appeared qhorin came stood first flame rose flickering shavings bark dead dry pine needles “as shy maid wedding night” big ranger said soft voice “and near fair sometimes man forgets pretty fire be”

 man you’d expect speak maids wedding nights far jon knew qhorin spent whole life watch ever love maid wedding could ask instead fanned fire blaze acrackle peeled stiff gloves warm hands sighed wondering ever kiss felt good warmth spread fingers like melting butter

 halfhand eased ground sat crosslegged fire flickering light playing across hard planes face two remained five rangers fled skirling pass back bluegrey wilderness frostfangs

 first jon nursed hope squire dalbridge would keep wildlings bottled pass they’d heard call faroff horn every man knew squire fallen later spied eagle soaring dusk great bluegrey wings stonesnake unslung bow bird flew range could much string ebben spat muttered darkly wargs skinchangers

 glimpsed eagle twice day heard hunting horn behind echoing mountains time seemed little louder little closer night fell halfhand told ebben take squire’s garron well ride east mormont haste back way come rest would draw pursuit “send jon” ebben urged “he ride fast me”

 “jon different part play”

 “he half boy still”

 “no” said qhorin “he man night’s watch”

 moon rose ebben parted stonesnake went east short way doubled back obscure tracks three remained set toward southwest

 days nights blurred one slept saddles stopped long enough feed water garrons mounted bare rock rode gloomy pine forests drifts old snow icy ridges across shallow rivers names sometimes qhorin stonesnake would loop back sweep away tracks futile gesture watched every dawn every dusk saw eagle soaring peaks speck vastness sky

 scaling low ridge two snowcapped peaks shadowcat came snarling lair ten yards away beast gaunt halfstarved sight sent stonesnake’s mare panic reared ran ranger could get back control stumbled steep slope broken leg

 ghost ate well day qhorin insisted rangers mix garron’s blood oats give strength taste foul porridge almost choked jon forced cut dozen strips raw stringy meat carcass chew rode left rest shadowcats

 question riding double stonesnake offered lay wait pursuit surprise came perhaps could take hell qhorin refused “if man night’s watch make frostfangs alone afoot brother go mountains horse must go around make fist tell mormont jon saw tell old powers waking faces giants wargs worse tell trees eyes again”

 chance jon thought watched stonesnake vanish snowcovered ridge tiny black bug crawling across rippling expanse white

 every night seemed colder night lonely ghost always never far either even apart jon sensed nearness glad halfhand companionable men qhorin’s long grey braid swung slowly motion horse often would ride hours without word spoken sounds soft scrape horseshoes stone keening wind blew endlessly heights slept dream wolves brothers anything even dreams cannot live told

 “is sword sharp jon snow” asked qhorin halfhand across flickering fire

 “my sword valyrian steel old bear gave me”

 “do remember words vow”

 “yes” words man like forget said could never unsaid changed life forever

 “say jon snow”

 “if like” voices blended one beneath rising moon ghost listened mountains bore witness “night gathers watch begins shall end death shall take wife hold lands father children shall wear crowns win glory shall live die post sword darkness watcher walls fire burns cold light brings dawn horn wakes sleepers shield guards realms men pledge life honor night’s watch night nights come”

 done sound faint crackle flames distant sigh wind jon opened closed burnt fingers holding tight words mind praying father’s gods would give strength die bravely hour came would long garrons near end strength qhorin’s mount would last another day jon suspected

 flames burning low warmth fading “the fire soon go out” qhorin said “but wall ever fall fires go out”

 nothing jon could say nodded

 “we may escape yet” ranger said “or not”

 “i’m afraid die” half lie

 “it may easy jon”

 understand “what mean”

 “if taken must yield”

 “yield” blinked disbelief wildlings make captives men called crows killed except for…“they spare oathbreakers join like mance rayder”

 “and you”

 “no” shook head “never won’t”

 “you command you”

 “command but…”

 “our honor means lives long realm safe man night’s watch”

 “yes but—”

 “there jon snow not”

 jon sat straight “i am”

 “then hear taken go wildling girl captured urged may demand cut cloak ribbons swear oath father’s grave curse brothers lord commander must balk whatever asked bid you… heart remember ride eat fight long takes watch”

 “for what” jon asked

 “would knew” said qhorin “your wolf saw diggings valley milkwater seek bleak distant place find must learn return lord mormont brothers duty lay jon snow”

 “i’ll say” jon said reluctantly “but… tell won’t old bear least you’ll tell never broke oath”

 qhorin halfhand gazed across fire eyes lost pools shadow “when see next swear it” gestured fire “more wood want bright hot”

 jon went cut branches snapping one two tossing flames tree dead long time seemed live fire fiery dancers woke within stick wood whirl spin glowing gowns yellow red orange

 “enough” qhorin said abruptly “now ride”

 “ride” dark beyond fire night cold “ride where”

 “back” qhorin mounted weary garron one time “the fire draw past hope come brother”

 jon pulled gloves raised hood even horses seemed reluctant leave fire sun long gone cold silver shine halfmoon remained light way treacherous ground lay behind know qhorin mind perhaps chance hoped want play oathbreaker even good reason

 went cautiously moving silent man horse could move retracing steps reached mouth narrow defile icy little stream emerged two mountains jon remembered place watered horses sun went

 “the water’s icing up” qhorin observed turned aside “else we’d ride streambed break ice like see keep close cliffs there’s crook half mile hide us” rode defile jon gave one last wistful look distant fire followed

 farther went closer cliffs pressed either side followed moonlit ribbon stream back toward source icicles bearded stony banks jon could still hear sound rushing water beneath thin hard crust

 great jumble fallen rock blocked way partway section cliff face fallen surefooted little garrons able pick way beyond walls pinched sharply stream led foot tall twisting waterfall air full mist like breath vast cold beast tumbling waters shone silver moonlight jon looked dismay way qhorin might able climb cliffs horses think would last long afoot

 “quickly now” halfhand commanded big man small horse rode iceslick stones right curtain water vanished reappear jon put heels horse went garron best shy away falling water slapped frozen fists shock cold seemed stop jon’s breath

 drenched shivering

 cleft rock barely large enough man horse pass beyond walls opened floor turned soft sand jon could feel spray freezing beard ghost burst waterfall angry rush shook droplets fur sniffed darkness suspiciously lifted leg one rocky wall qhorin already dismounted jon “you knew place here”

 “when older heard brother tell followed shadowcat falls” unsaddled horse removed bit bridle ran fingers shaggy mane “there way heart mountain come dawn found us press first watch mine brother” qhorin seated sand back wall vague black shadow gloom cave rush falling waters jon heard soft sound steel leather could mean halfhand drawn sword

 took wet cloak cold damp strip ghost stretched beside licked glove curling sleep jon grateful warmth wondered fire still burning outside gone wall ever fall fires go moon shone curtain falling water lay shimmering pale stripe across sand time faded went dark

 sleep came last nightmares dreamed burning castles dead men rising unquiet graves still dark qhorin woke halfhand slept jon sat back cave wall listening water waiting dawn

 break day chewed halffrozen strip horsemeat saddled garrons fastened black cloaks around shoulders watch halfhand made halfdozen torches soaking bundles dry moss oil carried saddlebag lit first one led way dark holding pale flame jon followed horses stony path twisted turned first steeply spots grew narrow hard convince garrons could squeeze time come lost told went even eagle see solid stone lost ride hard fist tell old bear know

 emerged back light long hours later eagle waiting perched dead tree hundred feet slope ghost went bounding rocks bird flapped wings took air

 qhorin’s mouth tightened followed flight eyes

 “here good place make stand” declared “the mouth cave shelters us cannot get behind us without passing mountain sword sharp jon snow”

 “yes” said

 “we’ll feed horses they’ve served us bravely poor beasts”

 jon gave garron last oats stroked shaggy mane ghost prowled restlessly amongst rocks pulled gloves tighter flexed burnt fingers shield guards realms men

 hunting horn echoed mountains moment later jon heard baying hounds “they us soon” announced qhorin “keep wolf hand”

 “ghost me” jon called direwolf returned reluctantly side tail held stiffly behind

 wildlings came boiling ridge half mile away hounds ran snarling greybrown beasts little wolf blood ghost bared teeth fur bristling “easy” jon murmured “stay” overhead heard rustle wings eagle landed outcrop rock screamed triumph

 hunters approached warily perhaps fearing arrows jon counted fourteen eight dogs large round shields made skins stretched woven wicker painted skulls half hid faces behind crude helms wood boiled leather either wing archers notched shafts strings small woodandhorn bows loose rest seemed armed spears mauls one chipped stone axe wore bits armor looted dead rangers stolen raids wildlings mine smelt smiths fewer forges north wall

 qhorin drew longsword tale taught fight left hand losing half right part legend said handled blade better ever jon stood shoulder shoulder big ranger pulled longclaw sheath despite chill air sweat stung eyes

 ten yards cave mouth hunters halted leader came alone riding beast seemed goat horse surefooted way climbed uneven slope man mount grew nearer jon could hear clattering armored bones cow bones sheep bones bones goats aurochs elk great bones hairy mammoths… human bones well

 “rattleshirt” qhorin called icypolite

 “to crows lord o’ bones” rider’s helm made broken skull giant arms bearclaws sewn boiled leather

 qhorin snorted “i see lord dog dressed chickenbones rattles rides”

 wildling hissed anger mount reared rattle jon could hear bones strung together loosely clacked clattered moved “it’s bones i’ll rattling soon halfhand i’ll boil flesh make byrnie ribs i’ll carve teeth cast runes eat oaten porridge skull”

 “if want bones come get them”

 rattleshirt seemed reluctant numbers meant little close confines rocks black brothers taken stand winkle cave wildlings would need come two time another company edged horse beside one fighting women called spearwives “we fourandten two crows eight dogs wolf” called “fight run ours”

 “show them” commanded rattleshirt

 woman reached bloodstained sack drew trophy ebben bald egg dangled head ear “he died brave” said

 “but died” said rattleshirt “same like you” freed battleaxe brandishing head good steel wicked gleam blades ebben never man neglect weapons wildlings crowded forward beside yelling taunts chose jon mockery “is wolf boy” skinny youth called unlimbering stone flail “he’ll cloak sun down” side line another spearwife opened ragged furs show jon heavy white breast “does baby want momma come suck o’ boy” dogs barking

 “they would shame us folly” qhorin gave jon long look “remember orders”

 “belike need flush crows” rattleshirt bellowed clamor “feather them”

 “no” word burst jon’s lips bowmen could loose took two quick steps forward “we yield”

 “they warned bastard blood craven” heard qhorin halfhand say coldly behind “i see run new masters coward”

 face reddening jon descended slope rattleshirt sat horse wildling stared eyeholes helm said “the free folk need cravens”

 “he craven” one archers pulled sewn sheepskin helm shook head shaggy red hair “this bastard o’ winterfell spared let live”

 jon met ygritte’s eyes words

 “let die” insisted lord bones “the black crow tricksy bird trust not”

 rock eagle flapped wings split air scream fury

 “the bird hates jon snow” said ygritte “and well might man killed him”

 “i know” said jon truthfully trying remember face man slain pass “you told mance would take me”

 “and will” ygritte said

 “mance here” said rattleshirt “ragwyle gut him”

 big spearwife narrowed eyes said “if crow would join free folk let show us prowess prove truth him”

 “i’ll whatever ask” words came hard jon said

 rattleshirt’s bone armor clattered loudly laughed “then kill halfhand bastard”

 “as could” said qhorin “turn snow die”

 qhorin’s sword coming somehow longclaw leapt upward block force impact almost knocked bastard blade jon’s hand sent staggering backward must balk whatever asked shifted twohand grip quick enough deliver stroke big ranger brushed aside contemptuous ease back forth went black cloaks swirling youth’s quickness savage strength qhorin’s lefthand cuts halfhand’s longsword seemed everywhere raining one side driving would keeping balance already could feel arms growing numb

 even ghost’s teeth closed savagely around ranger’s calf somehow qhorin kept feet instant twisted opening jon planted pivoted ranger leaning away instant seemed jon’s slash touched string red tears appeared across big man’s throat bright ruby necklace blood gushed qhorin halfhand fell

 ghost’s muzzle dripping red point bastard blade stained last half inch jon pulled direwolf away knelt one arm around light already fading qhorin’s eyes “…sharp” said lifting maimed fingers hand fell gone

 knew thought numbly knew would ask thought samwell tarly grenn dolorous edd pyp toad back castle black lost lost bran rickon robb

 “get up” rough hands dragged feet jon resist “do name”

 ygritte answered “his name jon snow eddard stark’s blood winterfell”

 ragwyle laughed “who would thought qhorin halfhand slain lordling’s byblow”

 “gut him” rattleshirt still ahorse eagle flew perched atop bony helm screeching

 “he yielded” ygritte reminded

 “aye slew brother” said short homely man rusteaten iron halfhelm

 rattleshirt rode closer bones clattering “the wolf work foully done halfhand’s death mine”

 “we saw eager take it” mocked ragwyle

 “he warg” said lord bones “and crow like not”

 “a warg may be” ygritte said “but never frightened us” others shouted agreement behind eyeholes yellowed skull rattleshirt’s stare malignant yielded grudgingly free folk indeed thought jon

 burned qhorin halfhand he’d fallen pyre made pine needles brush broken branches wood still green burned slow smoky sending black plume bright hard blue sky afterward rattleshirt claimed charred bones others threw dice ranger’s gear ygritte cloak

 “will return skirling pass” jon asked know could face heights garron could survive second crossing

 “no” said “there’s nothing behind us” look gave sad “by mance well milkwater marching wall”





 bran

 ashes fell like soft grey snow

 padded dry needles brown leaves edge wood pines grew thin beyond open fields could see great piles manrock stark swirling flames wind blew hot rich smell blood burnt meat strong began slaver

 yet one smell drew onward others warned back sniffed drifting smoke men many men many horses fire fire fire smell dangerous even hard cold smell iron stuff manclaws hardskin smoke ash clouded eyes sky saw great winged snake whose roar river flame bared teeth snake gone behind cliffs tall fires eating stars

 night fires crackled great roar crash made earth jump feet dogs barked whined horses screamed terror howls shuddered night howls manpack wails fear wild shouts laughter screams beast noisy man pricked ears listened brother growled every sound prowled trees piney wind blew ashes embers sky time flames began dwindle gone sun rose grey smoky morning

 “bran” voice whispering softly “bran come back come back bran bran…”

 closed third eye opened two old two blind two dark place men blind someone holding could feel arms around warmth body snuggled close could hear hodor singing “hodor hodor hodor” quietly

 “bran” meera’s voice “you thrashing making terrible noises see”

 “winterfell” tongue felt strange thick mouth one day come back won’t know talk anymore “it winterfell fire horse smells steel blood killed everyone meera”

 felt hand face stroking back hair “you’re sweaty” said “do need drink”

 “a drink” agreed held skin lips bran swallowed fast water ran corner mouth always weak thirsty came back hungry remembered dying horse taste blood mouth smell burnt flesh morning air “how long”

 “three days” said jojen boy come softfoot perhaps along blind black world bran could said “we afraid you”

 “i summer” bran said

 “too long you’ll starve meera dribbled little water throat smeared honey mouth enough”

 “i ate” said bran “we ran elk drive treecat tried steal him” cat tanandbrown half size direwolves fierce remembered musky smell way snarled limb oak

 “the wolf ate” jojen said “not take care bran remember are”

 remembered well bran boy bran broken better bran beastling wonder would sooner dream summer dreams wolf dreams chill damp darkness tomb third eye finally opened could reach summer whenever wanted even touched ghost talked jon though maybe dreamed could understand jojen always trying pull back bran used strength arms squirm sitting position “i tell osha saw go”

 wildling woman gave answer “nowhere m’lord i’ve fill o’ blundering black” heard scrape heel stone turned head toward sound saw nothing thought could smell wasn’t sure stank alike summer’s nose tell one “last night pissed king’s foot” osha went “might morning say sleeping i’m not” slept lot bran nothing else sleep eat sleep sometimes talk little… much whispers safe osha might liked better never talked way quiet rickon stop hodor muttering “hodor hodor hodor” endlessly

 “osha” bran said “i saw winterfell burning” left could hear soft sound rickon’s breathing

 “a dream” said osha

 “a wolf dream” said bran “i smelled nothing smells like fire blood”

 “whose blood”

 “men horses dogs everyone go see”

 “this scrawny skin mine’s one got” said osha “that squid prince catches hold o’ they’ll strip back whip”

 meera’s hand found bran’s darkness gave fingers squeeze “i’ll go you’re afraid”

 bran heard fingers fumbling leather followed sound steel flint spark flew caught osha blew softly long pale flame awoke stretching upward like girl toes osha’s face floated touched flame head torch bran squint pitch began burn filling world orange glare light woke rickon sat yawning

 shadows moved looked instant dead rising well lyanna brandon lord rickard stark father lord edwyle father lord willam brother artos implacable lord donnor lord beron lord rodwell oneeyed lord jonnel lord barth lord brandon lord cregan fought dragonknight stone chairs sat stone wolves feet came warmth seeped bodies dark hall dead living feared tread

 mouth empty tomb waited lord eddard stark beneath stately granite likeness six fugitives huddled round little cache bread water dried meat “little enough left” osha muttered blinked stores “i’d need go soon steal food case we’d eating hodor”

 “hodor” hodor said grinning

 “is day night there” osha wondered “i’ve lost count o’ such”

 “day” bran told “but it’s dark smoke”

 “m’lord certain”

 never moving broken body reached instant seeing double stood osha holding torch meera jojen hodor double row tall granite pillars long dead lords behind stretching away darkness… winterfell well grey drifting smoke massive oakandiron gates charred askew drawbridge tangle broken chains missing planks bodies floated moat islands crows

 “certain” declared

 osha chewed moment “i’ll risk look want lot o’ close behind meera get bran’s basket”

 “are going home” rickon asked excitedly “i want horse want applecakes butter honey shaggy going shaggydog is”

 “yes” bran promised “but quiet”

 meera strapped wicker basket hodor’s back helped lift bran easing useless legs holes queer flutter belly knew awaited make less fearful set turned give father one last look seemed bran sadness lord eddard’s eyes want go thought it’s time

 osha carried long oaken spear one hand torch naked sword hung back one last bear mikken’s mark forged lord eddard’s tomb keep ghost rest mikken slain ironmen guarding armory good steel hard resist even meant graverobbing meera claimed lord rickard’s blade though complained heavy brandon took namesake’s sword made uncle never known knew would much use fight even blade felt good hand

 certain go ever come back go die

 “wait” osha said reached twisting stone stairs led surface deeper levels kings ancient still sat dark thrones handed meera torch “i’ll grope way up” time could hear sound footfalls grew softer softer faded away entirely “hodor” said hodor nervously

 bran told hundred times much hated hiding dark much wanted see sun ride horse wind rain moment upon afraid he’d felt safe darkness could even find hand front face easy believe enemies could ever find either stone lords given courage even could see known

 seemed long heard anything bran begun fear something happened osha brother squirming restlessly “i want go home” said loudly hodor bobbed head said “hodor” heard footsteps growing louder minutes osha emerged light looking grim “something blocking door can’t move it”

 “hodor move anything” said bran

 osha gave huge stableboy appraising look “might come then”

 steps narrow climb single file osha led behind came hodor bran crouched low back head wouldn’t hit ceiling meera followed torch jojen brought rear leading rickon hand around around went bran thought could smell smoke perhaps torch

 door crypts made ironwood old heavy lay slant ground one person could approach time osha tried reached bran could see budging “let hodor try”

 pull bran basket first would get squished meera squatted beside steps one arm thrown protectively across shoulders osha hodor traded places “open door hodor” bran said

 huge stableboy put hands flat door pushed grunted “hodor” slammed fist wood much jump “hodor”

 “use back” urged bran “and legs”

 turning hodor put back wood shoved “hodor” put one foot higher step bent slant door tried rise time wood groaned creaked “hodor” foot came step hodor spread legs apart braced straightened face turned red bran could see cords neck bulging strained weight “hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor” came dull rumble suddenly door jerked upward shaft daylight fell across bran’s face blinding moment another shove brought sound shifting stone way open osha poked spear slid rickon squirmed meera’s legs follow hodor shoved door open way stepped surface reeds carry bran last steps

 sky pale grey smoke eddied around stood shadow first keep remained one whole side building torn loose fallen away stone shattered gargoyles lay strewn across yard fell bran thought saw gargoyles broken many pieces made wonder alive nearby crows pecking body crushed beneath tumbled stone lay facedown bran could say

 first keep used many hundreds years shell ever floors burned inside beams wall fallen away could see right rooms even privy yet behind broken tower still stood burned jojen reed coughing smoke “take home” rickon demanded “i want home” hodor stomped circle “hodor” whimpered small voice stood huddled together ruin death around

 “we made noise enough wake dragon” osha said “but there’s one come castle’s dead burned bran dreamed best—” broke suddenly noise behind whirled spear ready

 two lean dark shapes emerged behind broken tower padding slowly rubble rickon gave happy shout “shaggy” black direwolf came bounding toward summer advanced slowly rubbed head bran’s arm licked face

 “we go” said jojen “so much death bring wolves besides summer shaggydog four feet”

 “aye soon enough” osha agreed “but need food may survived stay together meera keep shield guard backs”

 took rest morning make slow circuit castle great granite walls remained blackened fire otherwise untouched within death destruction doors great hall charred smoldering inside rafters given way whole roof crashed onto floor green yellow panes glass gardens shards trees fruits flowers torn left exposed die stables made wood thatch nothing remained ashes embers dead horses bran thought dancer wanted weep shallow steaming lake beneath library tower hot water gushing crack side bridge bell tower rookery collapsed yard maester luwin’s turret gone saw dull red glow shining narrow cellar windows beneath great keep second fire still burning one storehouses

 osha called softly blowing smoke went one answered saw one dog worrying corpse ran caught scents direwolves rest slain kennels maester’s ravens paying court corpses crows broken tower attended others bran recognized poxy tym even though someone taken axe face one charred corpse outside ashen shell mother’s sept sat arms drawn hands balled hard black fists punch anyone dared approach “if gods good” osha said low angry voice “the others take work”

 “it theon” bran said blackly

 “no look” pointed across yard spear “that’s one ironmen that’s greyjoy’s warhorse see black one arrows him” moved among dead frowning “and here’s black lorren” hacked cut badly beard looked reddishbrown “took did” osha turned one corpses foot “there’s badge little man red”

 “the flayed man dreadfort” said bran

 summer howled darted away

 “the godswood” meera reed ran direwolf shield frog spear hand rest trailed threading way smoke fallen stones air sweeter trees pines along edge wood scorched deeper damp soil green wood defeated flames “there power living wood” said jojen reed almost knew bran thinking “a power strong fire”

 edge black pool beneath shelter heart tree maester luwin lay belly dirt trail blood twisted back damp leaves crawled summer stood bran thought dead first meera touched throat maester moaned “hodor” hodor said mournfully “hodor”

 gently eased luwin onto back grey eyes grey hair robes grey well darker blood soaked “bran” said softly saw sitting tall hodor’s back “and rickon too” smiled “the gods good knew…”

 “knew” said bran uncertainly

 “the legs could tell… clothes fit muscles legs… poor lad…” coughed blood came inside “you vanished… woods… though”

 “we never went” said bran “well edge doubled back sent wolves make trail hid father’s tomb”

 “the crypts” luwin chuckled froth blood lips maester tried move gave sharp gasp pain

 tears filled bran’s eyes man hurt took maester could maester hurt

 “we’ll need make litter carry him” said osha

 “no use” said luwin “i’m dying woman”

 “you can’t” said rickon angrily “no can’t” beside shaggydog bared teeth growled

 maester smiled “hush child i’m much older can… die please”

 “hodor down” said bran hodor went knees beside maester

 “listen” luwin said osha “the princes… robb’s heirs not… together… hear”

 wildling woman leaned spear “aye safer apart take i’d thought might cerwyns…”

 maester luwin shook head though plain see effort cost “cerwyn boy’s dead ser rodrik leobald tallhart lady hornwood… slain deepwood fallen moat cailin soon torrhen’s square ironmen stony shore east bastard bolton”

 “then where” asked osha

 “white harbor… umbers… know… war everywhere… man neighbor winter coming… folly black mad folly…” maester luwin reached grasped bran’s forearm fingers closing desperate strength “you must strong strong”

 “i be” bran said though hard ser rodrik killed maester luwin everyone everyone…

 “good” maester said “a good boy your… father’s son bran go”

 osha gazed weirwood red face carved pale trunk “and leave gods”

 “i beg…” maester swallowed “a… drink water and… another boon would…”

 “aye” turned meera “take boys”

 jojen meera led rickon hodor followed low branches whipped bran’s face pushed trees leaves brushed away tears osha joined yard moments later said word maester luwin “hodor must stay bran legs” wildling woman said briskly “i take rickon me”

 “we’ll go bran” said jojen reed

 “aye thought might” said osha “believe i’ll try east gate follow kingsroad ways”

 “we’ll take hunter’s gate” said meera

 “hodor” said hodor

 “seven hells” gave leashes hard yank get dogs’ attention “track bastards that’s bear print want meat find” hounds huddled closer whining chett snapped short lash heads black bitch snarled “dog meat would taste good bear” warned breath frosting every word

 lark sisterman stood arms crossed chest hands tucked armpits wore black wool gloves always complaining fingers frozen “it’s bloody cold hunt” said “bugger bear he’s worth freezing over”

 “we can’t go back emptyhand lark” rumbled small paul brown whiskers covered face “the lord commander wouldn’t like that” ice big man’s squashed pug nose snot frozen huge hand thick fur glove clenched tight around shaft spear

 “bugger old bear too” said sisterman thin man sharp features nervous eyes “mormont dead daybreak remember cares likes”

 small paul blinked black little eyes maybe forgotten chett thought stupid enough forget anything “why kill old bear don’t go let be”

 “you think he’ll let us be” said lark “he’ll hunt us want hunted great muttonhead”

 “no” said small paul “i don’t want don’t”

 “so you’ll kill him” said lark

 “yes” huge man stamped butt spear frozen riverbank “i shouldn’t hunt us”

 chett spat “how many could tell”

 “many twenty thirty thousand didn’t stay count harma five hundred van every one ahorse”

 men around fire exchanged uneasy looks rare thing find even dozen mounted wildlings five hundred…

 “smallwood sent bannen wide around van catch peek main body” kedge went “there end they’re moving slow frozen river four five miles day don’t look like mean go back villages neither more’n half women children driving animals goats sheep even aurochs dragging sledges they’d loaded bales fur sides meat cages chickens butter churns spinning wheels every damn thing mules garrons heavy laden you’d think backs would break women well”

 “chett” said small paul trudged along stony game trail sentinels soldier pines “what bird”

 “what bloody bird” last thing needed muttonhead going bird

 “the old bear’s raven” small paul said “if kill who’s going feed bird”

 “who bloody well cares kill bird like”

 “i don’t want hurt bird” big man said “but that’s talking bird tells did”

 lark sisterman laughed “small paul thick castle wall” mocked

 “you shut that” said small paul dangerously

 “paul” said chett big man got angry “when find old man lying pool blood throat slit won’t need bird tell someone killed him”

 small paul chewed moment “that’s true” allowed “can keep bird like bird”

 “he’s yours” said chett shut

 “we always eat get hungry” offered lark

 small paul clouded “best try eat bird lark best not”

 chett could hear voices drifting trees “close bloody mouths we’re almost fist”

 emerged near west face hill walked around south slope gentler near edge forest dozen men taking archery practice carved outlines trunks trees loosing shafts “look” said lark “a pig bow”

 watched trees fat boy wrestled longbow tall red moon face screwed concentration three arrows stood ground tarly nocked drew held draw long moment tried aim let fly shaft vanished greenery chett laughed loudly snort sweet disgust

 “we’ll never find one i’ll blamed” announced edd tollett dour greyhaired squire everyone called dolorous edd “nothing ever goes missing don’t look ever since time lost horse could helped white snowing expect”

 “the wind took one” said grenn another friend lord snow’s “try hold bow steady sam”

 “it’s heavy” fat boy complained pulled second arrow one went high sailing branches ten feet target

 “i believe knocked leaf tree” said dolorous edd “fall falling fast enough there’s need help it” sighed “and know follows fall gods cold shoot last arrow samwell believe tongue freezing roof mouth”

 ser piggy lowered bow chett thought going start bawling “it’s hard”

 “notch draw loose” said grenn “go on”

 dutifully fat boy plucked final arrow earth notched longbow drew released quickly without squinting along shaft painstakingly first two times arrow struck charcoal outline low chest hung quivering “i hit him” ser piggy sounded shocked “grenn see edd look hit him”

 “put ribs i’d say” said grenn

 “did kill him” fat boy wanted know

 tollett shrugged “might punctured lung lung trees don’t rule” took bow sam’s hand “i’ve seen worse shots though aye made few”

 ser piggy beaming look you’d think he’d actually done something saw chett dogs smile curled died squeaking

 “you hit tree” chett said “let’s see shoot it’s mance rayder’s lads won’t stand arms leaves rustling oh they’ll come right screaming face bet you’ll piss breeches one o’ plant axe right little pig eyes last thing you’ll hear thunk makes bites skull”

 fat boy shaking dolorous edd put hand shoulder “brother” said solemnly “just happened way doesn’t mean samwell suffer same”

 “what talking tollett”

 “the axe split skull true half wits leaked ground dogs ate them”

 climb steep even side fist gentlest slope partway dogs started barking pulling figuring they’d get fed soon gave taste boot instead crack whip big ugly one snapped tied went report “the prints like giant said dogs wouldn’t track” told mormont front big black tent “down river like could old prints”

 “a pity” lord commander mormont bald head great shaggy grey beard sounded tired looked “we might better bit fresh meat” raven shoulder bobbed head echoed “meat meat meat”

 could cook bloody dogs chett thought kept mouth shut old bear sent way that’s last time i’ll need bow head one thought satisfaction seemed growing even colder would swom wasn’t possible dogs huddled together miserably hard frozen mud chett half tempted crawl instead wrapped black wool scarf round lower part face leaving slit mouth winds warmer kept moving found made slow circuit perimeter wad sourleaf sharing chew two black brothers guard hearing say none men day watch part scheme even figured good sense thinking

 mostly thinking bloody cold

 wind rising shadows lengthened made high thin sound shivered stones ringwall “i hate sound” little giant said “it sounds like babe brush wailing away milk”

 finished circuit returned dogs found lark waiting “the officers old bear’s tent talking something fierce”

 “that’s do” said chett “they’re highborn blane get drunk words instead wine”

 lark sidled closer “cheeseforwits keeps going bird” warned glancing make certain one close “now he’s asking cached seed damn thing”

 “it’s raven” said chett “it eats corpses”

 “them teeth sound pretty dead” said hake

 dywen clacked wooden teeth “no wolves neither where’d go figure”

 “someplace warm” said chett

 dozen odd brothers sat fire four gave one hard squinty look ate see showed signs breaking dirk seemed calm enough sitting silent sharpening blade way every night sweet donnel hill easy japes white teeth fat red lips yellow locks wore artful tumble shoulders claimed bastard lannister maybe chett use pretty boys bastards neither sweet donnel seemed like hold

 less certain forester brothers called sawwood snoring anything trees looked restless might never snore maslyn worse chett could see sweat trickling face despite frigid wind beads moisture sparkled firelight like many little wet jewels maslyn wasn’t eating neither staring soup smell make sick i’ll need watch one chett thought

 “assemble” shout came suddenly dozen throats quickly spread every part hilltop camp “men night’s watch assemble central fire”

 frowning chett finished soup followed rest

 old bear stood fire smallwood locke wythers blane ranged behind row mormont wore cloak thick black fur raven perched upon shoulder preening black feathers can’t good chett squeezed brown bernarr shadow tower men everyone gathered save watchers woods guards ringwall mormont cleared throat spat spittle frozen hit ground “brothers” said “men night’s watch”

 smallwood stepped forward “mance rayder means break wall bring red war seven kingdoms well that’s game two play morrow we’ll bring war him”

 “there thousands” someone called behind chett

 “we’ll die” maslyn’s voice green fear

 “die” screamed mormont’s raven flapping black wings “die die die”

 “many us” old bear said “mayhaps even us another lord commander said thousand years ago dress us black remember words brothers swords darkness watchers walls…”

 “the fire burns cold” ser mallador locke drew longsword

 “the light brings dawn” others answered swords pulled scabbards

 drawing near three hundred upraised swords many voices crying “the horn wakes sleepers shield guards realms men” chett choice join voice others air misty breath firelight glinted steel pleased see lark softfoot sweet donnel hill joining big fools rest good sense draw attention hour close

 jaime would welcome good rain dungeons riverrun cleanest place seven kingdoms must smell like overripe cheese

 cleos squinted downriver “smoke”

 thin grey finger crooked rising south bank several miles twisting curling jaime made smouldering remains large building live oak full dead women

 crows scarcely started corpses thin ropes cut deeply soft flesh throats wind blew twisted swayed “this chivalrously done” said brienne close enough see clearly “no true knight would condone wanton butchery”

 “true knights see worse every time ride war wench” said jaime “and worse yes”

 brienne turned rudder toward shore “i’ll leave innocents food crows”

 “a heartless wench crows need eat well stay river leave dead alone woman”

 brienne gave shout jumped rather climbing “to boat quick there’s sail”

 made haste could though jaime could hardly run pulled back skiff cousin brienne shoved oar raised sail hurriedly “ser cleos i’ll need row well”

 bid skiff began cut water bit faster current wind oars worked jaime sat chained peering upriver top sail visible way red fork looped looked across fields moving north behind screen trees moved south knew deceptive lifted hands shade eyes “mud red watery blue” announced

 brienne’s big mouth worked soundlessly giving look cow chewing cud “faster ser”

 good part hour played peekandseek pursuers sweeping around bends small wooded isles starting hope somehow might left behind pursuit distant sail became visible ser cleos paused stroke “the others take them” wiped sweat brow

 “row” brienne said

 “that river galley coming us” jaime announced he’d watched every stroke seemed grow little larger “nine oars side means eighteen men crowded fighters well rowers larger sails cannot outrun her”

 ser cleos froze oars “eighteen said”

 “six us i’d want eight bracelets hinder somewhat” jaime held wrists “unless lady brienne would kind unshackle me”

 ignored putting effort stroke

 “we half night’s start them” jaime said “they’ve rowing since dawn resting two oars time they’ll exhausted sight sail given burst strength last ought able kill good many them”

 ser cleos gaped “but… eighteen”

 “at least likely twenty twentyfive”

 cousin groaned “we can’t hope defeat eighteen”

 “did say could best hope die swords hands” perfectly sincere jaime lannister never afraid death

 brienne broke rowing sweat stuck strands flaxcolored hair forehead grimace made look homelier ever “you protection” said voice thick anger almost growl

 laugh fierceness she’s hound teats thought would teats speak “then protect wench free protect myself”

 galley skimming downriver great wooden dragonfly water around churned white furious action oars gaining visibly men deck crowding forward came metal glinted hands jaime could see bows well archers hated archers

 catelyn


 ser desmond grell served house tully life squire catelyn born knight learned walk ride swim masteratarms day wed seen lord hoster’s little cat become young woman great lord’s lady mother king seen become traitor well

 brother edmure named ser desmond castellan riverrun rode battle fell deal crime ease discomfort brought father’s steward dour utherydes wayn two men stood looked ser desmond stout redfaced embarrassed utherydes grave gaunt melancholy waited speak given lives father’s service repaid disgrace catelyn thought wearily

 “your sons” ser desmond said last “maester vyman told us poor lads terrible terrible but…”

 “we share grief lady” said utherydes wayn “all riverrun mourns but…”

 “the news must driven mad” ser desmond broke “a madness grief mother’s madness men understand know…”

 “i did” catelyn said firmly “i understood knew treasonous fail punish men believe connived together free jaime lannister mine act mine alone alone must answer put kingslayer’s empty irons wear proudly must be”

 “fetters” word seemed shock poor ser desmond “for king’s mother lord’s daughter impossible”

 “mayhaps” said steward utherydes wayn “my lady would consent confined chambers ser edmure returns time alone pray murdered sons”

 “confined aye” ser desmond said “confined tower cell would serve”

 “if confined let father’s chambers might comfort last days”

 ser desmond considered moment “very well shall lack comfort courtesy freedom castle denied visit sept need elsewise remain lord hoster’s chambers lord edmure returns”

 “as wish” brother lord father lived catelyn correct “set guard must give pledge shall attempt escape”

 ser desmond nodded plainly glad done distasteful task sadeyed utherydes wayn lingered moment castellan took leave “it grave thing lady naught ser desmond sent ser robin ryger bring back kingslayer… failing head”

 catelyn expected less may warrior give strength sword arm brienne prayed done could nothing remained hope

 things moved father’s bedchamber dominated great canopied bed born pillars carved shapes leaping trout father moved half turn stair sickbed placed face triangular balcony opened solar whence could see rivers always loved well

 lord hoster sleeping catelyn entered went balcony stood one hand rough stone balustrade beyond point castle swift tumblestone joined placid red fork could see long way downriver striped sail comes east ser robin returning moment surface waters empty thanked gods went back inside sit father

 catelyn could say lord hoster knew presence brought comfort gave solace would say knew crime father wondered would done lysa hands enemies would condemn call mother’s madness

 smell death room heavy smell sweet foul clinging reminded sons lost sweet bran little rickon slain hand theon greyjoy ned’s ward still grieved ned would always grieve ned babies taken well… “it monstrous cruel thing lose child” whispered softly father

 lord hoster’s eyes opened “tansy” husked voice thick pain

 know catelyn grown accustomed taking mother sister lysa tansy name strange “it’s catelyn” said “it’s cat father”

 “forgive me… blood… oh please… tansy…”

 could another woman father’s life village maiden wronged young perhaps could found comfort serving wench’s arms mother died queer thought unsettling suddenly felt though known father “who tansy lord want send father would find woman still live”

 lord hoster groaned “dead” hand groped “you’ll others… sweet babes trueborn”

 others catelyn thought forgotten ned gone still talking tansy lysa mother

 coughed sputum came bloody clutched fingers “ good wife gods bless you… sons… trueborn sons… aaahhh” sudden spasm pain made lord hoster’s hand tighten nails dug hand gave muffled scream

 maester vyman came quickly mix another dose milk poppy help lord swallow soon enough lord hoster tully fallen back heavy sleep

 “he asking woman” said cat “tansy”

 “tansy” maester looked blankly

 “you know one name serving girl woman nearby village perhaps someone years past” catelyn gone riverrun long time

 “no lady make inquiries like utherydes wayn would surely know person ever served riverrun tansy say smallfolk often name daughters flowers herbs” maester looked thoughtful “there widow recall used come castle looking old shoes need new soles name tansy think pansy come many years…”

 “her name violet” said catelyn remembered old woman well

 “was it” maester looked apologetic “my pardons lady catelyn may stay ser desmond decreed speak far duties require”

 “then must commands” catelyn could blame ser desmond given small reason trust doubt feared might use loyalty many folk riverrun would still feel toward lord’s daughter work mischief free war least told little

 maester gone donned woolen cloak stepped onto balcony sunlight shimmered rivers gilding surface waters rolled past castle catelyn shaded eyes glare searching distant sail dreading sight one nothing nothing meant hopes still alive

 day watched well night legs ached standing raven came castle late afternoon flapping great black wings rookery dark wings dark words thought remembering last bird come horror brought

 maester vyman returned evenfall minister lord tully bring catelyn modest supper bread cheese boiled beef horseradish “i spoke utherydes wayn lady quite certain woman name tansy ever riverrun service”

 “there raven today saw jaime taken again” slain gods forbid

 “no lady we’ve word kingslayer”

 “is another battle edmure difficulty robb please kind put fears rest”

 “my lady not…” vyman glanced make certain one else room “lord tywin left riverlands all’s quiet fords”

 “whence came raven then”

 “from west” answered busying lord hoster’s bedclothes avoiding eyes

 “was news robb”

 hesitated “yes lady”

 “something wrong” knew manner hiding something “tell robb hurt” dead gods good please tell dead

 “his grace took wound storming crag” maester vyman said still evasive “but writes cause concern hopes return soon”

 “a wound sort wound serious”

 “no cause concern writes”

 “all wounds concern cared for”

 “i certain maester crag tend doubt”

 “where wounded”

 “my lady commanded speak sorry” gathering potions vyman made hurried exit catelyn left alone father milk poppy done work lord hoster sunk heavy sleep thin line spittle ran one corner open mouth dampen pillow catelyn took square linen wiped away gently touched lord hoster moaned “forgive me” said softly could scarcely hear words “tansy… blood… blood… gods kind…”

 words disturbed could say though could make sense blood thought must come back blood father woman needs much forgiveness

 night catelyn slept fitfully haunted formless dreams children lost dead well break day woke father’s words echoing ears sweet babes trueborn… would say unless… could fathered bastard woman tansy could believe brother edmure yes would surprised learn edmure dozen natural children father lord hoster tully never

 could tansy pet name called lysa way called cat lord hoster mistaken sister you’ll others said sweet babes trueborn lysa miscarried five times twice eyrie thrice king’s landing… never riverrun lord hoster would hand comfort never unless… unless child first time…

 sister married day left father’s care new husbands ridden rejoin robert’s rebellion afterward moon blood come accustomed time lysa gushed happily sons certain carried “your son heir winterfell mine eyrie oh they’ll best friends like ned lord robert they’ll brothers cousins truly know it” happy

 lysa’s blood come long joy gone catelyn always thought lysa simply little late child…

 remembered first time gave sister robb hold small redfaced squalling strong even full life sooner catelyn placed babe sister’s arms lysa’s face dissolved tears hurriedly thrust baby back catelyn fled

 lost child might explain father’s words much else besides… lysa’s match lord arryn hastily arranged jon old man even older father old man without heir first two wives left childless brother’s son murdered brandon stark king’s landing gallant cousin died battle bells needed young wife house arryn continue… young wife known fertile

 catelyn rose threw robe descended steps darkened solar stand father sense helpless dread filled “father” said “father know did” longer innocent bride head full dreams widow traitor grieving mother wise wise ways world “you made take her” whispered “lysa price jon arryn pay swords spears house tully”

 small wonder sister’s marriage loveless arryns proud prickly honor lord jon might wed lysa bind tullys cause rebellion hopes son would hard love woman came bed soiled unwilling would kind doubt dutiful yes lysa needed warmth

 next day broke fast catelyn asked quill paper began letter sister vale arryn told lysa bran rickon struggling words mostly wrote father thoughts wrong time grows short maester vyman says dare make milk poppy stronger time father lay sword shield time rest yet fights grimly yield sake think needs forgiveness war made road eyrie riverrun dangerous travel know surely strong force knights could see safely mountains moon hundred men thousand cannot come write least words love might die peace write shall read ease way

 even set quill aside asked sealing wax catelyn sensed letter like little late maester vyman believe lord hoster would linger long enough raven reach eyrie return though said much before… tully men surrender easily matter odds entrusted parchment maester’s care catelyn went sept lit candle father father’s sake second crone let first raven world peered door death third mother lysa children lost

 later day sat lord hoster’s bedside book reading passage heard sound loud voices trumpet’s blare ser robin thought flinching went balcony nothing seen rivers could hear voices clearly outside sound many horses clink armor cheer catelyn made way winding stairs roof keep ser desmond forbid roof told climbed

 sounds coming far side castle main gate knot men stood portcullis rose jerks starts fields beyond outside castle several hundred riders wind blew lifted banners trembled relief sight leaping trout riverrun edmure

 two hours saw fit come castle rang sound noisy reunions men embraced women children left behind three ravens risen rookery black wings beating air took flight catelyn watched father’s balcony washed hair changed clothing prepared brother’s reproaches… even waiting hard

 last heard sounds outside door sat folded hands lap dried red mud spattered edmure’s boots greaves surcoat look would never know battle thin drawn pale cheeks unkempt beard toobright eyes

 “edmure” catelyn said worried “you look unwell something happened lannisters crossed river”

 “i threw back lord tywin gregor clegane addam marbrand turned away stannis though…” grimaced

 “stannis stannis”

 “he lost battle king’s landing” edmure said unhappily “his fleet burned army routed”

 lannister victory ill tidings catelyn could share brother’s obvious dismay still nightmares shadow seen slide across renly’s tent way blood come flowing steel gorget “stannis friend lord tywin”

 “you understand highgarden declared joffrey dorne well south” mouth tightened “and see fit loose kingslayer right”

 “i mother’s right” voice calm though news highgarden savage blow robb’s hopes could think though

 “no right” edmure repeated “he robb’s captive king’s captive robb charged keep safe”

 “brienne keep safe swore sword”

 “that woman”

 “she deliver jaime king’s landing bring arya sansa back us safely”

 “cersei never give up”

 “not cersei tyrion swore open court kingslayer swore well”

 “jaime’s word worthless imp it’s said took axe head battle he’ll dead brienne reaches king’s landing ever does”

 “dead” could gods truly merciless made jaime swear hundred oaths brother’s promise pinned hopes

 edmure blind distress “jaime charge mean back i’ve sent ravens—”

 “ravens many”

 “three” said “so message certain reach lord bolton river road way riverrun king’s landing must needs take close harrenhal”

 “harrenhal” word seemed darken room horror thickened voice said “edmure know done”

 “have fear left part wrote jaime escaped offered thousand dragons recapture”

 worse worse catelyn thought despair brother fool unbidden unwanted tears filled eyes “if escape” said softly “and exchange hostages lannisters give daughters brienne”

 “it never come kingslayer returned us made certain it”

 “all made certain shall never see daughters brienne might gotten king’s landing safely… long one hunting now…” catelyn could go “leave edmure” right command castle would soon yet tone would brook argument “leave father grief say go go” wanted lie close eyes sleep pray dreams would come





 arya


 sky black walls harrenhal behind rain fell soft steady muffling sound horses’ hooves running faces

 rode north away lake following rutted farm road across torn fields woods streams arya took lead kicking stolen horse brisk heedless trot trees closed around hot pie gendry followed best could wolves howled distance could hear hot pie’s heavy breathing one spoke time time arya glanced shoulder make sure two boys fallen far behind see pursued

 lord dreadfort would come roose bolton would stay abed pasty flesh dotted leeches giving commands whispery soft voice man walton might lead hunt one called steelshanks greaves always wore long legs perhaps would slobbery vargo hoat sellswords named brave companions others called bloody mummers though never faces sometimes footmen lord vargo’s habit cutting hands feet men displeased

 catch us he’ll cut hands feet arya thought roose bolton peel skin us still dressed page’s garb breast heart sewn lord bolton’s sigil flayed man dreadfort

 every time looked back half expected see blaze torches pouring distant gates harrenhal rushing along tops huge high walls nothing harrenhal slept lost darkness hidden behind trees

 crossed first stream arya turned horse aside led road following twisting course water quartermile finally scrambling stony bank hunters brought dogs might throw scent hoped could stay road death road told death roads

 gendry hot pie question choice map hot pie seemed almost terrified men might coming seen guard she’d killed it’s better he’s scared told way he’ll like say instead something stupid

 frightened knew ten skinny girl stolen horse dark forest ahead men behind would gladly cut feet yet somehow felt calmer ever harrenhal rain washed guard’s blood fingers wore sword across back wolves prowling dark like lean grey shadows arya stark unafraid fear cuts deeper swords whispered breath words syrio forel taught jaqen’s words valar morghulis

 rain stopped started stopped started good cloaks keep water arya kept moving slow steady pace black beneath trees ride faster boys horsemen neither one soft broken ground treacherous halfburied roots hidden stones crossed another road deep ruts filled runoff arya shunned rolling hills took brambles briars tangles underbrush along bottoms narrow gullies branches heavy wet leaves slapped faces passed

 gendry’s mare lost footing mud going hard hindquarters spilling saddle neither horse rider hurt gendry got stubborn look face mounted right long came upon three wolves devouring corpse fawn hot pie’s horse caught scent shied bolted two wolves fled well third raised head bared teeth prepared defend kill “back off” arya told gendry “slow don’t spook him” edged mounts away wolf feast longer sight swing ride hot pie clinging desperately saddle crashed trees

 day without dawn slowly sky lightened around never saw sun black turned grey colors crept timidly back world soldier pines dressed somber greens broadleafs russets faded golds already beginning brown stopped long enough water horses eat cold quick breakfast ripping apart loaf bread hot pie stolen kitchens passing chunks hard yellow cheese hand hand

 “do know we’re going” gendry asked

 “north” said arya

 hot pie peered around uncertainly “which way north”

 used cheese point “that way”

 “but there’s sun know”

 “from moss see grows mostly one side trees that’s south”

 “what want north” gendry wanted know

 “the trident” arya unrolled stolen map show “see reach trident need follow upstream till come riverrun here” finger traced path “it’s long way can’t get lost long keep river”

 hot pie blinked map “which one riverrun”

 riverrun painted castle tower fork flowing blue lines two rivers tumblestone red fork “there” touched “riverrun reads”

 “you read writing” said wonderingly she’d said could walk water

 nodded “we’ll safe reach riverrun”

 “we why”

 riverrun grandfather’s castle brother robb wanted say bit lip rolled map “we get there” first one back saddle made feel bad hide truth hot pie trust secret gendry knew different gendry secret though even didn’t seem know

 day arya quickened pace keeping horses trot long dared sometimes spurring gallop spied flat stretch fleld seldom enough though ground growing hillier went hills high especially steep seemed end soon grew tired climbing one found following lay land along streambeds maze shallow wooded valleys trees made solid canopy overhead

 time time sent hot pie gendry doubled back try confuse trail listening first sign pursuit slow thought chewing lip we’re going slow they’ll catch us certain crest ridge spied dark shapes crossing stream valley behind half heartbeat feared roose bolton’s riders looked realized pack wolves cupped hands around mouth howled “ahooooooooo ahooooooooo” largest wolves lifted head howled back sound made arya shiver

 midday hot pie begun complain arse sore told saddle rubbing raw inside legs besides get sleep “i’m tired i’m going fall horse”

 arya looked gendry “if falls think find first wolves mummers”

 “the wolves” said gendry “better noses”

 hot pie opened mouth closed fall horse rain began short time later still seen much glimpse sun growing colder pale white mists threading pines blowing across bare burned flelds

 gendry almost bad time hot pie though stubborn complain sat awkwardly saddle determined look face beneath shaggy black hair arya could tell horseman remembered thought riding long could remember ponies little later horses gendry hot pie cityborn city smallfolk walked yoren given mounts took king’s landing sitting donkey plodding kingsroad behind wagon one thing guiding hunting horse wild woods burned fields something else

 would make much better time arya knew could leave pack friends living friends remained would still safe harrenhal gendry sweating forge hot pie kitchens mummers catch us i’ll tell i’m ned stark’s daughter sister king north i’ll command take brother harm hot pie gendry might believe though even did… lord bolton brother’s bannerman frightened won’t let take us vowed silently reaching back shoulder touch hilt sword gendry stolen won’t

 late afternoon emerged beneath trees found banks river hot pie gave whoop delight “the trident go upstream like said we’re almost there”

 arya chewed lip “i don’t think trident” river swollen rain even couldn’t much thirty feet across remembered trident much wider “it’s little trident” told “and didn’t come far enough”

 “let’s look map again” said gendry

 arya dismounted took map unrolled rain pattered sheepskin ran rivulets “we’re someplace think” said pointing boys peered shoulders

 “but” said hot pie “that’s hardly ways see harrenhal’s finger you’re almost touching rode day”

 “there’s miles miles reach trident” said “we won’t days must different river one see” showed thinner blue lines mapmaker painted name painted flne script beneath “the darry greenapple maiden… one little willow might that”

 hot pie looked line river “it doesn’t look little me”

 gendry frowning well “the one you’re pointing runs one see”

 “the big willow” read

 “the big willow see big willow runs trident could follow one we’d need go downstream river isn’t little willow it’s one here…”

 “rippledown rill” arya read

 “see loops around flows toward lake back harrenhal” traced line finger

 hot pie’s eyes grew wide “no they’ll kill us sure”

 “we know river is” declared gendry stubbornest voice “we know”

 “well don’t” map might names written beside blue lines one written name riverbank “we won’t go downstream” decided rolling map “we’ll cross keep going north like were”

 “can horses swim” asked hot pie “it looks deep arry snakes”

 “are sure we’re going north” asked gendry “all hills… got turned around…”

 “the moss trees—”

 pointed nearby tree “that tree’s got moss three sides next one moss could lost riding around circle”

 “we could be” said arya “but i’m going cross river anyway come stay here” climbed back saddle ignoring didn’t want follow could find riverrun though likely mummers would find

 “no” arya gendry said exact instant hot pie quailed little arya gave gendry sideways look said like jon used back winterfell missed jon snow brothers

 tyrion


 woke creak old iron hinges

 “who” croaked least voice back raw hoarse though fever still tyrion notion hour long slept time weak damnably weak “who” called loudly torchlight spilled open door within chamber light came stub candle beside bed

 saw shape moving toward tyrion shivered maegor’s holdfast every servant queen’s pay visitor might another cersei’s catspaws sent finish work ser mandon begun

 man stepped candlelight got good look dwarf’s pale face chortled “cut shaving you”

 tyrion’s fingers went great gash ran one eye jaw across remained nose proud flesh still raw warm touch “with fearful big razor yes”

 bronn’s coalblack hair freshly washed brushed straight back hard lines face dressed high boots soft tooled leather wide belt studded nuggets silver cloak pale green silk across dark grey wool doublet burning chain embroidered diagonally bright green thread

 “where been” tyrion demanded “i sent you… must fortnight ago”

 “four days ago like” sellsword said “and i’ve twice found dead world”

 “not dead though sweet sister try” perhaps said aloud tyrion past caring cersei behind ser mandon’s attempt kill knew gut “what’s ugly thing chest”

 bronn grinned “my knightly sigil flaming chain green smokegrey field lord father’s command i’m ser bronn blackwater imp see don’t forget it”

 tyrion put hands featherbed squirmed back inches pillows “i one promised knighthood remember” liked “by lord father’s command” lord tywin wasted little time moving son tower hand claim message anyone could read another “i lose half nose gain knighthood gods deal answer for” voice sour “did father dub himself”

 “no us survived fight winch towers got dabbed high septon dubbed kingsguard took half bloody day three white swords left honors”

 “i knew ser mandon died battle” shoved river pod half heartbeat treacherous bastard could drive sword heart “who else lost”

 “the hound” said bronn “not dead gone gold cloaks say turned craven led sortie place”

 one better notions tyrion could feel scar tissue pull tight frowned waved bronn toward chair “my sister mistaken mushroom keeps dark feeds shit pod’s good lad knot tongue size casterly rock don’t trust half tells sent bring ser jacelyn came back told he’s dead”

 “him thousands more” bronn sat

 “how” tyrion demanded feeling much sicker

 “during battle sister sent kettleblacks fetch king back red keep way hear gold cloaks saw leavin’ half decided they’d leave ironhand put path tried order back walls say bywater blistering good almost ’em ready turn someone put arrow neck didn’t seem fearsome dragged horse killed him”

 another debt lay cersei’s door “my nephew” said “joffrey danger”

 “no more’n less most”

 “had suffered harm taken wound mussed hair stubbed toe cracked nail”

 “not heard”

 “i warned cersei would happen commands gold cloaks now”

 “your lord father’s given one westermen knight named addam marbrand”

 cases gold cloaks would resented outsider placed ser addam marbrand shrewd choice like jaime sort man men liked follow lost city watch “i sent pod looking shagga he’s luck”

 “the stone crows still kingswood shagga seems taken fancy place timett led burned men home plunder took stannis’s camp fighting chella turned dozen black ears river gate one morning father’s red cloaks chased kingslanders threw dung cheered”

 ingrates black ears died whilst tyrion lay drugged dreaming blood pulled claws one one “i want go sister precious son made battle unscathed cersei need hostage swore free alayaya once—”

 “she eight nine days ago whipping”

 tyrion shoved higher ignoring sudden stab pain shoulder “whipping”

 “they tied post yard scourged shoved gate naked bloody”

 learning read tyrion thought absurdly across face scar stretched tight moment felt though head would burst rage alayaya whore true enough sweeter braver innocent girl seldom met tyrion never touched veil hide shae carelessness never thought role might cost “i promised sister would treat tommen treated alayaya” remembered aloud felt though might retch “how scourge eightyearold boy” don’t cersei wins

 “you don’t tommen” bronn said bluntly “once learned ironhand dead queen sent kettleblacks one rosby balls say nay”

 another blow yet relief well must admit fond tommen “the kettleblacks supposed ours” reminded bronn touch irritation

 “they long could give two pennies every one queen she’s raised stakes osney osfryd made knights battle gods know one saw fighting”

 hirelings betray friends scourged shamed lie rotting tyrion thought thought bloody battle triumph tastes like “is true stannis put rout renly’s ghost”

 bronn smiled thinly “from winch towers saw banners mud men throwing spears run there’s hundreds pot shops brothels who’ll tell saw lord renly kill one one stannis’s host renly’s start went right back sight shiny green armor”

 planning sortie bridge ships getting face slashed two tyrion eclipsed dead man indeed renly dead something else would need look “how stannis escape”

 “his lyseni kept galleys bay beyond chain battle turned bad put along bay shore took many could men killing get aboard toward end”

 “what robb stark doing”

 “there’s wolves burning way toward duskendale father’s sending lord tarly sort i’d half mind join it’s said he’s good soldier openhanded plunder”

 thought losing bronn final straw “no place you’re captain hand’s guard”

 “you’re hand” bronn reminded sharply “your father he’s got bloody guard”

 “what happened men hired me”

 “some died winch towers uncle ser kevan paid rest us tossed us out”

 “how good him” tyrion said acidly “does mean you’ve lost taste gold”

 “not bloody likely”

 “good” said tyrion “because happens still need know ser mandon moore”

 bronn laughed “i know he’s bloody well drowned”

 “i owe great debt pay it” touched face feeling scar “i know precious little man truth told”

 “he eyes like fish wore white cloak else need know”

 “everything” said tyrion “for start” wanted proof ser mandon cersei’s dare say aloud red keep man best hold tongue rats walls little birds talked much spiders “help up” said struggling bedclothes “it’s time paid call father past time let seen again”

 “such pretty sight” mocked bronn

 “what’s half nose face like mine speaking pretty margaery tyrell king’s landing yet”

 “no she’s coming though city’s mad love tyrells carting food highgarden giving away name hundreds wayns day there’s thousands tyrell men swaggering little golden roses sewn doublets one buying wine wife widow whore women giving virtue every peachfuzz boy gold rose teat”

 spit buy drinks tyrells tyrion slid bed floor legs turned wobbly beneath room spun grasp bronn’s arm keep pitching headlong rushes “pod” shouted “podrick payne seven hells you” pain gnawed like toothless dog tyrion hated weakness especially shamed shame made angry “pod get here”

 boy came running saw tyrion standing clutching bronn’s arm gaped “my lord stood that… you… need wine dreamwine get maester said must stay abed mean”

 “i stayed abed long bring clean garb”

 “garb”

 boy could clearheaded resourceful battle confused times tyrion could never comprehend “clothing” repeated “tunic doublet breeches hose dress leave bloody cell”

 took three clothe hideous though face might worst wounds one juncture shoulder arm mail driven back armpit arrow pus blood still seeped discolored flesh whenever maester frenken changed dressing movement sent stab agony

 end tyrion settled pair breeches oversized bed robe hung loosely shoulders bronn yanked boots onto feet pod went search stick lean drank cup dreamwine fortify wine sweetened honey enough poppy make wounds bearable time

 even dizzy time turned latch descent twisting stone steps made legs tremble walked stick one hand pod’s shoulder serving girl coming going stared wide white eyes looking ghost dwarf risen dead tyrion thought look he’s uglier ever run tell friends

 maegor’s holdfast strongest place red keep castle within castle surrounded deep dry moat lined spikes drawbridge night reached door ser meryn trant stood pale armor white cloak “lower bridge” tyrion commanded

 “the queen’s orders raise bridge night” ser meryn always cersei’s creature

 “the queen’s asleep business father”

 magic name lord tywin lannister grumbling ser meryn trant gave command drawbridge lowered second kingsguard knight stood sentry across moat ser osmund kettleblack managed smile saw tyrion waddling toward “feeling stronger m’lord”

 “much when’s next battle scarcely wait”

 pod reached serpentine steps however tyrion could gape dismay never climb confessed swallowing dignity asked bronn carry hoping hope hour would one see smile one tell tale dwarf carried steps like babe arms

 outer ward crowded tents pavilions dozens “tyrell men” podrick payne explained threaded way maze silk canvas “lord rowan’s lord redwyne’s wasn’t room enough castle mean took rooms rooms city inns they’re wedding king’s wedding king joffrey’s strong enough attend lord”

 “ravening weasels could keep away” said weddings battles least less likely someone would cut nose

 lights still burned dimly behind shuttered windows tower hand men door wore crimson cloaks lioncrested helms father’s household guard tyrion knew admitted sight… though neither could bear look long face noted

 within came upon ser addam marbrand descending turnpike stair ornate black breastplate clothofgold cloak officer city watch “my lord” said “how good see feet i’d heard—”

 “—rumors small grave dug circumstances seemed best get hear you’re commander city watch shall offer congratulations condolences”

 “both fear” ser addam smiled “death desertion left fortyfour hundred gods littlefinger know go paying wages many sister forbids dismiss any”

 still anxious cersei battle’s done gold cloaks won’t help “do come father” asked

 “aye fear leave best moods lord tywin feels fortyfour hundred guardsmen sufficient find one lost squire cousin tyrek remains missing”

 tyrek son late uncle tygett boy thirteen vanished riot long wedding lady ermesande suckling babe happened last surviving heir house hayford likely first bride history seven kingdoms widowed weaned “i couldn’t find either” confessed tyrion

 “he’s feeding worms” said bronn usual tact “ironhand looked eunuch rattled nice fat purse luck give ser”

 ser addam gazed sellsword distaste “lord tywin stubborn blood concerned lad alive dead mean oblige him” looked back tyrion “you find father solar”

 solar thought tyrion “i believe know way”

 way steps time climbed power one hand pod’s shoulder bronn opened door lord tywin lannister seated beneath window writing glow oil lamp raised eyes sound latch “tyrion” calmly laid quill aside

 “i’m pleased remember lord” tyrion released grip pod leaned weight stick waddled closer something wrong knew

 “ser bronn” lord tywin said “podrick perhaps best wait without done”

 look bronn gave hand little less insolent nonetheless bowed withdrew pod heels heavy door swung shut behind tyrion lannister alone father even windows solar shuttered night chill room palpable sort lies cersei telling

 lord casterly rock lean man twenty years younger even handsome austere way stiff blond whiskers covered cheeks framing stern face bald head hard mouth throat wore chain golden hands fingers clasping wrist next “that’s handsome chain” tyrion said though looked better

 lord tywin ignored sally “you best seated wise sickbed”

 “i sick sickbed” tyrion knew much father despised weakness claimed nearest chair “such pleasant chambers would believe dying someone moved dark little cell maegor’s”

 “the red keep overcrowded wedding guests depart find suitable accommodations”

 “i rather liked accommodations set date great wedding”

 “joffrey margaery shall marry first day new year happens also first day new century ceremony herald dawn new era”

 new lannister era thought tyrion “oh bother fear i’ve made plans day”

 “did come complain bedchamber make lame japes important letters finish”

 “important letters sure”

 “some battles swords spears others quills ravens spare coy reproaches tyrion visited sickbed often maester ballabar would allow seemed like die” steepled fingers chin “why dismiss ballabar”

 tyrion shrugged “maester frenken determined keep insensate”

 “ballabar came city lord redwyne’s retinue gifted healer it’s said kind cersei ask look feared life”

 feared might keep mean “doubtless that’s she’s never left bedside”

 “don’t impertinent cersei royal wedding plan waging war danger least fortnight” lord tywin studied son’s disfigured face pale green eyes unflinching “though wound ghastly enough i’ll grant madness possessed you”

 “the foe gates battering ram jaime led sortie you’d call valor”

 “jaime would never foolish remove helm battle trust killed man cut you”

 “oh wretch dead enough” though podrick payne who’d killed ser mandon shoving river drown beneath weight armor “a dead enemy joy forever” tyrion said blithely though ser mandon true enemy man reason want dead catspaw believe know cat told make certain survive battle without proof lord tywin would never listen charge “why city father” asked “shouldn’t fighting lord stannis robb stark someone” sooner better

 “until lord redwyne brings fleet lack ships assail dragonstone makes matter stannis baratheon’s sun set blackwater stark boy still west large force northmen helman tallhart robett glover descending toward duskendale i’ve sent lord tarly meet ser gregor drives kingsroad cut retreat tallhart glover caught third stark’s strength”

 “duskendale” nothing duskendale worth risk young wolf finally blundered

 “it’s nothing need trouble face pale death there’s blood seeping dressings say want take back bed”

 “what want…” throat felt raw tight want ever give father “pod tells littlefinger’s made lord harrenhal”

 “an empty title long roose bolton holds castle robb stark yet lord baelish desirous honor us good service matter tyrell marriage lannister pays debts”

 tyrell marriage tyrion’s notion point fact would seem churlish try claim “that title may empty think” warned “littlefinger nothing without good reason may said something paying debts believe”

 “and want reward well would lands castle office”

 “a little bloody gratitude would make nice start”

 lord tywin stared unblinking “mummers monkeys require applause aerys matter commanded sure best ability one denies part played”

 “the part played” nostrils tyrion left must surely flared “i saved bloody city seems me”

 “most people seem feel attack lord stannis’s flank turned tide battle lords tyrell rowan redwyne tarly fought nobly well i’m told sister cersei set pyromancers making wildfire destroyed baratheon fleet”

 “while get nosehairs trimmed it” tyrion could keep bitterness voice

 “your chain clever stroke crucial victory wanted hear told thank dornish alliance well may pleased learn myrcella arrived safely sunspear ser arys oakheart writes taken great liking princess arianne prince trystane enchanted mislike giving house martell hostage suppose could helped”

 “we’ll hostage” tyrion said “a council seat also part bargain unless prince doran brings army comes claim he’ll putting power”

 “would council seat martell came claim” lord tywin said “you promised vengeance well”

 “i promised justice”

 “call still comes blood”

 “not item short supply surely splashed lakes battle” tyrion saw reason cut heart matter “or grown fond gregor clegane cannot bear part him”

 “ser gregor uses brother every lord need beast time time… lesson seem learned judging ser bronn clansmen yours”

 tyrion thought timett’s burned eye shagga axe chella necklace dried ears bronn bronn “the woods full beasts” reminded father “the alleyways well”

 “true perhaps dogs would hunt well shall think nothing else…”

 “you important letters yes” tyrion rose unsteady legs closed eyes instant wave dizziness washed took shaky step toward door later would reflect taken second third instead turned “what want ask i’ll tell want want mine rights want casterly rock”

 father’s mouth grew hard “your brother’s birthright”

 “the knights kingsguard forbidden marry father children hold land know well day jaime put white cloak gave claim casterly rock never acknowledged it’s past time want stand realm proclaim son lawful heir”

 lord tywin’s eyes pale green flecked gold luminous merciless “casterly rock” declared flat cold dead tone “never”

 word hung huge sharp poisoned

 knew answer asked tyrion thought eighteen years since jaime joined kingsguard never raised issue must known must always known “why” made ask though knew would rue question

 “you ask killed mother come world illmade devious disobedient spiteful little creature full envy lust low cunning men’s laws give right bear name display colors since cannot prove mine teach humility gods condemned watch waddle wearing proud lion father’s sigil father’s neither gods men shall ever compel let turn casterly rock whorehouse”

 “my whorehouse” dawn broke tyrion understood bile come ground teeth together said “cersei told alayaya”

 “is name confess cannot remember names whores one married boy”

 “tysha” spat answer defiant

 “and camp follower green fork”

 “why care” asked unwilling even speak shae’s name presence

 “i don’t care live die”

 “it yaya whipped” question

 “your sister told threats grandsons” lord tywin’s voice colder ice “did lie”

 tyrion would deny “i made threats yes keep alayaya safe kettleblacks would misuse her”

 “to save whore’s virtue threatened house kin way it”

 “you one taught good threat often telling blow joffrey hasn’t tempted sore hundred times you’re anxious whip people start tommen… would harm tommen he’s good lad mine blood”

 “as mother” lord tywin rose abruptly tower dwarf son “go back bed tyrion speak rights casterly rock shall reward shall one deem appropriate service station make mistake—this last time suffer bring shame onto house lannister done whores next one find bed i’ll hang”

 queen thorns snorted “so florents rowans oakhearts half noble houses south garth liked plant seed fertile ground say shouldn’t wonder hands green”

 “sansa” lady alerie broke “you must hungry shall bite boar together lemon cakes”

 sansa’s fingers tightened round spoon truth can’t don’t ask please can’t “i… i… i…”

 “you yes would know better lad seems kingly enough i’ll grant bit full would lannister blood heard troubling tales however truth boy mistreated you”

 sansa glanced nervously butterbumps popped whole orange mouth chewed swallowed slapped cheek blew seeds nose women giggled laughed servants coming going maidenvault echoed clatter spoons plates one chicks hopped back onto table ran lady graceford’s broth one seemed paying mind even frightened

 lady olenna growing impatient “why gaping butterbumps asked question expect answer lannisters stolen tongue child”

 “calm child” queen thorns commanded

 old woman called butterbumps “fool give us song long one think ‘the bear maiden fair’ nicely”

 “it will” huge jester replied “it nicely indeed shall sing standing head lady”

 “will make sound better”

 “stand feet wouldn’t want hat fall recall never wash hair”

 “as lady commands” butterbumps bowed low let loose enormous belch straightened threw belly bellowed “a bear bear bear black brown covered hair…”

 lady olenna squirmed forward “even girl younger well known red keep walls ears well better song meanwhile girls shall speak freely”

 “but” sansa said “varys… knows always…”

 “sing louder” queen thorns shouted butterbumps “these old ears almost deaf know whispering fat fool don’t pay whispers sing”

 “…the bear” thundered butterbumps great deep voice echoing rafters “oh come said oh come fair fair said i’m bear black brown covered hair”

 wrinkled old lady smiled “at highgarden many spiders amongst flowers long keep let spin little webs get underfoot step them” patted sansa back hand “now child truth sort man joffrey calls baratheon looks lannister “

 “and road three boys goat dancing bear”

 sansa felt though heart lodged throat queen thorns close could smell old woman’s sour breath gaunt thin fingers pinching wrist side margaery listening well shiver went “a monster” whispered tremulously could scarcely hear voice “joffrey monster lied butcher’s boy made father kill wolf displease kingsguard beat he’s evil cruel lady it’s queen well”

 lady olenna tyrell granddaughter exchanged look “ah” said old woman “that’s pity”

 oh gods thought sansa horrified margaery won’t marry joff know i’m blame “please” blurted “don’t stop wedding…”

 “have fear lord puff fish determined margaery shall queen word tyrell worth gold casterly rock least day even thank truth child”

 “…danced spun way fair fair fair” butterbumps hopped roared stomped feet

 “sansa would like visit highgarden” margaery tyrell smiled looked like brother loras “all autumn flowers bloom groves fountains shady courtyards marble colonnades lord father always keeps singers court sweeter ones butters pipers fiddlers harpers well best horses pleasure boats sail along mander hawk sansa”

 “a little” admitted

 “oh sweet pure fair maid honey hair”

 “you love highgarden know it” margaery brushed back loose strand sansa’s hair “once see you’ll never want leave perhaps won’t to”

 “her hair hair maid honey hair”

 “shush child” queen thorns said sharply “sansa hasn’t even told us would like come visit”

 “oh would” sansa said highgarden sounded like place always dreamed like beautiful magical court hoped find king’s landing

 “…smelled scent summer air bear bear black brown covered hair”

 “but queen” sansa went “she won’t let go…”

 “she without highgarden lannisters hope keeping joffrey throne son lord oaf asks choice grant request”

 “will he” asked sansa “will ask”

 lady olenna frowned “i see need give choice course hint true purpose”

 “he smelled scent summer air”

 sansa wrinkled brow “our true purpose lady”

 “he sniffed roared smelled honey summer air”

 “to see safely wed child” old woman said butterbumps bellowed old old song “to grandson”

 “brothers oh brothers days done

 last strains “the dornishman’s wife” faded bald earless man glanced map scowled ferociously rattleshirt ygritte jon “what’s this” said “a crow”

 “the black bastard gutted orell” said rattleshirt “and bloody warg well”

 “you kill all”

 “this one come over” explained ygritte “he slew qhorin halfhand hand”

 “this boy” earless man angered news “the halfhand mine name crow”

 “jon snow grace” wondered whether expected bend knee well

 “your grace” earless man looked big whitebearded one “you see takes king”

 bearded man laughed hard sprayed bits chicken everywhere rubbed grease mouth back huge hand “a blind boy must ever heard king without ears crown would fall straight neck har” grinned jon wiping fingers clean breeches “close beak crow spin around might you’d find you’re looking for”

 jon turned

 singer rose feet “i’m mance rayder” said put aside lute “and ned stark’s bastard snow winterfell “

 stunned jon stood speechless moment recovered enough say “how… could know…”

 “that’s tale later” said mance rayder “how like song lad”

 “well enough i’d heard before”

 “but matter men must die” kingbeyondthewall said lightly “and i’ve tasted dornishman’s wife tell lord bones speak truly slay old friend halffiand”

 “i did” though mine

 “the shadow tower never seem fearsome” king said sadness voice “qhorin enemy also brother so… shall thank killing jon snow curse you” gave jon mocking smile

 kingbeyondthewall looked nothing like king even much wildling middling height slender sharpfaced shrewd brown eyes long brown hair gone mostly grey crown head gold rings arms jewels throat even gleam silver wore wool leather garment note ragged black wool cloak long tears patched faded red silk

 “you ought thank killing enemy” jon said finally “and curse killing friend”

 “har” boomed whitebearded man “well answered”

 “agreed” mance rayder beckoned jon closer “if would join us you’d best know us man took styr magnar thenn magnar means ‘lord’ old tongue” earless man stared jon coldly mance turned whitebearded one “our ferocious chickeneater loyal tormund woman—”

 tormund rose feet “hold gave styr style give mine”

 mance rayder laughed “as wish jon snow stands tormund giantsbane talltalker hornblower breaker ice also tormund thunderfist husband bears meadking ruddy hall speaker gods father hosts”

 “that sounds like me” said tormund “well met jon snow fond o’ wargs happens though o’ starks”

 “the good woman brazier” mance rayder went “is dalla” pregnant woman smiled shyly “treat like would queen carrying child” turned last two “this beauty sister val young jarl beside latest pet”

 “i man’s pet” said jarl dark fierce

 “and val’s man” whitebearded tormund snorted “you ought noticed lad”

 “so us jon snow” said mance rayder “the kingbeyondthewall court words think come from”

 “winterfell” said “by way castle black”

 “and brings milkwater far fires home” wait jon’s answer looked rattleshirt “how many they”

 “five three’s dead boy’s t’other went mountainside horse could follow”

 rayder’s eyes met jon’s “was five brothers skulking about”

 “we four halfhand qhorin worth twenty common men”

 kingbeyondthewall smiled “some thought still… boy castle black rangers shadow tower come be”

 jon lie ready “the lord commander sent halfhand seasoning took ranging”

 styr magnar frowned “ranging call it… would crows come ranging skirling pass”

 “the villages deserted” jon said truthfully “it free folk vanished”

 “vanished aye” said mance rayder “and free folk told jon snow”

 tormund snorted “it craster i’m blushing maid told mance creature needs shorter head”

 king gave older man irritated look “tormund day try thinking speak know craster asked jon see would tell true”

 “har” tormund spat “well stepped that” grinned jon “see lad that’s he’s king i’m outdrink outfight outsing member’s thrice size o’ mance cunning raised crow know crow’s tricksy bird”

 “i would speak lad alone lord bones” mance rayder said rattleshirt “leave us you”

 “what well” said tormund

 “no especially” said mance

 “i eat hall i’m welcome” tormund got feet “me hens leaving” snatched another chicken brazier shoved pocket sewn lining cloak said “har” left licking fingers others followed woman dalla

 “sit like” rayder said gone “are hungry tormund left us two birds least”

 “i would pleased eat grace thank you”

 “your grace” king smiled “that’s style one often hears lips free folk i’m mance mance take horn mead”

 “gladly” said jon

 king poured dalla cut wellcrisped hens apart brought half jon peeled gloves ate fingers sucking every morsel meat bones

 “tormund spoke truly” said mance rayder ripped apart loaf bread “the black crow tricksy bird that’s so… crow bigger babe dalla’s belly jon snow take care play tricksy me”

 “as say your—mance”

 king laughed “your mance promised tale knew puzzled yet”

 jon shook head “did rattleshirt send word ahead”

 “by wing trained ravens knew face i’ve seen twice”

 made sense first jon turned mind dawn broke “when brother watch…”

 “very good yes first time boy black one dozen riding escort old lord commander qorgyle came see father winterfell walking wall around yard came brother robb snowed night two built great mountain gate waiting someone likely pass underneath”

 “i remember” said jon startled laugh young black brother wallwalk yes… “you swore tell”

 “and kept vow one least”

 “we dumped snow fat tom father’s slowest guardsman” tom chased around yard afterward three red autumn apples “but said saw twice time”

 “when king robert came winterfell make father hand” kingbeyondthewall said lightly

 jon’s eyes widened disbelief “that can’t so”

 “it father learned king coming sent word brother benjen wall might come feast commerce black brothers free folk know soon enough word came ears well choice chance resist uncle know sight fear quarter think father like remember young crow he’d met briefly years wanted see robert eyes king king get measure uncle benjen well first ranger bane people saddled fleetest horse rode”

 “but” jon objected “the wall…”

 “the wall stop army man alone took lute bag silver scaled ice near long barrow walked leagues south new gift bought horse made much better time robert traveling ponderous great wheelhouse keep queen comfort day south winterfell came fell company freeriders hedge knights always attaching royal processions hopes finding service king lute gained easy acceptance” laughed “i know every bawdy song that’s ever made north south wall night father feasted robert sat back hall bench freeriders listening orland oldtown play high harp sing dead kings beneath sea betook lord father’s meat mead look kingslayer imp… made passing note lord eddard’s children wolf pups ran heels”

 “bael bard” said jon remembering tale ygritte told frostfangs night he’d almost killed

 “would deny bael’s exploit inspired mine own… steal either sisters recall bael wrote songs lived sing songs better men made mead”

 “no” said jon “if discovered… taken…”

 “your father would head off” king gave shrug “though eaten board protected guest right laws hospitality old first men sacred heart tree” gestured board broken bread chicken bones “here guest safe harm hands… night least tell truly jon snow craven turned cloak fear another reason brings tent”

 guest right jon snow knew walked rotten ice one false step might plunge water cold enough stop heart weigh every word speak told took long draught mead buy time answer set horn aside said “tell turned cloak i’ll tell turned mine”

 mance rayder smiled jon hoped would king plainly man liked sound voice “you heard stories desertion doubt”

 “some say crown say woman others wildling blood”

 “the wildling blood blood first men blood flows veins starks crown see one”

 “i see woman” glanced dalla

 mance took hand pulled close “my lady blameless met return father’s castle halfhand carved old oak made flesh great fondness charms women… makes different threequarters watch men still wearing black ten times many women poor king must guess jon snow”

 jon considered moment “the halfhand said passion wildling music”

 “i that’s closer mark yes hit” mance rayder rose unfastened clasp held cloak swept bench “it this”

 “a cloak”

 “the black wool cloak sworn brother night’s watch” said kingbeyondthewall “one day ranging brought fine big elk skinning smell blood drew shadowcat lair drove shredded cloak ribbons see here” chuckled “it shredded arm back well bled worse elk brothers feared might die got back maester mullin shadow tower carried wildling village knew old wisewoman healing dead happened daughter saw cleaned wounds sewed fed porridge potions strong enough ride sewed rents cloak well scarlet silk asshai grandmother pulled wreck cog washed frozen shore greatest treasure gift me” swept cloak back shoulders “but shadow tower given new wool cloak stores black black trimmed black go black breeches black boots black doublet black mail new cloak frays rips tears… red men night’s watch dressed black ser denys mallister reminded sternly forgotten old cloak fit burning said

 “i left next morning… place kiss crime man could wear cloak chose” closed clasp sat back “and jon snow”

 jon took another swallow mead one tale might believe “you say winterfell night father feasted king robert”

 “i say was”

 “then saw us prince joffrey prince tommen princess myrcella brothers robb bran rickon sisters arya sansa saw walk center aisle every eye upon take seats table dais king queen seated”

 “i remember”

 “and see seated mance” leaned forward “did see put bastard”

 mance rayder looked jon’s face long moment “i think best find new cloak” king said holding hand

 “i cannot see drogon” said ser jorah mormont joined forecastle “is lost again”

 “we ones lost ser drogon taste wet creeping do” bolder two black dragon first try wings water first flutter ship ship first lose passing cloud… first kill flying fish sooner broke surface water enveloped lance flame snatched swallowed “how big grow” dany asked curiously “do know”

 “in seven kingdoms tales dragons grew huge could pluck giant krakens seas”

 dany laughed “that would wondrous sight see”

 “it tale khaleesi” said exile knight “they talk wise old dragons living thousand years well”

 “well long dragon live” looked viserion swooped low ship wings beating slowly stirring limp sails

 ser jorah shrugged “a dragon’s natural span days many times long man’s songs would us believe… dragons seven kingdoms knew best house targaryen bred war war died easy thing slay dragon done”

 squire whitebeard standing figurehead one lean hand curled tall hardwood staff turned toward said “balerion black dread two hundred years old died reign jaehaerys conciliator large could swallow aurochs whole dragon never stops growing grace long food freedom” name arstan strong belwas named whitebeard pale whiskers everyone called taller ser jorah though muscular eyes pale blue long beard white snow flne silk

 “freedom” asked dany curious “what mean”

 “in king’s landing ancestors raised immense domed castle dragons dragonpit called still stands atop hill rhaenys though ruins royal dragons dwelt days yore cavernous dwelling iron doors wide thirty knights could ride abreast yet even noted none pit dragons ever reached size ancestors maesters say walls around great dome heads”

 “if walls could keep us small peasants would tiny kings large giants” said ser jorah “i’ve seen huge men born hovels dwarfs dwelt castles”

 “men men” whitebeard replied “dragons dragons”

 ser jorah snorted disdain “how profound” exile knight love old man he’d made plain first “what know dragons anyway”

 “little enough that’s true yet served time king’s landing days king aerys sat iron throne walked beneath dragonskulls looked walls throne room”

 “viserys talked skulls” said dany “the usurper took hid away could bear looking upon stolen throne” beckoned whitebeard closer “did ever meet royal father” king aerys ii died daughter born

 “i great honor grace”

 “did find good gentle”

 whitebeard best hide feelings plain face “his grace was… often pleasant”

 “often” dany smiled “but always”

 “he could harsh thought enemies”

 “a wise man never makes enemy king” said dany “did know brother rhaegar well”

 “it said man ever knew prince rhaegar truly privilege seeing tourney though often heard play harp silver strings”

 ser jorah snorted “along thousand others harvest feast next you’ll claim squired him”

 “i make claim ser myles mooton prince rhaegar’s squire richard lonmouth spurs knighted remained close companions young lord connington dear prince well oldest friend arthur dayne”

 “the sword morning” said dany delighted “viserys used talk wondrous white blade said ser arthur knight realm brother’s peer”

 whitebeard bowed head “it place question words prince viserys”

 “king” dany corrected “he king though never reigned viserys third name mean” answer one she’d expected “ser jorah named rhaegar last dragon peerless warrior called surely”

 “your grace” said whitebeard “the prince dragonstone puissant warrior but…”

 “go on” urged “you may speak freely me”

 “as command” old man leaned upon hardwood staff brow furrowed “a warrior without peer… fine words grace words win battles”

 “swords win battles” ser jorah said bluntly “and prince rhaegar knew use one”

 “he ser but… seen hundred tournaments wars would wish however strong fast skilled knight may others match man win one tourney fall quickly next slick spot grass may mean defeat ate supper night change wind may bring gift victory” glanced ser jorah “or lady’s favor knotted round arm”

 mormont’s face darkened “be careful say old man”

 arstan seen ser jorah fight lannisport dany knew tourney mormont lady’s favor knotted round arm lady lynesse house hightower second wife highborn beautiful… ruined abandoned memory bitter “be gentle knight” put hand jorah’s arm “arstan wish give offense i’m certain”

 “as say khaleesi” ser jorah’s voice grudging

 dany turned back squire “i know little rhaegar tales viserys told little boy brother died truly like”

 old man considered moment “able determined deliberate dutiful singleminded tale told him… doubtless ser jorah knows well”

 “i would hear you”

 “as wish” said whitebeard “as young boy prince dragonstone bookish fault reading early men said queen rhaella must swallowed books candle whilst womb rhaegar took interest play children maesters awed wits father’s knights would jest sourly baelor blessed born one day prince rhaegar found something scrolls changed one knows might boy suddenly appeared early one morning yard knights donning steel walked ser willem darry masteratarms said ‘i require sword armor seems must warrior’”

 “and was” said dany delighted

 “he indeed” whitebeard bowed “my pardons grace speak warriors see strong belwas arisen must attend him”

 dany glanced aft eunuch climbing hold amidships nimble size belwas squat broad good fifteen stone fat muscle great brown gut crisscrossed faded white scars wore baggy pants yellow silk bellyband absurdly tiny leather vest dotted iron studs “strong belwas hungry” roared everyone one particular “strong belwas eat now” turning spied arstan forecastle “whitebeard bring food strong belwas”

 “you may go” dany told squire bowed moved tend needs man served

 ser jorah watched frown blunt honest face mormont big burly strong jaw thick shoulder handsome man means true friend dany ever known “you would wise take old man’s words well salted” told whitebeard earshot

 “a queen must listen all” reminded “the highborn low strong weak noble venal one voice may speak false many always truth found” read book

 “hear voice grace” exile said “this arstan whitebeard playing false old squire well spoken serving oaf eunuch”

 pondering next words felt cool breath back neck loose strand silvergold hair stirred brow canvas creaked moved suddenly great cry went balerion “wind” sailors shouted “the wind returns wind”

 dany looked great cog’s sails rippled belled lines thrummed tightened sang sweet song missed six long days captain groleo rushed aft shouting commands pentoshi scrambling masts cheering even strong belwas let great bellow little dance “the gods good” dany said “you see jorah way more”

 “yes” said “but queen”

 day wind blew steady east first wild gusts sun set blaze red still half world westeros dany reminded every hour brings closer tried imagine would feel like first caught sight land born rule fair shore ever seen know could otherwise

 later night balerion plunged onward dark dany sat crosslegged bunk captain’s cabin feeding dragons—“even upon sea” groleo said graciously “queens take precedence captains”—a sharp knock came upon door

 irri sleeping foot bunk narrow three tonight jhiqui’s turn share soft featherbed khaleesi handmaid roused knock went door dany pulled coverlet tucked arms naked expected caller hour “come” said saw ser jorah standing without beneath swaying lantern

 exile knight ducked head entered “your grace sorry disturb sleep”

 “i sleeping ser come watch” took chunk salt pork bowl lap held dragons see three eyed hungrily rhaegal spread green wings stirred air viserion’s neck swayed back forth like long pale snake’s followed movement hand “drogon” dany said softly “dracarys” tossed pork air

 drogon moved quicker striking cobra flame roared mouth orange scarlet black searing meat began fall sharp black teeth snapped shut around rhaegal’s head darted close steal prize brother’s jaws drogon swallowed screamed smaller green dragon could hiss frustration

 “stop rhaegal” dany said annoyance giving head swat “you last one i’ll greedy dragons” smiled ser jorah “i won’t need char meat brazier longer”

 “so see dracarys”

 three dragons turned heads sound word viserion let loose blast pale gold flame made ser jorah take hasty step backward dany giggled “be careful word ser they’re like singe beard means ‘dragonfire’ high valyrian wanted choose command one like utter chance”

 mormont nodded “your grace” said “i wonder might private words”

 “of course irri leave us bit” put hand jhiqui’s bare shoulder shook handmaid awake “you well sweetling ser jorah needs talk me”

 “yes khaleesi” jhiqui tumbled bunk naked yawning thick black hair tumbled head dressed quickly left irri closing door behind

 dany gave dragons rest salt pork squabble patted bed beside “sit goodser tell troubling you”

 “three things” ser jorah sat “strong belwas arstan whitebeard illyrio mopatis sent them”

 dany pulled coverlet higher tugged one end shoulder “and that”

 “the warlocks qarth told would betrayed three times” exile knight reminded viserion rhaegal began snap claw

 “once blood gold love” dany like forget “mirri maz duur first”

 “which means two traitors yet remain… two appear find troubling yes never forget robert offered lordship man slays you”

 dany leaned forward yanked viserion’s tail pull green brother blanket fell away chest moved grabbed hastily covered “the usurper dead” said

 “but son rules place” ser jorah lifted gaze dark eyes met “a dutiful son pays father’s debts even blood debts”

 “this boy joffrey might want dead… recalls i’m alive belwas arstan whitebeard old man even wear sword you’ve seen that”

 “aye seen deftly handles staff recall killed manticore qarth might easily throat crushed”

 “might not” pointed “it stinging manticore meant slay saved life”

 “khaleesi occurred whitebeard belwas might league assassin might ploy win trust”

 sudden laughter made drogon hiss sent viserion flapping perch porthole “the ploy worked well”

 exile knight return smile “these illyrio’s ships illyrio’s captains illyrio’s sailors… strong belwas arstan men well yours”

 “magister illyrio protected past strong belwas says wept heard brother dead”

 “yes” said mormont “but weep viserys plans made him”

 “his plans need change magister illyrio friend house targaryen wealthy…”

 “he born wealthy world seen man grows rich kindness warlocks said second treason would gold illyrio mopatis love gold”

 “his skin” across cabin drogon stirred restlessly steam rising snout “mirri maz duur betrayed burned it”

 “mirri maz duur power pentos shall illyrio’s power know magister well devious man clever—”

 “i need clever men win iron throne”

 ser jorah snorted “that wineseller tried poison clever man well clever men hatch ambitious schemes”

 dany drew legs beneath blanket “you protect bloodriders”

 “four men khaleesi believe know illyrio mopatis well yet insist surrounding men know like puffedup eunuch world’s oldest squire take lesson pyat pree xaro xhoan daxos”

 means well dany reminded love “it seems queen trusts one foolish queen trusts everyone every man take service risk understand win seven kingdoms without risks conquer westeros one exile knight three dothraki bloodriders”

 jaw set stubbornly “your path dangerous deny blindly trust every liar schemer crosses end brothers did”

 obstinacy made angry treats like child “strong belwas could scheme way breakfast lies arstan whitebeard told me”

 “he pretends speaks boldly squire would dare”

 “he spoke frankly command knew brother”

 “a great many men knew brother grace westeros lord commander kingsguard sits small council serves king wits well steel first queensguard pray hear plan put you”

 “what plan tell me”

 “illyrio mopatis wants back pentos roof well go him… time alone let us see loyal obedient new subjects truly command groleo change course slaver’s bay”

 dany certain liked sound everything she’d ever heard flesh marts great slave cities yunkai meereen astapor dire frightening “what slaver’s bay”

 “an army” said ser jorah “if strong belwas much liking buy hundreds like fighting pits meereen… astapor i’d set sails astapor buy unsullied”

 “the slaves spiked bronze hats” dany seen unsullied guards free cities posted gates magisters archons dynasts “why want unsullied don’t even ride horses fat”

 “the unsullied may seen pentos myr household guards that’s soft service eunuchs tend plumpness case food vice allowed judge unsullied old household slaves like judging squires arstan whitebeard grace know tale three thousand qohor”

 “no” coverlet slipped dany’s shoulder tugged back place

 “it four hundred years ago dothraki first rode east sacking burning every town city path khal led named temmo khalasar big drogo’s big enough fifty thousand least half braided warriors bells ringing hair

 “the qohorik knew coming strengthened walls doubled size guard hired two free companies besides bright banners second sons almost afterthought sent man astapor buy three thousand unsullied long march back qohor however approached saw smoke dust heard distant din battle

 “by time unsullied reached city sun set crows wolves feasting beneath walls remained qohorik heavy horse bright banners second sons fled sellswords wont face hopeless odds dark falling dothraki retired camps drink dance feast none doubted would return morrow smash city gates storm walls rape loot slave pleased

 “but dawn broke temmo bloodriders led khalasar camp found three thousand unsullied drawn gates black goat standard flying heads small force could easily flanked know dothraki men foot men foot fit ridden

 “the dothraki charged unsullied locked shields lowered spears stood firm twenty thousand screamers bells hair stood firm

 “eighteen times dothraki charged broke shields spears like waves rocky shore thrice temmo sent archers wheeling past arrows fell like rain upon three thousand unsullied merely lifted shields heads squall passed end six hundred remained… twelve thousand dothraki lay dead upon field including khal temmo bloodriders kos sons morning fourth day new khal led survivors past city gates stately procession one one man cut braid threw feet three thousand

 “since day city guard qohor made solely unsullied every one carries tall spear hangs braid human hair

 “that find astapor grace put ashore continue pentos overland take longer yes… break bread magister illyrio thousand swords behind four”

 wisdom yes dany thought but… “how buy thousand slave soldiers value crown tourmaline brotherhood gave me”

 “dragons great wonder astapor qarth may slavers shower gifts qartheen not… ships carry dothraki horses took trade goods qarth i’ve holds seen bolts silk bales tiger skin amber jade carvings saffron myrrh… slaves cheap grace tiger skins costly”

 “those illyrio’s tiger skins” objected

 “and illyrio friend house targaryen”

 “all reason steal goods”

 “what use wealthy friends put wealth disposal queen magister illyrio would deny xaro xhoan daxos four chins sincere devotion cause begrudge three shiploads trade goods better use tiger skins buy beginnings army”

 that’s true dany felt rising excitement “there dangers long march…”

 “there dangers sea well corsairs pirates hunt southern route north valyria smoking sea demonhaunted next storm could sink scatter us kraken could pull us under… might find becalmed die thirst wait wind rise march different dangers queen none greater”

 “what captain groleo refuses change course though arstan strong belwas do”

 ser jorah stood “perhaps it’s time found out”

 “yes” decided “i’ll it” dany threw back coverlets hopped bunk “i’ll see captain command set course astapor” bent chest threw open lid seized first garment hand pair loose sandsilk trousers “hand medallion belt” commanded jorah pulled sandsilk hips “and vest—” started say turning

 ser jorah slid arms around

 “oh” dany time say pulled close pressed lips smelled sweat salt leather iron studs jerkin dug naked breasts crushed hard one hand held shoulder slid spine small back mouth opened tongue though never told beard scratchy thought mouth sweet dothraki wore beards long mustaches khal drogo ever kissed queen woman

 long kiss though long dany could said ended ser jorah let go took quick step backward “you… have…”

 “i waited iong” finished “i kissed qarth vaes tolorru kissed red waste every night every day made kissed often well” eyes breasts

 dany covered hands nipples could betray “i… fitting queen”

 “my queen” said “and bravest sweetest beautiful woman ever seen daenerys—”

 “your grace”

 “your grace” conceded “the dragon three heads remember wondered ever since heard warlocks house dust well here’s meaning balerion meraxes vhagar ridden aegon rhaenys visenya threeheaded dragon house targaryen—three dragons three riders”

 “yes” said dany “but brothers dead”

 “rhaenys visenya aegon’s wives well sisters brothers take husbands tell truly daenerys man world ever half true me”





 bran


 ridge slanted sharply earth long fold stone soil shaped like claw trees clung lower slopes pines hawthorn ash higher ground bare ridgeline stark cloudy sky

 could feel high stone calling went loping easy first faster higher strong legs eating incline birds burst branches overhead raced clawing flapping way sky could hear wind sighing amongst leaves squirrels chittering one another even sound pinecone made tumbled forest floor smells song around song filled good green world

 gravel flew beneath paws gained last feet stand upon crest sun hung tall pines huge red trees hills went far could see smell kite circling far dark pink sky

 prince mansound came head suddenly yet could feel rightness prince green prince wolfswood strong swift fierce lived good green world went fear

 far base woods something moved amongst trees flash grey quickglimpsed gone enough make ears prick beside swift green brook another form slipped running wolves knew little cousins chasing prey prince could see shadows fleet grey paws pack

 pack well five sixth stood aside somewhere inside sounds men given tell one sounds knew remembered scents brothers sisters smelled alike smelled pack different

 angry brother hot green eyes near prince felt though seen many hunts yet every sun set grew distant last others far scattered like leaves blown wild wind

 sometimes could sense though still hidden sight boulder stand trees could smell hear howls night yet felt presence back… sister lost tail drooped remembered four five four one white voice

 woods belonged snowy slopes stony hills great green pines golden leaf oaks rushing streams blue lakes fringed fingers white frost sister left wilds walk halls manrock hunters ruled within halls hard find path back wolf prince remembered

 wind shifted suddenly

 deer fear blood scent prey woke hunger prince sniffed air turning bounding along ridgetop jaws halfparted far side ridge steeper one he’d come flew surefoot stones roots rotting leaves slope trees long strides eating ground scent pulled onward ever faster

 deer dying reached ringed eight small grey cousins heads pack begun feed male first female taking turns tearing flesh red underbelly prey others waited patiently tail paced wary circle strides rest tail tucked low would eat last whatever brothers left

 prince downwind sense leapt upon fallen log six strides fed tail saw first gave piteous whine slunk away pack brothers turned sound bared teeth snarling head male female

 direwolf answered snarls low warning growl showed teeth bigger cousins twice size scrawny tail half large two pack heads leapt midst three broke melting away brush another came teeth snapping met attack head caught wolf’s leg jaws met flung aside yelping limping

 head wolf face great grey male bloody muzzle fresh prey’s soft belly white muzzle well mark old wolf mouth opened red slaver ran teeth

 fear prince thought would good fight went

 long fought rolling together roots stones fallen leaves scattered entrails prey tearing tooth claw breaking apart circling round bolting fight prince larger much stronger cousin pack female prowled around closely snuffing snarling would interpose whenever mate broke bloodied time time wolves would dart well snap leg ear prince turned way one angered much whirled black fury tore attacker’s throat others kept distance

 last red light filtering green boughs golden old wolf lay weary dirt rolled expose throat belly submission

 prince sniffed licked blood fur torn flesh old wolf gave soft whimper direwolf turned away hungry prey

 “hodor”

 sudden sound made stop snarl wolves regarded green yellow eyes bright last light day none heard queer wind blew ears buried jaws deer’s belly tore mouthful flesh

 “hodor hodor”

 thought won’t boy’s thought direwolf’s woods darkening shadows trees remained glow cousins’ eyes behind eyes saw big man’s grinning face stone vault whose walls spotted niter rich warm taste blood faded tongue don’t don’t want eat want want…

 “hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor” hodor chanted shook softly shoulders back forth back forth trying gentle always tried hodor seven feet tall stronger knew huge hands rattled bran’s teeth together “no” shouted angrily “hodor leave i’m i’m here”

 hodor stopped looking abashed “hodor”

 woods wolves gone bran back damp vault ancient watchtower must abandoned thousands years wasn’t much tower even tumbled stones overgrown moss ivy could hardly see right top “tumbledown tower” bran named place meera found way vault however

 “you gone long” jojen reed thirteen four years older bran jojen wasn’t much bigger either two inches maybe three solemn way talking made seem older wiser really winterfell old nan dubbed “little grandfather”

 bran frowned “i wanted eat”

 “meera back soon supper”

 “i’m sick frogs” meera frogeater neck bran couldn’t really blame catching many frogs supposed even so… “i wanted eat deer” moment remembered taste blood raw rich meat mouth watered fight

 “did mark trees”

 bran flushed jojen always telling things opened third eye put summer’s skin claw bark tree catch rabbit bring back jaws uneaten push rocks line stupid things “i forgot” said

 “you always forget”

 true meant things jojen asked wolf never seemed important always things see things smell whole green world hunt could run nothing better running unless running prey “i prince jojen” told older boy “i prince woods”

 “you prince” jojen reminded softly “you remember don’t tell are”

 “you know” jojen friend teacher sometimes bran wanted hit

 “i want say words tell are”

 “bran” said sullenly bran broken “brandon stark” cripple boy “the prince winterfell” winterfell burned tumbled people scattered slain glass gardens smashed hot water gushed cracked walls steam beneath sun prince someplace might never see

 “and summer” jojen prompted

 “my direwolf” smiled “prince green”

 “bran boy summer wolf two then”

 “two” sighed “and one” hated jojen got stupid like winterfell wanted dream wolf dreams know he’s always calling back

 “remember bran remember wolf consume join enough run hunt howl summer’s skin”

 bran thought liked summer’s skin better good skinchanger can’t wear skin like

 “will remember next time mark tree tree doesn’t matter long it”

 “i i’ll remember could go back like won’t forget time” i’ll eat deer first fight little wolves

 jojen shook head “no best stay eat mouth warg cannot live beast consumes”

 would know bran thought resentfully you’ve never warg don’t know it’s like

 hodor jerked suddenly feet almost hitting head barrelvaulted ceiling “hodor” shouted rushing door meera pushed open reached stepped refuge “hodor hodor” huge stableboy said grinning

 meera reed sixteen woman grown stood higher brother crannogmen small told bran asked wasn’t taller brownhaired greeneyed flat boy walked supple grace bran could watch envy meera wore long sharp dagger favorite way fight slender threepronged frog spear one hand woven net

 “who’s hungry” asked holding catch two small silvery trout six fat green frogs

 “i am” said bran frogs back winterfell bad things happened walders used say eating frogs would turn teeth green make moss grow arms wondered walders dead hadn’t seen corpses winterfell… lot corpses hadn’t looked inside buildings

 “we’ll feed help clean catch bran”

 nodded hard sulk meera much cheerful brother always seemed know make smile nothing ever scared made angry well except jojen sometimes… jojen reed could scare anyone dressed green eyes murky moss green dreams jojen dreamed came true except dreamed dead i’m way

 jojen sent hodor wood built small fire bran meera cleaning fish frogs used meera’s helm cooking pot chopping catch little cubes tossing water wild onions hodor found make froggy stew wasn’t good deer wasn’t bad either bran decided ate “thank meera” said “my lady”

 “you welcome grace”

 “come morrow” jojen announced “we best move on”

 bran could see meera tense “have green dream”

 “no” admitted

 “why leave then” sister demanded “tumbledown tower’s good place us villages near woods full game there’s fish frogs streams lakes… ever going find us here”

 “this place meant be”

 “it safe though”

 “it seems safe know” said jojen “but long battle winterfell saw dead battles mean wars army take us unawares…”

 “it might robb’s army” said bran “robb come back south soon know he’ll come back banners chase ironmen away”

 “your maester said naught robb lay dying” jojen reminded “ironmen stony shore said east bastard bolton moat cailin deepwood motte fallen heir cerwyn dead castellan torrhen’s square war everywhere said man neighbor”

 “we plowed field before” sister said “you want make wall threeeyed crow that’s well good wall long way bran legs hodor mounted…”

 “if eagles might fly” said jojen sharply “but wings horses”

 “there horses had” said meera “even deep wolfswood foresters crofters hunters horses”

 “and steal thieves last thing need men hunting us”

 “we could buy them” said “trade them”

 “look us meera crippled boy direwolf simpleminded giant two crannogmen thousand leagues neck known word spread long bran remains dead safe alive becomes prey want dead good true” jojen went fire prod embers stick “somewhere north threeeyed crow awaits us bran need teacher wiser me”

 “how jojen” sister asked “how”

 “afoot” answered “a step time”

 “the road greywater winterfell went forever mounted want us travel longer road foot without even knowing ends beyond wall say haven’t know beyond wall’s big place jojen many threeeyed crows one find him”

 “perhaps find us”

 meera could find reply heard sound distant howl wolf drifting night “summer” asked jojen listening

 “no” bran knew voice direwolf

 “are certain” said little grandfather

 “certain” summer wandered far afield today would back till dawn maybe jojen dreams green can’t tell wolf direwolf wondered listened jojen much prince like bran big strong like hodor good hunter meera yet somehow always jojen telling “we steal horses like meera wants” bran said “and ride umbers last hearth” thought moment “or could steal boat sail white knife white harbor town fat lord manderly rules friendly harvest feast wanted build ships maybe built could sail riverrun bring robb home army wouldn’t matter knew alive robb wouldn’t let anyone hurt us”

 “hodor” burped hodor “hodor hodor”

 one liked bran’s plan though meera smiled jojen frowned never listened wanted even though bran stark prince besides reeds neck stark bannermen

 “hoooodor” said hodor swaying “hooooooodor hoooooodor hodor hodor hodor” sometimes liked saying name different ways times would stay quiet forgot never knowing hodor “hodor hodor hodor” shouted

 going stop bran realized “hodor” said “why don’t go outside train sword”

 stableboy forgotten sword remembered “hodor” burped went blade three tomb swords taken crypts winterfell bran brother rickon hidden theon greyjoy’s ironmen bran claimed uncle brandon’s sword meera one found upon knees grandfather lord rickard hodor’s blade much older huge heavy piece iron dull centuries neglect well spotted rust could swing hours time rotted tree near tumbled stones hacked half pieces

 even went outside could hear walls bellowing “hodor” cut slashed tree thankfully wolfswood huge like anyone else around hear

 “jojen mean teacher” bran asked “you’re teacher know never marked tree next time third eye open like wanted…”

 “so wide open fear may fall live rest days wolf woods”

 “i won’t promise”

 “the boy promises wolf remember run summer hunt kill him… bend yours”

 “i forget” bran complained “i’m nine i’ll better i’m older even florian fool prince aemon dragonknight weren’t great knights nine”

 “that true” said jojen “and wise thing say days still growing longer… aren’t summer child know tell words house stark”

 “winter coming” saying made bran feel cold

 jojen gave solemn nod “i dreamed winged wolf bound earth chains stone came winterfell free chains yet still fly”

 “then teach me” bran still feared threeeyed crow haunted dreams sometimes pecking endlessly skin eyes telling fly “you’re greenseer”

 “no” said jojen “only boy dreams greenseers wargs well greatest could wear skins beast flies swims crawls could look eyes weirwoods well see truth lies beneath world

 “the gods give many gifts bran sister hunter given run swiftly stand still seems vanish sharp ears keen eyes steady hand net spear breathe mud fly trees could things could gods gave green dreams you… could bran winged wolf saying far high might fly… someone teach help master gift understand remember first men neck children forest friends… much forgotten much never knew”

 meera took bran hand “if stay troubling one you’ll safe war ends learn though except brother teach you’ve heard says leave place seek refuge last hearth beyond wall risk taken boy know prince well lord’s son king’s true heir sworn faith earth water bronze iron ice fire risk bran gift choice think servants command” grinned “at least this”

 “you mean” bran said “you’ll say truly”

 “truly prince” girl replied “so consider well”

 bran tried think way father might greatjon’s uncles hother whoresbane mors crowfood fierce men thought would loyal karstarks karhold strong castle father always said would safe umbers karstarks

 bran realized crying stupid baby thought matter went karhold white harbor greywater watch he’d cripple got balled hands fists “i want fly” told “please take crow”

 “no one goes king” khorane sathmantes replied firmly “salladhor saan tell first”

 davos weak defy could nod

 salladhor saan aboard valyrian found another quay quarter mile distant hold bigbellied pentoshi cog named bountiful harvest counting cargo two eunuchs one held lantern wax tablet stylus “thirtyseven thirtyeight thirtynine” old rogue saying davos captain came hatch today wore winecolored tunic high boots bleached white leather inlaid silver scrollwork pulling stopper jar sniffed sneezed said “a coarse grind second quality nose declares bill lading saying fortythree jars others gotten wondering pentoshi think counting” saw davos stopped suddenly “is pepper stinging eyes tears knight onions stands dear friend davos died burning river agree come haunt me”

 “i ghost salla”

 “what else onion knight never thin pale you” salladhor saan threaded way jars spice bolts cloth filled hold merchanter wrapped davos fierce embrace kissed cheek third time forehead “you still warm ser feel heart thumpetythumping true sea swallowed spit again”

 davos reminded patchface princess shireen’s lackwit fool gone sea well came mad mad well coughed gloved hand said “i swam beneath chain washed ashore spear merling king would died shayala’s dance come upon me”

 salladhor saan threw arm around captain’s shoulders “this well done khorane fine reward thinking meizo mahr good eunuch take friend davos owner’s cabin fetch hot wine cloves misliking sound cough squeeze lime well bring white cheese bowl cracked green olives counted earlier davos join soon bespoken good captain forgiving know eat olives must cross you”

 davos let elder two eunuchs escort large lavishly furnished cabin stem ship carpets deep windows stained glass great leather chairs would seated three davos quite comfortably cheese olives arrived shortly cup steaming hot red wine held hands sipped gratefully warmth felt soothing spread chest

 salladhor saan appeared long “you must forgiving wine friend pentoshi would drink water purple”

 “it help chest” said davos “hot wine better compress mother used say”

 “you shall needing compresses well thinking sitting spear long time oh finding excellent chair fat cheeks not”

 “who” asked davos sips hot wine

 “illyrio mopatis whale whiskers telling truly chairs built measure though seldom bestirring pentos sit fat man always sits comfortably thinking takes pillow wherever goes”

 “how come pentoshi ship” asked davos “have gone pirate lord” set empty cup aside

 “vile calumny suffered pirates salladhor saan ask due much gold owed oh yes without reason place coin taken handsome parchment crisp bears name seal lord alester florent hand king made lord blackwater bay vessel may crossing lordly waters without lordly leave outlaws trying steal past night avoid lawful duties customs better smugglers well within rights seize them” old pirate laughed “i cut man’s fingers though good bits fingers ships taking cargoes ransoms nothing unreasonable” gave davos sharp look “you unwell friend cough… thin seeing bones skin yet seeing little bag fingerbones…”

 old habit made davos reach leather pouch longer “i lost river” luck

 “the river terrible” salladhor saan said solemnly “even bay seeing shuddering”

 davos coughed spat coughed “i saw black betha burning fury well” finally managed hoarsely “did none ships escape fire” part still hoped

 “lord steffon ragged jenna swift sword laughing lord others upstream pyromancers’pissing yes burn chain raised neither could flying surrendering rowed far blackwater away battling sunk crews would falling lannister hands ragged jenna laughing lord still playing pirate river heard say so”

 “lady marya” davos asked “wraith”

 salladhor saan put hand davos’s forearm gave squeeze “no sorry friend good men dale allard comfort give you—your young devan among took end brave boy never left king’s side say”

 moment felt almost dizzy relief palpable afraid ask devan “the mother merciful must go salla must see him”

 “yes” said salladhor saan “and wanting sail cape wrath know see wife two little ones must new ship thinking”

 “his grace give ship” said davos

 lyseni shook head “of ships grace none salladhor saan many king’s ships burned river mine shall one old friend sail yes dance braavos myr volantis black night unseen dance silks spices fat purses yes”

 “you kind salla duty’s king purse war go stannis still rightful heir laws seven kingdoms”

 sudden racking cough bent davos salladhor saan moved help waved moment recovered “no one” wheezed “what mean sees one” voice sounded wet thick even ears moment cabin swam dizzily around

 “no one her” said salladhor saan davos ask meant “my friend tire bed needing salladhor saan bed many blankets hot compress chest wine cloves”

 davos shook head “i fine tell salla must know one melisandre”

 lyseni gave long doubtful look continued reluctantly “the guards keep others away even queen little daughter servants bring meals one eats” leaned forward lowered voice “queer talking heard hungry fires within mountain stannis red woman go together watch flames shafts say secret stairs mountain’s heart hot places may walk unburned enough give old man terrors sometimes scarcely find strength eat”

 melisandre davos shivered “the red woman him” said “she sent fire consume us punish stannis setting aside teach could hope win without sorceries”

 lyseni chose plump olive bowl “you first saying friend saying loudly dragonstone crawls queen’s men oh yes sharp ears sharper knives” popped olive mouth

 “i knife captain khorane made gift it” pulled dirk laid table “a knife cut melisandre’s heart one”

 salladhor saan spit olive pit “davos good davos must saying things even jest”

 “no jest mean kill her” killed mortal weapons davos certain could seen old maester cressen slip poison wine eyes seen drank poisoned cup maester died red priestess knife heart though… even demons killed cold iron singers say

 “these dangerous talkings friend” salladhor saan warned “i thinking still sick sea fever cooked wits yes best taking bed long resting stronger”

 resolve weakens mean davos got feet feel feverish little dizzy matter “you treacherous old rogue salladhor saan good friend same”

 lyseni stroked pointed silver beard “so great friend staying yes”

 “no going” coughed

 “go look cough tremble thin weak going”

 “to castle bed son”

 “and red woman” salladhor saan said suspiciously “she castle also”

 “her too” davos slid dirk back sheath

 “you onion smuggler know skulkings stabbings ill cannot even hold dirk know happening caught burning river queen burning traitors servants dark named poor men red woman sang fires lit”

 davos unsurprised knew thought knew told “she took lord sunglass dungeons” guessed “and hubard rambton’s sons”

 “just burned burn kill red woman burn revenge fail kill burn trying sing scream die come back life”

 “and why” said davos “to thing make end melisandre asshai works else would sea spit know blackwater bay well salla sensible captain would ever take ship spears merling king risk ripping bottom shayala’s dance never come near me”

 “a wind” insisted salladhor saan loudly “an ill wind wind drove far south”

 “and sent wind salla mother spoke me”

 old lyseni blinked “your mother dead…”

 “the mother blessed seven sons yet let burn spoke called fire said called shadows rowed melisandre bowels storm’s end watched birth horror” saw still nightmares gaunt black hands pushing thighs wriggled free swollen womb “she killed cressen lord renly brave man named cortnay penrose killed sons well time someone killed her”

 “someone” said salladhor saan “yes someone weak child warrior stay beg talk eat perhaps sail braavos hire faceless man thing yes must sit eat”

 making much harder thought davos wearily perishingly hard begin “i vengeance belly salla leaves room food let go friendship wish luck let go”

 salladhor saan pushed feet “you true friend thinking dead bringing ashes bones back lady wife telling lost husband four sons sad old salladhor saan brave ser knight go rushing grave gather bones sack give sons leave behind wear little bags around necks” waved angry hand rings every finger “go go go go go”

 davos want leave like “salla—”

 “go stay better going go”

 reached castle gates found shut well davos pounded ironstudded wood fist answer kicked finally crossbowman appeared atop barbican peering two towering gargoyles “who goes there”

 craned head back cupped hands around mouth “ser davos seaworth see grace”

 “are drunk go away stop pounding”

 salladhor saan warned davos tried different tack “send son devan king’s squire”

 guard frowned “who say were”

 “davos” shouted “the onion knight”

 “his ship burned” davos agreed “but lived stands jate still captain gate”

 “who”

 “jate blackberry knows well enough”

 “i never heard like he’s dead”

 “lord chyttering then”

 “that one know burned blackwater”

 “hookface hal hog”

 “dead dead” crossbowman said face betrayed sudden doubt “you wait there” vanished

 davos waited gone gone thought dully remembering fat hal’s white belly always showed beneath greasestained doublet long scar fish hook left across will’s face way jate always doffed cap women five fifty highborn low drowned burned sons thousand others gone make king hell

 suddenly crossbowman back “go round sally port they’ll admit you”

 davos bid guards ushered inside strangers carried spears breasts wore foxandflowers sigil house florent escorted stone drum he’d expected arch dragon’s tail aegon’s garden “wait here” sergeant told

 “does grace know i’ve returned” asked davos

 “bugger know wait said” man left taking spearmen

 aegon’s garden pleasant piney smell tall dark trees rose every side wild roses well towering thorny hedges boggy spot cranberries grew

 brought davos wondered

 heard faint ringing bells child’s giggle suddenly fool patchface popped bushes shambling along fast could go princess shireen hot heels “you come back now” shouting “patches come back”

 fool saw davos jerked sudden halt bells antlered tin helmet going tingaling tingaling hopping one foot sang “fool’s blood king’s blood blood maiden’s thigh chains guests chains bridegroom aye aye aye” shireen almost caught last instant hopped patch bracken vanished among trees princess right behind sight made davos smile

 turned cough gloved hand another small shape crashed hedge bowled right knocking feet

 boy went well almost “what here” demanded brushed jetblack hair fell collar eyes startling blue “you shouldn’t get way i’m running”

 “no” davos agreed “i shouldn’t” another fit coughing seized struggled knees

 “are unwell” boy took arm pulled feet “should summon maester”

 davos shook head “a cough pass”

 boy took word “we playing monsters maidens” explained “i monster it’s childish game cousin likes name”

 “ser davos seaworth”

 boy looked dubiously “are certain don’t look knightly”

 “i knight onions lord”

 blue eyes blinked “the one black ship”

 “you know tale”

 “you brought uncle stannis fish eat born lord tyrell siege” boy drew tall “i edric storm” announced “king robert’s son”

 “of course are” davos known almost lad prominent ears florent hair eyes jaw cheekbones baratheon

 “did know father” edric storm demanded

 “i saw many time calling uncle court never spoke”

 “my father taught fight” boy said proudly “he came see almost every year sometimes trained together last name day sent warhammer like smaller made leave storm’s end though true uncle stannis cut fingers”

 “only last joint still fingers shorter”

 “show me”

 davos peeled glove boy studied hand carefully “he shorten thumb”

 “no” davos coughed “no left that”

 “he chopped fingers” lad decided “that ill done”

 “i smuggler”

 “yes smuggled fish onions”

 “lord stannis knighted onions took fingers smuggling” pulled glove back

 “my father would chopped fingers”

 “as say lord” robert different man stannis true enough boy like aye like renly well thought made anxious

 “onions float ser come take king”

 jaime


 jaime first spy inn main building hugged south shore river bent long low wings outstretched along water embrace travelers sailing downstream lower story grey stone upper whitewashed wood roof slate could see stables well arbor heavy vines “no smoke chimneys” pointed approached “nor lights windows”

 “the inn still open last passed way” said ser cleos frey “they brewed fine ale perhaps still cellars”

 “there may people” brienne said “hiding dead”

 “frightened corpses wench” jaime said

 glared “my name is—”

 “—brienne yes wouldn’t like sleep bed night brienne we’d safer open river might prudent find what’s happened here”

 gave answer moment pushed tiller angle skiff toward weathered wooden dock ser cleos scrambled take sail bumped softly pier climbed tie jaime clambered made awkward chains

 end dock flaking shingle swung iron post painted likeness king upon knees hands pressed together gesture fealty jaime took one look laughed aloud “we could found better inn”

 “is special place” wench asked suspicious

 ser cleos answered “this inn kneeling man lady stands upon spot last king north knelt aegon conqueror offer submission that’s sign suppose”

 “torrhen brought power south fall two kings field fire” said jaime “but saw aegon’s dragon size host chose path wisdom bent frozen knees” stopped sound horse’s whinny “horses stable one least” one need put wench behind “let’s see who’s home shall we” without waiting answer jaime went clinking dock put shoulder door shoved open…

 …and found eye eye loaded crossbow standing behind chunky boy fifteen “lion fish wolf” lad demanded

 “we hoping capon” jaime heard companions entering behind “the crossbow coward’s weapon”

 “it’ll put bolt heart same”

 “perhaps wind cousin spill entrails floor”

 “don’t scaring lad now” ser cleos said

 “we mean harm” wench said “and coin pay food drink” dug silver piece pouch

 boy looked suspiciously coin jaime’s manacles “why’s one irons”

 “killed crossbowmen” said jaime “do ale”

 “yes” boy lowered crossbow inch “undo swordbelts let fall might we’ll feed you” edged around peer thick diamondshaped windowpanes see outside “that’s tully sail”

 “we come riverrun” brienne undid clasp belt let clatter floor ser cleos followed suit

 sallow man pocked doughy face stepped cellar door holding butcher’s heavy cleaver “three got horsemeat enough three horse old tough meat’s still fresh”

 “is bread” asked brienne

 “hardbread stale oatcakes”

 jaime grinned “now there’s honest innkeep they’ll serve stale bread stringy meat don’t freely”

 “i’m innkeep buried back women”

 “did kill them”

 “would tell did” man spat “likely wolves’ work maybe lions what’s difference wife found dead way see place now”

 “where wife yours” ser cleos asked

 man gave suspicious squint “and would wanting know she’s here… more’n three unless like taste silver”

 brienne tossed coin caught air bit tucked away

 “she’s got more” boy crossbow announced

 “so boy go find onions”

 lad raised crossbow shoulder gave one last sullen look vanished cellar

 “your son” ser cleos asked

 “just boy wife took two sons lions killed one died flux boy lost mother bloody mummers days man needs someone keep watch sleeps” waved cleaver tables “might well sit”

 hearth cold jaime picked chair nearest ashes stretched long legs table clink chains accompanied every movement irritating sound done i’ll wrap chains around wench’s throat see likes

 man wasn’t innkeep charred three huge horse steaks fried onions bacon grease almost made stale oatcakes jaime cleos drank ale brienne cup cider boy kept distance perching atop cider barrel crossbow across knees cocked loaded cook drew tankard ale sat “what news riverrun” asked ser cleos taking leader

 ser cleos glanced brienne answering “lord hoster failing son holds fords red fork lannisters battles”

 “battles everywhere bound ser”

 “king’s landing” ser cleos wiped grease lips

 host snorted “then you’re three fools last heard king stannis outside city walls say hundred thousand men magic sword”

 jaime’s hands wrapped around chain bound wrists twisted taut wishing strength snap two i’d show stannis sheathe magic sword

 “i’d stay well clear kingsroad you” man went “it’s worse bad hear wolves lions bands broken men preying anyone catch”

 “vermin” declared ser cleos contempt “such would never dare trouble armed men”

 “begging pardon ser see one armed man traveling woman prisoner chains”

 brienne gave cook dark look wench hate reminded she’s wench jaime reflected twisting chains links cold hard flesh iron implacable manacles chafed wrists raw

 “i mean follow trident sea” wench told host “we’ll find mounts maidenpool ride way duskendale rosby keep us well away worst fighting”

 host shook head “you’ll never reach maidenpool river thirty miles couple boats burned sank channel’s silting around there’s nest outlaws preying anyone tries come downriver around skipping stones red deer island lightning lord’s seen parts well crosses river wherever likes riding way way never still”

 “and lightning lord” demanded ser cleos frey

 “lord beric please ser call ’cause strikes sudden like lightning clear sky it’s said cannot die”

 die shove sword jaime thought “does thoros myr still ride him”

 “aye red wizard i’ve heard tell strange powers”

 well power match robert baratheon drink drink enough could say jaime heard thoros tell king became red priest robes hid winestains well robert laughed hard he’d spit ale cersei’s silken mantle “far make objection” said “but perhaps trident safest course”

 “i’d say that’s so” cook agreed “even get past red deer island don’t meet lord beric red wizard there’s still ruby ford last heard leech lord’s wolves held ford time past could lions lord beric anyone”

 “or one” brienne suggested

 “if m’lady cares wager skin won’t stop her… i’d leave river cut overland stay main roads shelter trees night hidden were… well still wouldn’t want go might stand mummer’s chance”

 big wench looking doubtful “we would need horses”

 “there horses here” jaime pointed “i heard one stable”

 “aye are” said innkeep wasn’t innkeep “three happens they’re sale”

 jaime laugh “of course you’ll show us anyway”

 brienne scowled man wasn’t innkeep met eyes without blinking moment reluctantly said “show me” rose table

 stables mucked long smell hundreds fat black flies swarmed amongst straw buzzing stall stall crawling mounds horse dung lay everywhere three horses seen made unlikely trio lumbering brown plow horse ancient white gelding blind one eye knight’s palfrey dapple grey spirited “they’re sale price” alleged owner announced

 “how come horses” brienne wanted know

 “the dray stabled wife come inn” man said “along one ate gelding come wandering one night boy caught palfrey running free still saddled bridled i’ll show you”

 saddle showed decorated silver inlay saddlecloth originally checkered pink black mostly brown jaime recognize original colors recognized bloodstains easily enough “well owner won’t coming claim anytime soon” examined palfrey’s legs counted gelding’s teeth “give gold piece grey he’ll include saddle” advised brienne “a silver plow horse ought pay us taking white hands”

 “don’t speak discourteously horse ser” wench opened purse lady catelyn given took three golden coins “i pay dragon each”

 blinked reached gold hesitated drew hand back “i don’t know can’t ride golden dragon need get away eat one i’m hungry”

 “you skiff well” said “sail river like”

 “let taste o’ gold” man took one coins palm bit “hm real enough i’d say three dragons skiff”

 “he’s robbing blind wench” jaime said amiably

 “i’ll want provisions too” brienne told host ignoring jaime “whatever spare”

 “there’s oatcakes” man scooped two dragons palm jingled fist smiling sound made “aye smoked salt fish cost silver beds costing well you’ll wanting stay night”

 “no” brienne said

 man frowned “woman don’t want go riding night strange country horses don’t know you’re like blunder bog break horse’s leg”

 “the moon bright tonight” brienne said “we’ll trouble finding way”

 host chewed “if don’t silver might coppers would buy beds coverlet two keep warm it’s like i’m turning travelers away get meaning”

 “that sounds fair” said ser cleos

 “the coverlets fresh washed wife saw go flea found neither word that” jingled coins smiling

 ser cleos plainly tempted “a proper bed would us good lady” said brienne “we’d make better time morrow refreshed” looked cousin support

 “no coz wench right promises keep long leagues us ought ride on”

 “but” said cleos “you said yourself—”

 “then” thought inn deserted “now full belly moonlight ride thing” smiled wench “but unless mean throw back plow horse like sack flour someone best something irons it’s difficult ride ankles chained together”

 brienne frowned chain man wasn’t innkeep rubbed jaw “there’s smithy round back stable”

 “show me” brienne said

 “yes” said jaime “and sooner better there’s far much horse shit taste would hate step it” gave wench sharp look wondering bright enough take meaning

 hoped might strike irons wrists well brienne still suspicious split ankle chain center halfdozen sharp blows smith’s hammer delivered blunt end steel chisel suggested break wrist chain well ignored

 “six miles downriver you’ll see burned village” host said helping saddle horses load packs time directed counsel brienne “the road splits turn south you’ll come ser warren’s stone towerhouse ser warren went died couldn’t say holds it’s place best shunned you’d better follow track woods south east”

 “we shall” answered “you thanks”

 point gold jaime kept thought tired disregarded huge ugly cow woman

 took plow horse assigned palfrey ser cleos threatened jaime drew oneeyed gelding put end thoughts might giving horse kick leaving wench dust

 man boy came watch leave man wished luck told come back better times lad stood silent crossbow arm “take spear maul” jaime told “they’ll serve better” boy stared distrustfully much friendly advice shrugged turned horse never looked back

 ser cleos complaints rode still mourning lost featherbed rode east along bank moonlit river red fork broad shallow banks mud reeds jaime’s mount plodded along placidly though poor old thing tendency want drift side good eye felt good mounted horse since robb stark’s archers killed destrier whispering wood

 reached burned village choice equally unpromising roads confronted narrow tracks deeply rutted carts farmers hauling grain river one wandered toward southeast soon vanished amidst trees could see distance straighter stonier arrowed due south brienne considered briefly swung horse onto southern road jaime pleasantly surprised choice would made

 “but road innkeep warned us against” ser cleos objected

 “he innkeep” hunched gracelessly saddle seemed sure seat nonetheless “the man took great interest choice route woods… places notorious haunts outlaws may urging us trap”

 “clever wench” jaime smiled cousin “our host friends road would venture ones whose mounts gave stable memorable aroma”

 “he may lying river well put us horses” wench said “but could take risk soldiers ruby ford crossroads”

 well may ugly she’s entirely stupid jaime gave grudging smile

 ruddy light upper windows stone towerhouse gave warning presence long way brienne led fields stronghold well rear angle back find road

 “i’ll take first watch” brienne told ser cleos frey soon snoring softly

 jaime sat bole oak wondered cersei tyrion “do siblings lady” asked

 brienne squinted suspiciously “no father’s s—child”

 jaime chuckled “son meant say think son make queer sort daughter sure”

 wordless turned away knuckles tight sword hilt wretched creature one reminded tyrion queer way though first blush two people could scarcely dissimilar perhaps thought brother made say “i intend give offense brienne forgive me”

 “your crimes past forgiving kingslayer”

 “that name again” jaime twisted idly chains “why enrage i’ve never done harm know of”

 “you’ve harmed others sworn protect weak innocent…”

 “…the king” always came back aerys “don’t presume judge understand wench”

 “my name is—”

 “—brienne yes anyone ever told you’re tedious ugly”

 “you provoke anger kingslayer”

 “oh might cared enough try”

 “why take oath” demanded “why white cloak meant betray stood for”

 could say might possibly understand “i boy fifteen great honor one young”

 “that answer” said scornfully

 would like truth joined kingsguard love course

 “father never consent” jaime objected

 “the king won’t ask it’s done father can’t object openly aerys ser ilyn payne’s tongue torn boasting hand truly ruled seven kingdoms captain hand’s guard yet father dared try stop won’t stop either”

 “but” jaime said “there’s casterly rock…”

 “is rock want me”

 tyrion


 eunuch humming tunelessly came door dressed flowing robes peachcolored silk smelling lemons saw tyrion seated hearth stopped grew still “my lord tyrion” came squeak punctuated nervous giggle

 “so remember begun wonder”

 “it good see looking strong well” varys smiled slimiest smile “though confess thought find mine humble chambers”

 “they humble excessively truth” tyrion waited varys summoned father slipping pay visit eunuch’s apartments sparse small three snug windowless chambers north wall “i’d hoped discover bushel baskets juicy secrets away waiting there’s paper found” he’d searched hidden passages knowing spider must ways coming going unseen proved equally elusive “there water flagon gods mercy” went “your sleeping cell wider coffin bed… actually made stone feel way”

 varys closed door barred “i plagued backaches lord prefer sleep upon hard surface”

 “i would taken featherbed man”

 “i full surprises cross abandoning battle”

 “it made think one family”

 “it want love good lord delicate disposition scar dreadful look upon…” gave exaggerated shudder “your poor nose…”

 tyrion rubbed irritably scab “perhaps new one made gold sort nose would suggest varys one like smell secrets tell goldsmith want father’s nose” smiled “my noble father labors diligently scarce see anymore tell true he’s restoring grand maester pycelle small council”

 “it lord”

 “do sweet sister thank that” pycelle sister’s creature tyrion stripped man office beard dignity flung black cell

 “not lord thank archmaesters oldtown wished insist pycelle’s restoration grounds conclave may make unmake grand maester”

 bloody fools thought tyrion “i seem recall maegor cruel’s headsman unmade three axe”

 “quite true” varys said “and second aegon fed grand maester gerardys dragon”

 “alas quite dragonless suppose could dipped pycelle wildfire set ablaze would citadel preferred that”

 “well would keeping tradition” eunuch tittered “thankfully wiser heads prevailed conclave accepted fact pycelle’s dismissal set choosing successor giving due consideration maester turquin cordwainer’s son maester erreck hedge knight’s bastard thereby demonstrating satisfaction ability counts birth order conclave verge sending us maester gormon tyrell highgarden told lord father acted once”

 conclave met oldtown behind closed doors tyrion knew deliberations supposedly secret varys little birds citadel “i see father decided nip rose bloomed” chuckle “pycelle toad better lannister toad tyrell toad no”

 “grand maester pycelle always good friend house” varys said sweetly “perhaps console learn ser boros blount also restored”

 cersei stripped ser boros white cloak failing die defense prince tommen bronn seized boy rosby road man friend tyrion’s likely hated cersei almost much suppose that’s something “blount blustering coward” said amiably

 “is oh dear still knights kingsguard serve life traditionally perhaps ser boros prove braver future doubt remain loyal”

 “to father” said tyrion pointedly

 “while subject kingsguard… wonder could delightfully unexpected visit happen concern ser boros’s fallen brother gallant ser mandon moore” eunuch stroked powdered cheek “your man bronn seems interested late”

 bronn turned could ser mandon doubt varys knew deal more… choose share “the man seems quite friendless” tyrion said carefully

 “sadly” said varys “oh sadly might find kin turned enough stones back vale here… lord arryn brought king’s landing robert gave white cloak neither loved much fear sort smallfolk cheer tourneys despite undoubted prowess even brothers kingsguard never warmed ser barristan heard say man friend sword life duty… know think selmy meant altogether praise queer consider qualities seek kingsguard could said—men live king lights brave ser mandon perfect white knight died knight kingsguard ought sword hand defending one king’s blood” eunuch gave slimy smile watched sharply

 trying murder one king’s blood mean tyrion wondered varys knew rather saying nothing he’d heard new bronn brought back much reports needed link cersei sign ser mandon sister’s catspaw want always get reflected bitterly reminded him…

 “it ser mandon brings here”

 “to sure” eunuch crossed room flagon water “may serve lord” asked filled cup

 “yes water” folded hands together “i want bring shae”

 varys took drink “is wise lord dear sweet child would shame father hanged her”

 surprise varys knew “no it’s wise it’s bloody madness want see one last time send away cannot abide close”

 “i understand”

 “you wise suspect good lord”

 “who” cocked head

 “the kettleblacks report frequently sweet sister”

 “when think much coin paid wretched… think there’s chance gold might win away cersei”

 “there always chance care wager likelihood knights three sister promised advancement” wicked little titter burst eunuch’s lips “and eldest ser osmund kingsguard dreams certain other… favors… well match queen coin coin doubt second purse quite inexhaustible”

 seven hells thought tyrion “are suggesting cersei’s fucking osmund kettleblack”

 “oh dear would dreadfully dangerous don’t think queen hints… perhaps morrow wedding’s done… smile whisper ribald jest… breast brushing lightly sleeve pass… yet seems serve would eunuch know things” tip tongue ran across lower lip like shy pink animal

 could somehow push beyond sly fondling arrange father catch abed together… tyrion fingered scab nose see could done perhaps plan would come later “are kettleblacks ones”

 “would true lord fear many eyes upon are… shall say conspicuous well loved grieves tell janos slynt’s sons would gladly inform avenge father sweet lord petyr friends half brothels king’s landing unwise visit know lord father soon thereafter”

 it’s even worse feared “and father spying me”

 time eunuch laughed aloud “why lord”

 tyrion laughed well great fool trust varys to—but eunuch already knew enough shae get well thoroughly hanged “you bring shae walls hidden eyes done before”

 varys wrung hands “oh lord nothing would please but… king maegor wanted rats walls take meaning require means secret egress ever trapped enemies door connect passages steal shae away lady lollys time sure way bring bedchamber without us seen”

 “then bring somewhere else”

 “but safe place”

 “there is” tyrion grinned “here it’s time put rockhard bed better use think”

 tyrion almost forgotten shae’s thricedamned singer “how spoke symon”

 “i told lady tanda hired play lollys music calms baby starts kick symon says there’s dancing bear feast wines arbor i’ve never seen bear dance”

 “they worse do” singer concerned bear one careless word wrong ear shae would hang

 “symon says there’s seventyseven courses hundred doves baked great pie” shae gushed “when crust’s opened they’ll burst fly”

 “after roost rafters rain birdshit guests” tyrion suffered wedding pies doves liked shit especially always suspected

 “couldn’t dress silks velvets go lady instead maidservant one would know wasn’t”

 everyone would know weren’t thought tyrion “lady tanda might wonder lollys’s bedmaid found many jewels”

 “there’s thousand guests symon says she’d never even see i’d find place dark corner salt whenever got go privy could slip meet you” cupped cock stroked gently “i won’t wear smallclothes gown m’lord won’t even need unlace me” fingers teased “or liked could him” took mouth

 “what him”

 kill might said man done nothing sing songs fill shae’s sweet head visions doves dancing bears “find him” said instead “find someone else does”





 arya


 grubbing vegetables dead man’s garden heard singing

 arya stiffened still stone listening three stringy carrots hand suddenly forgotten thought bloody mummers roose bolton’s men shiver fear went back it’s fair finally found trident thought almost safe

 would mummers singing

 song came drifting river somewhere beyond little rise east “off gulltown see fair maid heighho heighho…”

 arya rose carrots dangling hand sounded like singer coming river road among cabbages hot pie heard judge look face gendry gone sleep shade burned cottage past hearing anything

 “i’ll steal sweet kiss point blade heighho heighho” thought heard woodharp beneath soft rush river

 “do hear” hot pie asked hoarse whisper hugged armful cabbages “someone’s coming”

 “go wake gendry” arya told “just shake shoulder don’t make lot noise” gendry easy wake unlike hot pie needed kicked shouted

 “i’ll make love we’ll rest shade heighho heighho” song swelled louder every word

 hot pie opened arms cabbages fell ground soft thumps “we hide”

 burned cottage overgrown garden stood hard beside banks trident willows growing along river’s edge reed beds muddy shallows beyond ground hereabouts painfully open knew never left woods thought they’d hungry though garden much temptation bread cheese stolen harrenhal given six days ago back thick woods “take gendry horses behind cottage” decided part one wall still standing big enough maybe conceal two boys three horses horses don’t whinny singer doesn’t come poking around garden

 “what you”

 “i’ll hide tree he’s probably alone bothers i’ll kill go”

 hot pie went arya dropped carrots drew stolen sword shoulder strapped sheath across back longsword made man grown bumped ground wore hip it’s heavy besides thought missing needle way every time took clumsy thing hand sword could kill enough

 lightfoot moved big old willow grew beside bend road went one knee grass mud within veil trailing branches old gods prayed singer’s voice grew louder tree gods hide make go past horse whickered song broke suddenly he’s heard knew maybe he’s alone he’s maybe they’ll scared us

 “did hear that” man’s voice said “there’s something behind wall would say”

 “aye” replied second voice deeper “what think might archer”

 two arya bit lip could see knelt account willow could hear

 “a bear” third voice first one

 “a lot meat bear” deep voice said “a lot fat well fall good eat it’s cooked right”

 “could wolf maybe lion”

 “with four feet think two”

 “makes matter it”

 “not know archer mean arrows”

 “drop shafts wall whatever’s hiding back come quick enough watch see”

 “what it’s honest man back though poor woman little babe breast”

 “an honest man would come show us face outlaw would skulk hide”

 “aye that’s go loose shafts then”

 arya sprang feet “don’t” showed sword three saw three syrio could fight three hot pie gendry stand maybe they’re boys men

 three men looked standing road blade hand singer idly plucked string “boy” said “put sword unless you’re wanting hurt it’s big lad besides anguy could put three shafts could hope reach us”

 “he could not” arya said “and i’m girl”

 “so are” singer bowed “my pardons”

 “you go road walk right past keep singing we’ll know go away leave us won’t kill you”

 frecklefaced archer laughed “lem won’t kill us hear”

 “i heard” said lem big soldier deep voice

 “child” said singer “put sword we’ll take safe place get food belly wolves parts lions worse things place little girl wandering alone”

 “she’s alone” gendry rode behind cottage wall behind hot pie leading horse chainmail shirt sword hand gendry looked almost man grown dangerous hot pie looked like hot pie “do like says leave us be” warned gendry

 “two three” singer counted “and horses lovely horses steal them”

 “they’re ours” arya watched carefully singer kept distracting talk archer danger pull arrow ground…

 “will give us names like honest men” singer asked boys

 “i’m hot pie” hot pie said

 “aye good you” man smiled “it’s every day meet lad tasty name would friends called mutton chop squab”

 gendry scowled saddle “why tell name haven’t heard yours”

 big man laughed “a squab sword” said “now there’s something don’t often see”

 “i’m bull” said gendry taking lead arya could blame preferring bull mutton chop

 tom sevenstrings strummed harp “hot pie squab bull escaped lord bolton’s kitchen you”

 “how know” arya demanded uneasy

 “you bear sigil chest little one”

 “why not” said lem “you’re little enough”

 “i’m bigger i’m child” children didn’t kill people

 “i see squab you’re none children bolton’s”

 “we never were” hot pie never knew keep quiet “we harrenhal came that’s all”

 “so you’re lion cubs way it” said tom

 “not either we’re nobody’s men whose men you”

 anguy archer said “we’re king’s men”

 arya frowned “which king”

 “king robert” said lem yellow cloak

 “that old drunk” said gendry scornfully “he’s dead boar killed everyone knows that”

 “aye lad” said tom sevenstrings “and more’s pity” plucked sad chord harp

 arya didn’t think king’s men looked like outlaws tattered ragged didn’t even horses ride king’s men would horses

 hot pie piped eagerly “we’re looking riverrun” said “how many days’ ride know”

 arya could killed “you quiet i’ll stuff rocks big stupid mouth”

 “riverrun long way upstream” said tom “a long hungry way might you’d like hot meal set there’s inn far ahead kept friends could share ale bite bread instead fighting one another”

 “an inn” thought hot food made arya’s belly rumble didn’t trust tom everyone spoke friendly really friend “it’s near say”

 “two miles upstream” said tom “a league most”

 gendry looked uncertain felt “what mean friends” asked warily

 “friends forgotten friends are”

 “sharna innkeep’s name” tom put “she sharp tongue fierce eye i’ll grant heart’s good one she’s fond little girls”

 “i’m little girl” said angrily “who else said friends”

 “sharna’s husband orphan boy took won’t harm there’s ale think you’re old enough fresh bread maybe bit meat” tom glanced toward cottage “and whatever stole old pate’s garden besides”

 “we never stole” said arya

 “are old pate’s daughter sister wife tell lies squab buried old pate right willow hiding don’t look” drew sad sound harp “we’ve buried many good man past year we’ve wish bury swear harp archer show her”

 archer’s hand moved quicker arya would believed shaft went hissing past head within inch ear buried trunk willow behind bowman second arrow notched drawn she’d thought understood syrio meant quick snake smooth summer silk knew hadn’t arrow thrummed behind like bee “you missed” said

 “more fool think so” said anguy “they go send them”

 “that do” agreed lem lemoncloak

 dozen steps archer point sword chance arya realized wishing bow like skill use glumly lowered heavy longsword till point touched ground “we’ll come see inn” conceded trying hide doubt heart behind bold words “you walk front we’ll ride behind see you’re doing”

 tom sevenstrings bowed deeply said “before behind makes matter come along lads let’s show way anguy best pull arrows won’t needing here”

 arya sheathed sword crossed road friends sat horses keeping distance three strangers “hot pie get cabbages” said vaulted saddle “and carrots too”

 “we sing real songs marches” anguy said mildly

 “singing stupid” said arya “singing makes noise heard long way could killed you”

 tom’s smile said think “there worse things dying song lips”

 “if wolves hereabouts we’d know it” groused lem “or lions woods”

 “you never knew there” said gendry

 “now lad shouldn’t certain that” said tom “sometimes man knows says”

 hot pie shifted seat “i know song bear” said “some anyhow”

 tom ran fingers strings “then let’s hear pie boy” threw back head sang “a bear bear bear black brown covered hair…”

 hot pie joined lustily even bouncing saddle little rhymes arya stared astonishment good voice sang well never anything well except bake thought

 “you put sail” said “and wind pushes it”

 “what wind blowing wrong way”

 “then there’s oars row”

 “against current” gendry frowned “wouldn’t slow boat tips fall water it’s boat anyway it’s inn’s”

 “we shot duck” lem held like peace banner

 woman snatched hand “anguy shot duck you’re meaning get boots deaf stupid” turned away “husband” called loudly “get lads back husband”

 cellar steps came man stained apron grumbling head shorter woman lumpy face loose yellowish skin still showed marks pox “i’m woman quit bellowing now”

 “hang this” said handing duck

 anguy shuffled feet “we thinking might eat sharna lemons some”

 “lemons would get lemons look like dorne freckled fool don’t hop back lemon trees pick us bushel nice olives pomegranates too” shook finger “now suppose could cook lem’s cloak like till it’s hung days you’ll eat rabbit won’t eat roast rabbit spit would quickest you’ve got hunger might you’d like stewed ale onions”

 noted catelyn ser desmond amidst tumult elbowed fellows slowly hush grew around held head high ignored eyes let think robb’s judgment matters

 sight ser brynden tully’s craggy face dais gave comfort boy know seemed acting robb’s squire behind stood young knight sandcolored surcoat blazoned seashells older one wore three black pepperpots saffron bend across field green silver stripes handsome older lady pretty maid looked daughter another girl well near sansa’s age seashells sigil lesser house catelyn knew older man’s recognize prisoners would robb bring captives onto dais

 utherydes wayn banged staff floor ser desmond escorted forward robb looks edmure know seemed anger saw son’s eyes something else… apprehension perhaps made sense fear young wolf king trident north

 uncle first greet black fish ever ser brynden care others might think leapt dais pulled catelyn arms said “it good see home cat” struggle keep composure “and you” whispered

 “mother”

 catelyn looked tall kingly son “your grace prayed safe return heard wounded”

 “i took arrow arm storming crag” said “it’s healed well though best care”

 “the gods good then” catelyn took deep breath say cannot avoided “they told tell reasons”

 “for girls”

 “i five children three”

 “aye lady” lord rickard karstark pushed past greatjon like grim specter black mail long ragged grey beard narrow face pinched cold “and one son three robbed vengeance”

 catelyn faced calmly “lord rickard kingslayer’s dying would bought life children living may buy life mine”

 lord unappeased “jaime lannister played fool you’ve bought bag empty words torrhen eddard deserved better you”

 “leave karstark” rumbled greatjon crossing huge arms chest “it mother’s folly women made way”

 “a mother’s folly” lord karstark rounded lord umber “i name treason”

 “enough” instant robb sounded like brandon father “no man calls lady winterfell traitor hearing lord rickard” turned catelyn voice softened “if could wish kingslayer back chains would freed without knowledge consent… know love arya sansa grief bran rickon love’s always wise i’ve learned lead us great folly follow hearts… wherever take us don’t mother”

 “if heart led folly would gladly make whatever amends lord karstark yourself”

 lord rickard’s face implacable “will amends warm torrhen eddard cold graves kingslayer laid them” shouldered greatjon maege mormont left hall

 robb made move detain “forgive mother”

 “if forgive me”

 “i know love greatly think nothing else”

 catelyn bowed head “thank you” lost child least

 “we must talk” robb went “you uncles and… things steward call end”

 utherydes wayn slammed staff floor shouted dismissal river lords northerners alike moved toward doors catelyn realized amiss wolf wolf grey wind knew direwolf returned robb heard dogs hall son’s side belonged

 could think question robb however found surrounded circle wellwishers lady mormont took hand said “my lady cersei lannister held two daughters would done same” greatjon respecter proprieties lifted feet squeezed arms huge hairy hands “your wolf pup mauled kingslayer he’ll need be” galbart glover lord jason mallister cooler jonos bracken almost icy words courteous enough brother last approach “i pray girls well cat hope doubt “

 “of course not” kissed “i love it”

 words done great hall riverrun empty save robb three tullys six strangers catelyn could place eyed curiously “my lady sers new son’s cause”

 “new” said younger knight seashells “but fierce courage firm loyalties hope prove lady”

 robb looked uncomfortable “mother” said “may present lady sybell wife lord gawen westerling crag” older woman came forward solemn mien “her husband one took captive whispering wood”

 westerling yes catelyn thought banner six seashells white sand minor house sworn lannisters

 robb beckoned strangers forward turn “ser rolph spicer lady sybell’s brother castellan crag took it” pepperpot knight inclined head squarebuilt man broken nose closecropped grey beard looked doughty enough “the children lord gawen lady sybell ser raynald westerling” seashell knight smiled beneath bushy mustache young lean roughhewn good teeth thick mop chestnut hair “elenya” little girl quick curtsy “rollam westerling squire” boy started kneel saw one else kneeling bowed instead

 “the honor mine” catelyn said robb crag’s allegiance wonder westerlings casterly rock suffer betrayals gently since tywin lannister old enough go war…

 maid came forward last shy robb took hand “mother” said “i great honor present lady jeyne westerling lord gawen’s elder daughter my… ah… lady wife”

 first thought flew across catelyn’s mind cannot child

 second besides pledged another

 third mother mercy robb done

 came belated remembrance follies done love bagged neat hare snare seem already forgiven mixed annoyance rueful admiration scene staged cunning worthy master mummer… king catelyn saw choice take jeyne westerling’s hands “i new daughter” said stiffly she’d intended kissed terrified girl cheeks “be welcome hall hearth”

 “thank lady shall good true wife robb swear wise queen can”

 queen yes pretty little girl queen must remember pretty undeniably chestnut curls heartshaped face shy smile slender good hips catelyn noted trouble bearing children least

 lady sybell took hand said “we honored joined house stark lady also weary come long way short time perhaps might retire chambers may visit son”

 “that would best” robb kissed jeyne “the steward find suitable accommodations”

 “i’ll take him” ser edmure tully volunteered

 “you kind” said lady sybell

 “must go too” asked boy rollam “i’m squire”

 robb laughed “but i’m need squiring now”

 “oh”

 “his grace gotten along sixteen years without rollam” said ser raynald seashells “he survive hours think” taking little brother firmly hand walked hall

 “your wife lovely” catelyn said earshot “and westerlings seem worthy… though lord gawen tywin lannister’s sworn man not”

 “yes jason mallister captured whispering wood holding seagard ransom course i’ll free though may wish join wed without consent fear marriage puts dire peril crag strong love jeyne may lose all”

 “and you” said softly “have lost freys”

 wince told understood angry voices perwyn frey martyn rivers left haste trampling robb’s banner ground went

 “dare ask many swords come bride robb”

 “fifty dozen knights” voice glum well might marriage contract made twins old lord walder frey sent robb thousand mounted knights near three thousand foot “jeyne bright well beautiful kind well gentle heart”

 swords need gentle hearts could robb could heedless stupid could so… very… young reproaches would serve however said “tell came be”

 “i took castle took heart’ robb smiled “the crag weakly garrisoned took storm one night black walder smalljon led scaling parties walls broke main gate ram took arrow arm ser rolph yielded us castle seemed nothing first festered jeyne taken bed nursed fever passed greatjon brought news of… winterfell bran rickon” seemed trouble saying brothers’ names “that night she… comforted mother”

 catelyn need told sort comfort jeyne westerling offered son “and wed next day”

 looked eyes proud miserable “it honorable thing she’s gentle sweet mother make good wife”

 “perhaps appease lord frey”

 “i know” son said stricken “i’ve made botch everything battles haven’t thought battles would hard part but… listened kept theon hostage i’d still rule north bran rickon would alive safe winterfell”

 “perhaps lord balon might still chanced war last time reached crown cost two sons might thought bargain lose one time” touched arm “what happened freys wed”

 robb shook head “with ser stevron might able make amends ser ryman dullwitted stone black walder… one named color beard promise went far say sisters would loath wed widower would killed jeyne begged merciful”

 “you done house frey grievous insult robb”

 “i never meant ser stevron died olyvar loyal squire king could want asked stay ser ryman took rest strength greatjon urged attack them…”

 “fighting midst enemies” said “it would end you”

 “yes thought perhaps could arrange matches lord walder’s daughters ser wendel manderly offered take one greatjon tells uncles wish wed lord walder reasonable—”

 “he reasonable” said catelyn “he proud prickly fault know wanted grandfather king appease offer two hoary old brigands second son fattest man seven kingdoms broken oath you’ve slighted honor twins choosing bride lesser house”

 robb bristled “the westerlings better blood freys they’re ancient line descended first men kings rock sometimes wed westerlings conquest another jeyne westerling queen king maegor three hundred years ago”

 “all salt lord walder’s wounds always rankled older houses look freys upstarts insult first he’s borne hear tell jon arryn disinclined foster grandsons father refused offer one daughters edmure” inclined head toward brother rejoined

 “your grace” brynden blackflsh said “perhaps best continue private”

 “yes” robb sounded tired “i would kill cup wine audience chamber think”

 started steps catelyn asked question troubling since entered hall “robb grey wind”

 “in yard haunch mutton told kennelmaster see fed”

 “you always kept before”

 “a hall place wolf gets restless you’ve seen growling snapping never taken battle he’s killed many men fear jeyne’s anxious around terrifies mother”

 there’s heart catelyn thought “he part robb fear fear you”

 “i wolf matter call me” robb sounded cross “grey wind killed man crag another ashemark six seven oxcross seen—”

 “i saw bran’s wolf tear man’s throat winterfell” said sharply “and loved it”

 “that’s different man crag knight jeyne known life can’t blame afraid grey wind doesn’t like uncle either bares teeth every time ser rolph comes near him”

 chill went “send ser rolph away once”

 “where back crag lannisters mount head spike jeyne loves he’s uncle fair knight besides need men like rolph spicer fewer going banish wolf doesn’t seem like way smells”

 “robb” stopped held arm “i told keep theon greyjoy close listen listen send man away saying must banish find task requires man courage honorable duty matters not… keep near you”

 frowned “should grey wind sniff knights might others whose smell mislikes”

 “any man grey wind mislikes man want close wolves wolves robb must know think perhaps gods sent us father’s gods old gods north five wolf pups robb five five stark children”

 “six” said robb “there wolf jon well found remember know many came used think wolves guardians protectors until…”

 “until” prompted

 robb’s mouth tightened “…until told theon murdered bran rickon small good wolves longer boy mother i’m king protect myself” sighed “i find duty ser rolph pretext send away smell ease mind suffered enough”

 relieved catelyn kissed lightly cheek others could come around turn stair moment boy king

 lord hoster’s private audience chamber small room great hall better suited intimate discussions robb took high seat removed crown set floor beside catelyn rang wine edmure filling uncle’s ear whole story fight stone mill servants come gone blackfish cleared throat said “i think we’ve heard sufficient boasting nephew”

 edmure taken aback “boasting mean”

 “i mean” said blackfish “that owe grace thanks forbearance played mummer’s farce great hall shame people would flayed stupidity rather praising folly fords”

 “good men died defend fords uncle” edmure sounded outraged “what one win victories young wolf steal glory meant robb”

 “your grace” robb corrected icy “you took king uncle forgotten well”

 blackfish said “you commanded hold riverrun edmure more”

 “i held riverrun bloodied lord tywin’s nose—”

 “so did” said robb “but bloody nose won’t win war ever think ask remained west long oxcross knew enough men threaten lannisport casterly rock”

 “why… castles… gold cattle…”

 “you think stayed plunder” robb incredulous “uncle wanted lord tywin come west”

 “we horsed” ser brynden said “the lannister host mainly foot planned run lord tywin merry chase coast slip behind take strong defensive position athwart gold road place scouts found ground would greatly favor come us would paid grievous price attack would trapped west thousand leagues needed would lived land instead living ours”

 “lord stannis fall upon king’s landing” robb said “he might rid us joffrey queen imp one red stroke might able make peace”

 edmure looked uncle nephew “you never told me”

 “i told hold riverrun” said robb “what part command fail comprehend”

 “when stopped lord tywin red fork” said blackfish “you delayed long enough riders bitterbridge reach word happening east lord tywin turned host joined matthis rowan randyll tarly near headwaters blackwater made forced march tumbler’s falls found mace tyrell two sons waiting huge host fleet barges floated river disembarked half day’s ride city took stannis rear”

 catelyn remembered king renly’s court seen bitterbridge thousand golden roses streaming wind queen margaery’s shy smile soft words brother knight flowers bloody linen around temples fall woman’s arms son couldn’t margaery tyrell’s wealth power highgarden could made difference fighting yet come perhaps grey wind would liked smell well

 edmure looked ill “i never meant… never robb must let make amends lead van next battle”

 amends brother glory catelyn wondered

 “the next battle” robb said “well soon enough joffrey wed lannisters take fleld don’t doubt time tyrells march beside may need fight freys well black walder way…”

 “so long theon greyjoy sits father’s seat brothers’ blood hands foes must wait” catelyn told son “your first duty defend people win back winterfell hang theon crow’s cage die slowly else put crown good robb men know true king all”

 way robb looked could tell long since anyone dared speak bluntly “when told winterfell fallen wanted go north once” said hint defensiveness “i wanted free bran rickon thought… never dreamed theon could harm truly had…”

 “it late ifs late rescues” catelyn said “all remains vengeance”

 “the last word north ser rodrik defeated force ironmen near torrhen’s square assembling host castle cerwyn retake winterfell” said robb “by may done news long trident turn north can’t ask river lords abandon people”

 “no” said catelyn “leave guard win back north northmen”

 “how get northmen north” brother edmure asked “the ironmen control sunset sea greyjoys hold moat cailin well army ever taken moat cailin south even march madness could trapped causeway ironborn us angry freys backs”

 “we must win back freys” said robb “with still chance success however small without see hope willing give lord walder whatever requires… apologies honors lands gold… must something would soothe pride…”

 “not something” said catelyn “someone”

 “big enough you” snowflakes speckled tormund’s broad face melting hair beard

 ‘the giants swayed slowly atop mammoths rode past two two jon’s garron shied frightened strangeness whether mammoths riders scared hard say even ghost backed step baring teeth silent snarl direwolf big mammoths deal bigger many

 jon took horse hand held still could count giants emerging blowing snow pale mists swirled along milkwater well beyond fifty tormund said something lost count must hundreds matter many went past seemed keep coming

 old nan’s stories giants outsized men lived colossal castles fought huge swords walked boots boy could hide something else bearlike human wooly mammoths rode seated hard say big truly ten feet tall maybe twelve jon thought maybe fourteen taller sloping chests might passed men arms hung far lower torsos looked half wide upper legs shorter arms thick wore boots feet broad splayed things hard horny black neckless huge heavy heads thrust forward shoulder blades faces squashed brutal rats’ eyes larger beads almost lost within folds horny flesh snuffled constantly smelling much saw

 men small never stand tall

 whilst giants still walk light

 oooooooh last giants

 gone singing fade

 silence shall last long long





 tears ygritte’s cheeks song ended

 “why weeping” jon asked “it song hundreds giants i’ve seen them”

 “oh hundreds” said furiously “you know nothing jon snow you—jon”

 jon turned sudden sound wings bluegrey feathers filled eyes sharp talons buried face red pain lanced sudden fierce pinions beat round head saw beak time get hand reach weapon jon reeled backward foot lost stirrup garron broke panic falling still eagle clung face talons tearing flapped shrieked pecked world turned upside chaos feathers horseflesh blood ground came smash

 “be gone” bones rattleshirt’s breastplate clattered together “i sent crowcomedown none other”

 “a free woman rides will” ygritte said

 wind blowing snow jon’s eyes could feel blood freezing face “are talking riding”

 “riding” said lord bones

 grim gallop rode two miles column swirling snows cut tangle baggage wayns splash across milkwater took great loop toward east crust thin ice covered river shallows every step horses’ hooves crashed reached deeper water ten yards snow seemed falling even faster eastern bank drifts deeper even wind colder night falling

 even blowing snow shape great white hill loomed trees unmistakable fist first men jon heard scream eagle overhead raven looked soldier pine quorked went past old bear made attack instead clash steel thrum arrows taking flight jon heard soft crunch frozen crust beneath garron’s hooves

 silence circled round south slope approach easiest bottom jon saw dead horse sprawled base hill half buried snow entrails spilled belly animal like frozen snakes one legs gone wolves jon’s first thought wrong wolves eat kill

 garrons strewn across slope legs twisted grotesquely blind eyes staring death wildlings crawled like flies stripping saddles bridles packs armor hacking apart stone axes

 “up” rattleshirt told jon “mance top”

 outside ringwall dismounted squeeze crooked gap stones carcass shaggy brown garron impaled upon sharpened stakes old bear placed inside every entrance trying get sign rider

 ygritte said “orell tried take eye out”

 “it asked lost tongue perhaps spare us lies”

 styr magnar drew long knife “the boy might see clear one eye instead two”

 “would like keep eye jon” asked kingbeyondthewall “if tell many try speak truth time bastard winterfell”

 jon’s throat dry “my lord… what…”

 “i lord” said mance “and plain enough brothers died question many”

 jon’s face throbbing snow kept coming hard think must balk whatever asked qhorin told words stuck throat made say “there three hundred us”

 “us” mance said sharply

 “them three hundred them” whatever asked halfhand said feel craven “two hundred castle black one hundred shadow tower”

 “there’s truer song one sang tent” mance looked harma dogshead “how many horses found”

 “more’n hundred” huge woman replied “less two there’s dead east snow hard t’ know many” behind stood banner bearer holding pole dog’s head fresh enough still leaking blood

 “you never lied jon snow” said mance

 “i… know that” could say

 wildling king studied face “who command tell true rykker smallwood wythers he’s feeble whose tent this”

 said much “you find body”

 harma snorted disdain frosting nostrils “what fools black crows be”

 “the next time answer question give lord bones” mance rayder promised jon stepped closer “who led here”

 one step thought jon another foot moved hand closer longclaw’s hilt hold tongue…

 “reach bastard sword i’ll bastard head clears scabbard” said mance “i fast losing patience crow”

 “say it” ygritte urged “he’s dead whoever was”

 frown cracked blood cheek hard jon thought despair play turncloak without becoming one qhorin told second step always easier first “the old bear”

 “that old man” harma’s tone said believe “he came commands castle black”

 “bowen marsh” time jon answered must balk whatever asked

 sansa


 “a new gown” said wary astonished

 “more lovely worn lady” old woman promised measured sansa’s hips length knotted string “all silk myrish lace satin linings beautiful queen commanded it”

 “which queen” margaery yet joff’s queen renly’s mean queen thorns or…

 “the queen regent sure”

 “queen cersei”

 “none honored custom many year” old woman laid string along inside sansa’s leg “her grace said woman dress like little girl hold arm”

 sansa lifted arm needed new gown true grown three inches past year old wardrobe ruined smoke she’d tried burn mattress day first flowering

 “your bosom lovely queen’s” old woman said looped string around sansa’s chest “you hide so”

 comment made blush yet last time she’d gone riding could lace jerkin way top stableboy gaped helped mount sometimes caught grown men looking chest well tunics tight could scarce breathe

 “what color be” asked seamstress

 “leave colors lady pleased know shall smallclothes hose well kirtles mantles cloaks else befitting a… lovely young lady noble birth”

 “will ready time king’s wedding”

 “oh sooner much sooner grace insists six seamstresses twelve apprentice girls set work aside many ladies cross us queen’s command”

 “thank grace kindly thoughtfulness” sansa said politely “she good me”

 “her grace generous” seamstress agreed gathered things took leave

 sansa wondered alone made uneasy i’ll wager gown margaery’s somehow grandmother’s

 margaery’s kindness unfailing presence changed everything ladies welcomed sansa well long since enjoyed company women almost forgotten pleasant could lady leonette gave lessons high harp lady janna shared choice gossip merry crane always amusing story little lady bulwer reminded arya though fierce

 closest sansa’s age cousins elinor alla megga tyrells junior branches house “roses lower bush” quipped elinor witty willowy megga round loud alla shy pretty elinor ruled three right womanhood maiden flowered whereas megga alla mere girls

 cousins took sansa company known lives spent long afternoons needlework talking lemon cakes honeyed wine played tiles evening sang together castle sept… often one two would chosen share margaery’s bed would whisper half night away alla lovely voice coaxed would play woodharp sing songs chivalry lost loves megga couldn’t sing mad kissed alla played kissing game sometimes confessed wasn’t kissing man much less king sansa wondered megga would think kissing hound he’d come night battle stinking wine blood kissed threatened kill made sing song

 “king joffrey beautiful lips” megga gushed oblivious “oh poor sansa heart must broken lost oh must wept”

 joffrey made weep often know wanted say butterbumps hand drown voice pressed lips together held tongue

 elinor promised young squire son lord ambrose would wed soon spurs worn favor battle blackwater he’d slain myrish crossbowman mullendore manatarms “alyn said favor made fearless” said megga “he says shouted name battle cry isn’t ever gallant someday want champion wear favor kill hundred men” elinor told hush looked pleased

 children sansa thought silly little girls even elinor they’ve never seen battle they’ve never seen man die know nothing dreams full songs stories way joffrey cut father’s head sansa pitied sansa envied

 margaery different though sweet gentle yet little grandmother day last she’d taken sansa hawking first time outside city since battle dead burned buried mud gate scarred splintered lord stannis’s rams battered hulls smashed ships could seen along sides blackwater charred masts poking shallows like gaunt black fingers traffic flatbottomed ferry took across river reached kingswood found wilderness ash charcoal dead trees waterfowl teemed marshes along bay sansa’s merlin brought three ducks margaery’s peregrine took heron full flight

 “willas best birds seven kingdoms” margaery said two briefly alone “he flies eagle sometimes see sansa” took hand gave squeeze “sister”

 sister sansa dreamt sister like margaery beautiful gentle world’s graces command arya entirely unsatisfactory sisters went let sister marry joffrey thought suddenly eyes full tears “margaery please” said “you mustn’t” hard get words “you mustn’t marry he’s like seems he’s he’ll hurt you”

 “i shouldn’t think so” margaery smiled confidently “it’s brave warn need fear joff’s spoiled vain don’t doubt he’s cruel say father forced name loras kingsguard would agree match shall finest knight seven kingdoms protecting night day prince aemon protected naerys little lion best behave hadn’t he” laughed said “come sweet sister let’s race back river drive guards quite mad” without waiting answer put heels horse flew

 brave sansa thought galloping her… yet doubts still gnawed ser loras great knight agreed joffrey kingsguard gold cloaks red cloaks besides older would command armies aegon unworthy never harmed queen naerys perhaps fear brother dragonknight… another kingsguard fell love one mistresses king taken heads

 ser loras tyrell sansa reminded knight toyne brothers armies way avenge swords yet thought wondered joff might restrain turns perhaps long year soon late show claws does… realm might second kingslayer would war inside city men lion men rose made gutters run red

 sansa surprised margaery see older must wiser father lord tyrell knows surely silly

 told ser dontos going highgarden marry willas tyrell thought would relieved pleased instead grabbed arm said “you cannot” voice thick horror wine “i tell tyrells lannisters flowers beg forget folly give florian kiss promise you’ll go ahead planned night joffrey’s wedding that’s long wear silver hair net told afterward make escape” tried plant kiss cheek

 sansa slipped grasp stepped away “i won’t can’t something would go wrong wanted escape wouldn’t take don’t need to”

 dontos stared stupidly “but arrangements made sweetling ship take home boat take ship florian sweet jonquil”

 “i sorry trouble put to” said “but need boats ships now”

 “but it’s see safe”

 “i safe highgarden willas keep safe”

 “but know you” dontos insisted “and love jonquil jonquil open sweet eyes tyrells care nothing it’s claim mean wed”

 “my claim” lost moment

 “sweetling” told “you heir winterfell” grabbed pleading must thing sansa wrenched free left swaying beneath heart tree visited godswood since

 forgotten words either heir winterfell would think lay abed night it’s claim mean wed sansa grown three brothers never thought claim bran rickon dead… doesn’t matter there’s still robb he’s man grown soon he’ll wed son anyway willas tyrell highgarden would want winterfell

 arya


 rains came went grey sky blue streams running high morning third day arya noticed moss growing mostly wrong side trees “we’re going wrong way” said gendry rode past especially mossy elm “we’re going south see moss growing trunk”

 pushed thick black hair eyes said “we’re following road that’s road goes south here”

 we’ve going south day wanted tell yesterday riding along streambed hadn’t paying close attention yesterday couldn’t certain “i think we’re lost” said low voice “we shouldn’t left river follow it”

 “the river bends loops” said gendry “this shorter way bet secret outlaw way lem tom living years”

 true arya bit lip “but moss…”

 “the way it’s raining we’ll moss growing ears long” gendry complained

 “only south ear” arya declared stubbornly use trying convince bull anything still true friend hot pie left

 “sharna says needs bake bread” he’d told day rode “anyhow i’m tired rain saddlesores scared time there’s ale rabbit eat bread better make you’ll see come back come back won’t war’s done” remembered added “my lady” reddening

 arya didn’t know war would ever done nodded “i’m sorry beat time” said hot pie stupid craven he’d way king’s landing she’d gotten used “i broke nose”

 “you broke lem’s too” hot pie grinned “that good”

 “lem didn’t think so” arya said glumly time go hot pie asked might kiss milady’s hand punched shoulder “don’t call you’re hot pie i’m arry”

 “i’m hot pie sharna calls boy calls boy it’s going confusing”

 missed thought would harwin made told father hullen she’d found dying stables red keep day fled “he always said he’d die stable” harwin said “but thought badtempered stallion would death pack lions” arya told yoren escape king’s landing well much happened since left stableboy she’d stabbed needle guard whose throat she’d cut get harrenhal telling harwin would almost like telling father things could bear father know

 speak jaqen h’ghar three deaths he’d owed paid iron coin he’d given arya kept tucked away beneath belt sometimes night would take remember face melted changed ran hand across “valar morghulis” would say breath “ser gregor dunsen polliver raff sweetling tickler hound ser ilyn ser meryn queen cersei king joffrey”

 six winterfell men remained twenty father sent west beric dondarrion harwin told scattered “it trap milady lord tywin sent mountain across red fork fire sword hoping draw lord father planned lord eddard come west deal gregor clegane would killed taken prisoner traded imp lady mother’s captive time kingslayer never knew lord tywin’s plan heard brother’s capture attacked father streets king’s landing”

 “i remember” said arya “he killed jory” jory always smiled wasn’t telling get underfoot

 “he killed jory” harwin agreed “and father’s leg broken horse fell lord eddard couldn’t go west sent lord beric instead twenty men twenty winterfell among others besides thoros ser raymun darry men ser gladden wylde lord named lothar mallery gregor waiting us mummer’s ford men concealed banks crossed fell upon us front rear

 “i saw mountain slay raymun darry single blow terrible took darry’s arm elbow killed horse beneath gladden wylde died lord mallery ridden drowned lions every side thought doomed rest alyn shouted commands restored order ranks still horse rallied around thoros cut way free six score we’d morning dark two score left lord beric gravely wounded thoros drew foot lance chest night poured boiling wine hole left

 “every man us certain lordship would dead daybreak thoros prayed night beside fire dawn came still alive stronger he’d fortnight could mount horse courage kept us strong told us war ended mummer’s ford begun every man who’d fallen would avenged tenfold

 “by fighting passed us mountain’s men van lord tywin’s host crossed red fork strength swept riverlands burning everything path could harry rear told we’d join king robert marched west crush lord tywin’s rebellion heard robert dead lord eddard well cersei lannister’s whelp ascended iron throne

 “that turned whole world head we’d sent king’s hand deal outlaws see outlaws lord tywin hand king wanted yield lord beric wouldn’t hear still king’s men said king’s people lions savaging could fight robert would fight every man us dead fought something queer happened every man lost two showed take place knights squires gentle birth common men—fieldhands fiddlers innkeeps servants shoemakers even two septons men sorts women children dogs…”

 “dogs” said arya

 “aye” harwin grinned “one lads keeps meanest dogs you’d ever want see”

 “i wish good mean dog” said arya wistfully “a lionkilling dog” she’d direwolf nymeria she’d thrown rocks fled keep queen killing could direwolf kill lion wondered

 rained afternoon long evening thankfully outlaws secret friends need camp open seek shelter beneath leaky bower hot pie gendry done often

 night sheltered burned abandoned village least seemed abandoned jackbelucky blew two short blasts two long ones hunting horn sorts people came crawling ruins secret cellars ale dried apples stale barley bread outlaws goose anguy brought ride supper night almost feast

 arya sucking last bit meat wing one villagers turned lem lemoncloak said “there men two days past looking kingslayer”

 lem snorted “they’d better looking riverrun deepest dungeons it’s nice damp” nose looked like squashed apple red raw swollen mood foul

 “no” another villager said “he’s escaped”

 kingslayer arya could feel hair back neck prickling held breath listen

 “could true” tom o’ sevens said

 “i’ll believe it” said oneeyed man rusty pothelm outlaws called jackbelucky though losing eye didn’t seem lucky arya “i’ve taste o’ dungeons could escape”

 villagers could shrug greenbeard stroked thick greyandgreen whiskers said “the wolves drown blood kingslayer’s loose thoros must told lord light show lannister flames”

 “there’s fine fire burning here” said anguy smiling

 greenbeard laughed cuffed archer’s ear “do look priest archer pello tyrosh peers fire cinders singe beard”

 lem cracked knuckles said “wouldn’t lord beric love capture jaime lannister though…”

 “would hang lem” one village women asked “it’d half shame hang man pretty one”

 “a trial first” said anguy “lord beric always gives trial know that” smiled “then hangs them”

 laughter around tom drew fingers across strings woodharp broke soft song

 warm dry corner gendry harwin arya listened singing time closed eyes drifted sleep dreamt home riverrun winterfell good dream though alone outside castle knees mud could see grey walls ahead tried reach gates every step seemed harder one castle faded looked like smoke granite wolves well gaunt grey shapes stalking trees around eyes shining whenever looked remembered taste blood

 next morning left road cut across fields wind gusting sending dry brown leaves swirling around hooves horses rain sun came behind cloud bright arya pull hood forward keep eyes

 reined suddenly “we going wrong way”

 gendry groaned “what moss again”

 “look sun” said “we’re going south” arya rummaged saddlebag map could show “we never left trident see” unrolled map leg looking “see there’s riverrun rivers”

 “as happens” said jackbelucky “we know riverrun every man o’ us”

 “you’re going riverrun” lem told bluntly

 almost arya thought let take horses could walked rest way remembered dream bit lip

 “ah don’t look hurt child” said tom sevenstrings “no harm come word that”

 “the word liar”

 “no one lied” said lem “we made promises it’s us say what’s done you”

 lem leader though tom greenbeard tyroshi arya turned face “take riverrun you’ll rewarded” said desperately

 “little one” greenbeard answered “a peasant may skin common squirrel pot finds gold squirrel tree takes lord wish did”

 “i’m squirrel” arya insisted

 “you are” greenbeard laughed “a little gold squirrel who’s see lightning lord whether wills he’ll know what’s done i’ll wager sends back lady mother wish”

 tom sevenstrings nodded “aye that’s like lord beric he’ll right see don’t”

 lord beric dondarrion arya remembered she’d heard harrenhal lannisters bloody mummers alike lord beric wisp o’ wood lord beric who’d killed vargo hoat ser amory lorch twice mountain rides won’t send home maybe i’ll kill “why see lord beric” asked quietly

 “we bring highborn captives” said anguy

 captive arya took breath still soul calm still water glanced outlaws horses turned horse’s head quick snake thought slammed heels courser’s flank right greenbeard jackbelucky flew caught one glimpse gendry’s startled face mare moved way open field running

 two elms rode never paused see side moss growing leapt rotten log swung wide around monstrous deadfall jagged broken branches gentle slope side slowing speeding horse’s shoes striking sparks flintstones underfoot top hill glanced back harwin pushed ahead anguy coming hard greenbeard fallen back seemed flagging

 horses lathered flagging time came beside reached grabbed bridle arya breathing hard knew fight done “you ride like northman milady” harwin said he’d drawn halt “your aunt lady lyanna father master horse remember”

 “will ride back peaceful now” harwin asked “or must tie throw across horse”

 “i’ll ride peaceful” said sullenly





 samwell


 sobbing sam took another step last one last can’t go can’t feet moved one took step another thought they’re feet they’re someone else’s someone else walking can’t

 looked could see stumbling snow shapeless things clumsy boots black seemed remember snow caked around misshapen white balls like two clubfeet made ice

 would stop snow drifts past knees crust covered lower legs like pair white greaves steps dragging lurching heavy pack carried made look like monstrous hunchback tired tired can’t go mother mercy can’t

 every fourth fifth step reach tug swordbelt lost sword fist scabbard still weighed belt two knives dragonglass dagger jon given steel one cut meat weight dragged heavy belly big round forgot tug belt slipped right tangled round ankles matter tight cinched tried belting belly came almost armpits grenn laughed sick sight dolorous edd said “i knew man wore sword chain around neck like one day stumbled hilt went nose”

 sam stumbling rocks beneath snow roots trees sometimes deep holes frozen ground black bernarr stepped one broken ankle three days past maybe four or… know long truly lord commander put bernarr horse

 sobbing sam took another step felt like falling walking falling endlessly never hitting ground falling forward forward stop hurts much i’m cold tired need sleep little sleep beside fire bite eat isn’t frozen

 stopped died knew knew left fifty fled fist maybe wandered snow wounded bled death… sometimes sam heard shouts behind rear guard awful scream heard run twenty yards thirty fast far could halffrozen feet kicking snow would running still legs stronger behind us still behind us taking us one one

 sobbing sam took another step cold long forgetting like feel warm wore three pairs hose two layers smallclothes beneath double lambswool tunic thick quilted coat padded cold steel chainmail hauberk loose surcoat triplethick cloak bone button fastened tight chins hood flopped forward forehead heavy fur mitts covered hands thin woolandleather gloves scarf wrapped snugly lower half face tightfitting fleecelined cap pull ears beneath hood still cold feet especially couldn’t even feel yesterday hurt bad could hardly bear stand let alone walk every step made want scream yesterday could remember slept since fist since horn blown unless walking could man walk sleeping sam know else forgotten

 sobbing took another step snow swirled around sometimes fell white sky sometimes black remained day night wore shoulders like second cloak piled high atop pack carried made even heavier harder bear small back hurt abominably someone shoved knife wiggling back forth every step shoulders agony weight mail would given anything take afraid anyway would needed remove cloak surcoat get cold would

 stronger… wasn’t though good wishing sam weak fat fat could hardly bear weight mail much much felt though rubbing shoulders raw despite layers cloth quilt steel skin thing could cry cried tears froze cheeks

 sobbing took another step crust broken set feet otherwise think could moved left right halfseen silent trees torches turned vague orange haloes falling snow turned head could see slipping silent wood bobbing back forth old bear’s ring fire reminded woe leaves walked seemed chasing torches ahead legs well longer stronger could never catch

 yesterday begged let one torchbearers even meant walking outside column darkness pressing close wanted fire dreamed fire fire would cold someone reminded he’d torch start he’d dropped snow snuffed fire sam didn’t remember dropping torch supposed true weak hold arm long edd reminded torch grenn couldn’t remember either fat weak useless even wits freezing took another step

 wrapped scarf nose mouth covered snot stiff feared must frozen face even breathing hard air cold hurt swallow “mother mercy” muttered hushed husky voice beneath frozen mask “mother mercy mother mercy mother mercy” prayer took another step dragging legs snow “mother mercy mother mercy mother mercy”

 mother thousand leagues south safe sisters little brother dickon keep horn hill can’t hear mother mother merciful septons agreed seven power beyond wall old gods ruled nameless gods trees wolves snows “mercy” whispered whatever might listening old gods new demons “oh mercy mercy mercy me”

 maslyn screamed mercy suddenly remembered nothing wanted remember man stumbled backward dropping sword pleading yielding even yanking thick black glove thrusting gauntlet still shrieking quarter wight lifted air throat near ripped head dead mercy left others… mustn’t think don’t think don’t remember walk walk walk

 sobbing took another step

 root beneath crust caught toe sam tripped fell heavily one knee hard bit tongue could taste blood mouth warmer anything tasted since fist end thought fallen could seem find strength rise groped tree branch clutched tight trying pull back feet stiff legs would support mail heavy fat besides weak tired

 “back feet piggy” someone growled went past sam paid mind i’ll lie snow close eyes wouldn’t bad dying couldn’t possibly colder little wouldn’t able feel ache lower back terrible pain shoulders could feel feet won’t first die can’t say hundreds died fist died around died he’d seen shivering sam released grip tree eased snow cold wet knew could scarcely feel clothing stared upward pale white sky snowflakes drifted upon stomach chest eyelids snow cover like thick white blanket warm snow speak they’ll say died man night’s watch duty one say forswore i’m fat i’m weak i’m craven duty

 ravens responsibility brought along hadn’t wanted go he’d told he’d told big coward maester aemon old blind besides send sam tend ravens lord commander given orders made camp fist “you’re fighter know boy happens we’re attacked don’t go trying prove otherwise you’ll get way you’re send message don’t come running ask letter say write send one bird castle black another shadow tower” old bear pointed gloved finger right sam’s face “i don’t care you’re scared foul breeches don’t care thousand wildlings coming walls howling blood get birds swear i’ll hunt seven hells make damn sorry didn’t” mormont’s raven bobbed head croaked “sorry sorry sorry”

 sam sorry sorry hadn’t braver stronger good swords hadn’t better son father better brother dickon girls sorry die better men died fist good men true squeaking fat boys like least would old bear hunting hell though got birds right least written messages ahead time short messages simple telling attack fist first men tucked away safe parchment pouch hoping would never need send

 horns blew sam sleeping thought dreaming first opened eyes snow falling camp black brothers grabbing bows spears running toward ringwall chett one nearby maester aemon’s old steward face full boils big wen neck sam never seen much fear man’s face saw chett’s third blast came moaning trees “help get birds off” pleaded steward turned run dagger hand dogs care sam remembered probably lord commander given orders well

 fingers stiff clumsy gloves shaking fear cold found parchment pouch dug messages he’d written ravens shrieking furiously opened castle black cage one flew right face two escaped sam could catch one pecked glove drawing blood yet somehow held long enough attach little roll parchment warhorn fallen silent fist rang shouted commands clatter steel “fly” sam called tossed raven air

 birds shadow tower cage screaming fluttering madly afraid open door made anyway time caught first raven tried escape moment later clawing way falling snow bearing word attack

 duty done finished dressing clumsy frightened fingers donning cap surcoat hooded cloak buckling swordbelt buckling real tight wouldn’t fall found pack stuffed things inside spare smallclothes dry socks dragonglass arrowheads spearhead jon given old horn parchments inks quills maps he’d drawing rockhard garlic sausage he’d saving since wall tied shouldered pack onto back lord commander said wasn’t rush ringwall recalled said shouldn’t come running either sam took deep breath realized know next

 remembered turning circle lost fear growing inside always dogs barking horses trumpeting snow muffled sounds made seem far away sam could see nothing beyond three yards even torches burning along low stone wall ringed crown hill could torches gone scary think horn blew thrice long three long blasts means others white walkers wood cold shadows monsters tales made squeak tremble boy riding giant icespiders hungry blood…

 awkwardly drew sword plodded heavily snow holding dog ran past barking saw men shadow tower big bearded men longaxes eightfoot spears felt safer company followed wall saw torches still burning atop ring stones shudder relief went

 black brothers stood swords spears hand watching snow fall waiting ser mallador locke went horse wearing snowspeckled helm sam stood well back behind others looking grenn dolorous edd die let die beside friends remembered thinking men around strangers shadow tower men command ranger named blane

 “here come” heard brother say

 “notch” said blane twenty black arrows pulled many quivers notched many bowstrings

 “gods good there’s hundreds” voice said softly

 “draw” blane said “hold” sam could see want see men night’s watch stood behind torches waiting arrows pulled back ears something came dark slippery slope snow “hold” blane said “hold hold” “loose”

 arrows whispered flew

 ragged cheer went men along ringwall died quickly “they’re stopping m’lord” man said blane another shouted “more look coming trees” yet another said “gods ha’ mercy they’s crawling they’s almost they’s us” sam backing away shaking like last leaf tree wind kicks much cold fear cold night even colder snow feels almost warm feel better little rest needed maybe little i’ll strong enough walk little

 horse stepped past head shaggy grey beast snow mane hooves crusted ice sam watched come watched go another appeared falling snow man black leading saw sam path cursed led horse around wish horse thought horse could keep going could sit even sleep saddle mounts lost fist though remained carried food torches wounded sam wasn’t wounded fat weak greatest craven seven kingdoms

 coward lord randyll father always said right sam heir never worthy father sent away wall little brother dickon would inherit tarly lands castle greatsword heartsbane lords horn hill borne proudly centuries wondered whether dickon would shed tear brother died snow somewhere beyond edge world coward’s worth weeping heard father tell mother much half hundred times old bear knew

 “fire arrows” lord commander roared night fist appeared suddenly astride horse “give flame” noticed sam quaking “tarly get place ravens”

 “i… i… got messages away”

 “good” mormont’s shoulder raven echoed “good good”

 lord commander looked huge fur mail behind black iron visor eyes fierce “you’re way go back cages need send another message don’t want find first see birds ready” wait response turned horse trotted around ring shouting “fire give fire”

 sam need told twice went back birds fast fat legs could carry write message ahead time thought get birds away fast need took longer light little fire warm frozen ink sat beside rock quill parchment wrote messages

 attacked amidst snow cold we’ve thrown back fire arrows wrote heard thoren smallwood’s voice ring command “notch draw… loose” flight arrows made sound sweet mother’s prayer “burn dead bastards burn” dywen sang cackling brothers cheered cursed safe wrote remain fist first men sam hoped better archers

 put note aside found another blank parchment still fighting fist amidst heavy snow wrote someone shouted “they’re still coming” result uncertain “spears” someone said might ser mallador sam could swear wights attacked us fist snow wrote drove fire turned head drifting snow could see huge fire center camp mounted men moving restlessly around reserve knew ready ride anything breached ringwall armed torches place swords lighting flames

 wights around us wrote heard shouts north face coming north south spears swords don’t stop fire “loose loose loose” voice screamed night another shouted “bloody huge” third voice said “a giant” fourth insisted “a bear bear” horse shrieked hounds began bay much shouting sam couldn’t make voices anymore wrote faster note note dead wildlings giant maybe bear us around heard crash steel wood could mean one thing wights ringwall fighting inside camp dozen mounted brothers pounded past toward east wall burning brands streaming flames rider’s hand lord commander mormont meeting fire we’ve we’re winning we’re holding we’re cutting way free retreating wall we’re trapped fist hard pressed

 one shadow tower men came staggering darkness fall sam’s feet crawled within foot fire died lost sam wrote battle’s lost we’re lost

 must remember fight fist didn’t want remember tried make remember mother little sister talla girl gilly craster’s keep someone shaking shoulder “get up” voice said “sam can’t go sleep get keep walking”

 wasn’t asleep remembering “go away” said words frosting cold air “i’m well want rest”

 “get up” grenn’s voice harsh husky loomed sam blacks crusty snow “there’s resting old bear said you’ll die”

 “grenn” smiled “no truly i’m good go i’ll catch i’ve rested bit longer”

 “you won’t” grenn’s thick brown beard frozen around mouth made look like old man “you’ll freeze others get sam get up”

 night left wall pyp teased grenn way sam remembered smiling saying grenn good choice ranging since stupid terrified grenn hotly denied realized saying stocky thicknecked strong—ser alliser thorne called “aurochs” way called sam “ser piggy” jon “lord snow”—but always treated sam nice enough jon though weren’t jon none would liked jon gone lost skirling pass qhorin halfhand likely dead sam would cried tears would freeze well could scarcely keep eyes open

 tall brother torch stopped beside wonderful moment sam felt warmth face “leave him” man said grenn “if can’t walk they’re done save strength grenn”

 “he’ll get up” grenn replied “he needs hand”

 man moved taking blessed warmth grenn tried pull sam feet “that hurts” complained “stop grenn you’re hurting arm stop it”

 “you’re bloody heavy” grenn jammed hands sam’s armpits gave grunt hauled upright moment let go fat boy sat back snow grenn kicked solid thump cracked crust snow around boot sent flying everywhere “get up” kicked “get walk walk”

 sam fell sideways curling tight ball protect kicks hardly felt wool leather mail even hurt thought grenn friend shouldn’t kick friends won’t let need rest that’s rest sleep maybe die little

 “if take torch take fat boy”

 suddenly jerked cold air away sweet soft snow floating arm knees another one back sam raised head blinked face loomed close broad brutal face flat nose small dark eyes thicket coarse brown beard seen face took moment remember paul small paul melting ice ran eyes heat torch “can carry him” heard grenn ask

 “i carried calf heavier carried mother could get drink milk”

 sam’s head bobbed every step small paul took “stop it” muttered “put i’m baby i’m man night’s watch” sobbed “just let die”

 “be quiet sam” said grenn “save strength think sisters brother maester aemon favorite foods sing song like”

 “aloud”

 “in head”

 sam knew hundred songs tried think one couldn’t words gone head sobbed said “i don’t know songs grenn know don’t”

 “yes do” said grenn “how ‘the bear maiden fair’ everybody knows one bear bear bear black brown covered hair”

 “no one” sam pleaded bear come fist hair left rotted flesh didn’t want think bears “no songs please grenn”

 “think ravens then”

 “they never mine” lord commander’s ravens ravens night’s watch “they belonged castle black shadow tower”

 small paul frowned “chett said could old bear’s raven one talks saved food everything” shook head “i forgot though left food hid it” plodded onward pale white breath coming mouth every step suddenly said “could one ravens one i’d never let lark eat it”

 “they’re gone” said sam “i’m sorry” sorry “they’re flying back wall now” set birds free he’d heard warhorns sound calling watch horse two short blasts long one call mount reason mount unless abandon fist meant battle lost fear bit strong sam could open cages watched last raven flap snowstorm realize forgotten send messages he’d written

 “no” he’d squealed “oh oh no” snow fell horns blew ahooo ahooo ahooooooooooooooooooo cried horse horse horse sam saw two ravens perched rock ran birds flapped lazily swirling snow opposite directions chased one breath puffing nose thick white clouds stumbled found ten feet ringwall

 that… remembered dead coming stones arrows faces throats ringmail almost naked… wildlings wore faded blacks remembered one shadow tower men shoving spear wight’s pale soft belly back thing staggered right shaft reached black hands twisted brother’s head around blood came mouth bladder let go first time almost sure

 sam found horse wasn’t horse never recalled mounting either maybe horse smashed ser ottyn’s face horns still blowing kicked horse turned toward sound

 midst carnage chaos blowing snow found dolorous edd sitting garron plain black banner spear “sam” edd said saw “would wake please terrible nightmare”

 men mounting every moment warhorns called back ahooo ahooo ahooooooooooooooooooo “they’re west wall m’lord” thoren smallwood screamed old bear fought control horse “i’ll send reserves…”

 middle flying spearhead brothers either side behind well dog ran ways bounding snowy slope among horses could keep wights stood ground ridden trampled underhoof even fell clutched swords stirrups legs passing horses sam saw one claw open garron’s belly right hand clung saddle left

 suddenly trees sam splashing frozen stream sounds slaughter dwindling behind turned breathless relief… man black leapt brush yanked saddle sam never saw instant galloping away next tried run horse feet tangled root fell hard face lay weeping like baby dolorous edd found

 last coherent memory fist first men later hours later stood shivering among survivors half mounted half afoot miles fist though sam remember dywen led five packhorses heavy laden food oil torches three made far old bear made redistribute loads loss one horse provisions would catastrophe took garrons healthy men gave wounded organized walkers set torches guard flanks rear need walk sam told took first step toward home hour gone begun struggle lag…

 “bloody fool” torch man said gone

 grenn stopped suddenly “we’re alone” said hoarse voice “i can’t see torches rear guard”

 small paul answer big man gave grunt sank knees arms trembled lay sam gently snow “i can’t carry would can’t” shivered violently

 wind sighed trees driving fine spray snow faces cold bitter sam felt naked looked torches gone every one one grenn carried flames rising like pale orange silks could see black beyond torch burn soon thought alone without food friends fire

 wrong weren’t alone

 lower branches great green sentinel shed burden snow soft wet plop grenn spun thrusting torch “who goes there” horse’s head emerged darkness sam felt moment’s relief saw horse hoarfrost covered like sheen frozen sweat nest stiff black entrails dragged open belly back rider pale ice sam made whimpery sound deep throat scared might pissed cold cold savage bladder felt frozen solid slid gracefully saddle stand upon snow swordslim milky white armor rippled shifted moved feet break crust newfallen snow

 tyrion


 lord tywin’s chain hands made golden glitter deep wine velvet tunic lords tyrell redwyne rowan gathered round entered greeted turn spoke quiet word varys kissed high septon’s ring cersei’s cheek clasped hand grand maester pycelle seated king’s place head long table daughter brother

 tyrion claimed pycelle’s old place foot propped cushions could gaze length table dispossessed pycelle moved next cersei far dwarf could get without claiming king’s seat grand maester shambling skeleton leaning heavily twisted cane shaking walked white hairs sprouting long chicken’s neck place onceluxuriant white beard tyrion gazed without remorse

 others scramble seats lord mace tyrell heavy robust man curling brown hair spadeshaped beard well salted white paxter redwyne arbor stoopshouldered thin bald head fringed tufts orange hair mathis rowan lord goldengrove cleanshaven stout sweating high septon frail man wispy white chin hair many strange faces tyrion thought many new players game changed lay rotting bed one tell rules

 oh lords courteous enough though could tell uncomfortable made look “that chain cunning” mace tyrell said jolly tone lord redwyne nodded said “quite quite lord highgarden speaks us” cheerfully

 tell people city tyrion thought bitterly tell bloody singers songs renly’s ghost

 uncle kevan warmest going far kiss cheek say “lancel told brave tyrion speaks highly you”

 he’d better i’ll things say made smile say “my good cousin kind wound healing trust”

 ser kevan frowned “one day seems stronger next… worrisome sister often visits sickbed lift spirits pray him”

 praying lives dies cersei made shameless use cousin bed little secret doubt hoped lancel would carry grave father longer need would go far murder though look today would never suspect cersei capable ruthlessness charm flirting lord tyrell spoke joffrey’s wedding feast complimenting lord redwyne valor twins softening gruff lord rowan jests smiles making pious noises high septon “shall begin wedding arrangements” asked lord tywin took seat

 “no” father said “with war varys”

 eunuch smiled silken smile “i delicious tidings lords yesterday dawn brave lord randyll caught robett glover outside duskendale trapped sea losses heavy sides end loyal men prevailed ser helman tallhart reported dead thousand others robett glover leads survivors back toward harrenhal bloody disarray little dreaming find valiant ser gregor stalwarts athwart path”

 “gods praised” said paxter redwyne “a great victory king joffrey “

 joffrey thought tyrion

 “and terrible defeat north certainly” observed littlefinger “yet one robb stark played part young wolf remains unbeaten field”

 “what know stark’s plans movements” asked mathis rowan ever blunt point

 “he run back riverrun plunder abandoning castles took west” announced lord tywin “our cousin ser daven reforming remnants late father’s army lannisport ready shall join ser forley prester golden tooth soon stark boy starts north ser forley ser daven descend riverrun”

 “you certain lord stark means go north” lord rowan asked “even ironmen moat cailin”

 mace tyrell spoke “is anything pointless king without kingdom it’s plain boy must abandon riverlands join forces roose bolton’s throw strength moat cailin would do”

 tyrion bite tongue robb stark battles year lord highgarden twenty tyrell’s reputation rested one indecisive victory robert baratheon ashford battle largely lord tarly’s van main host even arrived siege storm’s end mace tyrell actually hold command dragged year result trident fought lord highgarden meekly dipped banners eddard stark

 “i ought write robb stark stern letter” littlefinger saying “i understand man bolton stabling goats high hall it’s really quite unconscionable”

 ser kevan lannister cleared throat “as regards starks… balon greyjoy styles king isles north written us offering terms alliance”

 “he ought offering fealty” snapped cersei “by right call king”

 “by right conquest” lord tywin said “king balon strangler’s fingers round neck robb stark’s heirs dead winterfell fallen ironmen hold moat cailin deepwood motte stony shore king balon’s longships command sunset sea well placed menace lannisport fair isle even highgarden provoke him”

 “and accept alliance” inquired lord mathis rowan “what terms propose”

 “that recognize kingship grant everything north neck”

 lord redwyne laughed “what north neck sane man would want greyjoy trade swords sails stone snow say count lucky”

 “truly” agreed mace tyrell “that’s would let king balon finish northmen whilst finish stannis”

 lord tywin’s face gave hint feelings “there lysa arryn deal well jon arryn’s widow hoster tully’s daughter catelyn stark’s sister… whose husband conspiring stannis baratheon time death”

 “oh” said mace tyrell cheerfully “women stomach war let say she’s like trouble us”

 “i agree” said redwyne “the lady lysa took part fighting committed overt acts treason”

 tyrionstirred “she throw cell put trial life” pointed certain amount rancor “nor returned king’s landing swear fealty joff commanded lords grant men sort lysa arryn” could think nothing would enjoy except perhaps strangling cersei sometimes still dreamed eyrie’s sky cells woke drenched cold sweat

 mace tyrell’s smile jovial behind tyrion sensed contempt “perhaps you’d best leave fighting fighters” said lord highgarden “better men lost great armies mountains moon shattered bloody gate know worth lord need tempt fate”

 tyrion pushed cushions bristling father spoke could lash back “i tasks mind tyrion believe lord petyr may hold key eyrie”

 “oh do” said littleflnger “i legs” mischief greygreen eyes “my lords leave propose travel vale woo win lady lysa arryn consort shall deliver vale arryn without drop blood spilled”

 lord rowan looked doubtful “would lady lysa you”

 “she’s times lord mathis voiced complaints”

 “bedding” said cersei “is wedding even cow like lysa arryn might able grasp difference”

 “to sure would fitting daughter riverrun marry one far her” littlefinger spread hands “now though… match lady eyrie lord harrenhal unthinkable it”

 tyrion noted look passed paxter redwyne mace tyrell “it might serve” lord rowan said “if certain keep woman loyal king’s grace”

 “my lords” pronounced high septon “autumn upon us men good heart weary war lord baelish bring vale back king’s peace without shedding blood gods surely bless him”

 “but he” asked lord redwyne “jon arryn’s son lord eyrie lord robert”

 “only boy” said littleflnger “i see grows joffrey’s loyal subject fast friend us all”

 tyrion studied slender man pointed beard irreverent greygreen eyes lord harrenhal empty honor bugger father even never sets foot castle title makes match possible he’s known along

 “we lack foes” said ser kevan lannister “if eyrie kept war good mind see lord petyr accomplish”

 ser kevan brother’s vanguard council tyrion knew long experience never thought lord tywin first settled beforehand concluded discussion’s show

 sheep bleating agreement unaware neatly they’d shorn fell tyrion object “how crown pay debts without lord petyr wizard coin one replace him”

 littlefinger smiled “my little friend kind count coppers king robert used say clever tradesman could well… lannister blessed golden touch casterly rock doubt far surpass me”

 “a lannister” tyrion bad feeling

 lord tywin’s goldflecked eyes met son’s mismatched ones “you admirably suited task believe”

 “indeed” ser kevan said heartily “i’ve doubt you’ll make splendid master coin tyrion”

 lord tywin turned back littlefinger “if lysa arryn take husband return king’s peace shall restore lord robert honor warden east soon might leave”

 “on morrow winds permit there’s braavosi galley standing past chain taking cargo boat merling king i’ll see captain berth”

 “you miss king’s wedding” said mace tyrell

 petyr baelish gave shrug “tides brides wait man lord autumn storms begin voyage much hazardous drowning would definitely diminish charms bridegroom”

 lord tyrell chuckled “true best linger”

 “may gods speed way” high septon said “all king’s landing shall pray success”

 lord redwyne pinched nose “may return matter greyjoy alliance view much said greyjoy’s longships augment fleet give us sufficient strength sea assault dragonstone end stannis baratheon’s pretensions”

 “king balon’s longships occupied nonce” lord tywin said politely “as greyjoy demands half kingdom price alliance earn fight starks already pay given us free best thing lord pyke nothing view granted enough time better option may well present one require king give half kingdom”

 tyrion watched father closely there’s something he’s saying remembered important letters lord tywin writing night tyrion demanded casterly rock said battles swords spears others quills ravens… wondered “better option” sort price demanding

 “perhaps ought move wedding” ser kevan said

 high septon spoke preparations made great sept baelor cersei detailed plans making feast would feed thousand throne room many outside yards outer middle wards would tented silk tables food casks ale could accommodated within hall

 “your grace” said grand maester pycelle “in regard number guests… raven sunspear three hundred dornishmen riding toward king’s landing speak hope arrive wedding”

 “how come” asked mace tyrell gruffly “they asked leave cross lands” thick neck turned dark red tyrion noted dornishmen highgardeners never great love one another centuries fought border wars beyond count raided back forth across mountains marches even peace enmity waned bit dorne become part seven kingdoms… dornish prince called red viper crippled young heir highgarden tourney could ticklish dwarf thought waiting see father would handle

 “prince doran comes son’s invitation” lord tywin said calmly “not join celebration claim seat council justice robert denied murder sister elia children”

 tyrion watched faces lords tyrell redwyne rowan wondering three would bold enough say “but lord tywin wasn’t presented bodies robert wrapped lannister cloaks” none faces redwyne give fig thought rowan looks fit gag

 “when king wed margaery myrcella prince trystane shall one great house” ser kevan reminded mace tyrell “the enmities past remain would agree lord”

 “this daughter’s wedding—”

 “—and grandson’s” said lord tywin firmly “no place old quarrels surely”

 “i quarrel doran martell” insisted lord tyrell though tone little grudging “if wishes cross reach peace need ask leave”

 small chance thought tyrion he’ll climb boneway turn east near summerhall come kingsroad

 “three hundred dornishmen need trouble plans” said cersei “we feed menatarms yard squeeze extra benches throne room lordlings highborn knights find prince doran place honor dais”

 message tyrion saw mace tyrell’s eyes lord highgarden made reply curt nod

 “perhaps move pleasant task” said lord tywin “the fruits victory await division”

 “what could sweeter” said littlefinger already swallowed fruit harrenhal

 lord demands castle village tracts lands small river forest wardship certain minors left fatherless battle fortunately fruits plentiful orphans castles varys lists fortyseven lesser lordlings six hundred nineteen knights lost lives beneath fiery heart stannis lord light along several thousand common menatarms traitors heirs disinherited lands castles granted proved loyal

 highgarden reaped richest harvest tyrion eyed mace tyrell’s broad belly thought prodigious appetite one tyrell demanded lands castles lord alester florent bannerman who’d singular ill judgment back first renly stannis lord tywin pleased oblige brightwater keep lands incomes granted lord tyrell’s second son ser garlan transforming great lord blink eye elder brother course stood inherit highgarden

 lesser tracts granted lord rowan set aside lord tarly lady oakheart lord hightower worthies present lord redwyne asked thirty years’ remission taxes littlefinger wine factors levied certain arbor’s finest vintages granted pronounced well satisfied suggested send cask arbor gold toast good king joffrey wise benevolent hand cersei lost patience “it’s swords joff needs toasts” snapped “his realm still plagued wouldbe usurpers selfstyled kings”

 “but long think” said varys unctuously

 “a items remain lords” ser kevan consulted papers “ser addam found crystals high septon’s crown appears certain thieves broke crystals melted gold”

 “our father knows guilt sit judgment all” high septon said piously

 “no doubt will” said lord tywin “all must crowned king’s wedding cersei summon goldsmiths must see replacement” wait reply turned varys “you reports”

 eunuch drew parchment sleeve “a kraken seen fingers” giggled “not greyjoy mind true kraken attacked ibbenese whaler pulled fighting stepstones new war tyrosh lys seems likely hope win myr ally sailors back jade sea report threeheaded dragon hatched qarth wonder city—”

 “dragons krakens interest regardless number heads” said lord tywin “have whisperers perchance found trace brother’s son”

 “alas beloved tyrek quite vanished poor brave lad” varys sounded close tears

 “tywin” ser kevan said lord tywin could vent obvious displeasure “some gold cloaks deserted battle drifted back barracks thinking take duty ser addam wishes know them”

 “they might endangered joff cowardice” cersei said “i want put death”

 varys sighed “they surely earned death grace none deny yet perhaps might wiser send night’s watch disturbing messages wall late wildlings astir…”

 “wildlings krakens dragons” mace tyrell chuckled “why anyone stirring”

 lord tywin ignored “the deserters serve us best lesson break knees hammers run man sees begging streets” glanced table see lords disagreed

 tyrion remembered visit wall crabs he’d shared old lord mormont officers remembered old bear’s fears well “perhaps might break knees make point killed ser jacelyn say rest send marsh watch grievously strength wall fail…”

 “…the wildlings flood north” father finished “and starks greyjoys another enemy contend longer wish subject iron throne would seem right look iron throne aid king robb king balon claim north let defend mance rayder might even prove useful ally” lord tywin looked brother “is more”

 ser kevan shook head “we done lords grace king joffrey would doubt wish thank wisdom good counsel”

 “i like private words children” said lord tywin others rose leave “you well kevan”

 obediently councillors made farewells varys first depart tyrell redwyne last chamber empty four lannisters ser kevan closed door

 “master coin” said tyrion thin strained voice “whose notion pray”

 “lord petyr’s” father said “but serves us well treasury hands lannister asked important work fear might incapable task”

 “no” said tyrion “i fear trap littlefinger subtle ambitious trust you”

 “he highgarden side…” cersei began

 “…and sold ned stark know sell us quick coin dangerous sword wrong hands”

 uncle kevan looked oddly “not us surely gold casterly rock…”

 “…is dug ground littlefinger’s gold made thin air snap fingers”

 “a useful skill sweet brother” purred cersei voice sweet malice

 “littlefinger liar—”

 “—and black well said raven crow”

 lord tywin slammed hand table “enough unseemly squabbling lannisters comport such”

 ser kevan cleared throat “i would sooner petyr baelish ruling eyrie lady lysa’s suitors yohn royce lyn corbray horton redfort… dangerous men way proud littlefinger may clever neither high birth skill arms lords vale never accept liege” looked brother lord tywin nodded continued “and this—lord petyr continues demonstrate loyalty yesterday brought us word tyrell plot spirit sansa stark highgarden ‘visit’ marry lord mace’s eldest son willas”

 “littlefinger brought word” tyrion leaned table “not master whisperers interesting”

 cersei looked uncle disbelief “sansa hostage goes nowhere without leave”

 “leave must perforce grant lord tyrell ask” father pointed “to refuse would tantamount declaring trust would take offense”

 “let care”

 bloody fool thought tyrion “sweet sister” explained patiently “offend tyrell offend redwyne tarly rowan hightower well perhaps start wondering whether robb stark might accommodating desires”

 “i rose direwolf bed together” declared lord tywin “we must forestall him”

 “how” asked cersei

 “by marriage begin with”

 came suddenly cersei could stare moment cheeks reddened slapped “no not”

 “your grace” said ser kevan courteously “you young woman still fair fertile surely cannot wish spend rest days alone new marriage would put rest talk incest good all”

 “so long remain unwed allow stannis spread disgusting slander” lord tywin told daughter “you must new husband bed father children you”

 “three children quite sufficient queen seven kingdoms brood mare queen regent”

 “you daughter command”

 stood “i sit listen this—”

 “you wish voice choice next husband” lord tywin said calmly

 hesitated sat tyrion knew lost despite loud declaration “i marry again”

 “you marry breed every child birth makes stannis liar” father’s eyes seemed pin chair “mace tyrell paxter redwyne doran martell wed younger women likely outlive balon greyjoy’s wife elderly failing match would commit us alliance iron islands still uncertain whether would wisest course”

 “no” cersei said white lips “no no”

 tyrion could quite suppress grin came lips thought packing sister pyke give praying sweet god gives

 lord tywin went “oberyn martell might suit tyrells would take ill must look sons assume object wedding man younger yourself”

 “i object wedding any—”

 “i considered redwyne twins theon greyjoy quentyn martell number others alliance highgarden sword broke stannis tempered made stronger ser loras taken white ser garlan wed one fossoways remains eldest son boy scheme wed sansa stark”

 willas tyrell tyrion taking wicked pleasure cersei’s helpless fury “that would cripple” said

 father chilled look “willas heir highgarden reports mild courtly young man fond reading books looking stars passion breeding animals well owns finest hounds hawks horses seven kingdoms”

 perfect match mused tyrion cersei also passion breeding pitied poor willas tyrell know whether wanted laugh sister weep

 “the tyrell heir would choice” lord tywin concluded “but would prefer another hear reasons”

 “that kind father” cersei said icy courtesy “it difficult choice give would sooner take bed old squid crippled dog boy shall need days consider leave go”

 queen tyrion wanted tell ought begging leave

 “go” father said “we shall talk composed remember duty”

 cersei swept stiffly room rage plain see yet end father bid proved robert though jaime consider brother much younger cersei wed first time might acquiesce second marriage quite easily unfortunate willas tyrell like contract sudden fatal case swordthroughbowels could rather sour alliance highgarden casterly rock say something pardon father it’s brother wants marry

 “tyrion”

 gave resigned smile “do hear herald summoning lists”

 “your whoring weakness you” lord tywin said without preamble “but perhaps share blame mine since stand taller boy found easy forget truth man grown man’s baser needs past time wed”

 wed forgotten tyrion’s mouth twisted noise emerged half laugh half snarl

 “does prospect marriage amuse you”

 “only imagining buggerall handsome bridegroom i’ll make” wife might thing needed brought lands keep would give place world apart joffrey’s court… away cersei father

 hand shae like swears content whore

 scarcely point sway father however tyrion squirmed higher seat said “you mean wed sansa stark won’t tyrells take match affront designs girl”

 “lord tyrell broach matter stark girl joffrey’s wedding sansa wed take offense gave us hint intentions”

 “quite so” said ser kevan “and lingering resentments soothed offer cersei willas”

 tyrion rubbed raw stub nose scar tissue itched abominably sometimes “his grace royal pustule made sansa’s life misery since day father died finally rid joffrey propose marry seems singularly cruel even father”

 “why plan mistreat her” father sounded curious concerned “the girl’s happiness purpose alliances south may solid casterly rock remains north win key north sansa stark”

 “she child”

 “your sister swears she’s flowered woman fit wed must needs take maidenhead man say marriage consummated prefer wait year two bedding would within rights husband”

 shae woman need thought sansa’s girl matter say “if purpose keep tyrells return mother perhaps would convince robb stark bend knee”

 lord tywin’s look scornful “send riverrun mother match blackwood mallister shore son’s alliances along trident send north wed manderly umber moon turns yet less dangerous court business tyrells prove must marry lannister soon”

 “the man weds sansa stark claim winterfell name” uncle kevan put “had occurred you”

 “if girl shall give one cousins” said father “kevan lancel strong enough wed think”

 ser kevan hesitated “if bring girl bedside could say words… consummate no… would suggest one twins starks hold riverrun genna’s boy tion well else might serve”

 tyrion let byplay benefit knew sansa stark mused softspoken sweetsmelling sansa loved silks songs chivalry tall gallant knights handsome faces felt though back bridge boats deck shifting beneath feet

 “you asked reward efforts battle” lord tywin reminded forcefully “this chance tyrion best ever likely have” drummed fingers impatiently table “i hoped marry brother lysa tully aerys named jaime kingsguard arrangements complete suggested lord hoster lysa might wed instead replied wanted whole man daughter”

 wed jon arryn old enough grandfather tyrion inclined thankful angry considering lysa arryn become

 “when offered dorne told suggestion insult” lord tywin continued “in later years similar answers yohn royce leyton hightower finally stooped low suggest might take florent girl robert deflowered brother’s wedding bed father preferred give one household knights

 “if stark girl shall find another wife somewhere realm doubtless little lordling who’d gladly part daughter win friendship casterly rock lady tanda offered lollys…”

 tyrion gave shudder dismay “i’d sooner cut feed goats”

 “then open eyes stark girl young nubile tractable highest birth still maid uncomely would hesitate”

 indeed “a quirk mine strange say would prefer wife wants bed”

 “if think whores want bed even greater fool suspected” said lord tywin “you disappoint tyrion hoped match would please you”

 “yes know important pleasure father there’s key north say greyjoys hold north king balon daughter sansa stark her” looked father’s cool green eyes bright flecks gold

 lord tywin steepled fingers beneath chin “balon greyjoy thinks terms plunder rule let enjoy autumn crown suffer northern winter give subjects cause love come spring northmen bellyful krakens bring eddard stark’s grandson home claim birthright lords little folk alike rise one place high seat ancestors capable getting woman child hope”

 “i believe am” said bristling “i confess cannot prove though one say tried plant little seeds often can…”

 “in gutters ditches” finished lord tywin “and common ground bastard weeds take root past time kept garden” rose feet “you shall never casterly rock promise wed sansa stark possible might win winterfell”

 tyrion lannister lord protector winterfell prospect gave queer chill “very good father” said slowly “but there’s big ugly roach rushes robb stark capable presumably sworn marry one fertile freys young wolf sires litter pups sansa births heirs nothing”

 lord tywin unconcerned “robb stark father children fertile frey word bit news yet seen fit share council though doubt good lords hear soon enough young wolf taken gawen westerling’s eldest daughter wife”

 moment tyrion could believe he’d heard father right “he broke sworn word” said incredulous “he threw away freys for…” words failed

 “a maid sixteen years named jeyne” said ser kevan “lord gawen suggested willem martyn refuse gawen good man wife sybell spicer never wed westerlings always honor sense lady sybell’s grandfather trader saffron pepper almost lowborn smuggler stannis keeps grandmother woman he’d brought back east frightening old crone supposed priestess maegi called one could pronounce real name half lannisport used go cures love potions like” shrugged “she’s long dead sure jeyne seemed sweet child i’ll grant though saw doubtful blood…”

 married whore tyrion could entirely share uncle’s horror thought wedding girl whose great grandfather sold cloves even so… sweet child ser kevan said many poison sweet well westerlings old blood pride power would surprise learn lady sybell brought wealth marriage highborn husband westerling mines failed years ago best lands sold lost crag ruin stronghold romantic ruin though jutting brave sea “i surprised” tyrion confess “i thought robb stark better sense”

 “he boy sixteen” said lord tywin “at age sense weighs little lust love honor”

 “he forswore shamed ally betrayed solemn promise honor that”

 ser kevan answered “he chose girl’s honor deflowered course”

 “it would kinder leave bastard belly” said tyrion bluntly westerlings stood lose everything lands castle lives lannister always pays debts

 “jeyne westerling mother’s daughter” said lord tywin “and robb stark father’s son”

 westerling betrayal seem enraged father much tyrion would expected lord tywin suffer disloyalty vassals extinguished proud reynes castamere ancient tarbecks tarbeck hall root branch still half boy singers even made rather gloomy song years later lord farman faircastle grew truculent lord tywin sent envoy bearing lute instead letter he’d heard “the rains castamere” echoing hall lord farman gave trouble song enough shattered castles reynes tarbecks still stood mute testimony fate awaited chose scorn power casterly rock “the crag far tarbeck hall castamere” tyrion pointed “you’d think westerlings might ridden past seen lesson there”

 “mayhaps have” lord tywin said “they well aware castamere promise you”

 “could westerlings spicers great fools believe wolf defeat lion”

 every long lord tywin lannister would actually threaten smile never threat alone terrible behold “the greatest fools ofttimes clever men laugh them” said “you marry sansa stark tyrion soon”





 catelyn


 carried corpses upon shoulders laid beneath dais silence fell across torchlit hall quiet catelyn could hear grey wind howling half castle away smells blood thought stone walls wooden doors night rain still knows scent death ruin

 stood robb’s left hand beside high seat moment felt almost looking dead bran rickon boys much older death shrunken naked wet seemed little things still hard remember living

 blond boy trying grow beard pale yellow peach fuzz covered cheeks jaw red ruin knife made throat long golden hair still wet pulled bath look died peacefully perhaps sleep brownhaired cousin fought life arms bore slashes he’d tried block blades red still trickled slowly stab wounds covered chest belly back like many tongueless mouths though rain washed almost clean

 robb donned crown coming hall bronze shone darkly torchlight shadows hid eyes looked upon dead see bran rickon well might wept tears left dead boys pale long imprisonment fair smooth white skin blood shockingly red unbearable look upon lay sansa naked beneath iron throne killed skin seem white blood red outside came steady wash rain restless howling wolf

 brother edmure stood robb’s right one hand upon back father’s seat face still puffy sleep woken pounding door black night yank rudely dreams good dreams brother dream sunlight laughter maiden’s kisses pray dreams dark laced terrors

 robb’s captains lords bannermen stood hall mailed armed others various states dishevelment undress ser raynald uncle ser rolph among robb seen fit spare queen ugliness crag far casterly rock catelyn recalled leyne may well played boys children

 looked upon corpses squires tion frey willem lannister waited son speak

 seemed long time robb lifted eyes bloody dead “smalljon” said “tell father bring in” wordless smalljon umber turned obey steps echoing great stone hall

 greatjon marched prisoners doors catelyn made note men stepped back give room treason could somehow passed touch glance cough captors captives looked much alike big men every one thick beards long hair two greatjon’s men wounded three prisoners fact spears others empty scabbards served set apart clad mail hauberks shirts sewn rings heavy boots thick cloaks wool fur north hard cold mercy ned told first came winterfell thousand years ago

 “five” said robb prisoners stood wet silent “is them”

 “there eight” rumbled greatjon “we killed two taking third dying now”

 robb studied faces captives “it required eight kill two unarmed squires”

 edmure tully spoke “they murdered two men well get tower delp elwood”

 “it murder ser” said lord rickard karstark discomfited ropes wrists blood trickled face “any man steps father vengeance asks death”

 words rang catelyn’s ears harsh cruel pounding war drum throat dry bone two boys died daughters might live

 “i saw sons die night whispering wood” robb told lord karstark “tion frey kill torrhen willem lannister slay eddard call vengeance folly bloody murder sons died honorably battlefield swords hands”

 “they died” said rickard karstark yielding inch ground “the kingslayer cut two ilk blood pay blood”

 “the blood children” robb pointed corpses “how old twelve thirteen squires”

 “squires die every battle”

 “die fighting yes tion frey willem lannister gave swords whispering wood captives locked cell asleep unarmed… boys look them”

 lord karstark looked instead catelyn “tell mother look them” said “she slew much l”

 catelyn put hand back robb’s seat hall seemed spin felt though might retch

 “my mother naught this” robb said angrily “this work murder treason”

 “how treason kill lannisters treason free them” asked karstark harshly “has grace forgotten war casterly rock war kill enemies didn’t father teach boy”

 “boy” greatjon dealt rickard karstark buffet mailed fist sent lord knees

 “leave him” robb’s voice rang command umber stepped back away captive

 lord karstark spit broken tooth “yes lord umber leave king means give scolding forgives that’s deals treason king north” smiled wet red smile “or call king lost north grace”

 greatjon snatched spear man beside jerked shoulder “let spit sire let open belly see color guts”

 doors hall crashed open blackfish entered water running cloak helm tully menatarms followed outside lightning cracked across sky hard black rain pounded stones riverrun ser brynden removed helm went one knee “your grace” said grimness tone spoke volumes

 “i hear ser brynden privily audience chamber” robb rose feet “greatjon keep lord karstark till return hang seven”

 greatjon lowered spear “even dead ones”

 “yes fouling lord uncle’s rivers let feed crows”

 one captives dropped knees “mercy sire killed one stood door watch guards”

 robb considered moment “did know lord rickard intended see knives drawn hear shouts screams cries mercy”

 “aye took part watcher swear it…”

 “lord umber” said robb “this one watcher hang last may watch others die mother uncle please” turned away greatjon’s men closed upon prisoners drove hall spearpoint outside thunder crashed boomed loud sounded castle coming ears sound kingdom falling catelyn wondered

 dark within audience chamber least sound thunder muffled another thickness wall servant entered oil lamp light fire robb sent away kept lamp tables chairs edmure sat rose realized others remainded standing robb took crown placed table

 blackfish shut door “the karstarks gone”

 “all” anger despair thickened robb’s voice like even catelyn certain

 “all fighting men” ser brynden replied “a camp followers serving men left wounded questioned many needed certain truth started leaving nightfall stealing ones twos first larger groups wounded men servants told keep campfires lit one would know they’d gone rains began didn’t matter”

 “will reform away riverrun” asked robb

 “no they’ve scattered hunting lord karstark sworn give hand maiden daughter man highborn low brings head kingslayer”

 gods good catelyn felt ill

 “near three hundred riders twice many mounts melted away night” robb rubbed temples crown left mark soft skin ears “all mounted strength karhold lost”

 lost may gods forgive catelyn need soldier grasp trap robb moment held riverlands kingdom surrounded enemies every side east lysa sat aloof mountaintop even trident scarce secure long lord crossing withheld allegiance lose karstarks well…

 “no word must leave riverrun” brother edmure said “lord tywin would… lannisters pay debts always saying mother mercy hears”

 sansa catelyn’s nails dug soft flesh palms hard close hand

 robb gave edmure look chilled “would make liar well murderer uncle”

 “we need speak falsehood say nothing bury boys hold tongues till war’s done willem son ser kevan lannister lord tywin’s nephew tion lady genna’s frey must keep news twins well until…”

 “until bring murdered dead back life” said brynden blackfish sharply “the truth escaped karstarks edmure late games”

 “i owe fathers truth” said robb “and justice owe well” gazed crown dark gleam bronze circle iron swords “lord rickard defied betrayed choice condemn gods know karstark foot roose bolton hear i’ve executed liege traitor bolton must warned”

 “lord karstark’s heir harrenhal well” ser brynden reminded “the eldest son one lannisters took captive green fork”

 “harrion name harrion” robb laughed bitterly “a king best know names enemies don’t think”

 blackfish looked shrewdly “you know certainty make young karstark enemy”

 “what else would kill father he’s like thank me”

 “he might sons hate fathers stroke make lord karhold”

 robb shook head “even harrion sort could never openly forgive father’s killer men would turn northmen uncle north remembers”

 “pardon then” urged edmure tully

 robb stared frank disbelief

 gaze edmure’s face reddened “spare life mean don’t like taste sire slew men well poor delp recovered wound ser jaime gave karstark must punished certainly keep chains say”

 “a hostage” said catelyn might best…

 “yes hostage” brother seized musing agreement “tell son long remains loyal father harmed otherwise… hope freys offered marry lord walder’s daughters carry litter besides lose karstarks well hope there”

 “what hope…” robb let breath pushed hair back eyes said “we’ve naught ser rodrik north response walder frey new offer silence eyrie” appealed mother “will sister never answer us many times must write believe none birds reached her”

 son wanted comfort catelyn realized wanted hear would right king needed truth “the birds reached though may tell ever comes expect help quarter robb

 “lysa never brave girls together would run hide whenever she’d done something wrong perhaps thought lord father would forget wroth could find different ran king’s landing fear safest place knows sits mountain hoping everyone forget her”

 “the knights vale could make difference war” said robb “but fight i’ve asked open bloody gate us provide ships gulltown take us north high road would hard hard fighting way neck could land white harbor could flank moat cailin drive ironmen north half year”

 “it happen sire” said blackfish “cat right lady lysa fearful admit army vale army bloody gate remain closed”

 “the others take then” robb cursed fury despair “bloody rickard karstark well theon greyjoy walder frey tywin lannister rest gods good would man ever want king everyone shouting king north king north told myself… swore myself… would good king honorable father strong loyal friends brave faced enemies… can’t even tell one get confused lord rickard’s fought side half dozen battles sons died whispering wood tion frey willem lannister enemies yet kill dead friends’ father sakes” looked “will lannisters thank lord rickard’s head freys”

 “no” said brynden blackfish blunt ever

 “all reason spare lord rickard’s life keep hostage” edmure urged

 robb reached hands lifted heavy bronzeandiron crown set back atop head suddenly king “lord rickard dies”

 “but why” said edmure “you said yourself—”

 “i know said uncle change must do” swords crown stood stark black brow “in battle might slain tion willem battle asleep beds naked unarmed cell put rickard karstark killed frey lannister killed honor shall deal dawn”

 day broke grey chilly storm diminished steady soaking rain yet even godswood crowded river lords northmen highborn low knights sellswords stableboys stood amongst trees see end night’s dark dance edmure given commands headsman’s block set heart tree rain leaves fell around greatjon’s men led lord rickard karstark press hands still bound men already hung riverrun’s high walls slumping end long ropes rain washed darkening faces

 long lew waited beside block robb took poleaxe hand ordered step aside “this work” said “he dies word must die hand”

 lord rickard karstark dipped head stiffly “for much thank naught else” dressed death long black wool surcoat emblazoned white sunburst house “the blood first men flows veins much boy would well remember named grandfather raised banners king aerys father king joffrey oxcross whispering wood battle camps rode beside stood lord eddard trident kin stark karstark”

 “this kinship stop betraying me” robb said “and save kneel lord”

 lord rickard spoken truly catelyn knew karstarks traced descent karlon stark younger son winterfell put rebel lord thousand years ago granted lands valor castle built named karl’s hold soon became karhold centuries karhold starks become karstarks

 “old gods new makes matter” lord rickard told son “no man accursed kinslayer”

 “kneel traitor” robb said “or must force head onto block”

 lord karstark knelt “the gods shall judge judged me” laid head upon block

 “rickard karstark lord karhold” robb lifted heavy axe hands “here sight gods men judge guilty murder high treason mine name condemn mine hand take life would speak final word”

 “kill cursed king mine”

 axe crashed heavy wellhoned killed single blow took three sever man’s head body time done living dead drenched blood robb flung poleaxe disgust turned wordless heart tree stood shaking hands halfclenched rain running cheeks gods forgive catelyn prayed silence boy choice

 last saw son day rain continued morning lashing surface rivers turning godswood grass mud puddles blackfish assembled hundred men rode karstarks one expected would bring back many “i pray need hang them” said departed gone catelyn retreated father’s solar sit beside lord hoster’s bed

 “it much longer” maester vyman warned came afternoon “his last strength going though still tries fight”

 “he ever fighter” said “a sweet stubborn man”

 “yes” maester said “but battle cannot win time lay sword shield time yield”

 yield thought make peace father maester speaking son

 evenfall jeyne westerling came see young queen entered solar timidly “lady catelyn mean disturb you…”

 “you welcome grace” catelyn sewing put needle aside

 “please call jeyne don’t feel like grace”

 “you one nonetheless please come sit grace”

 “jeyne” sat hearth smoothed skirt anxiously

 “as wish might serve jeyne”

 “it’s robb” girl said “he’s miserable so… angry disconsolate don’t know do”

 “it hard thing take man’s life”

 “i know told use headsman lord tywin sends man die give command it’s easier way don’t think”

 “yes” said catelyn “but lord husband taught sons killing never easy”

 “oh” queen jeyne wet lips “robb eaten day rollam bring nice supper boar’s ribs stewed onions ale never touched bite spent morning writing letter told disturb letter done burned sitting looking maps asked looking never answered don’t think ever heard wouldn’t even change clothes damp day bloody want good wife don’t know help cheer comfort don’t know needs please lady you’re mother tell do”

 “very good add prayers well old gods new”

 jaime


 two days’ ride either side kingsroad passed wide swath destruction miles blackened fields orchards trunks dead trees jutted air like archers’ stakes bridges burnt well streams swollen autumn rains range along banks search fords nights alive howling wolves saw people

 maidenpool lord mooton’s red salmon still flew castle hill town walls deserted gates smashed half homes shops burned plundered saw nothing living feral dogs went slinking away sound approach pool town took name legend said florian fool first glimpsed jonquil bathing sisters choked rotting corpses water turned murky greygreen soup

 jaime took one look burst song “six maids springfed pool…”

 “what doing” brienne demanded

 “singing ‘six maids pool’ i’m sure you’ve heard shy little maids rather like though somewhat prettier i’ll warrant”

 “be quiet” wench said look suggested would love leave floating pool among corpses

 “please jaime” pleaded cousin cleos “lord mooton sworn riverrun don’t want draw castle may enemies hiding rubble…”

 “hers coz yen see wench use sword wears”

 “if won’t quiet leave choice gag kingslayer”

 “unchain hands i’ll play mute way king’s landing could fairer wench”

 “brienne name brienne” three crows went flapping air startled sound

 “care bath brienne” laughed “you’re maiden there’s pool i’ll wash back” used scrub cersei’s back children together casterly rock

 wench turned horse’s head trotted away jaime ser cleos followed ashes maidenpool half mile green began creep back world jaime glad burned lands reminded much aerys

 “she’s taking duskendale road” ser cleos muttered “it would safer follow coast”

 “safer slower i’m duskendale coz truth told i’m bored company” may half lannister you’re far cry sister

 could never bear long apart twin even children would creep other’s beds sleep arms entwined even womb long sister’s flowering advent manhood seen mares stallions fields dogs bitches kennels played mother’s maid caught it… recall whatever horrified lady joanna she’d sent maid away moved jaime’s bedchamber side casterly rock set guard outside cersei’s told must never would choice tell lord father need feared though long died birthing tyrion jaime barely remembered mother looked like

 perhaps stannis baratheon starks done kindness spread tale incest seven kingdoms nothing left hide shouldn’t marry cersei openly share bed every night dragons always married sisters septons lords smallfolk turned blind eye targaryens hundreds years let house lannister would play havoc joffrey’s claim crown sure end swords iron throne robert swords could keep joffrey well regardless whose seed could marry myrcella we’ve sent sansa stark back mother would show realm lannisters laws like gods targaryens

 jaime decided would return sansa younger girl well could found like win back lost honor notion keeping faith expected betrayal amused could say

 riding past trampled wheatfield low stone wall jaime heard soft thrum behind dozen birds taken flight “down” shouted throwing neck horse gelding screamed reared arrow took rump shafts went hissing past jaime saw ser cleos lurch saddle twisting foot caught stirrup palfrey bolted frey dragged past shouting head bouncing ground

 jaime’s gelding lumbered ponderously blowing snorting pain craned around look brienne still ahorse arrow lodged back another leg seemed feel saw pull sword wheel circle searching bowmen “behind wall” jaime called fighting turn halfblind mount back toward fight reins tangled damned chains air full arrows “at them” shouted kicking show done old sorry horse found burst speed somewhere suddenly racing across wheatfield throwing clouds chaff jaime enough time think wench better follow realize they’re charged unarmed man chains heard coming hard behind “evenfall” shouted plow horse thundered brandished longsword “tarth tarth”

 last arrows sped harmlessly past bowmen broke ran way unsupported bowmen always broke ran charge knights brienne reined wall time jaime reached melted wood twenty yards away “lost taste battle”

 “they running”

 “that’s best time kill them”

 sheathed sword “why charge”

 “bowmen fearless long hide behind walls shoot afar come run know happen reach arrow back know another leg ought let tend them”

 “you”

 “who else last saw cousin cleos palfrey using head plow furrow though suppose ought find lannister sorts”

 found cleos still tangled stirrup arrow right arm second chest ground done top head matted blood mushy touch pieces broken bone moving skin beneath pressure jaime’s hand

 brienne knelt held hand “he’s still warm”

 “he’ll cool soon enough want horse clothes i’m weary rags fleas”

 “he cousin” wench shocked

 “was” jaime agreed “have fear amply provisioned cousins i’ll sword well need someone share watches”

 “you stand watch without weapons” rose

 “chained tree perhaps could perhaps could make bargain next lot outlaws let slit thick neck wench”

 “i arm name is—”

 “—brienne know i’ll swear oath harm ease girlish fears”

 “your oaths worthless swore oath aerys”

 “you haven’t cooked anyone armor far know want safe whole king’s landing don’t we” squatted beside cleos began undo swordbelt

 “step away stop that”

 jaime tired tired suspicions tired insults tired crooked teeth broad spotty face limp thin hair ignoring protests grasped hilt cousin’s longsword hands held corpse foot pulled blade slid scabbard already pivoting bringing sword around swift deadly arc steel met steel ringing bonejarring clang somehow brienne gotten blade time jaime laughed “very good wench”

 “give sword kingslayer”

 “oh will” sprang feet drove longsword alive hands brienne jumped back parrying followed pressing attack sooner turn one cut next upon swords kissed sprang apart kissed jaime’s blood singing meant never felt alive fighting death balanced every stroke wrists chained together wench may even give contest time chains forced use twohanded grip though course weight reach less blade true twohanded greatsword matter cousin’s sword long enough write end brienne tarth

 high low overhand rained steel upon left right backslash swinging hard sparks flew swords came together upswing sideslash overhand always attacking moving step slide strike step step strike hacking slashing faster faster faster…

 …until breathless stepped back let point sword fall ground giving moment respite “not half bad” acknowledged “for wench”

 took slow deep breath eyes watching warily “i would hurt kingslayer”

 “as could” whirled blade back head flew chains rattling

 jaime could said long pressed attack might minutes might hours time slept swords woke drove away cousin’s corpse drove across road drove trees stumbled root never saw moment thought done went one knee instead falling never lost beat sword leapt block downcut would opened shoulder groin cut fighting way back feet stroke stroke

 dance went pinned oak cursed slipped away followed shallow brook halfchoked fallen leaves steel rang steel sang steel screamed sparked scraped woman started grunting like sow every crash yet somehow could reach iron cage around stopped every blow

 “not bad all” said paused second catch breath circling right

 “for wench”

 “for squire say green one” laughed ragged breathless laugh “come come sweetling music’s still playing might dance lady”

 grunting came blade whirling suddenly jaime struggling keep steel skin one slashes raked across brow blood ran right eye others take riverrun well skills gone rust rot bloody dungeon chains great help either eye closed shoulders going numb jarring they’d taken wrists ached weight chains manacles sword longsword grew heavier every blow jaime knew swinging quickly he’d done earlier raising high

 realization chilled robert stronger sure white bull gerold hightower well heyday ser arthur dayne amongst living greatjon umber stronger strongboar crakehall likely cleganes certainty mountain’s strength like nothing human matter speed skill jaime could beat woman huge cow woman sure even so… rights one wearing

 instead forced back brook shouting “yield throw sword”

 slick stone turned jaime’s foot felt falling twisted mischance diving lunge point scraped past parry bit upper thigh red flower blossomed jaime instant savor sight blood knee slammed rock pain blinding brienne splashed kicked away sword “yield”

 jaime drove shoulder legs bringing top rolled kicking punching finally sitting astride managed jerk dagger sheath could plunge belly caught wrist slammed hands back rock hard thought she’d wrenched arm socket hand spread across face “yield” shoved head held pulled “yield” jaime spit water face shove splash kicking uselessly fighting breathe “yield i’ll drown you”

 “and break oath” snarled “like me”

 let go went splash

 woods rang coarse laughter

 brienne lurched feet mud blood waist clothing askew face red looks caught us fucking instead fighting jaime crawled rocks shallow water wiping blood eye chained hands armed men lined sides brook small wonder making enough noise wake dragon “well met friends” called amiably “my pardons disturbed caught chastising wife”

 “seemed chastising” man spoke thick powerful nasal bar iron halfhelm wholly conceal lack nose

 outlaws killed ser cleos jaime realized suddenly scum earth surrounded swarthy dornishmen blond lyseni dothraki bells braids hairy ibbenese coalblack summer islanders feathered cloaks knew brave companions

 brienne found voice “i hundred stags—”

 cadaverous man tattered leather cloak said “we’ll take start m’lady”

 “then we’ll cunt” said noseless man “it can’t ugly rest you”

 “turn rape arse rorge” urged dornish spearman red silk scarf wound helm “that way won’t need look her”

 “and rob o’ pleasure o’ looking me” noseless said others laughed

 ugly stubborn though might wench deserved better gang raped refuse “who commands here” jaime demanded loudly

 “i honor ser jaime” cadaver’s eyes rimmed red hair thin dry dark blue veins could seen pallid skin hands face “urswyck called urswyck faithful”

 “you know am”

 sellsword inclined head “it takes beard shaved head deceive brave companions”

 bloody mummers mean jaime use gregor clegane amory lorch dogs father called used like dogs hound prey put fear hearts “if know urswyck know you’ll reward lannister always pays debts wench she’s highborn worth good ransom”

 cocked head “is fortunate”

 something sly way urswyck smiling jaime like “you heard where’s goat”

 “a hours distant pleased see doubt would call goat face lord vargo grows prickly dignity”

 since slobbering savage dignity “i’ll sure remember see lord pray”

 “harrenhal promised”

 harrenhal father taken leave senses jaime raised hands “i’ll chains off”

 urswyck’s chuckle papery dry

 something wrong jaime gave sign discomfiture smiled “did say something amusing”

 noseless grinned “you’re funniest thing seen since biter chewed septa’s teats off”

 “you father lost many battles” offered dornishman “we trade lion pelts wolfskins”

 urswyck spread hands “what timeon means say brave companions longer hire house lannister serve lord bolton king north”

 jaime gave cold contemptuous smile “and men say shit honor”

 urswyck unhappy comment signal two mummers grasped jaime arms rorge drove mailed fist stomach doubled grunting heard wench protesting “stop he’s harmed lady catelyn sent us exchange captives he’s protection…” rorge hit driving air lungs brienne dove sword beneath waters brook mummers could lay hands strong took four beat submission

 end wench’s face swollen bloody jaime’s must knocked two teeth nothing improve appearance stumbling bleeding two captives dragged back woods horses brienne limping thigh wound he’d given brook jaime felt sorry would lose maidenhood tonight doubt noseless bastard would certainty others would likely take turn

 dornishman bound back back atop brienne’s plow horse mummers stripping cleos frey skin divvy possessions rorge bloodstained surcoat proud lannister frey quarterings arrows punched holes lions towers alike

 “i hope you’re pleased wench” jaime whispered brienne coughed spat mouthful blood “if you’d armed we’d never taken” made answer there’s pigstubborn bitch thought brave yes could take “when make camp night you’ll raped once” warned “you’d wise resist fight you’ll lose teeth”

 felt brienne’s back stiffen “is would woman”

 woman i’d cersei “if woman i’d make kill i’m not” jaime kicked horse trot “urswyck word”

 cadaverous sellsword ragged leather cloak reined moment fell beside “what would ser mind tongue i’ll chastise again”

 “gold” said jaime “you like gold”

 urswyck studied reddened eyes “it uses confess”

 jaime gave urswyck knowing smile “all gold casterly rock let goat enjoy take us king’s landing collect ransom well like tarth called sapphire isle maiden told once” wench squirmed said nothing

 “do take turncloak”

 “certainly else”

 half heartbeat urswyck considered proposition “king’s landing long way father lord tywin may resent us selling harrenhal lord bolton”

 he’s cleverer looks jaime looking forward hanging wretch pockets bulged gold “leave deal father i’ll get royal pardon crimes committed i’ll get knighthood”

 “ser urswyck” man said savoring sound “how proud dear wife would hear hadn’t killed her” sighed “and brave lord vargo”

 “shall sing verse ‘the rains castamere’ goat won’t quite brave father gets hold him”

 “and father’s arms long reach walls harrenhal pluck us out”

 “if need be” king harren’s monstrous folly fallen could fall “are fool think goat outfight lion”

 urswyck leaned slapped lazily across face sheer casual insolence worse blow fear jaime realized chill “i heard enough kingslayer would great fool indeed believe promises oathbreaker like you” kicked horse galloped smartly ahead

 aerys jaime thought resentfully always turns aerys swayed motion horse wishing sword two swords would even better one wench one we’d die we’d take half hell us “why tell tarth sapphire isle” brienne whispered urswyck earshot “he’s like think father’s rich gemstones…”

 “you best pray does”

 “is every word say lie kingslayer tarth called sapphire isle blue waters”

 “shout little louder wench don’t think urswyck heard sooner know little you’re worth ransom sooner rapes begin every man mount care close eyes open legs pretend they’re lord renly”

 mercifully shut mouth time

 day almost done time found vargo hoat sacking small sept another dozen brave companions leaded windows smashed carved wooden gods dragged sunlight fattest dothraki jaime ever seen sitting mother’s chest rode prying chalcedony eyes point knife nearby skinny balding septon hung upside limb spreading chestnut tree three brave companions using corpse archery butt one must good dead man arrows eyes

 goat gave disinterested glance “thilence her”

 “hear me” brienne entreated rorge cut ropes bound jaime “in name king north king serve please listen—”

 rorge dragged horse began kick “see don’t break bones” urswyck called “the horsefaced bitch worth weight sapphires”

 dornishman timeon foulsmelling ibbenese pulled jaime saddle shoved roughly toward cookfire would hard grasped one sword hilts manhandled many still fetters might cut one two end would die jaime ready die yet certainly likes brienne tarth

 “thith ith thweet day” vargo hoat said around neck hung chain linked coins coins every shape size cast hammered bearing likenesses kings wizards gods demons manner fanciful beasts

 “oh yeth” said vargo hoat “half gold cathterly rock thall firth mutht thend methage” said something slithery goatish tongue

 urswyck shoved back jester green pink motley kicked legs hit ground one archers grabbed chain jaime’s wrists used yank arms front fat dothraki put aside knife unsheathe huge curved arakh wickedly sharp scythesword horselords loved

 arya


 small square keep half ruin great grey knight lived old understand questions matter said would smile mutter “i held bridge ser maynard red hair black temper could move six wounds took killed six”

 maester cared young man thankfully old knight drifted sleep chair took aside said “i fear seek ghost bird ages ago half year least lannisters caught lord beric near gods eye hanged”

 “aye hanged thoros cut died” lem’s broken nose red swollen healing crooked giving face lopsided look “his lordship’s hard man kill is”

 “and hard man find would seem” maester said “have asked lady leaves”

 “we shall” said greenbeard

 next morning crossed little stone bridge behind keep gendry wondered bridge old man fought one knew “most like is” said jackbelucky “don’t see bridges”

 “you’d know certain song” said tom sevenstrings “one good song we’d know ser maynard used wanted cross bridge bad poor old lychester might far famed dragonknight he’d sense enough keep singer”

 “lord lychester’s sons died robert’s rebellion” grumbled lem “some one side t’other he’s right head since bloody song’s like help o’ that”

 “what maester mean asking lady leaves” arya asked anguy rode

 archer smiled “wait see”

 three days later rode yellow wood jackbelucky unslung horn blew signal different one sounds scarcely died away rope ladders unrolled limbs trees “hobble horses go” said tom half singing words climbed hidden village upper branches maze rope walkways little mosscovered houses concealed behind walls red gold taken lady leaves stickthin whitehaired woman dressed roughspun “we cannot stay much longer autumn us” told “a dozen wolves went hayford road nine days past hunting they’d chanced look might seen us”

 “you’ve seen lord beric” asked tom sevenstrings

 “he’s dead” woman sounded sick “the mountain caught drove dagger eye begging brother told us lips man saw happen”

 “that’s old stale tale false” said lem “the lightning lord’s easy kill ser gregor might put eye man don’t die o’ jack could tell you”

 “well never did” said oneeyed jackbelucky “my father got good hanged lord piper’s bailiff brother wat got sent wall lannisters killed brothers eye that’s nothing”

 “you swear he’s dead” woman clutched lem’s arm “bless lem that’s best tidings we’ve half year may warrior defend red priest too”

 next night found shelter beneath scorched shell sept burned village called sallydance shards remained windows leaded glass aged septon greeted said looters even made mother’s costly robes crone’s gilded lantern silver crown father worn “they hacked maiden’s breasts though wood” told “and eyes eyes jet lapis motherofpearl pried knives may mother mercy all”

 “whose work this” said lem lemoncloak “mummers”

 “no” old man said “northmen savages worship trees wanted kingslayer said”

 arya heard chewed lip could feel gendry looking made angry ashamed

 dozen men living vault beneath sept amongst cobwebs roots broken wine casks word beric dondarrion either even leader wore sootblackened armor crude lightning bolt cloak greenbeard saw arya staring laughed said “the lightning lord everywhere nowhere skinny squirrel”

 “i’m squirrel” said “i’ll almost woman soon i’ll oneandten”

 “best watch don’t marry then” tried tickle chin arya slapped stupid hand away

 lem gendry played tiles hosts night tom sevenstrings sang silly song big belly ben high septon’s goose anguy let arya try longbow matter hard bit lip could draw “you need lighter bow milady” freckled bowman said “if there’s seasoned wood riverrun might i’ll make one”

 tom overheard broke song “you’re young fool archer go riverrun collect ransom won’t time sit making bows thankful get hide lord hoster hanging outlaws shaving son his… man hates music can’t trusted always say”

 “it’s music hates” said lem “it’s fool”

 “well cause wench willing make man fault drank much deed”

 lem snorted broken nose “was made song bloody arse love voice”

 “i sang once” tom complained “and who’s say song ’twas song fish”

 “a floppy fish” said anguy laughing

 arya didn’t care tom’s stupid songs turned harwin “what mean ransom”

 “we sore need horses milady armor well swords shields spears things coin buy aye seed planting winter coming remember” touched chin “you first highborn captive we’ve ransomed last i’d hope”

 much true arya knew knights captured ransomed time sometimes women robb won’t pay price wasn’t famous knight kings supposed put realm sisters lady mother would say would still want back things she’d done arya chewed lip wondered

 next day rode place called high heart hill lofty atop arya felt though could see half world around brow stood ring huge pale stumps remained circle oncemighty weirwoods arya gendry walked around hill count thirtyone wide could used bed

 high heart sacred children forest tom sevenstrings told magic lingered still “no harm ever come sleep here” singer said arya thought must true hill high surrounding lands flat enemy could approach unseen

 smallfolk hereabouts shunned place tom told said haunted ghosts children forest died andal king named erreg kinslayer cut grove arya knew children forest andals ghosts frighten used hide crypts winterfell little play games comeintomycastle monsters maidens amongst stone kings thrones

 yet even hair back neck stood night asleep storm woke wind pulled coverlet right sent swirling bushes went heard voices

 beside embers campfire saw tom lem greenbeard talking tiny little woman foot shorter arya older old nan stooped wrinkled leaning gnarled black cane white hair long came almost ground wind gusted blew head fine cloud flesh whiter color milk seemed arya eyes red though hard tell bushes “the old gods stir let sleep” heard woman say “i dreamt saw shadow burning heart butchering golden stag aye dreamt man without face waiting bridge swayed swung shoulder perched drowned crow seaweed hanging wings dreamt roaring river woman fish dead drifted red tears cheeks eyes open oh woke terror dreamt gifts pay dreams”

 “dreams” grumbled lem lemoncloak “what good dreams fish women drowned crows dream last night kissing tavern wench used know going pay old woman”

 “the wench dead” woman hissed “only worms may kiss now” tom sevenstrings said “i’ll song i’ll gone”

 “no” gendry admitted “master mott said thoros could outdrink even king robert pease pod told gluttons sots”

 “you shouldn’t call king sot” maybe king robert drunk lot he’d father’s friend

 “i talking thoros” gendry reached tongs pinch face arya swatted away “he liked feasts tourneys king robert fond thoros brave walls pyke crashed first breach fought one flaming swords setting ironmen afire every slash”

 “sheep obedient” said arstan words translated valyrian well though much dany like feigning ignorance

 kraznys mo nakloz showed big white teeth rendered back “a word sheep would spill stinking old bowels bricks” said “but say tell creatures dogs sheep eat dogs horse seven kingdoms”

 “they prefer pigs cows worship”

 dany listened patiently translation

 “tell names such” kraznys commanded girl “it reminds vermin name disks thrown empty cask duty’s end dawn plucked random”

 “more madness” said arstan heard “how man possibly remember new name every day”

 “those cannot culled training along cannot run day full pack scale mountain black night walk across bed coals slay infant”

 dany’s mouth surely twisted see blind well cruel turned away quickly trying keep face mask heard translation allow say “whose infants slay”

 “and gear”

 “sword shield spear sandals quilted tunic included” said kraznys “and spiked caps sure wear armor wish must provide it”

 dany could think questions looked arstan “you lived long world whitebeard seen say”

 “i say grace” old man answered

 “why” asked “speak freely” dany thought knew would say wanted slave girl hear kraznys mo nakloz might hear later

 “my queen” said arstan “there slaves seven kingdoms thousands years old gods new alike hold slavery abomination evil land westeros head slave army many good men oppose reason great harm cause honor house”

 “yet must army” dany said “the boy joffrey give iron throne asking politely”

 “when day comes raise banners half westeros you” whitebeard promised “your brother rhaegar still remembered great love”

 “and father” dany said

 old man hesitated saying “king aerys also remembered gave realm many years peace grace need slaves magister illyrio keep safe dragons grow send secret envoys across narrow sea behalf sound high lords cause”

 “those high lords abandoned father kingslayer bent knee robert usurper”

 “even bent knees may yearn hearts return dragons”

 “may” said dany slippery word may language turned back kraznys mo nakloz slave girl “i must consider carefully”

 slaver shrugged “tell consider quickly many buyers three days past showed unsullied corsair king hopes buy all”

 “the corsair wanted hundred worship” dany heard slave girl say

 poked end whip “corsairs liars he’ll buy tell girl”

 dany knew would take hundred took “remind good master remind daenerys stormborn mother dragons unburnt trueborn queen seven kingdoms westeros blood blood aegon conqueror old valyria him”

 yet words move plump perfumed slaver even rendered ugly tongue “old ghis ruled empire valyrians still fucking sheep” growled poor little scribe “and sons harpy” gave shrug “my tongue wasted wagging women east west makes matter cannot decide pampered flattered stuffed sweetmeats well fate tell whore requires guide sweet city kraznys mo nakloz gladly serve her… service well woman looks”

 “good master kraznys would pleased show astapor ponder grace” translator said

 “i feed jellied dog brains fine rich stew red octopus unborn puppy” wiped lips

 “many delicious dishes says”

 “tell pretty pyramids night” slaver growled “tell lick honey breasts allow lick honey mine prefers”

 “ask wishes view fighting pits” kraznys added “douquor’s pit fine folly scheduled evening bear three small boys one boy rolled honey one blood one rotting fish may wager bear eat first”

 tap tap tap dany heard arstan whitebeard’s face still staff beat rage tap tap tap made smile “i bear balerion” told translator “and may well eat return him”

 “see” said kraznys words translated “it woman decides man runs ever”

 “thank good master patient kindness” dany said “and tell think learned here” gave arm arstan whitebeard lead back across plaza litter aggo jhogo fell either side walking bowlegged swagger horselords affected forced dismount stride earth like common mortals

 dany climbed litter frowning beckoned arstan climb beside man old walking heat close curtains got way sun beating fiercely city red brick every stray breeze cherished even come swirl fine red dust besides need see

 astapor queer city even eyes one walked within house dust bathed womb world beneath mother mountains streets made red brick paved plaza stepped pyramids deepdug fighting pits rings descending seats sulfurous fountains gloomy wine caves ancient walls encircled many bricks thought old crumbling fine red dust everywhere dancing gutters gust wind small wonder many astapori women veiled faces brick dust stung eyes worse sand

 “make way” jhogo shouted rode litter “make way mother dragons” uncoiled great silverhandled whip dany given made crack air leaned told nay “not place blood blood” said tongue “these bricks heard much sound whips”

 streets largely deserted set port morning scarcely seemed crowded elephant lumbered past latticework litter back naked boy peeling skin sat dry brick gutter picking nose staring sullenly ants street lifted head sound hooves gaped column mounted guards trotted cloud red dust brittle laughter copper disks sewn cloaks yellow silk glittered like many suns tunics embroidered linen waist wore sandals pleated linen skirts bareheaded man teased oiled twisted stiff redblack hair fantastic shape horns wings blades even grasping hands looked like troupe demons escaped seventh hell naked boy watched bit along dany soon enough gone went back ants knuckle nose

 old city reflected populous glory near crowded qarth pentos lys

 “bricks blood built astapor” whitebeard murmured side “and bricks blood people”

 “what that” dany asked curious

 “an old rhyme maester taught boy never knew true bricks astapor red blood slaves make them”

 “i well believe that” said dany

 “then leave place heart turns brick well sail night evening tide”

 would could thought dany “when leave astapor must army ser jorah says”

 “ser jorah slaver grace” old man reminded “there sellswords pentos myr tyrosh hire man kills coin honor least slaves find army beg you”

 “my brother visited pentos myr braavos near free cities magisters archons fed wine promises soul starved death man cannot sup beggar’s bowl life stay man taste qarth enough come pentos bowl hand”

 “better come beggar slaver” arstan said

 “there speaks one neither” dany’s nostrils flared “do know like sold squire brother sold khal drogo promise golden crown well drogo crowned gold though wished i… sunandstars made queen different man might much otherwise think forgotten felt afraid”

 whitebeard bowed head “your grace mean give offense”

 “only lies offend never honest counsel” dany patted arstan’s spotted hand reassure “i dragon’s temper that’s must let frighten you”

 “i shall try remember” whitebeard smiled

 good face great strength dany thought could understand ser jorah mistrusted old man could jealous found another man talk unbidden thoughts went back night balerion exile knight kissed never done thrice age low birth never gave leave true knight would ever kiss queen without leave taken care never alone ser jorah keeping handmaids aboard ship sometimes bloodriders wants kiss see eyes

 dany wanted could begin say jorah’s kiss woken something something sleeping since khal drogo died lying abed narrow bunk found wondering would man squeezed beside place handmaid thought exciting sometimes would close eyes dream never jorah mormont dreamed lover always younger comely though face remained shifting shadow

 tormented could sleep dany slid hand legs gasped felt wet scarce daring breathe moved fingers back forth lower lips slowly wake irri beside found one sweet spot lingered touching lightly timidly first faster still relief wanted seemed recede dragons stirred one screamed across cabin irri woke saw

 dany knew face flushed darkness irri surely could tell wordless handmaid put hand breast bent take nipple mouth hand drifted across soft curve belly mound fine silverygold hair went work dany’s thighs moments legs twisted breasts heaved whole body shuddered screamed perhaps drogon irri never said thing curled back went back sleep instant thing done

 next day seemed dream ser jorah anything drogo want sunandstars dany reminded irri ser jorah drogo drogo dead though she’d thought feelings died red waste one treacherous kiss somehow brought back life never kissed presumed much permitted must never happen set mouth grimly gave head shake bell braid chimed softly

 closer bay city presented fairer face great brick pyramids lined shore largest four hundred feet high manner trees vines flowers grew broad terraces winds swirled around smelled green fragrant another gigantic harpy stood atop gate one made baked red clay crumbling visibly stub scorpion’s tail remaining chain grasped clay claws old iron rotten rust cooler water though lapping waves rotting pilings made curiously soothing sound

 aggo helped dany litter strong belwas seated massive piling eating great haunch brown roasted meat “dog” said happily saw dany “good dog astapor little queen eat” offered greasy grin

 “that kind belwas no” dany eaten dog places times could think unsullied stupid puppies swept past huge eunuch plank onto deck balerion

 ser jorah mormont stood waiting “your grace” said bowing head “the slavers come gone three dozen scribes many slaves lift fetch crawled every foot holds made note had” walked aft “how many men sale”

 “none” mormont angry city sullen heat stinks sweats crumbling bricks “they sell eunuchs men eunuchs made brick like rest astapor shall buy eight thousand brick eunuchs dead eyes never move kill suckling babes sake spiked hat strangle dogs don’t even names don’t call men ser”

 “khaleesi” said taken aback fury “the unsullied chosen boys trained—”

 “i heard care training” dany could feel tears welling eyes sudden unwanted hand flashed cracked ser jorah hard across face either cry

 mormont touched cheek she’d slapped “if displeased queen—”

 “you you’ve displeased greatly ser true knight would never brought vile sty” true knight would never kissed looked breasts way or…

 “as grace commands shall tell captain groleo make ready sail evening tide sty less vile”

 “no” said dany groleo watched forecastle crew watching whitebeard bloodriders jhiqui every one stopped sound slap “i want sail tide want sail far fast never look back can’t eight thousand brick eunuchs sale must find way buy them” left went

 behind carved wooden door captain’s cabin dragons restless drogon raised head screamed pale smoke venting nostrils viserion flapped tried perch shoulder smaller “no” dany said trying shrug gently “you’re big sweetling” dragon coiled white gold tail around one arm dug black claws fabric sleeve clinging tightly helpless sank groleo’s great leather chair giggling

 “they wild gone khaleesi” irri told “viserion clawed splinters door see drogon made escape slaver men came see grabbed tail hold back turned bit me” showed dany marks teeth hand

 “did try burn way free” thing frightened dany

 “no khaleesi drogon breathed fire empty air slaver men feared come near him”

 kissed irri’s hand drogon bitten “i’m sorry hurt dragons meant locked small ship’s cabin”

 “dragons like horses this” irri said “and riders horses scream khaleesi kick wooden walls hear jhiqui says old women little ones scream like water cart like black salt sea”

 “i know” dany said “i know”

 “my khaleesi sad”

 “yes” dany admitted sad lost

 “should pleasure khaleesi”

 dany stepped away “no irri need happened night woke… you’re bed slave freed remember you…”

 “i handmaid mother dragons” girl said “it great honor please khaleesi”

 “i don’t want that” insisted “i don’t” turned away sharply “leave want alone think”

 dusk begun settle waters slaver’s bay dany returned deck stood rail looked astapor looks almost beautiful thought stars coming silk lanterns kraznys’s translator promised brick pyramids glimmery light dark streets plazas fighting pits darkest barracks little boy feeding scraps puppy gave took away manhood

 soft step behind “khaleesi” voice “might speak frankly”

 dany turn could bear look might well slap cry kiss never know right wrong madness “say ser”

 “when aegon dragon stepped ashore westeros kings vale rock reach rush hand crowns mean sit iron throne must win steel dragonfire mean blood hands thing done”

 blood fire thought dany words house targaryen known life “the blood enemies shed gladly blood innocents another matter eight thousand unsullied would offer eight thousand dead babes eight thousand strangled dogs”

 “your grace” said jorah mormont “i saw king’s landing sack babes butchered day well old men children play women raped count savage beast every man hand man sword spear send forth war beast stirs scent blood takes wake yet never heard unsullied raping putting city sword even plundering save express command lead brick may say buy henceforth dogs they’ll kill want dead dogs want dead recall”

 usurper’s dogs “yes” dany gazed soft colored lights let cool salt breeze caress “you speak sacking cities answer ser—why dothraki never sacked city” pointed “look walls see they’ve begun crumble see guards towers don’t hiding ser saw sons harpy today proud highborn warriors dressed linen skirts fiercest thing hair even modest khalasar could crack astapor like nut spill rotted meat inside tell ugly harpy sitting beside godsway vaes dothrak among stolen gods”

 “you dragon’s eye khaleesi that’s plain see”

 “i wanted answer compliment”

 “there two reasons astapor’s brave defenders much chaff it’s true old names fat purses dress ghiscari scourges pretend still rule vast empire every one high officer feastdays fight mock wars pits demonstrate brilliant commanders it’s eunuchs dying enemy wanting sack astapor would know they’d facing unsullied slavers would turn whole garrison city’s defense dothraki ridden unsullied since left braids gates qohor”

 “and second reason” dany asked

 “who would attack astapor” ser jorah asked “meereen yunkai rivals enemies doom destroyed valyria folk eastern hinterlands ghiscari beyond hills lies lhazar lamb men dothraki call notably unwarlike people”

 “yes” agreed “but north slave cities dothraki sea two dozen mighty khals like nothing sacking cities carrying people slavery”

 “carrying good slaves you’ve killed slavers valyria qarth lies beyond red waste nine free cities thousands leagues west may sure sons harpy give lavishly every passing khal magisters pentos norvos myr know feast horselords give gifts soon ride it’s cheaper fighting deal certain”

 cheaper fighting dany thought yes might could easy pleasant would sail king’s landing dragons pay boy joffrey chest gold make go away

 “khaleesi” ser jorah prompted silent long time touched elbow lightly

 dany shrugged  “viserys would bought many unsullied coin said like rhaegar…”

 “i remember daenerys”

 “your grace” corrected “prince rhaegar led free men battle slaves whitebeard said dubbed squires made many knights well”

 “there higher honor receive knighthood prince dragonstone”

 “tell then—when touched man shoulder sword say ‘go forth kill weak’ ‘go forth defend them’ trident brave men viserys spoke died beneath dragon banners—did give lives believed rhaegar’s cause bought paid for” dany turned mormont crossed arms waited answer

 roads ran twisted mountain valleys walked grey stone peaks lay still blue lakes long deep narrow green gloom endless piney woods russet gold autumn leaves grew less common left wolfswood climb amongst old flint hills vanished time hills turned mountains giant greygreen sentinels loomed spruce fir soldier pines endless profusion undergrowth sparse beneath forest floor carpeted dark green needles

 lost way happened twice need wait clear cold night clouds intrude look sky ice dragon blue star dragon’s eye pointed way north osha told thinking osha made bran wonder pictured safe white harbor rickon shaggydog eating eels fish hot crab pie fat lord manderly maybe warming last hearth greatjon’s fires bran’s life turned endless chilly days hodor’s back riding basket slopes mountains

 “up down” meera would sigh sometimes walked “then hate stupid mountains prince bran”

 “yesterday said loved them”

 “oh lord father told mountains never saw one till love say”

 bran made face “but said hated them”

 “why can’t both” meera reached pinch nose

 “because they’re different” insisted “like night day ice fire”

 “if ice burn” said jojen solemn voice “then love hate mate mountain marsh makes matter land one”

 “one” sister agreed “but wrinkled”

 high glens seldom courtesy running north south often found going long leagues wrong direction sometimes forced double back way they’d come “if took kingsroad could wall now” bran would remind reeds wanted find threeeyed crow could learn fly half hundred times said said meera started teasing saying along

 “if took kingsroad wouldn’t hungry either” started saying hills they’d lack food meera fine huntress even better taking fish streams threepronged frog spear bran liked watch admiring quickness way sent spear lancing pulled back silvery trout wriggling end summer hunting well direwolf vanished every night sun went always back dawn often something jaws squirrel hare

 mountains streams smaller icy game scarcer meera still hunted fished could harder nights even summer found prey often went sleep empty bellies

 jojen remained stubbornly determined stay well away roads “where find roads find travelers” said way “and travelers eyes see mouths spread tales crippled boy giant wolf walks beside them” one could get stubborn jojen struggled wild every day climbed little higher moved little farther north

 days rained days windy caught sleet storm fierce even hodor bellowed dismay clear days often seemed living things world “does one live here” meera reed asked made way around granite upthrust large winterfell

 “there’s people” bran told “the umbers mostly east kingsroad graze sheep high meadows summer wulls west mountains along bay ice harclays back behind us hills knotts liddles norreys even flints high places” father’s mother’s mother flint mountains old nan said blood made bran fool climbing fall died years years years born though even father born

 “wull” said meera “jojen wasn’t wull rode father war”

 “theo wull” joien breathing hard climb “buckets used call him”

 “that’s sigil” said bran “three brown buckets blue field border white grey checks lord wull came winterfell fealty talk father buckets shield he’s true lord though well call wull there’s knott norrey liddle winterfell called lords folk don’t”

 jojen reed stopped catch breath “do think mountain folk know we’re here”

 “they know” bran seen watching eyes summer’s sharper ones missed little “they won’t bother us long don’t try make goats horses”

 encounter mountain people sudden burst freezing rain sent looking shelter summer found sniffing shallow cave behind greygreen branches towering sentinel tree hodor ducked beneath stony overhang bran saw orange glow fire farther back realized alone “come warm yourselves” man’s voice called “there’s stone enough keep rain heads”

 offered oatcakes blood sausage swallow ale skin carried never name ask bran figured liddle clasp fastened squirrelskin cloak gold bronze wrought shape pinecone liddles bore pinecones white half greenandwhite shields

 “is far wall” bran asked waited rain stop

 “not far raven flies” said liddle “farther lacks wings”

 bran started “i’d bet we’d if…”

 “…we took kingsroad” meera finished

 liddle took knife whittled stick “when stark winterfell maiden girl could walk kingsroad nameday gown still go unmolested travelers could find fire bread salt many inn holdfast nights colder doors closed there’s squids wolfswood flayed men ride kingsroad asking strangers”

 reeds exchanged look “flayed men” said jojen

 “the bastard’s boys aye dead he’s paying good silver wolfskins man hears maybe gold word certain walking dead” looked bran said summer stretched beside “as wall” man went “it’s place i’d going old bear took watch haunted woods come back ravens hardly message dark wings dark words mother used say birds fly silent seems that’s even darker” poked fire stick “it different stark winterfell old wolf’s dead young one’s gone south play game thrones that’s left us ghosts”

 “the wolves come again” said jojen solemnly

 “and would knowing boy”

 “i dreamed it”

 “some nights dream mother buried nine years past” man said “but wake she’s come back us”

 “there dreams dreams lord”

 “hodor” said hodor

 spent night together rain let till well past dark summer seemed want leave cave fire burned embers bran let go direwolf feel damp people night calling moonlight painted wet woods shades silver turned grey peaks white owls hooted dark flew silently pines pale goats moved along mountainsides bran closed eyes gave wolf dream smells sounds midnight

 woke next morning fire gone liddle gone he’d left sausage dozen oatcakes folded neatly green white cloth cakes pinenuts baked blackberries bran ate one still know sort liked best one day would starks winterfell told he’d send liddles pay back hundredfold every nut berry

 trail followed little easier day noon sun came breaking clouds bran sat basket hodor’s back felt almost content dozed lulled sleep smooth swing big stableboy’s stride soft humming sound made sometimes walked meera woke light touch arm “look” said pointing sky frog spear “an eagle”

 bran lifted head saw grey wings spread still floated wind followed eyes circled higher wondering would like soar world effortless better climbing even tried reach eagle leave stupid crippled body rise sky join way joined summer greenseers could able tried tried eagle vanished golden haze afternoon “it’s gone” said disappointed

 “we’ll see others” said meera “they live here”

 “i suppose”

 “hodor” said hodor

 “hodor” bran agreed

 jojen kicked pinecone “hodor likes say name think”

 “hodor’s true name” bran explained “it’s word says real name walder old nan told grandmother’s grandmother something” talking old nan made sad “do think ironmen killed her” hadn’t seen body winterfell didn’t remember seeing women dead thought back “she never hurt one even theon told stories theon wouldn’t hurt someone like would he”

 “some people hurt others can” said jojen

 “and wasn’t theon killing winterfell” said meera “too many dead ironmen” shifted frog spear hand “remember old nan’s stories bran remember way told sound voice long part always alive you”

 “i’ll remember” promised climbed without speaking long time following crooked game trail high saddle two stony peaks scrawny soldier pines clung slopes around far ahead bran could see icy glitter stream tumbled mountainside found listening jojen’s breathing crunch pine needles hodor’s feet “do know stories” asked reeds sudden

 meera laughed “oh few”

 “a few” brother admitted

 “hodor” said hodor humming

 “you could tell one” said bran “while walked hodor likes stories knights too”

 “there knights neck” said jojen

 “above water” sister corrected “the bogs full dead ones though”

 “that’s true” said jojen “andals ironmen freys fools proud warriors set conquer greywater one could find ride neck back sooner later blunder bogs sink beneath weight steel drown armor”

 thought drowned knights water gave bran shivers didn’t object though liked shivers

 “there one knight” said meera “in year false spring knight laughing tree called might crannogman one”

 “or not” jojen’s face dappled green shadows “prince bran heard tale hundred times i’m sure”

 “no” said bran “i haven’t doesn’t matter sometimes old nan would tell story she’d told never minded good story old stories like old friends used say visit time time”

 “that’s true” meera walked shield back pushing occasional branch way frog spear bran began think wasn’t going tell story began “once curious lad lived neck small like crannogmen brave smart strong well grew hunting fishing climbing trees learned magics people”

 bran almost certain never heard story “did green dreams like jojen”

 “no” said meera “but could breathe mud run leaves change earth water water earth whispered word could talk trees weave words make castles appear disappear”

 “i wish could” bran said plaintively “when meet tree knight”

 meera made face “sooner certain prince would quiet”

 “i asking”

 “the lad knew magics crannogs” continued “but wanted people seldom travel far home know we’re small folk ways seem queer big people always treat us kindly lad bolder one day grown manhood decided would leave crannogs visit isle faces”

 “no one visits isle faces” objected bran “that’s green men live”

 “it green men meant find donned shirt sewn bronze scales like mine took leathern shield threepronged spear like mine paddled little skin boat green fork”

 bran closed eyes try see man little skin boat head crannogman looked like jojen older stronger dressed like meera

 “he passed beneath twins night freys would attack reached trident climbed river put boat head began walk took many day finally reached gods eye threw boat lake paddled isle faces”

 “did meet green men”

 “yes” said meera “but that’s another story tell prince asked knights”

 “green men good too”

 “they are” agreed said “all winter crannogman stayed isle spring broke heard wide world calling knew time come leave skin boat he’d left said farewells paddled toward shore rowed rowed finally saw distant towers castle rising beside lake towers reached ever higher neared shore realized must greatest castle world”

 “harrenhal” bran knew “it harrenhal”

 meera smiled “was beneath walls saw tents many colors bright banners cracking wind knights mail plate barded horses smelled roasting meats heard sound laughter blare heralds’ trumpets great tourney commence champions land come contest king son dragon prince white swords come welcome new brother ranks storm lord hand rose lord well great lion rock quarreled king stayed away many bannermen knights attended crannogman never seen pageantry knew might never see like part wanted nothing much part it”

 bran knew feeling well enough he’d little ever dreamed knight fell lost legs

 “the daughter great castle reigned queen love beauty tourney opened five champions sworn defend crown four brothers harrenhal famous uncle white knight kingsguard”

 “was fair maid”

 “she was” said meera hopping stone “but others fairer still one wife dragon prince who’d brought dozen lady companions attend knights begged favors tie lances”

 “this isn’t going one love stories it” bran asked suspiciously “hodor doesn’t like much”

 “hodor” said hodor agreeably

 “he likes stories knights fight monsters”

 “sometimes knights monsters bran little crannogman walking across field enjoying warm spring day harming none set upon three squires none older fifteen yet even bigger three world saw right snatched away spear knocked ground cursing frogeater”

 “were walders” sounded like something little walder frey might done

 “none offered name marked faces well could revenge upon later shoved every time tried rise kicked curled ground heard roar ‘that’s father’s man you’re kicking’ howled shewolf”

 “a wolf four legs two”

 “two” said meera “the shewolf laid squires tourney sword scattering crannogman bruised bloodied took back lair clean cuts bind linen met pack brothers wild wolf led quiet wolf beside pup youngest four

 “that evening feast harrenhal mark opening tourney shewolf insisted lad attend high birth much right place bench man easy refuse wolf maid let young pup find garb suitable king’s feast went great castle

 “under harren’s roof ate drank wolves many sworn swords besides barrowdown men moose bears mermen dragon prince sang song sad made wolf maid sniffle pup brother teased crying poured wine head black brother spoke asking knights join night’s watch storm lord drank knight skulls kisses winecup war crannogman saw maid laughing purple eyes dance white sword red snake lord griffins lastly quiet wolf… wild wolf spoke behalf brother shy leave bench

 “amidst merriment little crannogman spied three squires who’d attacked one served pitchfork knight one porcupine last attended knight two towers surcoat sigil crannogmen know well”

 “the freys” said bran “the freys crossing”

 “then now” agreed “the wolf maid saw pointed brothers ‘i could find horse armor might fit’ pup offered little crannogman thanked gave answer heart torn crannogmen smaller proud lad knight people sit boat often horse hands made oars lances much wished vengeance feared would make fool shame people quiet wolf offered little crannogman place tent night slept knelt lakeshore looking across water isle faces would said prayer old gods north neck…”

 “you never heard tale father” asked jojen

 “it old nan told stories meera go can’t stop “

 hodor must felt “hodor” said “hodor hodor hodor hodor”

 “well” said meera “if would hear rest…”

 “yes tell it”

 “five days jousting planned” said “there great sevensided mêlée well archery axethrowing horse race tourney singers…”

 “never mind that” bran squirmed impatiently basket hodor’s back “tell jousting”

 “as prince commands daughter castle queen love beauty four brothers uncle defend four sons harrenhal defeated first day conquerors reigned briefly champions vanquished turn happened end first day saw porcupine knight win place among champions morning second day pitchfork knight knight two towers victorious well late afternoon second day shadows grew long mystery knight appeared lists”

 bran nodded sagely mystery knights would oft appear tourneys helms concealing faces shields either blank bore strange device sometimes famous champions disguise dragonknight tourney knight tears could name sister queen love beauty place king’s mistress barristan bold twice donned mystery knight’s armor first time ten “it little crannogman bet”

 “no one knew” said meera “but mystery knight short stature clad illfitting armor made bits pieces device upon shield heart tree old gods white weirwood laughing red face”

 “maybe came isle faces” said bran “was green” old nan’s stories guardians dark green skin leaves instead hair sometimes antlers bran didn’t see mystery knight could worn helm antlers “i bet old gods sent him”

 “perhaps mystery knight dipped lance king rode end lists five champions pavilions know three challenged”

 “the porcupine knight pitchfork knight knight twin towers” bran heard enough stories know “he little crannogman told you”

 “whoever old gods gave strength arm porcupine knight fell first pitchfork knight lastly knight two towers none well loved common folk cheered lustily knight laughing tree new champion soon called fallen foes sought ransom horse armor knight laughing tree spoke booming voice helm saying ‘teach squire honor shall ransom enough’ defeated knights chastised squires sharply horses armor returned little crannogman’s prayer answered… green men old gods children forest say”

 good story bran decided thinking moment two “then happened knight laughing tree win tourney marry princess”

 “no” said meera “that night great castle storm lord knight skulls kisses swore would unmask king urged men challenge declaring face behind helm friend next morning heralds blew trumpets king took seat two champions appeared knight laughing tree vanished king wroth even sent son dragon prince seek man ever found painted shield hanging abandoned tree dragon prince tourney end”

 “oh” bran thought tale awhile “that good story three bad knights hurt squires little crannogman could killed part ransoms stupid mystery knight win tourney defeating every challenger name wolf maid queen love beauty”

 “she was” said meera “but that’s sadder story”

 “are certain never heard tale bran” asked jojen “your lord father never told you”

 bran shook head day growing old long shadows creeping mountainsides send black fingers pines little crannogman could visit isle faces maybe could tales agreed green men strange magic powers maybe could help walk even turn knight turned little crannogman knight even day thought day would enough





 davos


 cell warmer cell right

 dark yes flickering orange light fell ancient iron bars torch sconce wall outside back half cell remained drenched gloom dank well might expected isle dragonstone sea never far rats many dungeon could expect besides

 davos could complain chill smooth stony passages beneath great mass dragonstone always warm davos often heard said grew warmer farther one went well castle judged wall cell often felt warm touch pressed palm perhaps old tales true dragonstone built stones hell

 sick first brought cough plagued since battle grew worse fever took hold well lips broke blood blisters warmth cell stop shivering linger long remembered thinking die soon dark

 davos soon found wrong much else dimly remembered gentle hands firm voice young maester pylos looking given hot garlic broth drink milk poppy take away aches shivers poppy made sleep slept leeched drain bad blood surmised leech marks arms woke long coughing stopped blisters vanished broth chunks whitefish carrots onions well one day realized felt stronger since black betha shattered beneath flung river

 two gaolers tend one broad squat thick shoulders huge strong hands wore leather brigantine dotted iron studs day brought davos bowl oaten porridge sometimes sweetened honey poured bit milk gaoler older stooped sallow greasy unwashed hair pebbled skin wore doublet white velvet ring stars worked upon breast golden thread fit badly short loose soiled torn besides would bring davos plates meat mash fish stew even half lamprey pie lamprey rich could keep even rare treat prisoner dungeon

 neither sun moon shone dungeons windows pierced thick stone walls way tell day night gaolers neither man would speak though knew mutes sometimes heard exchange brusque words watch changing would even tell names gave names short strong one called porridge stooped sallow one lamprey pie marked passage days meals brought changing torches sconce outside cell

 man grows lonely dark hungers sound human voice davos would talk gaolers whenever came cell whether bring food change slops pail knew would deaf pleas freedom mercy instead asked questions hoping perhaps one day one might answer “what news war” asked “is king well” asked son devan princess shireen salladhor saan “what weather like” asked “have autumn storms begun yet ships still sail narrow sea”

 made matter asked never answered though sometimes porridge gave look half heartbeat davos would think speak lamprey even much man davos thought stone eats shits speaks decided liked porridge much better porridge least seemed know alive queer sort kindness man davos suspected fed rats many thought heard gaoler talking children perhaps he’d dreamed

 mean let die realized keeping alive purpose like think might lord sunglass confined cells beneath dragonstone time ser hubard rambton’s sons ended pyre given sea davos thought sat staring torch beyond bars let sail pass perish rock would sooner feed crabs flames

 one night finishing supper davos felt queer flush come glanced bars stood shimmering scarlet great ruby throat red eyes gleaming bright torch bathed “melisandre” said calm feel

 “onion knight” replied calmly two met stair yard exchanging polite greetings “are well”

 “better was”

 “do lack anything”

 “my king son lack them” pushed bowl aside stood “have come burn me”

 strange red eyes studied bars “this bad place dark place foul good sun shine bright moon” lifted hand toward torch wall sconce “this stands darkness onion knight little fire gift r’hllor shall put out”

 “no” moved toward bars “please” think could bear left alone utter blackness one rats company

 red woman’s lips curved upward smile “so come love fire would seem”

 “i need torch” hands opened closed beg

 “i like torch ser davos instruments r’hllor made single purpose—to keep darkness bay believe that”

 “no” perhaps lied told wanted hear davos accustomed speaking truth “you mother darkness saw storm’s end gave birth eyes”

 “is brave ser onions frightened passing shadow take heart shadows live given birth light king’s fires burn low dare draw make another son might well kill him” melisandre moved closer “with another man though… man whose flames still burn hot high… truly wish serve king’s cause come chamber one night could give pleasure never known lifefire could make…”

 “…a horror” davos retreated “i want part lady god may seven protect me”

 melisandre sighed “they protect guncer sunglass prayed thrice day bore seven sevenpointed stars upon shield r’hllor reached hand prayers turned screams burned cling false gods”

 “i worshiped life”

 “all life davos seaworth well say yesterday” shook head sadly “you never feared speak truth kings lie open eyes ser knight”

 “what would see”

 “the way world made truth around plain behold night dark full terrors day bright beautiful full hope one black white ice fire hate love bitter sweet male female pain pleasure winter summer evil good” took step toward “death life everywhere opposites everywhere war”

 “the war” asked davos

 “the war” affirmed “there two onion knight seven one hundred thousand two think crossed half world put yet another vain king yet another empty throne war waged since time began done men must choose stand one side r’hllor lord light heart fire god flame shadow stands great whose name may spoken lord darkness soul ice god night terror choice baratheon lannister greyjoy stark death choose life darkness light” clasped bars cell slender white hands great ruby throat seemed pulse radiance “so tell ser davos seaworth tell truly—does heart burn shining light r’hllor black cold full worms” reached bars laid three fingers upon breast feel truth flesh wool leather

 “my heart” davos said slowly “is full doubts”

 melisandre sighed “ahhhh davos good knight honest last even day darkness well lie would known other’s servants oft hide black hearts gaudy light r’hllor gives priests power see falsehoods” stepped lightly away cell “why mean kill me”

 “i tell you” said davos “if tell betrayed me” could salladhor saan yet even prayed

 red woman laughed “no one betrayed onion knight saw purpose flames”

 flames “if see future flames burned upon blackwater gave sons fire… sons ship men burning…”

 melisandre shook head “you wrong onion knight fires mine battle would different ending grace surrounded unbelievers pride proved stronger faith punishment grievous learned mistake”

 sons lesson king davos felt mouth tighten

 “it night seven kingdoms now” red woman went “but soon sun rise war continues davos seaworth soon learn even ember ashes still ignite great blaze old maester looked stannis saw man see king wrong lord’s chosen warrior fire seen leading fight dark seen flames flames lie else would written prophecy well red star bleeds darkness gathers azor ahai shall born amidst smoke salt wake dragons stone bleeding star come gone dragonstone place smoke salt stannis baratheon azor ahai reborn” red eyes blazed like twin fires seemed stare deep soul “you believe doubt truth r’hllor even now… yet served serve shall leave think told r’hllor source good shall leave torch well”

 smile swirl scarlet skirts gone scent lingered torch davos lowered floor cell wrapped arms knees shifting torchlight washed melisandre’s footsteps faded away sound scrabbling rats ice fire thought black white dark light davos could deny power god seen shadow crawling melisandre’s womb priestess knew things way knowing saw purpose flames good learn salla sold thought red woman spying secrets fires disquieted could say mean said served god would serve like either

 lifted eyes stare torch looked long time never blinking watching flames shift shimmer tried see beyond peer fiery curtain glimpse whatever lived back there… nothing fire time eyes began water

 godblind tired davos curled straw gave sleep

 three days later—well porridge come thrice lamprey twice—davos heard voices outside cell sat back stone wall listening sounds struggle new change unchanging world noise coming left steps led daylight could hear man’s voice pleading shouting

 “…madness” man saying came view dragged along two guardsmen fiery hearts breasts porridge went jangling ring keys ser axell florent walked behind “axell” prisoner said desperately “for love bear unhand cannot i’m traitor” older man tall slender silvery grey hair pointed beard long elegant face twisted fear “where selyse queen demand see others take release me”

 guards paid mind outcries “here” porridge asked front cell davos got feet instant considered trying rush door opened madness many guards wore swords porridge strong bull

 ser axell gave gaoler curt nod “let traitors enjoy other’s company”

 “i traitor” screeched prisoner porridge unlocking door though plainly dressed grey wool doublet black breeches speech marked highborn birth serve thought davos

 porridge swung bars wide ser axell gave nod guards flung charge headlong man stumbled might fallen davos caught wrenched away staggered back toward door slammed pale pampered face “no” shouted “nooooo” strength suddenly left legs slid slowly floor clutching iron bars ser axell porridge guards already turned leave “you cannot this” prisoner shouted retreating backs “i king’s hand”

 davos knew “you alester florent”

 man turned head “who…”

 “ser davos seaworth”

 lord alester blinked “seaworth… onion knight tried murder melisandre”

 davos deny “at storm’s end wore redgold armor inlaid lapis flowers breastplate” reached hand help man feet

 lord alester brushed filthy straw clothing “i… must apologize appearance ser chests lost lannisters overran camp escaped mail back rings fingers”

 still wears rings noted davos lacked even fingers

 “no doubt cook’s boy groom prancing around king’s landing slashed velvet doublet jeweled cloak” lord alester went oblivious “but war horrors men know doubt suffered losses”

 “my ship” said davos “all men four sons”

 “may the… may lord light lead darkness better world” man said

 may father judge justly mother grant mercy davos thought kept prayer seven place dragonstone

 “my son safe brightwater” lord went “but lost nephew fury ser imry brother ryam’s son”

 ser imry florent led blindly blackwater rush oars pulling paying heed small stone towers mouth river davos like forget “my son maric nephew’s oarmaster” remembered last sight fury engulfed wildfire “has word survivors”

 “the fury burned sank hands” lordship said “your son nephew lost countless good men war lost day ser”

 man defeated davos remembered melisandre’s talk embers ashes igniting great blazes small wonder ended “his grace never yield lord”

 “folly that’s folly” lord alester sat floor effort standing moment much “stannis baratheon never sit iron throne treason say truth bitter truth less true fleet gone save lyseni salladhor saan flee first sight lannister sail lords supported stannis gone joffrey died…”

 “even lords narrow sea lords sworn dragonstone”

 lord alester waved hand feebly “lord celtigar captured bent knee monford velaryon died ship red woman burned sunglass lord bar emmon fifteen fat feeble lords narrow sea strength house florent left stannis might highgarden sunspear casterly rock storm lords well best hope remains try salvage something peace meant gods good call treason”

 davos stood frowning “my lord do”

 “not treason never treason love grace much man niece queen remained loyal wiser men fled hand hand king traitor meant save lives and… honor… yes” licked lips “i penned letter salladhor saan swore man could get king’s landing lord tywin lordship a… man reason terms… terms fair… fair”

 “what terms lord”

 “it filthy here” lord alester said suddenly “and odor… odor”

 “the pail” said davos gesturing “we privy terms”

 lordship stared pail horror “that lord stannis give claim iron throne retract said joffrey’s bastardy condition accepted back king’s peace confirmed lord dragonstone storm’s end vowed return brightwater keep lands thought… lord tywin would see sense proposal still starks deal ironmen well offered seal bargain wedding shireen joffrey’s brother tommen” shook head “the terms… good ever like get even see surely”

 “yes” said davos “even me” unless stannis father son marriage would mean dragonstone storm’s end would one day pass tommen would doubtless please lord tywin meanwhile lannisters would shireen hostage make certain stannis raised new rebellions “and grace say proposed terms him”

 “he always red woman and… right mind fear talk stone dragon… madness tell sheer madness learn nothing aerion brightfire nine mages alchemists learn nothing summerhall good ever come dreams dragons told axell much way better surer stannis gave seal gave leave rule hand speaks king’s voice”

 “not this” davos courtier even try blunt words “it stannis yield long knows claim unsay words joffrey believes true marriage tommen born incest joffrey grace would sooner see shireen dead wed such”

 vein throbbed florent’s forehead “he choice”

 “you wrong lord choose die king”

 “and us desire onion knight”

 “no king’s man make peace without leave”

 lord alester stared helplessly long moment began weep





 jon


 last night fell black moonless sky clear “i going hill look ghost” told thenns cave mouth grunted let pass

 many stars thought trudged slope pines firs ash maester luwin taught stars boy winterfell learned names twelve houses heaven rulers could find seven wanderers sacred faith old friends ice dragon shadowcat moonmaid sword morning shared ygritte others look stars see different things king’s crown cradle hear tell stallion horned lord red wanderer septons preached sacred smith called thief thief moonmaid propitious time man steal woman ygritte insisted “like night stole thief bright night”

 “i never meant steal you” said “i never knew girl knife throat”

 “if kill man never mean t’ he’s dead” ygritte said stubbornly jon never met anyone stubborn except maybe little sister arya still sister wondered ever never truly stark lord eddard’s motherless bastard place winterfell theon greyjoy even he’d lost man night’s watch said words put aside old family joined new one jon snow lost brothers

 found ghost atop hill thought might white wolf never howled yet something drew heights would squat hindquarters hot breath rising white mist red eyes drank stars

 “do names well” jon asked went one knee beside direwolf scratched thick white fur neck “the hare doe shewolf” ghost licked face rough wet tongue rasping scabs eagle’s talons ripped jon’s cheek bird marked us thought “ghost” said quietly “on morrow go there’s steps cageandcrane way get side part understand”

 dark direwolf’s red eyes looked black nuzzled jon’s neck silent ever breath hot mist wildlings called jon snow warg poor one know put wolf skin way orell eagle he’d died jon dreamed ghost looking upon valley milkwater mance rayder gathered people dream turned true dreaming left words

 “you cannot come me” jon said cupping wolf’s head hands looking deep eyes “you go castle black understand castle black find way home follow ice east east sun you’ll find know castle black maybe coming warn them” thought writing warning ghost carry ink parchment even writing quill risk discovery great “i meet castle black get must hunt alone time alone”

 direwolf twisted free jon’s grasp ears pricked suddenly bounding away loped tangle brush leapt deadfall raced hillside pale streak among trees castle black jon wondered hare wished knew feared might prove poor warg sworn brother spy

 wind sighed trees rich smell pine needles tugging faded blacks jon could see wall looming high dark south great shadow blocking stars rough hilly ground made think must somewhere shadow tower castle black likely closer former days wending way south deep lakes stretched like long thin fingers along floors narrow valleys flint ridges pineclad hills jostled one another either side ground made slow riding offered easy concealment wishing approach wall unseen

 wildling raiders thought like us like

 something coming hill behind realized suddenly half heartbeat thought might ghost come back direwolf never made much noise jon drew longclaw single smooth motion one thenns broad man bronze helm “snow” intruder said “come magnar wants” men thenn spoke old tongue words common

 jon much care magnar wanted use arguing someone could scarcely understand followed man back hill

 arya rode harwin anguy outlaws moved streets father fought could see sept hill stout strong holdfast grey stone looked much small big town every third house passed blackened shell saw people “are townfolk dead”

 market square town’s heart stood fountain shape leaping trout spouting water shallow pool women filling pails flagons feet away dozen iron cages hung creaking wooden posts crow cages arya knew crows mostly outside cages splashing water perched atop bars inside men lem reined scowling “what’s now”

 “justice” answered woman fountain

 “beds got” said redhaired tansy “there’s never lack o’ beds peach you’ll climb tub first last time lot stayed roof left fleas behind” poked greenbeard chest “and green want food”

 “if spare won’t say no” tom conceded

 turning red “what then” demanded “a brothel’s fit place bloody highborn lady everybody knows that”

 one girls sat bench beside “who’s highborn lady little skinny one” looked arya laughed “i’m king’s daughter myself”

 arya knew mocked “you not”

 “well might be” girl shrugged gown slipped one shoulder “they say king robert fucked mother hid back battle didn’t girls leslyn says liked best”

 girl hair like old king’s arya thought great thick mop black coal doesn’t mean anything though gendry kind hair lots people black hair

 “i’m named bella” girl told gendry “for battle bet could ring bell want to”

 “no” said gruffly

 “i bet do” ran hand along arm “i don’t cost nothing friends thoros lightning lord”

 “no said” gendry rose abruptly stalked away table night

 bella turned arya “don’t like girls”

 arya shrugged “he’s stupid likes polish helmets beat swords hammers”

 “oh” bella tugged gown back shoulder went talk jackbelucky long sitting lap giggling drinking wine cup greenbeard two girls one knee anguy vanished frecklefaced wench lem gone well tom sevenstrings sat fire singing “the maids bloom spring” arya sipped cup watered wine redhaired woman allowed listening across square dead men rotting crow cages inside peach everyone jolly except seemed laughing hard somehow

 it’s true arya thought never would felt sad angry lonely

 old man sat beside “well aren’t pretty little peach” breath smelled near foul dead men cages little pig eyes crawling “does sweet peach name”

 half heartbeat forgot supposed wasn’t peach couldn’t arya stark either smelly drunk know “i’m…”

 “she’s sister” gendry put heavy hand old man’s shoulder squeezed “leave be”

 “why say that” arya hopped feet “you’re brother”

 “that’s right” said angrily “i’m bloody lowborn kin m’lady high”

 arya taken aback fury voice “that’s way meant it”

 “yes is” sat bench cradling cup wine hands “go away want drink wine peace maybe i’ll go find blackhaired girl ring bell her”

 “but…”

 “i said go away m’lady”

 arya whirled left stupid bullheaded bastard boy that’s could ring bells wanted nothing

 jon


 ghost gone wildlings led horses cave understand castle black jon took breath crisp morning air allowed hope eastern sky pink near horizon pale grey higher sword morning still hung south bright white star hilt blazing like diamond dawn blacks greys darkling forest turning greens golds reds russets soldier pines oaks ash sentinels stood wall ice pale glimmering beneath dust dirt pocked surface

 magnar sent dozen men riding west dozen east climb highest hills could find watch sign rangers wood riders high ice thenns carried bronzebanded warhorns give warning watch sighted wildlings fell behind jarl jon ygritte rest young raider’s hour glory

 wall often said stand seven hundred feet high jarl found place higher lower ice rose sheer trees like immense cliff crowned windcarved battlements loomed least eight hundred feet high perhaps nine hundred spots deceptive jon realized drew closer brandon builder laid huge foundation blocks along heights wherever feasible hereabouts hills rose wild rugged

 heard uncle benjen say wall sword east castle black snake west true sweeping one huge humped hill ice dipped valley climbed knife edge long granite ridgeline league ran along jagged crest dipped valley deeper still rose higher higher leaping hill hill far eye could see mountainous west

 jarl chosen assault stretch ice along ridge though top wall loomed eight hundred feet forest floor good third height earth stone rather ice slope steep horses almost difficult scramble fist first men still vastly easier ascend sheer vertical face wall ridge densely wooded well offering easy concealment brothers black gone every day axes cut back encroaching trees days long past forest grew right ice

 wall awe jarl’s raiders jon saw done every man jarl called names dismounted beneath ridge eleven gathered round young oldest could fiveandtwenty two ten younger jon every one lean hard though look sinewy strength reminded stonesnake brother halfhand sent afoot rattleshirt hunting

 shadow wall wildlings made ready winding thick coils hempen rope around one shoulder across chests lacing queer boots supple doeskin boots spikes jutting toes iron jarl two others bronze often jagged bone small stoneheaded hammers hung one hip leathern bag stakes ice axes antlers sharpened tines bound wooden hafts strips hide eleven climbers sorted three teams four jarl made twelfth man “mance promises swords every man first team reach top” told breath misting cold air “southron swords castleforged steel name song he’ll make could free man ask others take hindmost”

 others take thought jon watched scramble steep slope ridge vanish beneath trees would first time wildlings scaled wall even hundred first patrols stumbled climbers two three times year rangers sometimes came broken corpses fallen along east coast raiders often built boats slip across bay seals west would descend black depths gorge make way around shadow tower way defeat wall go many raider fewer come back though thought certain grim pride climbers must necessity leave mounts behind many younger greener raiders began taking first horses found hue cry would go ravens would fly often night’s watch would hunt hang could get back plunder stolen women jarl would make mistake jon knew wondered styr magnar ruler raider may know game played

 “there are” ygritte said jon glanced see first climber emerge treetops jarl found sentinel tree leaned wall led men trunk get quicker start wood never allowed creep close they’re three hundred feet haven’t touched ice yet

 watched wildling move carefully wood wall hacking handhold short sharp blows ice axe swinging rope around waist tied second man line still edging tree step slow step jarl moved higher kicking toeholds spiked boots natural ones found ten feet sentinel stopped upon narrow icy ledge slung axe belt took hammer drove iron stake cleft second man moved onto wall behind third scrambling top tree

 two teams happily placed trees give leg long thenns wondering whether gotten lost climbing ridge jarl’s party wall eighty feet leading climbers groups came view teams spaced good twenty yards apart jarl’s four center right team headed grigg goat whose long blond braid made easy spot left thin man named errok led climbers

 “so slow” magnar complained loudly watched edge way upward “has forgotten crows climb faster afore discovered”

 jon hold tongue remembered skirling pass well moonlight climb he’d made stonesnake swallowed heart halfdozen times night end arms legs aching fingers half frozen stone ice stone solid ice treacherous stuff best times day like wall weeping warmth climber’s hand might enough melt huge blocks could frozen rockhard inside outer surface would slick runnels water trickling patches rotten ice air gotten whatever else wildlings they’re brave

 jon found hoping styr’s fears proved well founded gods good patrol chance put end “no wall keep safe” father told walked walls winterfell “a wall strong men defend it” wildlings might hundred twenty men four defenders would enough see wellplaced arrows perhaps pail stones

 defenders appeared however four even one sun climbed sky wildlings climbed wall jarl’s four remained well ahead till noon hit pitch bad ice jarl looped rope around windcarved pinnace using support weight whole jagged thing suddenly crumbled came crashing chunks ice big man’s head bombarded three clung handholds stakes held jarl jerked sudden halt end rope

 time team recovered mischance grigg goat almost drawn even errok’s four remained well behind face climbing looked smooth unpitted covered sheet icemelt glistened wetly sun brushed grigg’s section darker eye obvious features long horizontal ledges block imperfectly positioned atop block cracks crevices even chimneys along vertical joins wind water eaten holes large enough man hide

 jarl soon men edging upward four grigg’s moved almost side side errok’s fifty feet deerhorn axes chopped hacked sending showers glittery shards cascading onto trees stone hammers pounded stakes deep ice serve anchors ropes iron stakes ran halfway climbers used horn sharpened bone men kicked driving spikes boots hard unyielding ice make one foothold legs must numb jon thought fourth hour long keep watched restless magnar listening distant moan thenn warhorn horns stayed silent sign night’s watch

 sixth hour jarl moved ahead grigg goat men widening gap “the mance’s pet must want sword” magnar said shading eyes sun high sky upper third wall crystalline blue reflecting brilliantly hurt eyes look jarl’s four grigg’s lost glare though errok’s team still shadow instead moving upward edging way sideways five hundred feet making chimney jon watching inch along heard sound—a sudden crack seemed roll along ice followed shout alarm air full shards shrieks falling men sheet ice foot thick fifty feet square broke wall came tumbling crumbling rumbling sweeping even foot ridge chunks came spinning trees rolling slope jon grabbed ygritte pulled shield one thenns struck face chunk broke nose

 looked jarl team gone men ropes stakes gone nothing remained six hundred feet wound wall climbers clung half heartbeat ice within smooth white polished marble shining sun far far faint red smear someone smashed frozen pinnace

 found jarl tree impaled upon splintered branch still roped three men lay broken beneath one still alive legs spine shattered ribs well “mercy” said came upon one thenns smashed head big stone mace magnar gave orders men began gather fuel pyre

 dead burning grigg goat reached top wall time errok’s four joined nothing remained jarl team bone ash

 “why crying then”

 “not fear” kicked savagely ice beneath heel chopping chunk “i’m crying never found horn winter opened half hundred graves let shades loose world never found horn joramun bring cold thing down”





 jaime


 hand burned

 still still long snuffed torch they’d used sear bloody stump days could still feel fire lancing arm fingers twisting flames fingers longer

 taken wounds never like never known could pain sometimes unbidden old prayers bubbled lips prayers learned child never thought since prayers first prayed cersei kneeling beside sept casterly rock sometimes even wept heard mummers laughing made eyes go dry heart go dead prayed fever burn away tears know tyrion felt times laughed

 second time fell saddle bound tight brienne tarth made share horse one day instead back front bound facetoface “the lovers” shagwell sighed loudly “and lovely sight ’twould cruel separate good knight lady” laughed high shrill laugh said “ah one knight one lady”

 hand you’d learn soon enough jaime thought arms ached legs numb ropes none mattered world shrunk throb agony phantom hand brienne pressed she’s warm least consoled though wench’s breath foul

 hand always urswyck hung neck cord dangled chest slapping brienne’s breasts jaime slipped consciousness right eye swollen shut wound inflamed brienne cut fight hand hurt blood pus seeped stump missing hand throbbed every time horse took step

 throat raw could eat drank wine gave water offered handed cup quaffed straight away trembling brave companions burst laughter loud harsh hurt ears “that’s horse piss you’re drinking kingslayer” rorge told jaime thirsty drank anyway afterward retched back made brienne wash vomit beard made clean soiled saddle

 one damp cold morning feeling slightly stronger madness took hold reached dornishman’s sword left hand wrenched clumsily scabbard let kill thought long die fighting blade hand good shagwell came hopping leg leg dancing nimbly aside jaime slashed unbalanced staggered forward hacking wildly fool shagwell spun ducked darted mummers laughing jaime’s futile efforts land blow tripped rock stumbled knees fool leapt planted wet kiss atop head

 rorge finally flung aside kicked sword jaime’s feeble fingers tried bring “that wath amuthing kingthlayer” said vargo hoat “but try thall take hand perhapth foot”

 jaime lay back afterward staring night sky trying feel pain snaked right arm every time moved night strangely beautiful moon graceful crescent seemed though never seen many stars king’s crown zenith could see stallion rearing swan moonmaid shy ever halfhidden behind pine tree night beautiful asked would stars want look

 “jaime” brienne whispered faintly thought dreaming “jaime doing”

 “dying” whispered back

 “no” said “no must live”

 wanted laugh “stop telling wench i’ll die pleases me”

 “are craven”

 word shocked jaime lannister knight kingsguard kingslayer man ever called craven things called yes oathbreaker liar murderer said cruel treacherous reckless never craven “what else die”

 “live” said “live fight take revenge” spoke loudly rorge heard voice words came kick shouting hold bloody tongue wanted keep

 craven jaime thought brienne fought stifle moans took sword hand sword hand gods good true

 wench right could die cersei waiting would need tyrion little brother loved lie enemies waiting young wolf beaten whispering wood killed men around edmure tully kept darkness chains brave companions

 morning came made eat fed mush oats horse food forced every spoon ate evenfall next day live told harshly mush like gag live cersei live tyrion live vengeance lannister always pays debts missing hand throbbed burned stank reach king’s landing i’ll new hand forged golden hand one day i’ll use rip vargo hoat’s throat

 days nights blurred together haze pain would sleep saddle pressed brienne nose full stink rotting hand night would lie awake hard ground caught waking nightmare weak always bound tree gave cold consolation know feared much even

 brienne always bound beside lay bonds like big dead cow saying word wench built fortress inside rape soon enough behind walls cannot touch jaime’s walls gone taken hand taken sword hand without nothing good since time could walk left arm shield arm right hand made knight right arm made man

 one day heard urswyck say something harrenhal remembered destination made laugh aloud made timeon slash face long thin whip cut bled beside hand scarcely felt “why laugh” wench asked night whisper

 “harrenhal gave white cloak” whispered back “whent’s great tourney wanted show us big castle fine sons wanted show fifteen one could beaten day aerys never let joust” laughed “he sent away i’m coming back”

 heard laugh night jaime got kicks punches hardly felt either rorge slammed boot stump fainted

 next night finally came three worst shagwell noseless rorge fat dothraki zollo one who’d cut hand zollo rorge arguing would go first approached seemed question fool would going last shagwell suggested go first take front rear zollo rorge liked notion began fight would get front rear

 leave cripple inside show “wench” whispered zollo rorge cursing one another “let meat go far away quicker they’ll get less pleasure it”

 “they’ll get pleasure i’ll give them” whispered back defiant

 stupid stubborn brave bitch going get good killed knew care hadn’t pigheaded i’d still hand yet heard whisper “let go away inside” he’d done starks died lord rickard cooking armor son brandon strangled trying save “think renly loved think tarth mountains seas pools waterfalls whatever sapphire isle think…”

 rorge argument “you’re ugliest woman ever seen” told brienne “but don’t think can’t make uglier want nose like mine fight you’ll get one two eyes that’s many one scream o’ i’ll pop one make eat i’ll pull fucking teeth one one”

 “oh rorge” pleaded shagwell “without teeth she’ll look like dear old mother” cackled “and always wanted fuck dear old mother arse”

 jaime chuckled “there’s funny fool riddle shagwell care screams oh wait know” shouted “sapphires” loudly could

 cursing rorge kicked stump jaime howled never knew agony world last thing remembered thinking hard say long gone pain spit urswyck vargo hoat “thee’th touched” goat screamed spraying spittle zollo “thee hath maid foolth thee’th worth bag thapphireth” every night hoat put guards protect

 two nights passed silence wench finally found courage whisper “jaime shout out”

 “why shout ‘sapphires’ mean use wits wench would lot cared shouted ‘rape’

 “you need shout all”

 “you’re hard enough look nose besides wanted make goat say ‘thapphireth’” chuckled “a good thing i’m liar honorable man would told truth sapphire isle”

 “all same” said “i thank ser”

 hand throbbing ground teeth said “a lannister pays debts river rocks dropped robin ryger”

 goat wanted make show parading jaime made dismount mile gates harrenhal rope looped around waist second around brienne’s wrists ends tied pommel vargo hoat’s saddle stumbled along side side behind qohorik’s striped zorse

 jaime’s rage kept walking linen covered stump grey stinking pus phantom fingers screamed every step stronger know told still lannister still knight kingsguard would reach harrenhal king’s landing would live pay debt interest

 approached clifflike walls black harren’s monstrous castle brienne squeezed arm “lord bolton holds castle boltons bannermen starks”

 “the boltons skin enemies” jaime remembered much northman tyrion would known know lord dreadfort tyrion thousand leagues away cersei cannot die cersei lives told die together born together

 castleton outside walls burned ash blackened stone many men horses recently encamped beside lakeshore lord whent staged great tourney year false spring bitter smile touched jaime’s lips crossed torn ground someone dug privy trench spot he’d knelt king say vows never dreamed quick sweet would turn sour aerys would even let savor one night honored spat

 “the banners” brienne observed “flayed man twin towers see king robb’s sworn men gatehouse grey white fly direwolf”

 jaime twisted head upward look “that’s bloody wolf true enough” granted “and heads either side it”

 soldiers servants camp followers gathered hoot spotted bitch followed camps barking growling one lyseni impaled lance galloped front column “i bearing kingslayer’s banner” shouted shaking dead dog jaime’s head

 walls harrenhal thick passing beneath like passing stone tunnel vargo hoat sent two dothraki ahead inform lord bolton coming outer ward full curious gave way jaime staggered past rope around waist jerking pulling whenever slowed “i give kingthlayer” vargo hoat proclaimed thick slobbery voice spear jabbed small jaime’s back sending sprawling

 instinct made put hands stop fall stump smashed ground pain blinding yet somehow managed fight way back one knee flight broad stone steps led entrance one harrenhal’s colossal round towers five knights northman stood looking one paleeyed wool fur five fierce mail plate twin towers sigil surcoats “a fury freys” jaime declared “ser danwell ser aenys ser hosteen” knew lord walder’s sons sight aunt married one “you condolences”

 “for ser” ser danwell frey asked

 “your brother’s son ser cleos” said jaime “he us outlaws filled full arrows urswyck lot took goods left wolves”

 “my lords” brienne wrenched free pushed forward “i saw banners hear oath”

 “who speaks” demanded ser aenys frey

 “lannither’th wet nurth”

 “i brienne tarth daughter lord selwyn evenstar sworn house stark even are”

 ser aenys spit feet “that’s oaths trusted word robb stark repaid faith betrayal”

 interesting jaime twisted see brienne might take accusation wench singleminded mule bit teeth “i know betrayal” chafed ropes around wrists “lady catelyn commanded deliver lannister brother king’s landing—”

 tyrion


 nothing remained beyond king’s gate mud ashes bits burned bone yet already people living shadow city walls others selling fish barrows barrels tyrion felt eyes rode past chilly eyes angry unsympathetic one dared speak try bar way bronn beside oiled black mail alone though would pull smash face cobblestone preston greenfield

 “they come back quicker rats” complained “we burned you’d think they’d take lesson”

 “give dozen gold cloaks i’ll kill all” said bronn “once they’re dead don’t come back”

 “you mistake father king’s hand longer even finger fear”

 “you shall rise sure man like sweet lady shae tells newly wed would sent earlier honored sing feast”

 “the last thing wife needs songs” said tyrion “as shae know lady would thank never speak name aloud”

 “as hand commands” symon said

 last time tyrion seen man sharp word enough set sweating seemed singer found courage somewhere like flagon perhaps tyrion blame new boldness threatened nothing ever came threat believes toothless sighed “i told gifted singer”

 “you kind say lord”

 tyrion gave smile “i think time brought music free cities great lovers song braavos pentos lys generous please them” took sip wine foul stuff strong “a tour nine cities would best wouldn’t want deny anyone joy hearing sing year suffice” reached inside cloak gold hidden “with port closed need go duskendale take ship man bronn find horse would honored would let pay passage…”

 “but lord” man objected “you never heard sing pray listen moment” fingers moved deftly strings woodharp soft music filled cellar symon began sing

 “there’s more” man said broke “oh good deal refrain especially nice think hands gold always cold woman’s hands warm…”

 “enough” tyrion slid fingers cloak empty “that’s song would care hear ever”

 “no” symon silver tongue put harp aside took sip wine “a pity still man song old master used say teaching play others might like tune better queen perhaps lord father”

 tyrion rubbed scar nose said “my father time singers sister generous one might think wise man could earn silence song” could put much plainer

 symon seemed take meaning quick enough “you find price modest lord”

 “that’s good know” would matter thirty golden dragons tyrion feared “tell me”

 “at king joffrey’s wedding feast” man said “there tournament singers”

 “and jugglers jesters dancing bears”

 “only one dancing bear lord” said symon plainly attended cersei’s arrangements far interest tyrion “but seven singers galyeon cuy bethany fairfingers aemon costayne alaric eysen hamish harper collio quaynis orland oldtown compete gilded lute silver strings… yet unaccountably invitation forthcoming one master all”

 “let guess symon silver tongue”

 symon smiled modestly “i prepared prove truth boast king court hamish old oft forgets singing collio absurd tyroshi accent understand one word three count fortunate”

 “my sweet sister arranged feast even could secure invitation might look queer seven kingdoms seven vows seven challenges seventyseven dishes… eight singers would high septon think”

 “you strike pious man lord”

 “piety point certain forms must observed”

 symon took sip wine “still… singer’s life without peril ply trade alehouses wine sinks unruly drunkards one sister’s seven suffer mishap hope might consider fill place” smiled slyly inordinately pleased

 “six singers would unfortunate eight sure inquire health cersei’s seven indisposed man bronn find you”

 “very good lord” symon might left flushed triumph added “i shall sing night king joffrey’s wedding happen called court want offer king best compositions songs sung thousand times certain please find singing dreary winesink though… well would apt occasion try new song hands gold always cold woman’s hands warm”

 “that necessary” said tyrion “you word lannister bronn call upon soon”

 “very good lord” balding kettlebellied singer took woodharp

 bronn waiting horses mouth alley helped tyrion saddle “when take man duskendale”

 “you don’t” tyrion turned horse “give three days inform hamish harper broken arm tell clothes never serve court must fitted new garb he’ll come quick enough” grimaced “you may want tongue understand it’s made silver rest never found”

 bronn grinned “there’s pot shop know flea bottom makes savory bowl brown kinds meat hear”

 “make certain never eat there” tyrion spurred trot wanted bath hotter better

 even modest pleasure denied however sooner returned chambers podrick payne informed summoned tower hand “his lordship wants see hand lord tywin”

 “i recall hand pod” tyrion said “i lost nose wits”

 bronn laughed “don’t bite boy’s head now”

 “why never uses it” tyrion wondered he’d done like failed summons lord tywin always teeth father never sent share meal cup wine certain

 entered lord father’s solar moments later heard voice saying “…cherrywood scabbards bound red leather ornamented row lion’shead studs pure gold perhaps garnets eyes…”

 “rubies” lord tywin said “garnets lack fire”

 tyrion cleared throat “my lord sent me”

 father glanced “i come look this” bundle oilcloth lay table lord tywin longsword hand “a wedding gift joffrey” told tyrion light streaming diamondshaped panes glass made blade shimmer black red lord tywin turned inspect edge pommel crossguard flamed gold “with fool’s jabber stannis magic sword seemed best give joffrey something extraordinary well king bear kingly weapon”

 “that’s much much sword joff” tyrion said

 “he grow feel weight it” offered weapon hilt first

 sword much lighter expected turned hand saw one metal could beaten thin still strength enough fight mistaking ripples mark steel folded back many thousands times “valyrian steel”

 “yes” lord tywin said tone deep satisfaction

 long last father valyrian steel blades scarce costly yet thousands remained world perhaps two hundred seven kingdoms alone always irked father none belonged house lannister old kings rock owned weapon greatsword brightroar lost second king tommen carried back valyria fool’s quest never returned uncle gery youngest reckless father’s brothers gone seeking lost sword eight years past

 thrice least lord tywin offered buy valyrian longswords impoverished lesser houses advances always firmly rebuffed little lordlings would gladly part daughters lannister come asking cherished old family swords

 tyrion wondered metal one come master armorers could rework old valyrian steel secrets making lost doom came old valyria “the colors strange” commented turned blade sunlight valyrian steel grey dark looked almost black true well blended folds red deep grey two colors lapped one another without ever touching ripple distinct like waves night blood upon steely shore “how get patterning i’ve never seen anything like it”

 “nor lord” said armorer “i confess colors intended know could duplicate lord father asked crimson house color set infuse metal valyrian steel stubborn old swords remember said change easily worked half hundred spells brightened red time time always color would darken blade drinking sun folds would take red see lords lannister displeased course try many times require but—”

 “no need” lord tywin said “this serve”

 “a crimson sword might flash prettily sun truth told like colors better” said tyrion “they ominous beauty… make blade unique sword like world think”

 “there one” armorer bent table unfolded bundle oilcloth reveal second longsword

 tyrion put joffrey’s sword took twins two least close cousins one thicker heavier halfinch wider three inches longer shared fine clean lines distinctive color ripples blood night three fullers deeply incised ran second blade hilt point king’s sword two joff’s hilt good deal ornate arms crossguard done lions’ paws ruby claws unsheathed swords grips finely tooled red leather gold lions’ heads pommels

 “magnificent” even hands unskilled tyrion’s blade felt alive “i never felt better balance”

 “it meant son”

 need ask son tyrion placed jaime’s sword back table beside joffrey’s wondering robb stark would let brother live long enough wield father must surely think else blade forged

 “you done good work master mott” lord tywin told armorer “my steward see payment remember rubies scabbards”

 “i shall lord generous” man folded swords oilcloth tucked bundle one arm went knee “it honor serve king’s hand shall deliver swords day wedding”

 “see do”

 guards seen armorer tyrion clambered onto chair “so… sword joff sword jaime even dagger dwarf way father”

 “the steel sufficient two blades three need dagger take one armory robert left hundred died gerion gave gilded dagger ivory grip sapphire pommel wedding gift half envoys came court tried curry favor presenting grace jewelencrusted knives silver inlay swords”

 tyrion smiled “they’d pleased they’d presented daughters”

 “no doubt blade ever used hunting knife jon arryn boy” lord tywin waved hand dismissing king robert knives “what find riverfront”

 “mud” said tyrion “and dead things one’s bothered bury open port blackwater’s going dredged sunken ships broken raised threequarters quays need repair may torn rebuilt entire fish market gone river gate king’s gate splintered battering stannis gave replaced shudder think cost” shit gold father find privy get busy wanted say knew better

 “you find whatever gold required”

 “will treasury empty i’ve told we’re done paying alchemists wildfire smiths chain cersei’s pledged crown pay half costs joff’s wedding—seventyseven bloody courses thousand guests pie full doves singers jugglers…”

 “extravagance uses must demonstrate power wealth casterly rock realm see”

 “then perhaps casterly rock pay”

 “why seen littlefinger’s accounts crown incomes ten times higher aerys”

 “as crown’s expenses robert generous coin cock littlefinger borrowed heavily amongst others yes incomes considerable barely sufficient cover usury littlefinger’s loans forgive throne’s debt house lannister”

 “don’t absurd”

 “then perhaps seven courses would suffice three hundred guests instead thousand understand marriage binding without dancing bear”

 “the tyrells would think us niggardly wedding waterfront cannot pay say shall find master coin can”

 disgrace dismissed short time something tyrion cared suffer “i find money”

 “you will” father promised “and see find wife’s bed well”

 talk reached even “i thank it’s piece furniture window hearth velvet canopy mattress stuffed goose down”

 “i pleased know perhaps ought try know woman shares you”

 woman child mean “has spider whispering ear sweet sister thank” considering things went beneath cersei’s blankets would think she’d decency keep nose “tell sansa’s maids arc women cersei’s service sick spied upon chambers”

 “if mislike wife’s servants dismiss hire ones liking right wife’s maidenhood concerns maids this… delicacy puzzles seem difficulty bedding whores stark girl made differently”

 “why take much bloody interest put cock” tyrion demanded “sansa young”

 “she old enough lady winterfell brother dead claim maidenhood one step closer claiming north get child prize need remind marriage consummated set aside”

 “by high septon council faith present high septon trained seal barks prettily command moon boy like annul marriage is”

 “perhaps married sansa stark moon boy might known her”

 tyrion’s hands clenched arms chair “i heard mean hear subject wife’s maidenhead long discussing marriage hear nothing sister’s impending nuptials recall—”

 lord tywin cut “mace tyrell refused offer marry cersei heir willas”

 “refused sweet cersei” put tyrion much better mood

 “when first broached match lord tyrell seemed well enough disposed” father said “a day later changed old woman’s work hectors son unmercifully varys claims told sister old used precious onelegged grandson hers”

 “cersei must loved that” laughed

 lord tywin gave chilly look “she know better us offer never made see remember tyrion offer never made”

 “what offer” tyrion rather suspected lord tyrell might come regret rebuff

 “your sister wed question several thoughts—” could get rap door guardsman stuck head announce grand maester pycelle “he may enter” said lord tywin

 pycelle tottered cane stopped long enough give tyrion look would curdle milk oncemagnificent white beard someone unaccountably shaved growing back sparse wispy leaving unsightly pink wattles dangle beneath neck “my lord hand” old man said bowing deeply could without falling “there another bird castle black mayhaps could consult privily”

 “there’s need that” lord tywin waved grand maester pycelle seat “tyrion may stay”

 oooooh may rubbed nose waited

 pycelle cleared throat involved deal coughing hawking “the letter bowen marsh sent last castellan writes lord mormont sent word wildlings moving south vast numbers”

 “the lands beyond wall cannot support vast numbers” said lord tywin firmly “this warning new”

 “this last lord mormont sent bird haunted forest report attack ravens returned since none letters bowen marsh fears lord mormont slain strength”

 tyrion rather liked old jeor mormont gruff manner talking bird “is certain” asked

 “it not” pycelle admitted “but none mormont’s men returned yet marsh fears wildlings killed wall may attacked next” fumbled robe found paper “here letter lord plea five kings wants men many men send him”

 “five kings” father annoyed “there one king westeros fools black might try remember wish grace heed reply tell renly dead others traitors pretenders”

 “no doubt glad learn wall world apart news oft reaches late” pycelle bobbed head “what shall tell marsh concerning men begs shall convene council…”

 “there need night’s watch pack thieves killers baseborn churls occurs could prove otherwise given proper discipline mormont indeed dead black brothers must choose new lord commander”

 pycelle gave tyrion sly glance “an excellent thought lord know man janos slynt”

 tyrion liked notion “the black brothers choose commander” reminded “lord slynt new wall know sent pick dozen senior men”

 “because” father said tone suggested tyrion quite simpleton “if vote told wall melt sees another man”

 yes would work tyrion hitched forward “janos slynt wrong man father we’d better commander shadow tower eastwatchbythesea”

 “the commander shadow tower mallister seagard eastwatch held ironman” neither would serve purposes lord tywin’s tone said clear enough

 “janos slynt butcher’s son” tyrion reminded father forcefully “you told me—”

 “i recall told castle black harrenhal however night’s watch king’s council tool every task task every tool”

 tyrion’s anger flashed “lord janos hollow suit armor sell highest bidder”

 “i count point favor like bid higher us” turned pycelle “send raven write king joffrey deeply saddened hear lord commander mormont’s death regrets spare men whilst many rebels usurpers remain field suggest matters might quite different throne secure… provided king full confidence leadership watch closing ask marsh pass along grace’s fondest regards faithful friend servant lord janos slynt”

 enough sam thought craster’s sloping palisades mud melting snow would hardly slow wights who’d climbed much steeper slopes fist swarm ringwall instead three hundred brothers drawn disciplined ranks meet wights would find fortyone ragged survivors nine badly hurt fight fortyfour come straggling craster’s storm sixtyodd who’d cut way free fist three died wounds bannen would soon make four

 “do think wights gone” sam asked grenn “why don’t come finish us”

 “they come it’s cold”

 “yes” said sam “but cold brings wights wights bring cold”

 “who cares” grenn’s axe sent wood chips flying “they come together that’s matters hey know dragonglass kills maybe won’t come maybe they’re frightened us now”

 “me” sam got awkwardly feet

 “me” raven landed old man’s head “me”

 “the mmaesters think not” sam stammered “the maesters say comes fires earth call obsidian”

 mormont snorted “they call lemon pie care kills claim want it”

 sam stumbled “jon found fist hundreds arrowheads spearheads well…”

 “so said small good us reach fist we’d need armed weapons won’t reach bloody fist still wildlings deal need find dragonglass someplace else”

 sam almost forgotten wildlings much happened since “the children forest used dragonglass blades” said “they’d know find obsidian”

 “the children forest dead” said mormont “the first men killed half bronze blades andals finished job iron glass dagger should—”

 old bear broke craster emerged deerhide flaps door wildling smiled revealing mouth brown rotten teeth “i son”

 “she wants come” sam said “she begged me…”

 mormont raised hand “i hear tarly you’ve told told stay well away craster’s wives”

 “his wound…” said sam

 “bugger wound” dirk prodded corpse foot “his foot hurt knew man back village lost foot lived nineandforty”

 seven chosen push funereal boat water honor seven faces god robb one lord hoster’s liege lord lords bracken blackwood vance mallister ser marq piper… lame lothar frey come twins answer awaited forty soldiers rode escort commanded walder rivers eldest lord walder’s bastard brood stern greyhaired man formidable reputation warrior arrival coming within hours lord hoster’s passing sent edmure rage “walder frey flayed quartered” he’d shouted “he sends cripple bastard treat us tell insult meant that”

 “i doubt lord walder chose envoys care” replied “it peevish thing petty sort revenge remember dealing late lord frey father used call man illtempered envious prideful”

 blessedly son shown better sense brother robb greeted freys every courtesy found barracks space escort quietly asked ser desmond grell stand aside lothar might honor helping send lord hoster last voyage learned rough wisdom beyond years son house frey might abandoned king north lord crossing remained powerful riverrun’s bannermen lothar stead

 seven launched lord hoster water stair wading steps portcullis winched upward lothar frey softbodied portly man breathing heavily shoved boat current jason mallister tytos blackwood prow stood chest deep river guide way

 catelyn watched battlements waiting watching waited watched many times beneath swift wild tumblestone plunged like spear side broad red fork bluewhite current churning muddy redbrown flow greater river morning mist hung water thin gossamer wisps memory

 bran rickon waiting catelyn thought sadly used wait

 slim boat drifted red stone arch water gate picking speed caught headlong rush tumblestone pushed tumult waters met boat emerged beneath high sheltering walls castle square sail filled wind catelyn saw sunlight flashing father’s helm lord hoster tully’s rudder held true sailed serenely center channel rising sun

 “now” uncle urged beside brother edmure—lord edmure truth long would take grow used to—nocked arrow bowstring squire held brand point edmure waited flame caught lifted great bow drew string ear let fly deep thrum arrow sped upward catelyn followed flight eyes heart plunged water soft hiss well astern lord hoster’s boat

 edmure cursed softly “the wind” said pulling second arrow “again” brand kissed oilsoaked rag behind arrowhead flames went licking edmure lifted pulled released high far arrow flew far vanished river dozen yards beyond boat fire winking instant flush creeping edmure’s neck red beard “once more” commanded taking third arrow quiver tight bowstring catelyn thought

 ser brynden must seen thing “let lord” offered

 “i it” edmure insisted let light arrow jerked bow took deep breath drew back arrow long moment seemed hesitate fire crept shaft crackling finally released arrow flashed finally curved falling falling… hissing past billowing sail

 narrow miss handspan yet miss “the others take it” brother swore boat almost range drifting among river mists wordless edmure thrust bow uncle

 “swiftly” ser brynden said nocked arrow held steady brand drew released catelyn quite sure fire caught… shot rose saw flames trailing air pale orange pennon boat vanished mists falling flaming arrow swallowed well… heartbeat sudden hope saw red bloom flower sails took fire fog glowed pink orange moment catelyn saw outline boat clearly wreathed leaping flames

 watch little cat could hear whisper

 catelyn reached blindly groping brother’s hand edmure moved away stand alone highest point battlements uncle brynden took hand instead twining strong fingers together watched little fire grow smaller burning boat receded distance

 gone… drifting downriver still perhaps broken sinking weight armor would carry lord hoster rest soft mud riverbed watery halls tullys held eternal court schools fish last attendants

 sooner burning boat vanished sight edmure walked catelyn would liked embrace moment sit hour night turn moon speak dead mourn yet knew well time lord riverrun knights falling around murmuring condolences promises fealty walling something small sister’s grief edmure listened hearing none words

 “it disgrace miss shot” uncle told quietly “edmure hear day lord father went downriver hoster missed well”

 “with first shaft” catelyn young remember lord hoster often told tale “his second found sail” sighed edmure strong seemed father’s death mercy came last even brother taken hard

 last night cups broken wept full regrets things undone words unsaid ought never ridden fight battle fords told tearfully stayed father’s bedside “i were” said “did speak end tell true cat ask me”

 lord hoster’s last word “tansy” catelyn could bring tell “he whispered name” lied brother nodded gratefully kissed hand tried drown grief guilt might able bend bow thought sighing something else dare say

 blackfish escorted battlements robb stood among bannermen young queen side saw son took silently arms

 “lord hoster looked noble king lady” murmured jeyne “would given chance know him”

 “and know better” added robb

 “he would wished too” said catelyn “there many leagues riverrun winterfell” many mountains rivers armies riverrun eyrie would seem lysa made reply letter

 king’s landing came silence well hoped brienne ser cleos would reached city captive might even brienne way back girls ser cleos swore would make imp send raven trade made swore ravens always win bowman could brought bird roasted supper letter would set heart ease might even lying ashes campfire beside pile raven bones

 others waiting offer robb consolations catelyn stood aside patiently lord jason mallister greatjon ser rolph spicer spoke turn lothar frey approached gave sleeve tug robb turned waited hear lothar would say

 “your grace” plump man middle thirties lothar frey closeset eyes pointed beard dark hair fell shoulders ringlets leg twisted birth earned name lame lothar served father’s steward past dozen years “we loath intrude upon grief perhaps might grant us audience tonight”

 “it would pleasure” said robb “it never wish sow enmity us”

 “nor mine cause it” said queen jeyne

 lothar frey smiled “i understand lord father instructed say young well remembers like lose one’s heart beauty”

 catelyn doubted much lord walder said thing ever lost heart beauty lord crossing outlived seven wives wed eighth spoke bedwarmers brood mares still words fairly spoken could scarce object compliment robb “your father gracious” said “i shall look forward talk”

 lothar bowed kissed queen’s hand withdrew dozen others gathered word robb spoke giving thanks smile needed last done turn back catelyn “there something must speak walk me”

 “as command grace”

 “that wasn’t command mother”

 “it pleasure then” son treated kindly enough since returning riverrun yet seldom sought comfortable young queen could scarcely blame jeyne makes smile nothing share grief seemed enjoy company bride’s brothers well young rollam squire ser raynald standardbearer standing boots he’s lost catelyn realized watched together rollam taken bran’s place raynald part theon part jon snow westerlings see robb smile hear laugh like boy others always king north head bowed beneath weight crown even brows bare

 robb kissed wife gently promised see chambers went lady mother steps led toward godswood “lothar seemed amiable that’s hopeful sign need freys”

 “that mean shall them”

 nodded glumness face slope shoulders made heart go crown crushing thought wants much good king brave honorable clever weight much boy bear robb could yet still blows kept falling one relentless brought word battle duskendale lord randyll tarly shattered robett glover ser helman tallhart might expected rage instead he’d stared dumb disbelief said “duskendale narrow sea would go duskendale” he’d shook head bewildered “a third foot lost duskendale”

 “the ironmen castle lannisters hold brother” galbart glover said voice thick despair robett glover survived battle captured near kingsroad long

 “not long” son promised “i offer martyn lannister exchange lord tywin accept brother’s sake” martyn ser kevan’s son twin willem lord karstark butchered murders still haunted son catelyn knew tripled guard around martyn still feared safety

 “i traded kingslayer sansa first urged it” robb said walked gallery “if i’d offered wed knight flowers tyrells might instead joffrey’s thought that”

 “your mind battles rightly even king cannot think everything”

 “battles” muttered robb led beneath trees “i every battle yet somehow i’m losing war” looked answer might written sky “the ironmen hold winterfell moat cailin father’s dead bran rickon maybe arya father too”

 could let despair knew taste draught well “my father dying long time could changed made mistakes robb king ned would proud you”

 “mother something must know”

 catelyn’s heart skipped beat something hates something dreads tell could think brienne mission “is kingslayer”

 “no it’s sansa”

 she’s dead catelyn thought brienne failed jaime dead cersei killed sweet girl retribution moment could barely speak “is… gone robb”

 “gone” looked startled “dead oh mother haven’t harmed way only… bird came last night couldn’t bring tell father sent rest” robb took hand “they married tyrion lannister”

 catelyn’s fingers clutched “the imp”

 “yes”

 “he swore trade brother” said numbly “sansa arya would back returned precious jaime swore whole court could marry saying sight gods men”

 “he’s kingslayer’s brother oathbreaking runs blood” robb’s fingers brushed pommel sword “if could i’d take ugly head sansa would widow free there’s way see made speak vows septon crimson cloak”

 catelyn remembered twisted little man seized crossroads inn carried way eyrie “i let lysa push moon door poor sweet sansa… would anyone her”

 “for winterfell” robb said “with bran rickon dead sansa heir anything happen me…”

 clutched tight hand “nothing happen nothing could stand took ned sweet brothers sansa married arya lost father’s dead… anything befell would go mad robb left north left”

 “i dead yet mother”

 suddenly catelyn full dread “wars need fought last drop blood” even could hear desperation voice “you would first king bend knee even first stark”

 mouth tightened “no never”

 “there shame balon greyjoy bent knee robert rebellion failed torrhen stark bent knee aegon conqueror rather see army face fires”

 “did aegon kill king torrhen’s father” pulled hand “never said”

 playing boy king “the lannisters need north require homage hostages more… imp keep sansa matter hostage ironmen prove implacable enemy promise hope holding north greyjoys must leave single sprig house stark alive dispute right theon’s murdered bran rickon need kill you… jeyne yes think lord balon afford let live bear heirs”

 robb’s face cold “is freed kingslayer make peace lannisters”

 “i freed jaime sansa’s sake… arya’s still lives know nurtured hope buying peace well ill”

 “yes” said “the lannisters killed father”

 “do think forgotten that”

 “i don’t know you”

 catelyn never struck children anger almost struck robb effort remind frightened alone must feel “you king north choice ask think i’ve said singers make much kings die valiantly battle life worth song least gave you” lowered head “do leave go”

 “yes” turned away drew sword meant could say enemy one fight amongst tall trees fallen leaves fights sword win catelyn wanted tell feared king deaf words

 hours later sewing bedchamber young rollam westerling came running summons supper good catelyn thought relieved certain son would want quarrel “a dutiful squire” said rollam gravely bran would

 robb seemed cool table edmure surly lame lothar made model courtesy reminiscing warmly lord hoster offering catelyn gentle condolences loss bran rickon praising edmure victory stone mill thanking robb “swift sure justice” meted rickard karstark lothar’s bastard brother walder rivers another matter harsh sour man old lord walder’s suspicious face spoke seldom devoted attention meat mead set

 empty words said queen westerlings excused remains meal cleared away lothar frey cleared throat “before turn business brings us another matter” said solemnly “a grave matter fear hoped would fall bring tidings seems must lord father letter grandsons”

 catelyn lost grief almost forgotten two freys agreed foster thought mother mercy many blows bear somehow knew next words heard would plunge yet another blade heart “the grandsons winterfell” made ask “my wards”

 “walder walder yes presently dreadfort lady grieve tell battle winterfell burned”

 “burned” robb’s voice incredulous

 “your northern lords tried retake ironmen theon greyjoy saw prize lost put castle torch”

 “we heard naught battle” said ser brynden

 “my nephews young grant big walder wrote letter though cousin signed well bloody bit business account castellan slain ser rodrik name”

 “ser rodrik cassel” said catelyn numbly dear brave loyal old soul could almost see tugging fierce white whiskers “what people”

 “the ironmen put many sword fear”

 wordless rage robb slammed fist table turned face away freys would see tears

 mother saw world grows little darker every day catelyn’s thoughts went ser rodrik’s little daughter beth tireless maester luwin cheerful septon chayle mikken forge farlen palla kennels old nan simple hodor heart sick “please all”

 “no” said lame lothar “the women children hid nephews walder walder among winterfell ruins survivors carried back dreadfort son lord bolton’s”

 “bolton’s son” robb’s voice strained

 walder rivers spoke “a bastard son believe”

 “not ramsay snow lord roose another bastard” robb scowled “this ramsay monster murderer died coward told”

 “i cannot speak much confusion war many false reports tell nephews claim bastard son bolton’s saved women winterfell little ones safe dreadfort remain”

 “theon” robb said suddenly “what happened theon greyjoy slain”

 lame lothar spread hands “that cannot say grace walder walder made mention fate perhaps lord bolton might know word son his”

 ser brynden said “we certain ask him”

 “you distraught see sorry brought fresh grief perhaps adjourn morrow business wait composed yourselves…”

 “no” said robb “i want matter settled”

 brother edmure nodded “me well answer offer lord”

 “i do” lothar smiled “my lord father bids tell grace agree new marriage alliance houses renew fealty king north upon condition king’s grace apologize insult done house frey royal person face face”

 apology small enough price pay catelyn misliked petty condition lord walder’s

 “i pleased” robb said cautiously “it never wish cause rift us lothar freys fought valiantly cause would side more”

 “you kind grace accept terms instructed offer lord tully hand sister lady roslin maid sixteen years roslin lord father’s youngest daughter lady bethany house rosby sixth wife gentle nature gift music”

 edmure shifted seat “might better first met—”

 “you’ll meet you’re wed” said walder rivers curtly “unless lord tully feels need count teeth first”

 edmure kept temper “i take word far teeth concerned would pleasant might gaze upon face espoused her”

 “you must accept lord” said walder rivers “else father’s offer withdrawn”

 lame lothar spread hands “my brother soldier’s bluntness says true lord father’s wish marriage take place once”

 “at once” edmure sounded unhappy catelyn unworthy thought perhaps entertaining notions breaking betrothal fighting done

 “has lord walder forgotten fighting war” brynden blackfish asked sharply

 “scarcely” said lothar “that insists marriage take place ser men die war even men young strong would become alliance lord edmure fall took roslin bride father’s age consider well past ninety like see end struggle would put noble heart peace could see dear roslin safely wed gods take might die knowledge girl strong husband cherish protect her”

 want lord walder die happy catelyn growing less less comfortable arrangement “my brother lost father needs time mourn”

 “roslin cheerful girl” said lothar “she may thing lord edmure needs help grief”

 “and grandfather come mislike lengthy betrothals” bastard walder rivers added “i cannot imagine why”

 robb gave chilly look “i take meaning rivers pray excuse us”

 “as grace commands” lame lothar rose bastard brother helped hobble room

 edmure seething “they’re much saying promise worthless let old weasel choose bride lord walder daughters besides roslin granddaughters well offered choice i’m liege lord overjoyed i’m willing wed them”

 “he proud man we’ve wounded him” said catelyn

 “the others take pride shamed hall answer no”

 robb gave weary look “i command refuse lord frey take another slight hope putting arights gone”

 “you cannot know that” edmure insisted “frey wanted one daughters since day born let chance like slip grasping fingers lothar brings answer he’ll come wheedling back accept betrothal… daughter choosing”

 “perhaps time” said brynden blackfish “but wait lothar rides back forth offers counters”

 robb’s hands curled fists “i must get back north brothers dead winterfell burned smallfolk put sword… gods know bastard bolton’s whether theon still alive loose can’t sit waiting wedding might might happen”

 “it must happen” said catelyn though gladly “i wish suffer walder frey’s insults complaints brother see little choice without wedding robb’s cause lost edmure must accept”

 “we must accept” echoed peevishly “i don’t see offering become ninth lady frey cat”

 “the eighth lady frey still alive well far know” replied thankfully otherwise might well come knowing lord walder

 blackfish said “i last man seven kingdoms tell anyone must wed nephew nonetheless say something making amends battle fords”

 “i mind different sort amends single combat kingslayer seven years penace begging brother swimming sunset sea legs tied” saw one smiling edmure threw hands “the others take well i’ll wed wench amends”





 davos


 lord alester looked sharply “voices” said “do hear davos someone coming us”

 “lamprey” said davos “it’s time supper near enough” last night lamprey brought half beefandbacon pie flagon mead well thought made belly start rumble

 “no there’s one”

 he’s right davos heard two voices least footsteps growing louder got feet moved bars

 lord alester brushed straw clothes “the king sent queen yes selyse would never let rot blood”

 outside cell lamprey appeared ring keys hand ser axell florent four guardsmen followed close behind waited beneath torch lamprey searched correct key

 “axell” lord alester said “gods good king sends queen”

 “no one sent traitor” ser axell said

 lord alester recoiled he’d slapped “no swear committed treason won’t listen grace would let explain—”

 lamprey thrust great iron key lock turned pulled open cell rusted hinges screamed protest “you” said davos “come”

 “where” davos looked ser axell “tell true ser mean burn me”

 “you sent walk”

 “i walk” davos stepped cell lord alester gave cry dismay lamprey slammed door shut

 “take torch” ser axell commanded gaoler “leave traitor darkness”

 “no” brother said “axell please don’t take light… gods mercy…”

 “gods r’hllor other” ser axell gestured sharply one guardsmen pulled torch sconce led way stair

 “are taking melisandre” davos asked

 “she there” ser axell said “she never far king grace asked you”

 davos lifted hand chest luck hung leather bag thong gone remembered ends four fingers well hands still long enough wrap woman’s throat thought especially slender throat like

 went climbing turnpike stair single file walls rough dark stone cool touch light torches went shadows marched beside walls third turn passed iron gate opened blackness another fifth turn davos guessed near surface perhaps even next door came made wood still climbed walls broken arrow slits shafts sunlight pried way thickness stone night outside

 legs aching time ser axell thrust open heavy door gestured beyond high stone bridge arched emptiness massive central tower called stone drum sea wind blew restlessly arches supported roof davos could smell salt water crossed took deep breath filling lungs clean cold air wind water give strength prayed huge nightfire burned yard keep terrors dark bay queen’s men gathered around singing praises new red god

 center bridge ser axell stopped suddenly made brusque gesture hand men moved earshot “were choice would burn brother alester” told davos “you traitors”

 “say would never betray king stannis”

 “you would see face seen flames well r’hllor blessed gift like lady melisandre shows future fire stannis baratheon sit iron throne seen know must done grace must make hand place traitor brother tell so”

 davos said nothing

 “the queen urged appointment” ser axell went “even old friend lys pirate saan says made plan together yet grace act defeat gnaws inside black worm soul us love show devoted cause claim smuggler join voice tell hand needs tell sail shall see new ship”

 ship davos studied man’s face ser axell big florent ears much like queen’s coarse hair grew nostrils sprouted tufts patches beneath double chin nose broad brow beetled eyes closeset hostile would sooner give pyre ship said much favor…

 “if think betray me” ser axell said “pray remember castellan dragonstone good long time garrison mine perhaps cannot burn without king’s consent say might suffer fall” laid meaty hand back davos’s neck shoved bodily waisthigh side bridge shoved little harder force face yard “do hear me”

 “i hear” said davos dare name traitor

 ser axell released “good” smiled “his grace awaits best keep him”

 top stone drum within great round room called chamber painted table found stannis baratheon standing behind artifact gave hall name massive slab wood carved painted shape westeros time aegon conqueror iron brazier stood beside king coals glowing ruddy orange four tall pointed windows looked north south east west beyond night starry sky davos could hear wind moving fainter sounds sea

 “your grace” ser axell said “as please brought onion knight”

 “so see” stannis wore grey wool tunic dark red mantle plain black leather belt sword dagger hung redgold crown flameshaped points encircled brows look shock seemed ten years older man davos left storm’s end set sail blackwater battle would undoing king’s closecropped beard spiderwebbed grey hairs dropped two stone weight never fleshy man bones moved beneath skin like spears fighting cut free even crown seemed large head eyes blue pits lost deep hollows shape skull could seen beneath face

 yet saw davos faint smile brushed lips “so sea returned knight fish onions”

 “it grace” know dungeon davos went one knee

 “rise ser davos” stannis commanded “i missed ser need good counsel never gave less tell true—what penalty treason”

 word hung air frightful word thought davos asked condemn cellmate perchance kings know penalty treason better man “treason” finally managed weakly

 “what else would call deny king seek steal rightful throne ask again—what penalty treason law”

 davos choice answer “death” said “the penalty death grace”

 “it always not… cruel man ser davos know known long decree always since aegon’s day daemon blackfyre brothers toyne vulture king grand maester hareth… traitors always paid lives… even rhaenyra targaryen daughter one king mother two yet died traitor’s death trying usurp brother’s crown law law davos cruelty”

 “yes grace” speak davos felt moment’s pity cellmate dark knew keep silent tired sick heart heard say “sire lord florent meant treason”

 “do smugglers another name made hand would sold rights bowl pease porridge would even given shireen mine child would wed bastard born incest” king’s voice thick anger “my brother gift inspiring loyalty even foes summerhall three battles single day brought lords grandison cafferen back storm’s end prisoners hung banners hall trophies cafferen’s white fawns spotted blood grandison’s sleeping lion torn near two yet would sit beneath banners night drinking feasting robert even took hunting ‘these men meant deliver aerys burned’ told saw throwing axes yard ‘you putting axes hands’ robert laughed would thrown grandison cafferen dungeon turned friends lord cafferen died ashford castle cut randyll tarly whilst fighting robert lord grandison wounded trident died year brother made love would seem inspire betrayal even mine blood kin brother grandfather cousins good uncle…”

 “your grace” said ser axell “i beg give chance prove florents feeble”

 “ser axell would resume war” king stannis told davos “the lannisters think done beaten sworn lords forsaken near every one even lord estermont mother’s father bent knee joffrey loyal men remain losing heart waste days drinking gambling lick wounds like beaten curs”

 “battle set hearts ablaze grace” ser axell said “defeat disease victory cure”

 “victory” king’s mouth twisted “there victories victories ser tell plan ser davos would hear views propose”

 ser axell turned davos look face much like look proud lord belgrave must worn day king baelor blessed commanded wash beggar’s ulcerous feet nonetheless obeyed

 plan ser axell devised salladhor saan simple hours’ sail dragonstone lay claw isle ancient seagirt seat house celtigar lord ardrian celtigar fought beneath flery heart blackwater taken wasted time going joffrey remained king’s landing even “too frightened grace’s wrath come near dragonstone doubt” ser axell declared “and wisely man betrayed rightful king”

 ser axell proposed use salladhor saan’s fleet men escaped blackwater—stannis still fifteen hundred dragonstone half florents—to exact retribution lord celtigar’s defection claw isle lightly garrisoned castle reputedly stuffed myrish carpets volantene glass gold silver plate jeweled cups magnificent hawks axe valyrian steel horn could summon monsters deep chests rubies wines man could drink hundred years though celtigar shown world niggardly face never stinted comforts “put castle torch people sword say” ser axell concluded “leave claw isle desolation ash bone fit carrion crows realm might see fate bed lannisters”

 stannis listened ser axell’s recitation silence grinding jaw slowly side side done said “it could done believe risk small joffrey strength sea lord redwyne sets sail arbor plunder might serve keep lysene pirate salladhor saan loyal time claw isle worthless fall would serve notice lord tywin cause yet done” king turned back davos “speak truly ser make ser axell’s proposal”

 speak truly ser davos remembered dark cell shared lord alester remembered lamprey porridge thought promises ser axell made bridge yard ship shove shall stannis asking “your grace” said slowly “i make folly… aye cowardice”

 “cowardice” ser axell shouted “no man calls craven king”

 “silence” stannis commanded “ser davos speak would hear reasons”

 davos turned face ser axell “you say ought show realm done strike blow make war aye… enemy find lannisters claw isle”

 “we find traitors” said ser axell “though may could find closer home even room”

 davos ignored jibe “i don’t doubt lord celtigar bent knee boy joffrey old done man wants end days castle drinking fine wine jeweled cups” turned back stannis “yet came called sire came ships swords stood storm’s end lord renly came us ships sailed blackwater men fought killed burned claw isle weakly held yes held women children old men husbands sons fathers died blackwater that’s died oars swords hands fighting beneath banners yet ser axell proposes swoop homes left behind rape widows put children sword smallfolk traitors…”

 “they are” insisted ser axell “not celtigar’s men slain blackwater hundreds taken lord bent knee did”

 “when did” davos repeated “they men sworn men choice given”

 “every man choices might refused kneel died yet died true men loyal”

 “some men stronger others” feeble answer davos knew stannis baratheon man iron neither understood forgave weakness others losing thought despairing

 “it every man’s duty remain loyal rightful king even lord serves proves false” stannis declared tone brooked argument

 desperate folly took hold davos recklessness akin madness “as remained loyal king aerys brother raised banners” blurted

 shocked silence followed ser axell cried “treason” snatched dagger sheath “your grace speaks infamy face”

 davos could hear stannis grinding teeth vein bulged blue swollen king’s brow eyes met “put knife ser axell leave us”

 “as please grace—”

 “it would please leave” said stannis “take presence send melisandre”

 “as command” ser axell slid knife away bowed hurried toward door boots rang floor angry

 “you always presumed forbearance” stannis warned davos alone “i shorten tongue easy fingers smuggler”

 “i man grace tongue please”

 “it is” said calmer “and would speak truth though truth bitter draught times aerys knew… hard choosing blood liege brother king” grimaced “have ever seen iron throne barbs along back ribbons twisted steel jagged ends swords knives tangled melted comfortable seat ser aerys cut often men took calling king scab maegor cruel murdered chair chair hear tell seat man rest ease ofttimes wonder brothers wanted desperately”

 “why would want then” davos asked

 “it question wanting throne mine robert’s heir law must pass daughter unless selyse finally give son” ran three fingers lightly table layers smooth hard varnish dark age “i king wants enter duty daughter realm even robert loved little know yet brother lannister woman gave horns made motley fool may murdered well murdered jon arryn ned stark crimes must justice starting cersei abominations starting mean scour court clean robert done trident ser barristan told rot king aerys’s reign began varys eunuch never pardoned kingslayer least robert stripped white cloak jaime sent wall lord stark urged listened jon arryn instead still storm’s end siege unconsulted” turned abruptly give davos hard shrewd look “the truth wish murder lady melisandre”

 know davos could lie “four sons burned blackwater gave flames”

 “you wrong fires work curse imp curse pyromancers curse fool florent sailed fleet jaws trap curse stubborn pride sending away needed melisandre remains faithful servant”

 “maester cressen faithful servant slew killed ser cortnay penrose brother renly”

 “now sound fool” king complained “she saw renly’s end flames yes part priestess devan would tell ask doubt would spared renly could melisandre urged meet give one last chance amend treason melisandre told send ser axell wished give r’hllor” smiled thinly “does surprise you”

 “yes knows friend red god”

 “but friend knows well” beckoned davos closer “the boy sick maester pylos leeching him”

 “the boy” thoughts went devan king’s squire “my son sire”

 “devan good boy much robert’s bastard sick boy took storm’s end”

 edric storm “i spoke aegon’s garden”

 “as wished saw” stannis sighed “did boy charm gift got father blood knows king’s son chooses forget bastardborn worships robert renly young royal brother played fond father visits storm’s end gifts… swords ponies furtrimmed cloaks eunuch’s work every one boy would write red keep full thanks robert would laugh ask varys he’d sent year renly better left boy’s upbringing castellans maesters every one fell victim charm penrose chose die rather give up” king ground teeth together “it still angers could think would hurt boy chose robert hard day came chose blood honor”

 use boy’s name made davos uneasy “i hope young edric recover soon”

 stannis waved hand dismissing concern “it chill coughs shivers fever maester pylos soon set right boy nought understand veins flows brother’s blood power king’s blood says”

 davos ask

 stannis touched painted table “look onion knight realm rights westeros” swept hand across “this talk seven kingdoms folly aegon saw three hundred years ago stood standing painted table command rivers bays painted hills mountains castles cities market towns lakes swamps forests… borders one one realm one king rule alone”

 “one king” agreed davos “one king means peace”

 “i shall bring justice westeros thing ser axell understands little war claw isle would gain naught… evil said celtigar must pay traitor’s price person come kingdom shall every man shall reap sown highest lord lowest gutter rat lose tips fingers promise made kingdom bleed forget that” king stannis turned table “on knees onion knight”

 “your grace”

 “for onions fish made knight mind raise lord”

 davos lost “i content knight grace would know begin lordly”

 “good lordly false learned lesson hard kneel king commands”

 davos knelt stannis drew longsword lightbringer melisandre named red sword heroes drawn fires seven gods consumed room seemed grow brighter blade slid scabbard steel glow orange yellow red air shimmered around jewel ever sparkled brilliantly stannis touched davos’s shoulder felt different longsword “ser davos house seaworth” king said “are true honest liege man forever”

 “i grace”

 “and swear serve loyally days give honest counsel swift obedience defend rights realm foes battles great small protect people punish enemies”

 “i grace”

 “then rise davos seaworth rise lord rainwood admiral narrow sea hand king”

 moment davos stunned move woke morning dungeon “your grace cannot… fit man king’s hand”

 “there man fitter” stannis sheathed lightbringer gave davos hand pulled feet

 “i lowborn” davos reminded “an upjumped smuggler lords never obey me”

 “then make new lords”

 “but… cannot read… write…”

 “maester pylos read writing last hand wrote head shoulders ask things you’ve always given honesty loyalty service”

 “surely someone better… great lord…”

 stannis snorted “bar emmon boy faithless grandfather celtigar abandoned new velaryon six years old new sunglass sailed volantis burned brother” made angry gesture “a good men remain it’s true ser gilbert farring holds storm’s end still two hundred loyal men lord morrigen bastard nightsong young chyttering cousin andrew… trust none trust lord rainwood hand want beside battle”

 another battle end us thought davos lord alester saw much true enough “your grace asked honest counsel honesty then… lack strength another battle lannisters”

 “it great battle grace speaking of” said woman’s voice rich accents east melisandre stood door red silks shimmering satins holding covered silver dish hands “these little wars scuffle children come one whose name may spoken marshaling power davos seaworth power fell evil strong beyond measure soon comes cold night never ends” placed silver dish painted table “unless true men find courage fight men whose hearts fire”

 stannis stared silver dish “she shown lord davos flames”

 “you saw sire” like stannis baratheon lie thing

 “with mine eyes battle lost despair lady melisandre bid gaze hearthfire chimney drawing strongly bits ash rising fire stared feeling half fool bid look deeper and… ashes white rising updraft yet seemed falling snow thought sparks air seemed circle become ring torches looking fire high hill forest cinders become men black behind torches shapes moving snow heat fire felt cold terrible shivered sight gone fire fire saw real i’d stake kingdom it”

 “and have” said melisandre

 conviction king’s voice frightened davos core “a hill forest… shapes snow… don’t…”

 “it means battle begun” said melisandre “the sand running glass quickly man’s hour earth almost done must act boldly hope lost westeros must unite beneath one true king prince promised lord dragonstone chosen r’hllor”

 “r’hllor chooses queerly then” king grimaced he’d tasted something foul “why brothers renly peach dreams see juice running mouth blood throat done duty brother would smashed lord tywin victory even robert could proud robert…” teeth ground side side “he dreams well laughing drinking boasting things best fighting never bested anything lord light made robert champion me”

 “because righteous man” said melisandre

 “a righteous man” stannis touched covered silver platter finger “with leeches”

 “yes” said melisandre “but must tell way”

 “you swore would work” king looked angry

 “it will… not”

 “which”

 “both”

 “speak sense woman”

 “when fires speak plainly shall truth flames always easy see” great ruby throat drank fire glow brazier “give boy grace surer way better way give boy shall wake stone dragon”

 “i told no”

 “he one baseborn boy boys westeros girls well children might ever born kingdoms world”

 “the boy innocent”

 “the boy defiled marriage bed else would surely sons shamed you”

 “robert boy daughter grown fond mine blood”

 “your brother’s blood” melisandre said “a king’s blood king’s blood wake stone dragon”

 stannis ground teeth “i’ll hear dragons done targaryens tried bring back half dozen times made fools corpses patchface fool need godsforsaken rock leeches work”

 melisandre bowed head stiffly said “as king commands” reaching left sleeve right hand flung handful powder brazier coals roared pale flames writhed atop red woman retrieved silver dish brought king davos watched lift lid beneath three large black leeches fat blood

 boy’s blood davos knew king’s blood

 stannis stretched forth hand fingers closed around one leeches

 “say name” melisandre commanded

 leech twisting king’s grip trying attach one fingers “the usurper” said “joffrey baratheon” tossed leech fire curled like autumn leaf amidst coals burned

 stannis grasped second “the usurper” declared louder time “balon greyjoy” flipped lightly onto brazier flesh split cracked blood burst hissing smoking

 last king’s hand one studied moment writhed fingers “the usurper” said last “robb stark” threw flames





 jaime


 harrenhal’s bathhouse dim steamy lowceilinged room filled great stone tubs led jaime found brienne seated one scrubbing arm almost angrily

 “not hard wench” called “you’ll scrub skin off” dropped brush covered teats hands big gregor clegane’s pointy little buds intent hiding would looked natural tenyearold thick muscular chest

 “what here” demanded

 “lord bolton insists sup neglected invite fleas” jaime tugged guard left hand “help stinking rags” onehanded could much unlace breeches man obeyed grudgingly obeyed “now leave us” jaime said clothes lay pile wet stone floor “my lady tarth doesn’t want likes scum gaping teats” pointed stump hatchetfaced woman attending brienne “you wait without there’s one door wench big try shinny chimney”

 habit obedience went deep woman followed guard leaving bathhouse two tubs large enough hold six seven fashion free cities jaime climbed wench awkward slow eyes open though right remained somewhat swollen despite qyburn’s leeches jaime felt hundred nine years old deal better feeling came harrenhal

 brienne shrunk away “there tubs”

 “this one suits well enough” gingerly immersed chin steaming water “have fear wench thighs purple green i’m interested you’ve got them” rest right arm rim since qyburn warned keep linen dry could feel tension drain legs head spun “if faint pull lannister ever drowned bath don’t mean first”

 “why care die”

 “you swore solemn vow” smiled red flush crept thick white column neck turned back “still shy maiden think haven’t seen” groped brush dropped caught fingers began scrub desultorily even difficult awkward left hand good nothing

 still water darkened caked dirt dissolved skin wench kept back muscles great shoulders hunched hard

 “does sight stump distress so” jaime asked “you ought pleased i’ve lost hand killed king hand flung stark boy tower hand i’d slide sister’s thighs make wet” thrust stump face “no wonder renly died guarding him”

 jerked feet he’d struck sending wash hot water across tub jaime caught glimpse thick blonde bush juncture thighs climbed much hairier sister absurdly felt cock stir beneath bathwater know long away cersei averted eyes troubled body’s response “that unworthy” mumbled “i’m maimed man bitter forgive wench protected well man could better most”

 wrapped nakedness towel “do mock me”

 pricked back anger “are thick castle wall apology tired fighting say make truce”

 “truces built trust would trust—”

 “the kingslayer yes oathbreaker murdered poor sad aerys targaryen” jaime snorted “it’s aerys rue it’s robert ‘i hear they’ve named kingslayer’ said coronation feast ‘just don’t think make habit’ laughed one names robert oathbreaker tore realm apart yet one shit honor”

 “robert love” water ran brienne’s legs pooled beneath feet

 “robert pride cunt pretty face” made fist… would he’d hand pain lanced arm cruel laughter

 “he rode save realm” insisted

 save realm “did know brother set blackwater rush afire wildfire burn water aerys would bathed he’d dared targaryens mad fire” jaime felt lightheaded heat poison blood last fever eased water reached chin “soiled white cloak… wore gold armor day but…”

 “gold armor” voice sounded far faint

 floated heat memory “after dancing griffins lost battle bells aerys exiled him” telling absurd ugly child “he finally realized robert mere outlaw lord crushed whim greatest threat house targaryen faced since daemon blackfyre king reminded lewyn martell gracelessly held elia sent take command ten thousand dornishmen coming kingsroad jon darry barristan selmy rode stoney sept rally could griffins’ men prince rhaegar returned south persuaded father swallow pride summon father raven returned casterly rock made king even afraid saw traitors everywhere varys always point might missed grace commanded alchemists place caches wildfire king’s landing beneath baelor’s sept hovels flea bottom stables storehouses seven gates even cellars red keep

 water grown cool jaime opened eyes found staring stump sword hand hand made kingslayer goat robbed glory shame leaving

 wench looked ridiculous clutching towel meager teats thick white legs sticking beneath “has tale turned speechless come curse kiss call liar something”

 “if true one knows”

 “the knights kingsguard sworn keep king’s secrets would break oath” jaime laughed “do think noble lord winterfell wanted hear feeble explanations honorable man look judge guilty” jaime lurched feet water running cold chest “by right wolf judge lion right” violent shiver took smashed stump rim tub tried climb

 pain shuddered him… suddenly bathhouse spinning brienne caught could fall arm gooseflesh clammy chilled strong gentler would thought gentler cersei thought helped tub legs wobbly limp cock “guards” heard wench shout “the kingslayer”

 jaime thought name jaime

 next knew lying damp floor guards wench qyburn standing looking concerned brienne naked seemed forgotten moment “the heat tubs it” maester qyburn telling he’s maester took chain “there’s still poison blood well he’s malnourished feeding him”

 “worms piss grey vomit” offered jaime

 “hardbread water oat porridge” insisted guard “he don’t hardly eat though him”

 “scrub dress carry kingspyre need be” qyburn said “lord bolton insists sup tonight time growing short”

 “bring clean garb him” brienne said “i’ll see he’s washed dressed”

 others glad give task lifted feet sat stone bench wall brienne went away retrieve towel returned stiff brush finish scrubbing one guards gave razor trim beard qyburn returned roughspun smallclothes clean black woolen breeches loose green tunic leather jerkin laced front jaime feeling less dizzy though less clumsy wench’s help managed dress “now need silver looking glass”

 bloody maester brought fresh clothing brienne well stained pink satin gown linen undertunic “i sorry lady women’s garments harrenhal large enough fit you”

 obvious gown cut someone slimmer arms shorter legs much fuller breasts fine myrish lace little conceal bruising mottled brienne’s skin garb made wench look ludicrous thicker shoulders bigger neck jaime thought small wonder prefers dress mail pink kind color either dozen cruel japes leaped head kept best make angry match onehanded

 qyburn brought flask well “what it” jaime demanded chainless maester pressed drink

 “licorice steeped vinegar honey cloves give strength clear head”

 “bring potion grows new hands” said jaime “that’s one want”

 “drink it” brienne said unsmiling

 half hour felt strong enough stand dim wet warmth bathhouse air outside slap across face “m’lord looking now” guard told qyburn “her need carry him”

 “i still walk brienne give arm”

 clutching jaime let herd across yard vast draughty hall larger even throne room king’s landing huge hearths lined walls one every ten feet could count fires lit chill walls went bonedeep dozen spearmen fur cloaks guarded doors steps led two galleries center immense emptiness trestle table surrounded seemed like acres smooth slate floor lord dreadfort waited attended cupbearer

 “my lord” said brienne stood

 roose bolton’s eyes paler stone darker milk voice spider soft “i pleased strong enough attend ser lady seated” gestured spread cheese bread cold meat fruit covered table “will drink red white indifferent vintage fear ser amory drained lady whent’s cellars nearly dry”

 “i trust killed it” jaime slid offered seat quickly bolton could see weak “white starks i’ll drink red like good lannister”

 “i would prefer water” said brienne

 “elmar red ser jaime water lady brienne hippocras myself” bolton waved hand escort dismissing men beat silent retreat

 habit made jaime reach wine right hand stump rocked goblet spattering clean linen bandages bright red spots forcing catch cup left hand fell bolton pretended notice clumsiness northman helped prune ate small sharp bites “do try ser jaime sweet help move bowels well lord vargo took inn burnt it”

 “my bowels move fine goat’s lord prunes don’t interest half much intentions”

 “regarding you” faint smile touched roose bolton’s lips “you perilous prize ser sow dissension wherever go even happy house harrenhal” voice whisker whisper “and riverrun well seems know edmure tully offered thousand golden dragons recapture”

 “my sister pay ten times much”

 “will she” smile instant gone quick “ten thousand dragons formidable sum course lord karstark’s offer consider well promises hand daughter man brings head”

 “leave goat get backward” said jaime

 bolton gave soft chuckle “harrion karstark captive took castle know gave karhold men still sent glover hope nothing ill befell duskendale… else alys karstark would remains lord rickard’s progeny” chose another prune “fortunately need wife wed lady walda frey whilst twins”

 “fair walda” awkwardly jaime tried hold bread stump tearing left hand

 “fat walda lord frey offered bride’s weight silver dowry chose accordingly elmar break bread ser jaime”

 boy tore fistsized chunk one end loaf handed jaime brienne tore bread “lord bolton” asked “it’s said mean give harrenhal vargo hoat”

 “that price” lord bolton said “the lannisters men pay debts must take leave soon case edmure tully wed lady roslin frey twins king commands attendance”

 “edmure weds” said jaime “not robb stark”

 “his grace king robb wed” bolton spit prune pit hand put aside “to westerling crag told name jeyne doubt know ser father father’s bannerman”

 “my father good many bannermen daughters” jaime groped onehanded goblet trying recall jeyne westerlings old house pride power

 “this cannot true” brienne said stubbornly “king robb sworn wed frey would never break faith he—”

 “his grace boy sixteen” said roose bolton mildly “and would thank question word lady”

 jaime felt almost sorry robb stark war battlefield lost bedchamber poor fool “how lord walder relish dining trout place wolf” asked

 “oh trout makes tasty supper” bolton lifted pale finger toward cupbearer “though poor elmar bereft wed arya stark good father frey choice break betrothal king robb betrayed him”

 “is word arya stark” brienne leaned forward “lady catelyn feared that… girl still alive”

 “oh yes” said lord dreadfort

 “you certain knowledge lord”

 roose bolton shrugged “arya stark lost time true found mean see returned safely north”

 “her sister both” said brienne “tyrion lannister promised us girls brother”

 seemed amuse lord dreadfort “my lady one told lannisters lie”

 “is slight honor house” jaime picked cheese knife good hand “a rounded point dull” said sliding thumb along edge blade “but go eye same” sweat beaded brow could hope look feeble felt

 lord bolton’s little smile paid another visit lips “you speak boldly man needs help break bread guards around us remind you”

 “all around us half league away” jaime glanced vast length hall “by time reach us you’ll dead aerys”

 “’tis scarcely chivalrous threaten host cheese olives” lord dreadfort scolded “in north hold laws hospitality sacred still”

 “i’m captive guest goat cut hand think prunes make overlook you’re bloody well mistaken”

 took roose bolton aback “perhaps perhaps ought make wedding gift edmure tully… strike head sister eddard stark”

 “i would advise casterly rock long memory”

 “a thousand leagues mountain sea bog lie walls rock lannister enmity means little bolton”

 “lannister friendship could mean much” jaime thought knew game playing wench know well dare look see

 “i certain sort friends wise man would want” roose bolton beckoned boy “elmar carve guests slice roast”

 brienne served first made move eat “my lord” said “ser jaime exchanged lady catelyn’s daughters must free us continue way”

 “the raven came riverrun told escape exchange helped captive slip bonds guilty treason lady”

 big wench rose feet “i serve lady stark”

 “and king north king lost north call never wished trade ser jaime back lannisters”

 “sit eat brienne” jaime urged elmar placed slice roast dark bloody “if bolton meant kill us wouldn’t wasting precious prunes us peril bowels” stared meat realized way cut onehanded worth less girl thought goat’s evened trade though doubt lady catelyn thank cersei returns whelps like condition thought made grimace get blame well i’ll wager

 roose bolton cut meat methodically blood running across plate “lady brienne sit tell hope send ser jaime lady stark desire”

 “i… you’d send us on” wench sounded wary sat “that good lord”

 “it however lord vargo created one small… difficulty” turned pale eyes jaime “do know hoat cut hand”

 “he enjoys cutting hands” linen covered jaime’s stump spotted blood wine “he enjoys cutting feet well doesn’t seem need reason”

 “nonetheless one hoat cunning appears man commands company brave companions long unless wits him” bolton stabbed chunk meat point dagger put mouth chewed thoughtfully swallowed “lord vargo abandoned house lannister offered harrenhal reward thousand times greater could hope lord tywin stranger westeros know prize poisoned”

 “the curse harren black” mocked jaime

 “the curse tywin lannister” bolton held goblet elmar refilled silently “our goat consulted tarbecks reynes might warned lord father deals betrayal”

 “there tarbecks reynes” said jaime

 “my point precisely lord vargo doubtless hoped lord stannis would triumph king’s landing thence confirm possession castle gratitude small part downfall house lannister” gave dry chuckle “he knows little stannis baratheon either fear one might given harrenhal service… would given noose crimes well”

 “a noose kinder he’ll get father”

 “by come realization stannis broken renly dead stark victory save lord tywin’s vengeance chances grow perishingly slim”

 “king robb every battle” brienne said stoutly stubbornly loyal speech deed

 “won every battle losing freys karstarks winterfell north pity wolf young boys sixteen always believe immortal invincible older man would bend knee i’d think war always peace peace pardons… robb starks least likes vargo hoat” bolton gave small smile “both sides made use neither shed tear passing brave companions fight battle blackwater yet died same”

 “you’ll forgive don’t mourn”

 “you pity wretched doomed goat ah gods must… else deliver hands” bolton chewed another chunk meat “karhold smaller meaner harrenhal lies well beyond reach lion’s claws wed alys karstark hoat might lord truth could collect gold father much better would delivered lord rickard matter much lord tywin paid price would maid safe refuge

 “but sell must keep riverlands full would gladly steal away glover tallhart broken duskendale remnants host still abroad mountain slaughtering stragglers thousand karstarks prowl lands south east riverrun hunting elsewhere darry men left lordless lawless packs fourfooted wolves lightning lord’s outlaw bands dondarrion would gladly hang goat together tree” lord dreadfort sopped blood chunk bread “harrenhal place lord vargo could hope hold safe brave companions much outnumbered men ser aenys freys doubt feared might return ser edmure riverrun… worse send father

 “by maiming meant remove sword threat gain grisly token send father diminish value man king robb’s man thus crime mine may seem father’s eyes therein lies my… small difficulty” gazed jaime pale eyes unblinking expectant chill

 see “you want absolve blame tell father stump work yours” jaime laughed “my lord send cersei i’ll sing sweet song could want gently treated me” answer knew bolton would give back goat “had hand i’d write maimed sellsword father brought westeros saved noble lord bolton”

 “i trust word ser”

 there’s something don’t often hear “how soon might permitted leave mean get past wolves brigands karstarks”

 “you leave qyburn says strong enough strong escort picked men command captain walton steelshanks called soldier iron loyalty walton see safe whole king’s landing”

 “provided lady catelyn’s daughters delivered safe whole well” said wench “my lord man walton’s protection welcome girls charge”

 lord dreadfort gave uninterested glance “the girls need concern lady lady sansa dwarf’s wife gods part now”

 “his wife” brienne said appalled “the imp but… swore whole court sight gods men…”

 innocent jaime almost surprised truth told hid better sansa stark ought put smile tyrion’s face remembered happy brother little crofter’s daughter… fortnight

 “what imp swear scarcely matters now” said lord bolton “least you” wench looked almost wounded perhaps finally felt steel jaws trap roose bolton beckoned guards “ser jaime continue king’s landing said nothing fear would unconscionable deprive lord vargo prizes” lord dreadfort reached pick another prune “were lady worry less starks rather sapphires”





 tyrion


 horse whickered impatiently behind amidst ranks gold cloaks drawn across road tyrion could hear lord gyles coughing well asked gyles he’d asked ser addam jalabhar xho rest lord father felt doran martell might take ill dwarf came escort across blackwater

 joffrey met dornishmen reflected sat waiting would mucked doubt late king repeating little jests dornish he’d picked mace tyrell’s menatarms many dornishmen take shoe horse nine one shoeing eight lift horse somehow tyrion think doran martell would find amusing

 could see banners flying riders emerged green living wood long dusty column river bare black trees remained legacy battle many banners thought sourly watched ashes kick hooves approaching horses beneath hooves tyrell van smashed stannis flank martell’s brought half lords dorne look tried think good might come failed “how many banners count” asked bronn

 sellsword knight shaded eyes “eight… nine”

 tyrion turned saddle “pod come describe arms see tell houses represent”

 podrick payne edged gelding closer carrying royal standard joffrey’s great stagandlion struggling weight bronn bore tyrion’s banner lion lannister gold crimson

 he’s getting taller tyrion realized pod stood stirrups better look he’ll soon tower like rest lad making diligent study dornish heraldry tyrion’s command ever nervous “i can’t see wind flapping them”

 “bronn tell boy see”

 bronn looked much knight today new doublet cloak flaming chain across chest “a red sun orange” called “with spear back”

 “martell” podrick payne said visibly relieved “house martell sunspear lord prince dorne”

 “my horse would known one” said tyrion dryly “give another bronn”

 “there’s purple flag yellow balls”

 “lemons” pod said hopefully “a purple fleld strewn lemons house dalt lemonwood”

 “might next’s big black bird yellow something pink white claws hard say banner flapping”

 “the vulture blackmont grasps baby talons” said pod “house blackmont blackmont ser”

 bronn laughed “reading books books ruin sword eye boy see skull black banner”

 tyrion impressed boy’s half stupid gets tongue untied “go pod” urged “if get i’ll make gift”

 “a pie red black slices” said bronn “there’s gold hand middle”

 “house allyrion godsgrace”

 “a red chicken eating snake looks like”

 “the gargalens salt shore cockatrice ser pardon chicken red black snake beak”

 “very good” exclaimed tyrion “one lad”

 bronn scanned ranks approaching dornishmen “the last’s golden feather green checks”

 “a golden quill ser jordayne tor”

 tyrion laughed “nine well done could named myself” lie would give boy pride badly needed

 martell brings formidable companions would seem one houses pod named small insignificant nine greatest lords dorne coming kingsroad heirs somehow tyrion think come way see dancing bear message one like wondered mistake ship myrcella sunspear

 “my lord” pod said little timidly “there’s litter”

 tyrion turned head sharply boy right

 “doran martell always travels litter” boy said “a carved litter silk hangings suns drapes”

 tyrion heard talk prince doran past fifty gouty may wanted make faster time told may feared litter would make tempting target brigands would prove cumbersome high passes boneway perhaps gout better

 bad feeling

 waiting intolerable “banners forward” snapped “we’ll meet them” kicked horse bronn pod followed one either side dornishmen saw coming spurred mounts banners rippling rode ornate saddles slung round metal shields favored many carried bundles short throwing spears doublecurved dornish bows used well horseback

 three sorts dornishmen first king daeron observed salty dornishmen lived along coasts sandy dornishmen deserts long river valleys stony dornishmen made fastnesses passes heights red mountains salty dornishmen rhoynish blood stony dornishmen least

 three sorts seemed well represented doran’s retinue salty dornishmen lithe dark smooth olive skin long black hair streaming wind sandy dornishmen even darker faces burned brown hot dornish sun wound long bright scarfs around helms ward sunstroke stony dornishmen biggest fairest sons andals first men brownhaired blond faces freckled burned sun instead browning

 lords wore silk satin robes jeweled belts flowing sleeves armor heavily enameled inlaid burnished copper shining silver soft red gold came astride red horses golden ones pale snow slim swift long necks narrow beautiful heads fabled sand steeds dorne smaller proper warhorses could bear weight armor said could run day night another day never tire

 dornish leader forked stallion black sin mane tail color fire sat saddle he’d born tall slim graceful cloak pale red silk fluttered shoulders shirt armored overlapping rows copper disks glittered like thousand bright new pennies rode high gilded helm displayed copper sun brow round shield slung behind bore sunandspear house martell polished metal surface

 martell sun ten years young tyrion thought reined fit well far fierce knew must deal many dornishmen take start war asked one yet choice smile “well met lords word approach grace king joffrey bid ride welcome name lord father king’s hand sends greetings well” feigned amiable confusion “which prince doran”

 “my brother’s health requires remain sunspear” princeling removed helm beneath face lined saturnine thin arched brows large eyes black shiny pools coal oil streaks silver marred lustrous black hair receded brow widow’s peak sharply pointed nose salty dornishman certain “prince doran sent join king joffrey’s council stead please grace”

 “his grace honored counsel warrior renowned prince oberyn dorne” said tyrion thinking mean blood gutters “and noble companions welcome well”

 “permit acquaint lord lannister ser deziel dalt lemonwood lord tremond gargalen lord harmen uller brother ser ulwyck ser ryon allyrion natural son ser daemon sand bastard godsgrace lord dagos manwoody brother ser myles sons mors dickon ser arron qorgyle never let thought would neglect ladies myria jordayne heir tor lady larra blackmont daughter jynessa son perros” raised slender hand toward blackhaired woman rear beckoning forward “and ellaria sand mine paramour”

 tyrion swallowed groan paramour bastardborn cersei pitch holy fit wants wedding consigned woman dark corner salt sister would risk red viper’s wrath seat beside high table every lady dais like take offense prince doran mean provoke quarrel

 prince oberyn wheeled horse face fellow dornishmen “ellaria lords ladies sers see well king joffrey loves us grace kind send uncle imp bring us court “

 bronn snorted back laughter tyrion perforce must feign amusement well “not alone lords would enormous task little man like me” party come turn name names “let present ser flement brax heir hornvale lord gyles rosby ser addam marbrand lord commander city watch jalabhar xho prince red flower vale ser harys swyft uncle kevan’s good father marriage ser merlon crakehall ser philip foote ser bronn blackwater two heroes recent battle rebel stannis baratheon mine squire young podrick house payne” names nice ringing sound tyrion reeled bearers nowise near distinguished formidable company accompanied prince oberyn knew full well

 “at lady” tyrion turned horse’s head called ser addam marbrand mounted gold cloaks formed greatest part honor guard turned horses crisply ser addam’s command column set river king’s landing beyond

 course crippled heir highgarden

 man seven kingdoms less welcome tyrell wedding thought tyrion send prince oberyn king’s landing city still hosted lord mace tyrell two sons thousands menatarms provocation dangerous prince oberyn wrong word illtimed jest look that’s take noble allies one another’s throats

 “we met before” dornish prince said lightly tyrion rode side side along kingsroad past ashen fields skeletons trees “i would expect remember though even smaller now”

 mocking edge voice tyrion misliked let dornishman provoke “when lord” asked tones polite interest

 “oh many many year ago mother ruled dorne lord father hand different king”

 different might think reflected tyrion

 “it visited casterly rock mother consort sister elia oh fourteen fifteen thereabouts elia year older brother sister eight nine recall born”

 queer time come visiting mother died giving birth martells would found rock deep mouming father especially lord tywin seldom spoke wife tyrion heard uncles talk love days father aerys’s hand many people said lord tywin lannister ruled seven kingdoms lady joanna ruled lord tywin “he man died imp” uncle gery told “the best part died her” gerion youngest lord tytos lannister’s four sons uncle tyrion liked best

 gone lost beyond seas tyrion put lady joanna grave “did find casterly rock liking lord”

 “scarcely father ignored us whole time commanding ser kevan see entertainment cell gave featherbed sleep myrish carpets floor dark windowless much like dungeon come told elia time skies grey wines sweet women chaste food bland… greatest disappointment all”

 “i born expect me”

 “enormity” blackhaired prince replied “you small farfamed oldtown birth city talked monster born king’s hand omen might foretell realm”

 “famine plague war doubt” tyrion gave sour smile “it’s always famine plague war oh winter long night never ends”

 “all that” said prince oberyn “and father’s fall well lord tywin made greater king aerys heard one begging brother preach god meant stand king curse punishment sent gods teach better man”

 “i try refuses learn” tyrion gave sigh “but go pray love good tale”

 “and well might since said one stiff curly tail like swine’s head monstrous huge heard half size body born thick black hair beard besides evil eye lion’s claws teeth long could close mouth legs girl’s privates well boy’s”

 “life would much simpler men could fuck don’t agree think times claws teeth might proved useful even begin see nature complaint”

 bronn gave chuckle oberyn smiled “we might never seen sweet sister never seen table hall though sometimes night could hear baby howling depths rock monstrous great voice must grant would wail hours nothing would quiet woman’s teat”

 “still true happens”

 time prince oberyn laugh “a taste share lord gargalen told hoped die sword hand replied would sooner go breast mine”

 tyrion grin “you speaking sister”

 “cersei promised elia show us day sail whilst mother father closeted together jaime took us nursery wet nurse tried send us sister none ‘he’s mine’ said ‘and you’re milk cow can’t tell quiet i’ll father cut tongue cow doesn’t need tongue udders’”

 “her grace learned charm early age” said tyrion amused notion sister claiming she’s never rush claim since gods know

 “cersei even undid swaddling clothes give us better look” dornish prince continued “you one evil eye black fuzz scalp perhaps head larger most… tail beard neither teeth claws nothing legs tiny pink cock wonderful whispers lord tywin’s doom turned hideous red infant stunted legs elia even made noise young girls make sight infants i’m sure you’ve heard noise make cute kittens playful puppies believe wanted nurse ugly commented seemed poor sort monster sister said ‘he killed mother’ twisted little cock hard thought like pull shrieked brother jaime said ‘leave you’re hurting him’ cersei let go ‘it doesn’t matter’ told us ‘everyone says he’s like die soon shouldn’t even lived long’”

 sun shining bright day pleasantly warm autumn tyrion lannister went cold heard sweet sister scratched scar nose gave dornishman taste “evil eye” would tell tale testing simply twisting cock cersei hear scream “be sure tell story father delight much part tail especially one lopped off”

 prince oberyn chuckle “you’ve grown amusing since last met”

 “yes meant grow taller”

 “while speaking amusement heard curious tale lord buckler’s steward claimed put tax women’s privy purses”

 “it tax whoring” said tyrion irritated bloody father’s notion “only penny ah… act king’s hand felt might help improve morals city” pay joffrey’s wedding besides needless say master coin tyrion gotten blame bronn said calling dwarf’s penny streets “spread legs halfman now” shouting brothels wine sinks sellsword could believed

 “i make certain keep pouch full pennies even prince must pay taxes”

 “why need go whoring” glanced back ellaria sand rode among women “did tire paramour road”

 “never share much” prince oberyn shrugged “we never shared beautiful blonde woman however ellaria curious know creature”

 “i man wedded” though yet bedded “i longer frequent whores” unless want see hanged

 oberyn abruptly changed subject “it’s said seventyseven dishes served king’s wedding feast”

 “are hungry prince”

 “i hungered long time though food pray tell justice served”

 “justice” yes he’s seen “you close sister”

 “as children elia inseparable much like brother sister”

 gods hope “wars weddings kept us well occupied prince oberyn fear one yet time look murders sixteen years stale dreadful shall course soon may help dorne might able provide restore king’s peace would hasten beginning lord father’s inquiry—”

 “dwarf” said red viper tone grown markedly less cordial “spare lannister lies sheep take us fools brother bloodthirsty man neither asleep sixteen years jon arryn came sunspear year robert took throne sure questioned closely hundred come mummer’s show inquiry came justice elia children starting lummox gregor clegane… think ending dies enormity rides tell whence came orders please assure lord father that” smiled “an old septon claimed living proof goodness gods know imp”

 “no” tyrion admitted warily

 “why gods cruel would made mother’s firstborn doran third bloodthirsty man see must contend patient prudent gouty brother”

 tyrion could see sun shining blackwater rush half mile ahead walls towers hills king’s landing beyond glanced shoulder glittering column following kingsroad “you speak like man great host back” said “yet see three hundred spy city north river”

 “the midden heap call king’s landing”

 “that’s one”

 “not see believe smell now”

 “then take good sniff lord fill nose half million people stink three hundred you’ll find smell gold cloaks near five thousand father’s sworn swords must account another twenty thousand roses roses smell sweet don’t especially many fifty sixty seventy thousand roses city camped outside can’t really say many left there’s care count anyway”

 martell gave shrug “in dorne old married daeron said flowers bow sun roses seek hinder i’ll gladly trample underfoot”

 “as trampled willas tyrell”

 dornishman react expected “i letter willas half year past share interest fine horseflesh never borne ill happened lists struck breastplate clean foot caught stirrup fell horse came top sent maester afterward could save boy’s leg knee far past mending blame fool father willas tyrell green surcoat business riding company fat flower thrust tourneys tender age two wanted another leo longthorn made cripple”

 “there say ser loras better leo longthorn ever was” said tyrion

 “renly’s little rose doubt that”

 “doubt wish” said tyrion “but ser loras defeated many good knights including brother jaime”

 arya


 man roof first die crouched chimney two hundred yards away vague shadow predawn gloom sky began lighten stirred stretched stood anguy’s arrow took chest tumbled bonelessly steep slate pitch fell front septry door

 mummers posted two guards torch left night blind outlaws crept close kyle notch let fly together one man went arrow throat belly second man dropped torch flames licked screamed clothes took fire end stealth thoros gave shout outlaws attacked earnest

 arya watched atop horse crest wooded ridge overlooked septry mill brewhouse stables desolation weeds burnt trees mud surrounded trees mostly bare withered brown leaves still clung branches little obstruct view lord beric left beardless dick mudge guard arya hated left behind like stupid child least gendry kept back well knew better try argue battle battle obey

 eastern horizon glowed gold pink overhead half moon peeked low scuttling clouds wind blew cold arya could hear rush water creak mill’s great wooden waterwheel smell rain dawn air drops falling yet flaming arrows flew morning mists trailing pale ribbons fire thudded wooden walls septry smashed shuttered windows soon enough thin tendrils smoke rising broken shutters

 two mummers came bursting septry side side axes hands anguy archers waiting one axeman died managed duck shaft ripped shoulder staggered till two arrows found quickly hard say struck first long shafts punched breastplate made silk instead steel fell heavily anguy arrows tipped bodkins well broadheads bodkin could pierce even heavy plate i’m going learn shoot bow arya thought loved sword fighting could see arrows good

 flames creeping west wall septry thick smoke poured broken window myrish crossbowman poked head different window got bolt ducked rewind could hear fighting stables well shouts well mingled screams horses clang steel kill thought fiercely bit lip hard tasted blood kill every single one

 crossbowman appeared sooner loosed three arrows hissed past head one rattled helm vanished bow arya could see flames several secondstory windows smoke morning mists air haze blowing black white anguy bowmen creeping closer better find targets

 septry erupted mummers boiling like angry ants two ibbenese rushed door shaggy brown shields held high behind came dothraki great curved arakh bells braid behind three volantene sellswords covered fierce tattoos others climbing windows leaping ground arya saw man take arrow chest one leg across windowsill heard scream fell smoke thickening quarrels arrows sped back forth watty fell grunt bow slipping hand kyle trying nock another shaft string man black mail flung spear belly heard lord beric shout ditches trees rest band came pouring steel hand arya saw lem’s bright yellow cloak flapping behind rode man who’d killed kyle thoros lord beric everywhere swords swirling fire red priest hacked hide shield flew pieces horse kicked man face dothraki screamed charged lightning lord flaming sword leapt meet arakh blades kissed spun kissed dothraki’s hair ablaze moment later dead spied ned fighting lightning lord’s side it’s fair he’s little older let fight

 battle last long brave companions still feet soon died threw swords two dothraki managed regain horses flee lord beric let go “let carry word back harrenhal” said flaming sword hand “it give leech lord goat sleepless nights”

 jackbelucky harwin merrit o’ moontown braved burning septry search captives emerged smoke flames moments later eight brown brothers one weak merrit carry across shoulder septon well roundshouldered balding wore black chainmail grey robes “found hiding cellar steps” said jack coughing

 thoros smiled see “you utt”

 “septon utt man god”

 “what god would want likes o’ you” growled lem

 “i sinned” septon wailed “i know know forgive father oh grievously sinned”

 arya remembered septon utt time harrenhal shagwell fool said always wept prayed forgiveness he’d killed latest boy sometimes even made mummers scourge thought funny

 lord beric slammed sword scabbard quenching flames “give dying gift mercy bind others hand foot trial” commanded done

 trials went swiftly various outlaws came forward tell things brave companions done towns villages sacked crops burned women raped murdered men maimed tortured spoke boys septon utt carried septon wept prayed “i weak reed” told lord beric “i pray warrior strength gods made weak mercy weakness boys sweet boys… never mean hurt them…”

 septon utt soon dangled beneath tall elm swinging slowly neck naked name day brave companions followed one one fought kicking struggling noose tightened round throats one crossbowmen kept shouting “i soldier soldier” thick myrish accent another offered lead captors gold third told good outlaw would make stripped bound hanged turn tom sevenstrings played dirge woodharp thoros implored lord light roast souls end time

 mummer tree arya thought watched dangle pale skins painted sullen red flames burning septry already crows coming appearing nowhere heard croaking cackling one another wondered saying arya feared septon utt much rorge biter others still harrenhal glad dead hanged hound chopped head instead disgust outlaws treated sandor clegane’s burned arm restored sword horse armor set free miles hollow hill they’d taken gold

 septry soon collapsed roar smoke flame walls longer able support weight heavy slate roof eight brown brothers watched resignation remained explained eldest wore small iron hammer thong neck signify devotion smith “before war fourandforty prosperous place dozen milk cows bull hundred beehives vineyard apple arbor lions came took wine milk honey slaughtered cows put vineyard torch that… lost count visitors false septon latest one monster… gave silver certain hiding gold men killed us one one make elder brother talk”

 “how eight survive” asked anguy archer

 “i ashamed” old man said “it came turn die told gold hidden”

 “brother” said thoros myr “the shame telling once”

 outlaws sheltered night brewhouse beside little river hosts cache food hidden beneath floor stables shared simple supper oaten bread onions watery cabbage soup tasting faintly garlic arya found slice carrot floating bowl counted lucky brothers never asked outlaws names know arya thought could lord beric wore lightning bolt breastplate shield cloak thoros red robes remained one brother young novice bold enough tell red priest pray false god long roof “bugger that” said lem lemoncloak “he’s god owe us bloody lives what’s false might smith mend broken sword heal broken man”

 “enough lem” lord beric commanded “beneath roof honor rules”

 “the sun cease shine miss prayer two” thoros agreed mildly “i one would know”

 lord beric eat arya never seen eat though time time took cup wine seem sleep either good eye would often close weariness spoke would flick open marcher lord still clad ratty black cloak dented breastplate chipped enamel lightning even slept breastplate dull black steel hid terrible wound hound given way thick woolen scarf concealed dark ring throat nothing hid broken head caved temple raw red pit missing eye shape skull beneath face

 arya looked warily remembering tales told harrenhal lord beric seemed sense fear turned head beckoned closer “do frighten child”

 “no” chewed lip “only… well… thought hound killed but…”

 “a wound” said lem lemoncloak “a grievous wound aye thoros healed there’s never better healer”

 lord beric gazed lem queer look good eye look scars dried blood “no better healer” agreed wearily “lem past time change watch i’d think see you’d good”

 “aye m’lord” lem’s big yellow cloak swirled behind strode windy night

 “even brave men blind sometimes afraid see” lord beric said lem gone “thoros many times brought back now”

 red priest bowed head “it r’hllor brings back lord lord light instrument”

 “how many times” lord beric insisted

 “six” thoros said reluctantly “and time harder grown reckless lord death sweet”

 “sweet friend sweet”

 “then court lord tywin leads rear lord stannis well would wise seventh death might mean end us”

 lord beric touched spot left ear temple caved “here ser burton crakehall broke helm head blow mace” unwound scarf exposing black bruise encircled neck “here mark manticore made rushing falls seized poor beekeeper wife thinking mine let known far wide would hang unless gave hanged anyway gibbet them” lifted finger raw red pit eye “here mountain thrust dirk visor” weary smile brushed lips “that’s thrice died hands house clegane would think might learned…”

 jest arya knew thoros laugh put hand lord beric’s shoulder “best dwell it”

 “can dwell scarce remember held castle marches woman pledged marry could find castle today tell color woman’s hair knighted old friend favorite foods fades sometimes think born bloody grass grove ash taste fire mouth hole chest mother thoros”

 arya stared myrish priest shaggy hair pink rags bits old armor grey stubble covered cheeks sagging skin beneath chin look much like wizards old nan’s stories even so…

 “could bring back man without head” arya asked “just six times could you”

 “i magic child prayers first time lordship hole right blood mouth knew hope poor torn chest stopped moving gave good god’s kiss send way filled mouth fire breathed flames inside throat lungs heart soul last kiss called many time saw old priests bestow lord’s servants died given time two priests must never felt dead man shudder fire filled seen eyes come open raised lady lord r’hllor done yet life warmth warmth fire fire god’s god’s alone”

 arya felt tears well eyes thoros used lot words meant much understood

 “your father good man” lord beric said “harwin told much sake would gladly forgo ransom need gold desperately”

 chewed lip that’s true guess given hound’s gold greenbeard huntsman buy provisions south mander knew “the last harvest burned one drowning winter soon us” heard say sent “the smallfolk need grain seed need blades horses many men ride rounseys drays mules foes mounted coursers destriers”

 arya didn’t know much robb would pay though king boy she’d left winterfell snow melting hair knew things she’d done stableboy guard harrenhal all… “what brother doesn’t want ransom me”

 “why would think that” asked lord beric

 “well” arya said “my hair’s messy nails dirty feet hard” robb wouldn’t care probably mother would lady catelyn always wanted like sansa sing dance sew mind courtesies thinking made arya try comb hair fingers tangles mats tear “i ruined gown lady smallwood gave don’t sew good” chewed lip “i don’t sew well mean septa mordane used say blacksmith’s hands”

 gendry hooted “those soft little things” called “you couldn’t even hold hammer”

 “i could wanted” snapped

 thoros chuckled “your brother pay child fear count”

 “yes won’t” insisted

 lord beric sighed “then send lady smallwood time perhaps mine castle blackhaven necessary i’m certain power give back father thoros least see returned safely mother’s arms”

 “do swear” asked yoren promised take home he’d gotten killed instead

 “on honor knight” lightning lord said solemnly

 raining lem returned brewhouse muttering curses water ran yellow cloak puddle floor anguy jackbelucky sat door rolling dice matter game played oneeyed jack luck tom sevenstrings replaced string woodharp sang “the mother’s tears” “when willum’s wife wet” “lord harte rode rainy day” “the rains castamere”

 finally tom ran rain songs put away harp sound rain beating slate roof brewhouse dice game ended arya stood one leg listening merrit complain horse throwing shoe

 “i could shoe you” said gendry sudden “i ’prentice master said hand made hold hammer shoe horses close rents mail beat dents plate bet could make swords too”

 “what saying lad” asked harwin

 “i’ll smith you” gendry went one knee lord beric “if you’ll m’lord could use i’ve made tools knives made helmet wasn’t bad one mountain’s men stole taken”

 arya bit lip means leave

 “you would better serving lord tully riverrun” said lord beric “i cannot pay work”

 “no one ever want forge food eat place sleep that’s enough m’lord”

 “a smith find welcome anywhere skilled armorer even would choose stay us”

 arya watched gendry screw stupid face thinking “at hollow hill said king robert’s men brothers liked liked gave hound trial lord bolton hanged folk took heads lord tywin ser amory i’d sooner smith you”

 “we got plenty mail needs mending m’lord” jack reminded lord beric “most took dead there’s holes death came through”

 “you must lackwit boy” said lem “we’re outlaws lowborn scum us excepting lordship don’t think it’ll like tom’s fool songs neither won’t stealing kisses princess riding tourneys stolen armor join us you’ll end neck noose head mounted castle gate”

 “it’s they’d you” said gendry

 “aye that’s so” said jackbelucky cheerfully “the crows await us m’lord boy seems brave enough need brings us take says jack”

 “and quick” suggested harwin chuckling “before fever passes comes back senses”

 wan smile crossed lord beric’s lips “thoros sword”

 time lightning lord set blade afire merely laid light gendry’s shoulder “gendry swear eyes gods men defend cannot defend protect women children obey captains liege lord king fight bravely needed tasks laid upon however hard humble dangerous may be”

 “i m’lord”

 marcher lord moved sword right shoulder left said “arise ser gendry knight hollow hill welcome brotherhood”

 door came rough rasping laughter

 rain running burned arm wrapped leaves linen bound tight chest crude rope sling older burns marked face glistened black slick glow little fire “making knights dondarrion” intruder said growl “i ought kill that”

 lord beric faced coolly “i’d hoped we’d seen last clegane come find us”

 “it wasn’t hard made enough bloody smoke seen oldtown”

 “what’s become sentries posted”

 clegane’s mouth twitched “those two blind men might killed would had”

 anguy strung bow notch “do wish die much sandor” asked thoros “you must mad drunk follow us here”

 “drunk rain didn’t leave enough gold buy cup wine whoresons”

 anguy drew arrow “we’re outlaws outlaws steal it’s songs ask nice tom may sing one thankful didn’t kill you”

 “come try archer i’ll take quiver shove arrows freckly little arse”

 anguy raised longbow lord beric lifted hand could loose “why come clegane”

 “to get back what’s mine”

 “your gold”

 “what else wasn’t pleasure looking face dondarrion i’ll tell you’re uglier robber knight besides seems”

 “i gave note gold” lord beric said calmly “a promise pay war’s done”

 “i wiped arse paper want gold”

 “we don’t sent south greenbeard huntsman buy grain seed across mander”

 “to feed whose crops burned” said gendry

 “is tale now” sandor clegane laughed “as happens that’s meant feed bunch ugly peasants poxy whelps”

 “you’re lying” said gendry

 “the boy mouth see believe couldn’t face could it” clegane glanced arya “you going make knight dondarrion first eightyearold girl knight”

 “i’m twelve” arya lied loudly “and could knight wanted could killed lem took knife” remembering still made angry

 “complain lem tuck tail legs run know dogs wolves”

 “next time kill i’ll kill brother too”

 “no” dark eyes narrowed “that won’t” turned back lord beric “say make horse knight never shits hall doesn’t kick deserves knighted unless meant steal too”

 “best climb horse go” warned lem

 “i’ll go gold god said i’m guiltless—”

 “the lord light gave back life” declared thoros myr “he proclaim baelor blessed come again” red priest unsheathed sword arya saw jack merrit drawn well lord beric still held blade he’d used dub gendry maybe time they’ll kill

 hound’s mouth gave another twitch “you’re common thieves”

 lem glowered “your lion friends ride village take food every coin find call foraging wolves well us one robbed dog good foraged”

 sandor clegane looked faces every one trying commit memory walked back darkness pouring rain whence he’d come never another word outlaws waited wondering…

 “i best go see sentries” harwin took wary look door left make certain hound lurking outside

 “how’d bloody bastard get gold anyhow” lem lemoncloak said break tension

 anguy shrugged “he hand’s tourney king’s landing” bowman grinned “i fair fortune met dancy jayde alayaya taught roast swan tastes like bathe arbor wine”

 “pissed away you” laughed harwin

 “not bought boots excellent dagger”

 “you ought t’have bought land made one o’ roast swan girls honest woman” said jackbelucky “raised crop o’ turnips crop o’ sons”

 “warrior defend waste would turn gold turnips”

 “i like turnips” said jack aggrieved “i could mashed turnips right now”

 thoros myr paid heed banter “the hound lost bags coin” mused “he lost master kennel well cannot go back lannisters young wolf would never would brother like welcome gold left seems me”

 “bloody hell” said watty miller “he’ll come murder us sleep sure then”

 “no” lord beric sheathed sword “sandor clegane would kill us gladly sleep anguy morrow take rear beardless dick see clegane still sniffing us kill horse”

 “that’s good horse” anguy protested

 “aye” said lem “it’s bloody rider killing could use horse”

 “i’m lem” notch said “let feather dog times discourage some”

 lord beric shook head “clegane life beneath hollow hill rob it”

 “my lord wise” thoros told others “brothers trial battle holy thing heard ask r’hllor take hand saw fiery finger snap lord beric’s sword make end lord light yet done joffrey’s hound would seem”

 harwin soon returned brewhouse “puddingfoot sound asleep unharmed”

 “wait till get hold him” said lem “i’ll cut new bunghole could gotten every one us killed”

 one rested comfortably night knowing sandor clegane dark somewhere close arya curled near fire warm snug yet sleep would come took coin jaqen h’ghar given curled fingers around lay beneath cloak made feel strong hold remembering she’d ghost harrenhal could kill whisper

 jaqen gone though he’d left hot pie left gendry leaving lommy died yoren died syrio forel died even father died jaqen given stupid iron penny vanished “valar morghulis” whispered softly tightening fist hard edges coin dug palm “ser gregor dunsen polliver raff sweetling tickler hound ser ilyn ser meryn king joffrey queen cersei” arya tried imagine would look dead hard bring faces mind hound could see brother mountain would never forget joffrey’s face mother’s… raff dunsen polliver fading even tickler whose looks commonplace

 sleep took last black night arya woke tingling fire burned embers mudge stood door another guard pacing outside rain stopped could hear wolves howling close thought many sounded around stable dozens maybe hundreds hope eat hound remembered he’d said wolves dogs

 come morning septon utt still swung beneath tree brown brothers rain spades digging shallow graves dead lord beric thanked night’s lodging meal gave bag silver stags help rebuild harwin likely luke watty miller went scouting neither wolves hounds found

 arya cinching saddle girth gendry came say sorry put foot stirrup swung saddle could look instead could made swords riverrun brother thought said “if want stupid outlaw knight get hanged care i’ll riverrun ransomed brother”

 rain day thankfully made good time





 bran


 tower stood upon island twin reflected still blue waters wind blew ripples moved across surface lake chasing one another like boys play oak trees grew thick along lakeshore dense stand litter fallen acorns ground beneath beyond village remained

 first village seen since leaving foothills meera scouted ahead make certain one lurking amongst ruins sliding amongst oaks apple trees net spear hand startled three red deer sent bounding away brush summer saw flash motion bran watched direwolf lope moment wanted nothing much slip skin run meera waving come ahead reluctantly turned away summer urged hodor village jojen walked

 ground wall grasslands bran knew fallow fields low rolling hills high meadows lowland bogs would much easier going mountains behind much open space made meera uneasy “i feel naked” confessed “there’s place hide”

 “who holds land” jojen asked bran

 “the night’s watch” answered “this gift new gift north brandon’s gift” maester luwin taught history “brandon builder gave land south wall black brothers distance twentyfive leagues their… sustenance support” proud still remembered part “some maesters say brandon builder it’s still brandon’s gift thousands years later good queen alysanne visited wall dragon silverwing thought night’s watch brave old king double size lands fifty leagues new gift” waved hand “here this”

 one lived village long years bran could see houses falling even inn never much inn look remained stone chimney two cracked walls set amongst dozen apple trees one growing common room layer wet brown leaves rotting apples carpeted floor air thick smell cloying cidery scent almost overwhelming meera stabbed apples frog spear trying find still good enough eat brown wormy

 peaceful spot still tranquil lovely behold bran thought something sad empty inn hodor seemed feel “hodor” said confused sort way “hodor hodor”

 “this good land” jojen picked handful dirt rubbing fingers “a village inn stout holdfast lake apple trees… people bran would leave place”

 “they afraid wildlings” said bran “wildlings come wall mountains raid steal carry women catch make skull cup drink blood old nan used say night’s watch isn’t strong brandon’s day queen alysanne’s get places nearest wall got raided much smallfolk moved south mountains onto umber lands east kingsroad greatjon’s people get raided much people used live gift”

 jojen reed turned head slowly listening music could hear “we need shelter there’s storm coming bad one”

 bran looked sky beautiful crisp clear autumn day sunny almost warm dark clouds west true wind seemed picking “there’s roof inn two walls” pointed “we go holdfast”

 “hodor” said hodor maybe agreed

 “we boat bran” meera poked leaves idly frog spear

 “there’s causeway stone causeway hidden water could walk out” could anyway would ride hodor’s back least he’d stay dry way

 reeds exchanged look “how know that” asked jojen “have prince”

 “no old nan told holdfast golden crown see” pointed across lake could see patches flaking gold paint around crenellations “queen alysanne slept painted merlons gold honor”

 “a causeway” joien studied lake “you certain”

 “certain” said bran

 meera found foot easily enough knew look stone pathway three feet wide leading right lake took step careful step probing ahead frog spear could see path emerged climbing water onto island turning short flight stone steps led holdfast door

 path steps door straight line made think causeway ran straight wasn’t lake zigged zagged going third way around island jagging back turns treacherous long path meant anyone approaching would exposed arrow fire tower long time hidden stones slimy slippery twice hodor almost lost footing shouted “hodor” alarm regaining balance second time scared bran badly hodor fell lake basket could well drown especially huge stableboy panicked forgot bran way sometimes maybe stayed inn apple tree thought late

 thankfully third time water never got past hodor’s waist though reeds chests long island climbing steps holdfast door still stout though heavy oak planks warped years could longer closed completely meera shoved open way rusted iron hinges screaming lintel low “duck hodor” bran said enough keep bran hitting head “that hurt” complained

 “hodor” said hodor straightening

 found gloomy strongroom barely large enough hold four steps built inner wall tower curved away upward left downward right behind iron grates bran looked saw another grate head murder hole glad one pour boiling oil

 grates locked iron bars red rust hodor grabbed hold lefthand door gave pull grunting effort nothing happened tried pushing success shook bars kicked shoved rattled punched hinges huge hand air filled flakes rust iron door would budge one undervault accommodating “no way in” said meera shrugging

 murder hole bran’s head sat basket hodor’s back reached grabbed bars give try pulled grating came ceiling cascade rust crumbling stone “hodor” hodor shouted heavy iron grate gave bran another bang head crashed near jojen’s feet shoved meera laughed “look prince” said “you’re stronger hodor” bran blushed

 grate gone hodor able boost meera jojen gaping murder hole crannogmen took bran arms drew getting hodor inside hard part heavy reeds lift way they’d lifted bran finally bran told go look big rocks island lack hodor able pile high enough grab crumbling edges hole climb “hodor” panted happily grinning

 found maze small cells dark empty meera explored found way back steps higher climbed better light third story thick outer wall pierced arrow slits fourth actual windows fifth highest one big round chamber arched doors three sides opening onto small stone balconies fourth side privy chamber perched sewer chute dropped straight lake

 time reached roof sky completely overcast clouds west black wind blowing strong lifted bran’s cloak made flap snap “hodor” hodor said noise

 meera spun circle “i feel almost giant standing high world”

 “there trees neck stand twice tall this” brother reminded

 “aye trees around high” said meera “the world presses close neck sky much smaller here… feel wind brother look large world grown”

 true could see long ways south foothills rose mountains grey green beyond rolling plains new gift stretched away directions far eye could see “i hoping could see wall here” said bran disappointed “that stupid must still fifty leagues away” speaking made feel tired cold well “jojen reach wall uncle always said big seven hundred feet high thick base gates like tunnels ice going get past find threeeyed crow”

 “there abandoned castles along wall i’ve heard” jojen answered “fortresses built night’s watch left empty one may give us way through”

 ghost castles old nan called maester luwin made bran learn names every one forts along wall hard nineteen told though seventeen ever manned one time feast honor king robert’s visit winterfell bran recited names uncle benjen east west west east benjen stark laughed said “you know better bran perhaps first ranger i’ll stay place” bran fell though broken time he’d woken crippled sleep uncle gone back castle black

 “my uncle said gates sealed ice stone whenever castle abandoned” said bran

 “then we’ll open again” said meera

 made uneasy “we shouldn’t bad things might come side go castle black tell lord commander let us pass”

 “your grace” said jojen “we must avoid castle black avoided kingsroad hundreds men there”

 “men night’s watch” said bran “they say vows take part wars stuff”

 “aye” said jojen “but one man willing forswear would enough sell secret ironmen bastard bolton cannot certain watch would agree let us pass might decide hold us send us back”

 “but father friend night’s watch uncle first ranger might know threeeyed crow lives jon’s castle black too” bran hoping see jon uncle last black brothers visit winterfell said benjen stark vanished ranging surely would made way back “i bet watch would even give us horses” went

 “quiet” jojen shaded eyes hand gazed toward setting sun “look there’s something… rider think see him”

 bran shaded eyes well even squint saw nothing first till movement made turn first thought might summer man horse far away see much else

 “hodor” hodor put hand eyes well looking wrong way “hodor”

 “he haste” said meera “but he’s making village seems me”

 “we best go inside we’re seen” said jojen

 “summer’s near village” bran objected

 “summer fine” meera promised “it’s one man tired horse”

 fat wet drops began patter stone retreated floor well timed rain began fall earnest short time later even thick walls could hear lashing surface lake sat floor round empty room amidst gathering gloom northfacing balcony looked toward abandoned village meera crept belly peer across lake see become horseman “he’s taken shelter ruins inn” told came back “it looks though he’s making fire hearth”

 “i wish could fire” bran said “i’m cold there’s broken furniture stairs saw could hodor chop get warm”

 hodor liked idea “hodor” said hopefully

 jojen shook head “fire means smoke smoke tower could seen long way off”

 “if anyone see” sister argued

 “there’s man village”

 “one man”

 “one man would enough betray bran enemies he’s wrong man still half duck yesterday eat rest come morning man go way same”

 jojen way always meera divided duck four she’d caught net day tried rise marsh she’d surprised wasn’t tasty cold hot crisp spit least go hungry bran meera shared breast jojen ate thigh hodor devoured wing leg muttering “hodor” licking grease fingers every bite bran’s turn tell story told another brandon stark one called brandon shipwright sailed beyond sunset sea

 dusk settling time duck tale done rain still fell bran wondered far summer roamed whether caught one deer

 grey gloom filled tower slowly changed darkness hodor grew restless walked awhile striding round round walls stopping peer privy every circuit forgotten jojen stood north balcony hidden shadows looking night rain somewhere north lightning bolt crackled across sky brightening inside tower instant hodor jumped made frightened noise bran counted eight waiting thunder came hodor shouted “hodor”

 hope summer isn’t scared bran thought dogs winterfell’s kennels always spooked thunderstorms like hodor go see calm him…

 lightning flashed time thunder came six “hodor” hodor yelled “hodor hodor” snatched sword fight storm

 jojen said “be quiet hodor bran tell shout get sword away meera”

 “i try”

 “hodor hush” said bran “be quiet stupid hodoring sit down”

 “hodor” gave longsword meera meekly enough face mask confusion

 jojen turned back darkness heard suck breath “what it” meera asked

 “men village”

 “the man saw before”

 “other men armed saw axe spears well” joien never sounded much like boy “i saw lightning flashed moving trees”

 “how many”

 “many many count”

 “mounted

 “no”

 “hodor” hodor sounded frightened “hodor hodor”

 bran felt little scared though didn’t want say front meera “what come here”

 “they won’t” sat beside “why they”

 “for shelter” jojen’s voice grim “unless storm lets meera could go bar door”

 “i couldn’t even close wood’s warped won’t get past iron gates though”

 “they might could break lock hinges climb murder hole did”

 lightning slashed sky hodor whimpered clap thunder rolled across lake “hodor” roared clapping hands ears stumbling circle darkness “hodor hodor hodor”

 “no” bran shouted back “no hodoring”

 good “hoooodor” moaned hodor meera tried catch calm strong flung aside shrug “hoooooodooooooor” stableboy screamed lightning filled sky even jojen shouting shouting bran meera shut

 “be quiet” bran said shrill scared voice reaching uselessly hodor’s leg crashed past reaching reaching

 hodor staggered closed mouth shook head slowly side side sank back floor sat crosslegged thunder boomed scarcely seemed hear four sat dark tower scarce daring breathe

 “bran do” meera whispered

 “nothing” bran shook head “i don’t know” reached way reach summer hodor half heartbeat scared

 “something happening across lake” said jojen “i thought saw man pointing tower”

 won’t afraid prince winterfell eddard stark’s son almost man grown warg little baby boy like rickon summer would afraid “most like they’re umbers” said “or could knotts norreys flints come mountains even brothers night’s watch wearing black cloaks jojen”

 “by night cloaks black grace flash came went fast tell wearing”

 meera wary “if black brothers they’d mounted wouldn’t they”

 bran thought something else “it doesn’t matter” said confidently “they couldn’t get us even wanted unless boat knew causeway”

 “the causeway” meera mussed bran’s hair kissed forehead “our sweet prince he’s right jojen won’t know causeway even could never find way across night rain”

 “the night end though stay till morning…” jojen left rest unsaid moments said “they feeding fire first man started” lightning crashed sky light filled tower etched shadow hodor rocked back forth humming

 bran could feel summer’s fear bright instant closed two eyes opened third boy’s skin slipped like cloak left tower behind…

 …and found rain belly full deer cringing brush sky broke boomed smell rotten apples wet leaves almost drowned scent man heard clink slither hardskin saw men moving trees man stick blundered skin pulled head make blind deaf wolf went wide around behind dripping thornbush beneath bare branches apple tree could hear talking beneath scents rain leaves horse came sharp red stench fear…

 ground littered pine needles blown leaves carpet green brown still damp recent rains squished beneath feet huge bare oaks tall sentinels hosts soldier pines stood around hill another roundtower ancient empty thick green moss crawling side almost summit “who built stone like that” ygritte asked “some king”

 “no men used live here”

 “what happened them”

 “they died went away” brandon’s gift farmed thousands years watch dwindled fewer hands plow fields tend bees plant orchards wild reclaimed many field hall new gift villages holdfasts whose taxes rendered goods labor helped feed clothe black brothers largely gone well

 “they fools leave castle” said ygritte

 “it’s towerhouse little lordling lived family sworn men raiders came would light beacon roof winterfell towers three times size that”

 looked thought making “how could men build high giants lift stones”

 legend brandon builder used giants help raise winterfell jon want confuse issue “men build lot higher oldtown there’s tower taller wall” could tell believe could show winterfell… give flower glass gardens feast great hall show stone kings thrones could bathe hot pools love beneath heart tree old gods watched us

 dream sweet… winterfell would never show belonged brother king north snow stark bastard oathbreaker turncloak…

 “might could come back live tower” said “would want jon snow after”

 word spear thrust war conquest wildlings break wall…

 lord father talked raising new lords settling abandoned holdfasts shield wildlings plan would required watch yield back large part gift uncle benjen believed lord commander could around long new lordlings paid taxes castle black rather winterfell “it dream spring though” lord eddard said “even promise land lure men north winter coming on”

 winter come gone quickly spring followed turn might chosen hold one towers father’s name lord eddard dead however brother benjen lost shield dreamt together would never forged “this land belongs watch” jon said

 nostrils flared “no one lives here”

 “your raiders drove off”

 “they cowards wanted land stayed fought”

 “maybe tired fighting tired barring doors every night wondering rattleshirt someone like would break carry wives tired harvests stolen valuables might it’s easier move beyond reach raiders” wall fail north lie within reach raiders

 “you know nothing jon snow daughters taken wives you’re ones steal took whole world built wall t’ keep free folk out”

 “did we” sometimes jon forgot wild would remind “how happen”

 “the gods made earth men t’ share kings come crowns steel swords claimed trees said can’t eat apples stream can’t fish wood you’re t’ hunt earth water castle daughter keep hands away i’ll chop ’em maybe kneel t’ i’ll let sniff call us thieves least thief t’ brave clever quick kneeler t’ kneel”

 “harma bag bones don’t come raiding fish apples steal swords axes spices silks furs grab every coin ring jeweled cup find casks wine summer casks beef winter take women season carry beyond wall”

 “a queen stayed night” old nan told story maester luwin confirmed “alysanne wife king jaehaerys conciliator he’s called old king reigned long young first came iron throne days wont travel realm came winterfell brought queen six dragons half court king matters discuss warden north alysanne grew bored mounted dragon silverwing flew north see wall village one places stopped afterward smallfolk painted top holdfast look like golden crown she’d worn spent night among them”

 dothraki scouts told dany wanted see ser jorah mormont rode birchwood forest slanting sandstone ridge “near enough” warned crest

 dany reined mare looked across fields yunkish host lay athwart path whitebeard teaching best count numbers foe “five thousand” said moment

 “i’d say so” ser jorah pointed “those sellswords flanks lances mounted bowmen swords axes close work second sons left wing stormcrows right five hundred men apiece see banners”

 yunkai’s harpy grasped whip iron collar talons instead length chain sellswords flew standards beneath city served right four crows crossed thunderbolts left broken sword “the yunkai’i hold center themselves” dany noted officers looked indistinguishable astapor’s distance tall bright helms cloaks sewn flashing copper disks “are slave soldiers lead”

 “in large part equal unsullied yunkai known training bed slaves warriors”

 “what say defeat army”

 “easily” ser jorah said

 “but bloodlessly” blood aplenty soaked bricks astapor day city fell though little belonged

 “we might win battle cost cannot take city”

 “that ever risk khaleesi astapor complacent vulnerable yunkai forewarned”

 dany considered slaver host seemed small compared numbers sellswords ahorse she’d ridden long dothraki healthy respect mounted warriors could foot unsullied could withstand charge freedmen slaughtered “the slavers like talk” said “send word hear evening tent invite captains sellsword companies call well together stormcrows midday second sons two hours later”

 “as wish” ser jorah said “but come—”

 “this one remember”

 “i know tent midday want officers treat sellsword captains” dany spurred silver camp

 “five hundred stormcrows ten thousand unsullied” said dany “i young girl understand ways war yet odds seem poor me”

 “the stormcrows stand alone” said prendahl

 “stormcrows stand fly first sign thunder perhaps flying heard sellswords notoriously unfaithful avail staunch second sons change sides”

 “that happen” prendahl insisted unmoved “and would matter second sons nothing fight beside stalwart men yunkai”

 “you fight beside bedboys armed spears” turned head twin bells braid rang softly “once battle joined think ask quarter join however shall keep gold yunkaii paid claim share plunder besides greater rewards later come kingdom fight wise masters wages death imagine yunkai open gates unsullied butchering beneath walls “

 stormcrow captains rose unison “our answer no” said prendahl na ghezn fellows followed tent… daario naharis glanced back left inclined head polite farewell

 two hours later commander second sons arrived alone proved towering braavosi pale green eyes bushy redgold beard reached nearly belt name mero called titan’s bastard

 mero tossed wine straightaway wiped mouth back hand leered dany “i believe fucked twin sister pleasure house back home you”

 “that many years ago second sons led titan’s bastard”

 “so get courage” dany turned ser jorah “when battle joined kill one first”

 exile knight smiled “gladly grace”

 “of course” said mero “you could run stop take yunkish gold go”

 “had ever seen titan braavos foolish girl would know tail turn”

 “then stay fight me”

 “you worth fighting true” braavosi said “and would gladly let kiss sword free taken yunkai’s coin pledged holy word”

 “coins returned” said “i pay much cities conquer whole kingdom awaiting half world away serve faithfully second sons need never seek hire again”

 braavosi tugged thick red beard “as much perhaps kiss besides eh kiss man magnificent me”

 “perhaps”

 “it reputation want it’s five hundred horse stormcrows hope there”

 “no” ser jorah said bluntly “that prendahl ghiscari blood likely kin astapor”

 “a pity well perhaps need fight let us wait hear yunkai’i say”

 envoys yunkai arrived sun going fifty men magnificent black horses one great white camel helms twice tall heads crush bizarre twists towers shapes oiled hair beneath dyed linen skirts tunics deep yellow sewed copper disks cloaks

 “good unsullied relish bit fight” looked grey worm nodded

 grazdan shrugged expansively “if blood wish let flow told freed eunuchs freedom means much unsullied hat haddock” smiled grey worm eunuch might made stone “those survive shall enslave use retake astapor rabble make slave well doubt pleasure houses lys tyrosh men would pay handsomely bed last targaryen”

 “it good see know am” said dany mildly

 grazdan mo eraz pointed finger “you shall rue arrogance whore little lizards keep safe promise fill air arrows come within league yunkai think hard kill dragon”

 “harder kill slaver three days grazdan tell end third day yunkai whether open gates no”

 full dark fallen time yunkai’i departed camp promised gloomy night moonless starless chill wet wind blowing west fine black night thought dany fires burned around small orange stars strewn across hill field “ser jorah” said “summon bloodriders” dany seated mound cushions await dragons assembled said “an hour past midnight time enough”

 “yes khaleesi” said rakharo “time what”

 “to mount attack”

 “—that wanted answers morrow made promises tonight stormcrows arguing offer second sons drunk wine gave mero yunkai’i believe three days take cover darkness”

 “they scouts watching us”

 “and dark see hundreds campfires burning” said dany “if see anything all”

 “i think rhaegar targaryen’s sister” ser jorah said rueful half smile

 “aye” said arstan whitebeard “and queen well”

 took hour work details begins dangerous time dany thought captains departed commands could pray gloom night would hide preparations foe

 near midnight got scare ser jorah bulled way past strong belwas “the unsullied caught one sellswords trying sneak camp”

 “a spy” frightened they’d caught one many others might gotten away

 “he claims come bearing gifts it’s yellow fool blue hair”

 daario naharis “that one i’ll hear then”

 exile knight delivered asked whether two men ever different tyroshi fair ser jorah swarthy lithe knight brawny graced flowing locks balding yet smoothskinned mormont hairy knight dressed plainly made peacock look drab though thrown heavy black cloak bright yellow finery visit carried heavy canvas sack slung one shoulder

 “khaleesi” cried “i bring gifts glad tidings stormcrows yours” golden tooth gleamed mouth smiled “and daario naharis”

 dany dubious tyroshi come spy declaration might desperate plot save head “what prendahl na ghezn sallor say this”

 “little” daario upended sack heads sallor bald prendahl na ghezn spilled upon carpets “my gifts dragon queen”

 viserion sniffed blood leaking prendahl’s neck let loose gout flame took dead man full face blackening blistering bloodless cheeks drogon rhaegal stirred smell roasted meat

 “you this” dany asked queasily

 “none other” dragons discomfited daario naharis hid well mind paid might three kittens playing mouse

 “why”

 “because beautiful” hands large strong something hard blue eyes great curving nose suggested fierceness splendid bird prey “prendahl talked much said little” garb rich seen hard wear salt stains patterned boots enamel nails chipped lace soiled sweat could see end cloak fraying “and sallor picked nose snot gold” stood hands crossed wrists palms resting pommels blades curving dothraki arakh left hip myrish stiletto right hilts matched pair golden women naked wanton

 “are skilled use handsome blades” dany asked

 “prendahl sallor would tell dead men could talk count day lived unless loved woman slain foeman eaten fine meal… days lived numberless stars sky make slaughter thing beauty many tumbler fire dancer wept gods might half quick quarter graceful would tell names men slain could finish dragons would grow large castles walls yunkai would crumble yellow dust winter would come go come again”

 dany laughed liked swagger saw daario naharis “draw sword swear service”

 blink daario’s arakh free sheath submission outrageous rest great swoop brought face toes “my sword life love blood body songs live die command fair queen”

 “then live” dany said “and fight tonight”

 “that would wise queen” ser jorah gave daario cold hard stare “keep one guard battle’s fought won”

 considered moment shook head “if give us stormcrows surprise certain”

 “and betrays surprise lost”

 dany looked sellsword gave smile flushed turned away “he won’t”

 “how know that”

 pointed lumps blackened flesh dragons consuming bite bloody bite “i would call proof sincerity daario naharis stormcrows ready strike yunkish rear attack begins get back safely”

 “if stop say scouting saw nothing” tyroshi rose feet bowed swept

 ser jorah mormont lingered “your grace” said bluntly “that mistake know nothing man—”

 “we know great fighter”

 “a great talker mean”

 “he brings us stormcrows” blue eyes

 “five hundred sellswords uncertain loyalty”

 “all loyalties uncertain times these” dany reminded shall betrayed twice gold love

 “daenerys thrice age” ser jorah said “i seen false men worthy trust daario naharis one even beard wears false colors”

 angered “whilst honest beard telling man ever trust”

 stiffened “i say that”

 “you say every day pyat pree’s liar xaro’s schemer belwas braggart arstan assassin… think i’m still virgin girl cannot hear words behind words”

 “your grace—”

 bulled “you better friend known better brother viserys ever first queensguard commander army valued counselor good right hand honor respect cherish you—but desire jorah mormont weary trying push every man world away must needs rely alone serve make love better”

 mormont flushed red first began time dany done face pale stood still stone “if queen commands” said curt cold

 dany warm enough “she does” said “she commands go see unsullied ser battle fight win”

 gone dany threw pillows beside dragons meant sharp ser jorah endless suspicion finally woken dragon

 forgive told liege dany found wondering whether right daario felt lonely sudden mirri maz duur promised would never bear living child house targaryen end made sad “you must children” told dragons “my three fierce children arstan says dragons live longer men go dead”

 drogon looped neck around nip hand teeth sharp never broke skin played like dany laughed rolled back forth roared tail lashing like whip longer saw tomorrow longer still grow quickly grown shall wings mounted dragon could lead men battle astapor yet still small bear weight

 stillness settled camp midnight came went dany remained pavilion maids arstan whitebeard strong belwas kept guard waiting hardest part sit tent idle hands battle fought without made dany feel half child

 hours crept turtle feet even jhiqui rubbed knots shoulders dany restless sleep missandei offered sing lullaby peaceful people dany shook head “bring arstan” said

 old man came curled inside hrakkar pelt whose musty smell still reminded drogo “i cannot sleep men dying whitebeard” said “tell brother rhaegar would liked tale told ship decided must warrior”

 “your grace kind say so”

 “viserys said brother many tourneys”

 arstan bowed white head respectfully “it meet deny grace’s words…”

 “but” said dany sharply “tell command it”

 “prince rhaegar’s prowess unquestioned seldom entered lists never loved song swords way robert jaime lannister something task world set well everything well nature took joy men said loved harp much better lance”

 “he tourneys surely” said dany disappointed

 “when young grace rode brilliantly tourney storm’s end defeating lord steffon baratheon lord jason mallister red viper dorne mystery knight proved infamous simon toyne chief kingswood outlaws broke twelve lances ser arthur dayne day”

 “was champion then”

 “no grace honor went another knight kingsguard unhorsed prince rhaegar final tilt”

 dany want hear rhaegar unhorsed “but tourneys brother win”

 “your grace” old man hesitated “he greatest tourney all”

 “which that” dany demanded

 “the tourney lord whent staged harrenhal beside gods eye year false spring notable event besides jousting mêlée old style fought seven teams knights well archery axethrowing horse race tournament singers mummer show many feasts frolics lord whent open handed rich lavish purses proclaimed drew hundreds challengers even royal father came harrenhal left red keep long years greatest lords mightiest champions seven kingdoms rode tourney prince dragonstone bested all”

 “but tourney crowned lyanna stark queen love beauty” said dany “princess elia wife yet brother gave crown stark girl later stole away betrothed could dornish woman treat ill”

 “it say might brother’s heart grace princess elia good gracious lady though health ever delicate”

 dany pulled lion pelt tighter shoulders “viserys said fault born late” denied hotly remembered going far tell viserys fault born girl beat cruelly insolence “if born timely said rhaegar would married instead elia would come different rhaegar happy wife would needed stark girl”

 “perhaps grace” whitebeard paused moment “but certain rhaegar happy”

 “you make sound sour” dany protested

 “not sour but… melancholy prince rhaegar sense…” old man hesitated

 “say it” urged “a sense…”

 arya


 arya saw shape great hill looming distance golden afternoon sun knew come way back high heart

 sunset top making camp harm could come arya walked around circle weirwood stumps lord beric’s squire ned stood top one watching last light fade west could see storm raging north high heart stood rain wasn’t wind though gusts blowing strongly felt like someone behind yanking cloak turned one

 ghosts remembered high heart haunted

 built great fire atop hill thoros myr sat crosslegged beside gazing deep flames nothing else world

 “what doing” arya asked ned

 “sometimes sees things flames” squire told “the past future things happening far away”

 arya squinted fire see could see red priest seeing made eyes water long turned away gendry watching red priest well “can truly see future there” asked suddenly

 thoros turned fire sighing “not days yes lord light grants visions”

 gendry looked dubious “my master said sot fraud bad priest ever was”

 “that unkind” thoros chuckled “true unkind master know boy”

 “i ’prenticed master armorer tobho mott street steel used buy swords him”

 “just charged twice worth scolded setting afire” thoros laughed “your master right holy priest born youngest eight father gave red temple path would chosen prayed prayers spoke spells would also lead raids kitchens time time found girls bed wicked girls never knew got

 “i gift tongues though gazed flames well time time saw things even bother worth sent finally king’s landing bring lord’s light sevenbesotted westeros king aerys loved fire thought might make convert alas pyromancers knew better tricks

 “king robert fond though first time rode mêlée flaming sword kevan lannister’s horse reared threw grace laughed hard thought might rupture” red priest smiled memory “it way treat blade though master right too”

 “fire consumes” lord beric stood behind something voice silenced thoros “it consumes done nothing left nothing”

 “beric sweet friend” priest touched lightning lord forearm “what saying”

 “nothing said six times thoros six times many” turned away abruptly

 night wind howling almost like wolf real wolves west giving lessons notch anguy merrit o’ moontown watch ned gendry many others fast asleep arya spied small pale shape creeping behind horses thin white hair flying wild leaned upon gnarled cane woman could three feet tall firelight made eyes gleam red eyes jon’s wolf ghost arya stole closer knelt watch

 thoros lem lord beric dwarf woman sat uninvited fire squinted eyes like hot coals “the ember lemon come honor grace lord corpses”

 “an illomened name asked use it”

 “aye stink death fresh lord” single tooth remaining “give wine go bones old joints ache winds blow winds always blowing”

 “a silver stag dreams lady” lord beric said solemn courtesy “another news us”

 “i cannot eat silver stag ride one skin wine dreams news kiss great oaf yellow cloak” little woman cackled “aye sloppy kiss bit tongue long long mouth taste lemons mine bones old”

 “aye” lem complained “too old wine kisses you’ll get flat sword crone”

 “my hair comes handfuls one kissed thousand years hard old well song song tom o’ sevens news”

 “you song tom” lord beric promised gave wineskin

 dwarf woman drank deep wine running chin lowered skin wiped mouth back wrinkled hand said “sour wine sour tidings could fitting king dead sour enough you”

 arya’s heart caught throat

 “which bloody king dead crone” lem demanded

 “the wet one kraken king m’lords dreamt dead died iron squids turn one another oh lord hoster tully’s died know don’t hall kings goat sits alone fevered great dog descends him” old woman took another long gulp wine squeezing skin raised lips

 great dog mean hound maybe brother mountain rides arya certain bore arms three black dogs yellow field half men whose deaths prayed belonged ser gregor clegane polliver dunsen raff sweetling tickler ser gregor maybe lord beric hang

 “i dreamt wolf howling rain one heard grief” dwarf woman saying “i dreamt clangor thought head might burst drums horns pipes screams saddest sound little bells dreamt maid feast purple serpents hair venom dripping fangs later dreamt maid slaying savage giant castle built snow” turned head sharply smiled gloom right arya “you cannot hide child come closer now”

 cold fingers walked arya’s neck fear cuts deeper swords reminded stood approached fire warily light balls feet poised flee

 dwarf woman studied dim red eyes “i see you” whispered “i see wolf child blood child thought lord smelled death…” began sob little body shaking “you cruel come hill cruel gorged grief summerhall need none begone dark heart begone”

 fear voice arya took step backward wondering woman mad “don’t frighten child” thoros protested “there’s harm her”

 lem lemoncloak’s finger went broken nose “don’t bloody sure that”

 “she leave morrow us” lord beric assured little woman “we’re taking riverrun mother”

 “nay” said dwarf “you’re black fish holds rivers it’s mother want seek twins there’s wedding” cackled “look fires pink priest see though you’ll see nothing place belongs old gods still… linger shrunken feeble yet dead love flames oak recalls acorn acorn dreams oak stump lives remember first men came fire fists” drank last wine four long swallows flung skin aside pointed stick lord beric “i’ll payment i’ll song promised me”

 lem woke tom sevenstrings beneath furs brought yawning fireside woodharp hand “the song before” asked

 “oh aye jenny’s song another”

 sang dwarf woman closed eyes rocked slowly back forth murmuring words crying thoros took arya firmly hand drew aside “let savor song peace” said “it left”

 wasn’t going hurt arya thought “what mean twins mother’s riverrun isn’t she”

 “she was” red priest rubbed beneath chin “a wedding said shall see whenever lord beric find though”

 long sky opened lightning cracked thunder rolled across hills rain fell blinding sheets dwarf woman vanished suddenly appeared outlaws gathered branches threw crude shelters

 rained night come morning ned lem watty miller awoke chills watty could keep breakfast young ned feverish shivering turns skin clammy touch abandoned village half day’s ride north notch told lord beric they’d find better shelter place wait worst rains dragged back saddles urged horses great hill

 rains let rode woods fields fording swollen streams rushing water came bellies horses arya pulled hood cloak hunched sodden shivering determined falter merrit mudge soon coughing bad watty poor ned seemed grow miserable every mile “when wear helm rain beats steel gives headaches” complained “but take hair gets soaked sticks face mouth”

 “you knife” gendry suggested “if hair annoys much shave bloody head”

 doesn’t like ned squire seemed nice enough arya maybe little shy goodnatured always heard dornishmen small swarthy black hair small black eyes ned big blue eyes dark looked almost purple hair pale blond ash honey

 “how long lord beric’s squire” asked take mind misery

 “he took page espoused aunt” coughed “i seven turned ten raised squire prize riding rings”

 “i never learned lance could beat sword” said arya “have killed anyone”

 seemed startle “i’m twelve”

 killed boy eight arya almost said thought she’d better “you’ve battles though”

 “yes” sound proud “i mummer’s ford lord beric fell river dragged onto bank wouldn’t drown stood sword never fight though broken lance sticking one bothered us regrouped green gergen helped pull lordship back onto horse”

 arya remembering stableboy king’s landing there’d guard whose throat cut harrenhal ser amory’s men holdfast lake didn’t know weese chiswyck counted ones who’d died account weasel soup… sudden felt sad “my father called ned too” said

 “i know saw hand’s tourney wanted go speak couldn’t think say” ned shivered beneath cloak sodden length pale purple “were tourney saw sister ser loras tyrell gave rose”

 “she told me” seemed long ago “her friend jeyne poole fell love lord beric”

 “he’s promised aunt” ned looked uncomfortable “that though he…”

 …died thought ned’s voice trailed awkward silence horses’ hooves made sucking sounds pulled free mud

 “my lady” ned said last “you baseborn brother… jon snow”

 “he’s night’s watch wall” maybe go wall instead riverrun jon wouldn’t care killed whether brushed hair… “jon looks like even though he’s bastardborn used muss hair call ‘little sister’” arya missed jon saying name made sad “how know jon”

 “he milk brother”

 “brother” arya understand “but you’re dorne could jon blood”

 “milk brothers blood lady mother milk little wylla nurse me”

 arya lost “who’s wylla”

 “jon snow’s mother never told she’s served us years years since born”

 “jon never knew mother even name” arya gave ned wary look “you know truly” making mock “if lie i’ll punch face”

 “wylla wetnurse” repeated solemnly “i swear honor house”

 “you house” stupid squire course house “who you”

 “my lady” ned looked embarrassed “i’m edric dayne the… lord starfall”

 behind gendry groaned “lords ladies” proclaimed disgusted tone arya plucked withered crabapple passing branch whipped bouncing thick bull head “ow” said “that hurt” felt skin eye “what kind lady throws crabapples people”

 “the bad kind” said arya suddenly contrite turned back ned “i’m sorry didn’t know lord”

 “the fault mine lady” polite

 jon mother wylla name wylla would need remember could tell next time saw wondered would still call “little sister” i’m little anymore he’d call something else maybe got riverrun could write jon letter tell ned dayne said “there arthur dayne” remembered “the one called sword morning”

 “my father ser arthur’s elder brother lady ashara aunt never knew though threw sea atop palestone sword born”

 “why would that” said arya startled

 ned looked wary maybe afraid going throw something “your lord father never spoke her” said “the lady ashara dayne starfall”

 “no know her”

 “before robert king met father brothers harrenhal year false spring”

 “oh” arya know else say “why jump sea though”

 “her heart broken”

 sansa would sighed shed tear true love arya thought stupid couldn’t say ned though aunt “did someone break it”

 hesitated “perhaps it’s place…”

 “tell me”

 looked uncomfortably “my aunt allyria says lady ashara father fell love harrenhal—”

 “that’s loved lady mother”

 “i’m sure lady but—”

 “she one loved”

 “he must found bastard cabbage leaf then” gendry said behind

 arya wished another crabapple bounce face “my father honor” said angrily “and weren’t talking anyway don’t go back stoney sept ring girl’s stupid bells”

 gendry ignored “at least father raised bastard like mine don’t even know father’s name smelly drunk i’d wager like others mother dragged home alehouse whenever got mad she’d say ‘if father he’d beat bloody’ that’s know him” spat “well might i’d beat bloody he’s dead figure father’s dead matter lay with”

 mattered arya though could said ned trying apologize upsetting want hear pressed heels horse left anguy archer riding yards ahead caught said “dornishmen lie don’t they”

 “they’re famous it” bowman grinned “of course say us marchers what’s trouble ned’s good lad…”

 “he’s stupid liar” arya left trail leapt rotten log splashed across streambed ignoring shouts outlaws behind want tell lies thought trying get away many knew lands well use running caught

 harwin rode beside end “where think you’re going milady shouldn’t run wolves woods worse things”

 “i’m afraid” said “that boy ned said…”

 “aye told lady ashara dayne it’s old tale one heard winterfell older now” took hold bridle firmly turned horse around “i doubt there’s truth ned met dornish lady brother brandon still alive betrothed lady catelyn there’s stain father’s honor there’s nought like tourney make blood run hot maybe words whispered tent night say words kisses maybe where’s harm spring come thought neither one pledged”

 “she killed though” said arya uncertainly “ned says jumped tower sea”

 “so did” harwin admitted led back “but grief i’d wager she’d lost brother sword morning” shook head “let lie lady they’re dead let lie… please come riverrun say naught mother”

 village notch promised would took shelter grey stone stable half roof remained half roof building village it’s village it’s black stones old bones “did lannisters kill people lived here” arya asked helped anguy dry horses

 “no” pointed “look thick moss grows stones one’s moved long time there’s tree growing wall see place put torch long time ago”

 “who then” asked gendry

 “hoster tully” notch stooped thin greyhaired man born parts “this lord goodbrook’s village riverrun declared robert goodbrook stayed loyal king lord tully came fire sword trident goodbrook’s son made peace robert lord hoster didn’t help dead none”

 silence fell gendry gave arya queer look turned away brush horse outside rain came “i say need fire” thoros declared “the night dark full terrors wet eh wet”

 jackbelucky hacked dry wood stall notch merrit gathered straw kindling thoros struck spark lem fanned flames big yellow cloak roared swirled soon grew almost hot inside stable thoros sat crosslegged devouring flames eyes atop high heart arya watched closely lips moved thought heard mutter “riverrun” lem paced back forth coughing long shadow matching stride stride tom o’ sevens pulled boots rubbed feet “i must mad going back riverrun” singer complained “the tullys never lucky old tom lysa sent high road moon men took gold horse clothes well there’s knights vale still telling came walking bloody gate harp keep modest made sing ‘the name day boy’and king without courage’ opened gate solace three died laughing haven’t back eyrie since won’t sing’the king without courage’ either gold casterly—”

 “lannisters” thoros said “roaring red gold” lurched feet went lord beric lem tom wasted time joining arya could make saying singer kept glancing one time lem got angry pounded fist wall lord beric gestured come closer last thing wanted harwin put hand small back pushed forward took two steps hesitated full dread “my lord” waited hear lord beric would say

 “tell her” lightning lord commanded thoros

 red priest squatted beside “my lady” said “the lord granted view riverrun island sea fire seemed flames leaping lions long crimson claws roared sea lannisters lady riverrun soon come attack “

 arya felt though he’d punched belly “no”

 “sweetling” said thoros “the flames lie sometimes read wrongly blind fool time think lannisters soon riverrun siege”

 “robb beat them” arya got stubborn look “he’ll beat like before”

 “your brother may gone” said thoros “your mother well see flames wedding old one spoke wedding twins… ways knowing things one weirwoods whisper ear sleeps says mother gone twins…”

 arya turned tom lem “if hadn’t caught would would home”

 lord beric paid heed outburst “my lady” said weary courtesy “would know grandfather’s brother sight ser brynden tully called blackfish would know perchance”

 arya shook head miserably heard mother speak ser brynden blackfish ever met little remember

 “small chance blackfish pay good coin girl doesn’t know” said tom “those tullys sour suspicious lot he’s like think we’re selling false goods”

 “we’ll convince him” lem lemoncloak insisted “she harwin riverrun closest say take get gold bloody well done her”

 “and lions catch us inside castle” said tom “they’d like nothing better hang lordship cage top casterly rock”

 “i mean taken” said lord beric final word hung unspoken air alive heard even arya though never passed lips “still dare go blindly want know armies wolves lions sharna know something lord vance’s maester know acorn hall’s far lady smallwood shelter us time send scouts ahead learn…”

 words beat ears like pounding drum suddenly arya could stand wanted riverrun acorn hall wanted mother brother robb lady smallwood uncle never knew whirling broke door harwin tried grab arm spun away quick snake

 “no one need fear surely two hundred men”

 “aye others might m’lord said bring safe lord father that’s mean do”

 come way jaime reflected miles passed deserted mill beside lake weeds grew miller’s daughter smiled shyly miller shouted “the tourney’s back way ser” known

 king aerys made great show jaime’s investiture said vows king’s pavilion kneeling green grass white armor half realm looked ser gerold hightower raised put white cloak shoulders roar went jaime still remembered years later night aerys turned sour declaring need seven kingsguard harrenhal jaime commanded return king’s landing guard queen little prince viserys who’d remained behind even white bull offered take duty jaime might compete lord whent’s tourney aerys refused “he’ll win glory here” king said “he’s mine tywin’s he’ll serve see fit king rule he’ll obey”

 first time jaime understood skill sword lance white cloak feats valor he’d performed kingswood brotherhood aerys chosen spite father rob lord tywin heir

 even years later thought bitter day he’d ridden south new white cloak guard empty castle almost much stomach would ripped cloak could late said words whilst half realm looked kingsguard served life

 qyburn fell beside “is hand troubling you”

 “the lack hand troubling me” mornings hardest dreams jaime whole man dawn would lie halfawake feel fingers move nightmare part would whisper refusing believe even nightmare would open eyes

 “i understand visitor last night” said qyburn “i trust enjoyed her”

 jaime gave cool look “she say sent her”

 maester smiled modestly “your fever largely gone thought might enjoy bit exercise pia quite skilled would agree so… willing”

 certainly slipped door clothes quickly jaime thought still dreaming

 hadn’t woman slid blankets put good hand breast roused pretty little thing “i slip girl came lord whent’s tourney king gave cloak” confessed “you handsome white everyone said brave knight sometimes i’m man close eyes pretend it’s top smooth skin gold curls never truly thought i’d though”

 “more often lord vargo sends likes examine before… well suffice say loved unwisely wish fear pia quite healthy maid tarth”

 jaime gave sharp look “brienne”

 “yes strong girl one maidenhead still intact last night least” qyburn gave chuckle

 “he sent examine her”

 “to sure is… fastidious shall say”

 “does concern ransom” jaime asked “does father require proof still maiden”

 “you heard” qyburn gave shrug “we bird lord selwyn answer mine evenstar offers three hundred dragons daughter’s safe return told lord vargo sapphires tarth listen convinced evenstar intends cheat him”

 “three hundred dragons fair ransom knight goat take get”

 “the goat lord harrenhal lord harrenhal haggle”

 steps ended abruptly echoing darkness jaime sense vast space jerked halt teetering edge nothingness spearpoint jabbed small back shoving abyss shouted fall short landed hands knees upon soft sand shallow water watery caverns deep casterly rock one strange “what place this”

 “your place” voice echoed hundred voices thousand voices lannisters since lann clever who’d lived dawn days father’s voice beside lord tywin stood sister pale beautiful torch burning hand joffrey well son they’d made together behind dozen dark shapes golden hair

 “sister father brought us here”

 “us place brother darkness” torch light cavern torch light world turned go

 “stay me” jaime pleaded “don’t leave alone” leaving “don’t leave dark” something terrible lived “give sword least”

 “i gave sword” lord tywin said

 feet jaime groped water hand closed upon hilt nothing hurt long sword raised sword finger pale flame flickered point crept along edge stopping hand’s breath hilt fire took color steel burned silveryblue light gloom pulled back crouching listening jaime moved circle ready anything might come darkness water flowed boots ankle deep bitterly cold beware water told may creatures living hidden deeps…

 behind came great splash jaime whirled toward sound… faint light revealed brienne tarth hands bound heavy chains “i swore keep safe” wench said stubbornly “i swore oath” naked raised hands jaime “ser please would good”

 steel links parted like silk “a sword” brienne begged scabbard belt buckled around thick waist light dim jaime could scarcely see though stood scant feet apart light could almost beauty thought light could almost knight brienne’s sword took flame well burning silvery blue darkness retreated little

 “the flames burn long live” heard cersei call “when die must you”

 “sister” shouted “stay stay” reply soft sound retreating footsteps

 brienne moved longsword back forth watching silvery flames shift shimmer beneath feet reflection burning blade shone surface flat black water tall strong remembered yet seemed jaime woman’s shape

 “do keep bear here” brienne moving slow wary sword hand step turn listen step made little splash “a cave lion direwolves bear tell jaime lives lives darkness”

 “doom” bear knew lion “only doom”

 cool silveryblue light swords big wench looked pale fierce “i mislike place”

 “i’m fond myself” blades made little island light around stretched sea darkness unending “my feet wet”

 “we could go back way brought us climbed shoulders you’d trouble reaching tunnel mouth”

 could follow cersei could feel growing hard thought turned away brienne would see

 “listen” put hand shoulder trembled sudden touch she’s warm “something comes” brienne lifted sword point left “there”

 peered gloom saw something moving darkness could quite make out…

 “a man horse two two riders side side”

 “down beneath rock” made sense yet came two riders pale horses men mounts armored destriers emerged blackness slow walk make sound jaime realized splashing clink mail clop hoof remembered eddard stark riding length aerys’s throne room wrapped silence eyes spoken lord’s eyes cold grey full judgment

 “is stark” jaime called “come ahead never feared living fear dead”

 brienne touched arm “there more”

 saw armored snow seemed ribbons mist swirled back shoulders visors helms closed jaime lannister need look upon faces know

 five brothers oswell whent jon darry lewyn martell prince dorne white bull gerold hightower ser arthur dayne sword morning beside crowned mist grief long hair streaming behind rode rhaegar targaryen prince dragonstone rightful heir iron throne

 “you don’t frighten me” called turning split either side know way face “i fight one one together wench duel gets cross leave out”

 “i swore oath keep safe” said rhaegar’s shade “i swore holy oath”

 “we swore oaths” said ser arthur dayne sadly

 shades dismounted ghostly horses drew longswords made sound “he going burn city” jaime said “to leave robert ashes”

 “he king” said darry

 “you swore keep safe” said whent

 “and children well” said prince lewyn

 prince rhaegar burned cold light white red dark “i left wife children hands”

 “i never thought he’d hurt them” jaime’s sword burning less brightly “i king…”

 “killing king” said ser arthur

 “cutting throat” said prince lewyn

 “the king sworn die for” said white bull

 fires ran along blade guttering jaime remembered cersei said terror closed hand throat sword went dark brienne’s burned ghosts came rushing

 “no” said “no nooooooooo”

 heart pounding jerked awake found starry darkness amidst grove trees could taste bile mouth shivering sweat hot cold looked sword hand wrist ended leather linen wrapped snug around ugly stump felt sudden tears well eyes felt felt strength fingers rough leather sword’s grip hand…

 “my lord” qyburn knelt beside fatherly face crinkly concern “what heard cry out”

 steelshanks walton stood tall dour “what scream”

 “a dream… dream” jaime stared camp around lost moment “i dark hand back” looked stump felt sick there’s place like beneath rock thought stomach sour empty head pounding he’d pillowed stump

 qyburn felt brow “you still touch fever”

 “a fever dream” jaime reached “help me” steelshanks took good hand pulled feet

 “another cup dreamwine” asked qyburn

 “no i’ve dreamt enough night” wondered long till dawn somehow knew closed eyes would back dark wet place

 “milk poppy something fever still weak lord need sleep rest”

 last thing mean moonlight glimmered pale upon stump jaime rested head moss covered thickly noticed saw wood white made think winterfell ned stark’s heart tree thought never stump dead stark others prince rhaegar ser arthur children aerys aerys dead “do believe ghosts maester” asked qyburn

 man’s face grew strange “once citadel came empty room saw empty chair yet knew woman moment cushion dented she’d sat cloth still warm scent lingered air leave smells behind us leave room surely something souls must remain leave life” qyburn spread hands “the archmaesters like thinking though well marwyn one”

 jaime ran fingers hair “walton” said “saddle horses want go back”

 “back” steelshanks regarded dubiously

 thinks i’ve gone mad perhaps “i left something harrenhal”

 “lord vargo holds bloody mummers”

 “you twice men does”

 “if don’t serve father commanded lord bolton hide press king’s landing”

 jaime might countered smile threat onehanded cripples inspire much fear wondered brother would tyrion would find way “lannisters lie steelshanks didn’t lord bolton tell that”

 man frowned suspiciously “what did”

 “unless take back harrenhal song sing father may one lord dreadfort would wish hear might even say bolton ordered hand cut steelshanks walton swung blade”

 walton gaped “that isn’t so”

 “no father believe” jaime made smile way used smile nothing world could frighten “it much easier go back we’d way soon enough i’d sing sweet song king’s landing you’ll never believe ears you’d get girl nice fat purse gold thanks”

 “gold” walton liked well enough “how much gold”

 “why much would want”

 time sun came halfway back harrenhal

 jaime pushed horse much harder day steelshanks northmen forced match pace even midday reached castle lake beneath darkening sky threatened rain immense walls five great towers stood black ominous looks dead walls empty gates closed barred high barbican single banner hung limp black goat qohor knew jaime cupped hands shout “you open gates i’ll kick down”

 catelyn


 rob bid farewell young queen thrice godswood heart tree sight gods men second time beneath portcullis jeyne sent forth long embrace longer kiss finally hour beyond tumblestone girl came galloping welllathered horse plead young king take along

 robb touched catelyn saw abashed well day damp grey drizzle begun fall last thing wanted call halt march could stand wet console tearful young wife front half army speaks gently thought watched together anger underneath

 time king queen talking grey wind prowled around stopping shake water coat bare teeth rain last robb gave jeyne one final kiss dispatched dozen men take back riverrun mounted horse direwolf raced ahead swift arrow loosed longbow

 “queen jeyne loving heart see” said lame lothar frey catelyn “not unlike sisters would wager guess even roslin dancing round twins chanting ‘lady tully lady tully lady roslin tully’ morrow she’ll holding swatches riverrun redandblue cheek picture she’ll look bride’s cloak” turned saddle smile edmure “but strangely quiet lord tully feel wonder”

 “much stone mill warhorns sounded” edmure said half jest

 lothar gave goodnatured laugh “let us pray marriage ends happily lord”

 may gods protect us catelyn pressed heels horse leaving brother lame lothar other’s company

 insisted jeyne remain riverrun robb would sooner kept side lord walder might well construe queen’s absence wedding another slight yet presence would different sort insult salt old man’s wound “walder frey sharp tongue long memory” warned son “i doubt strong enough suffer old man’s rebukes price allegiance much father sit insults jeyne face”

 robb could deny sense yet resents catelyn thought wearily misses jeyne already part blames absence though knows good counsel

 six westerlings come son crag one remained side ser raynald jeyne’s brother royal bannerbearer robb dispatched jeyne’s uncle rolph spicer deliver young martyn lannister golden tooth day received lord tywin’s assent exchange captives deftly done son relieved fear martyn’s safety galbart glover relieved hear brother robett put ship duskendale ser rolph important honorable employment… grey wind king’s side belongs

 lady westerling remained riverrun children jeyne little sister eleyna young rollam robb’s squire complained bitterly left yet wise well olyvar frey squired robb previously would doubtless present sister’s wedding parade replacement would unwise unkind ser raynald cheerful young knight swore insult walder frey’s could possibly provoke let us pray insults need contend

 catelyn fears score though lord father never trusted walder frey trident ever mindful queen jeyne would safest behind high strong walls riverrun blackfish protect robb even created new title warden southern marches ser brynden would hold trident man could

 catelyn would miss uncle’s craggy face robb would miss counsel ser brynden played part every victory son galbart glover taken command scouts outriders place good man loyal steady without blackfish’s brilliance

 behind glover’s screen scouts robb’s line march stretched several miles greatjon led van catelyn traveled main column surrounded plodding warhorses steelclad men backs next came baggage train procession wayns laden food fodder camp supplies wedding gifts wounded weak walk watchful eye ser wendel manderly white harbor knights herds sheep goats scrawny cattle trailed behind little tail footsore camp followers even farther back robin flint rearguard enemy back hundreds leagues robb would take chances

 thirtyfive hundred thirtyfive hundred blooded whispering wood reddened swords battle camps oxcross ashemark crag goldrich hills lannister west aside brother edmure’s modest retinue friends lords trident remained hold riverlands king retook north ahead awaited edmure’s bride robb’s next battle… two dead sons empty bed castle full ghosts cheerless prospect brienne bring girls back brienne bring back safe

 drizzle sent turned soft steady rain midday continued well past nightfall next day northmen never saw sun rode beneath leaden skies hoods pulled keep water eyes heavy rain turning roads mud fields quagmires swelling rivers stripping trees leaves constant patter made idle chatter bother worth men spoke something say seldom enough

 “we stronger seem lady” lady maege mormont said rode catelyn grown fond lady maege eldest daughter dacey understanding matter jaime lannister found daughter tall lean mother short stout dressed alike mail leather black bear house mormont shield surcoat catelyn’s lights queer garb lady yet dacey lady maege seemed comfortable warriors women ever girl tarth

 “i fought beside young wolf every battle” dacey mormont said cheerfully “he lost one yet”

 lost everything else catelyn thought would say aloud northmen lack courage far home little enough sustain faith young king faith must protected costs must stronger told must strong robb despair grief consume everything would turn marriage edmure roslin happy one another late lord frey could appeased power wedded robb’s… even chance caught lannister greyjoy question catelyn dared dwell though robb dwelt little else saw studied maps whenever made camp searching plan might win back north

 brother edmure cares “you don’t suppose lord walder’s daughters look like you” wondered sat tall striped pavilion catelyn friends

 “with many different mothers maids bound turn comely” said ser marq piper “but old wretch give pretty one”

 “no reason all” said edmure glum tone

 catelyn could stand “cersei lannister comely” said sharply “you’d wiser pray roslin strong healthy good head loyal heart” left

 edmure take well next day avoided entirely march preferring company marq piper lymond goodbrook patrek mallister young vances scold except jest catelyn told raced afternoon nary word always hard edmure grief sharpens every word regretted rebuke rain enough falling sky without making really terrible thing want pretty wife remembered childish disappointment first time laid eyes eddard stark pictured younger version brother brandon wrong ned shorter plainer face somber spoke courteously enough beneath words sensed coolness odds brandon whose mirths wild rages even took maidenhood love duty passion made robb night though made king together war winterfell love enough woman found good sweet heart beneath ned’s solemn face reason edmure find roslin

 gods would route took whispering wood robb first great victory followed course twisting stream floor pinched narrow valley much jaime lannister’s men done fateful night warmer catelyn remembered trees still green stream overflow banks fallen leaves choked flow lay sodden snarls among rocks roots trees hidden robb’s army exchanged green raiment leaves dull gold spotted brown red reminded rust dry blood spruce soldier pines still showed green thrusting belly clouds like tall dark spears

 trees died since reflected night whispering wood ned still alive cell beneath aegon’s high hill bran rickon safe behind walls winterfell theon greyjoy fought robb’s side boasted almost crossed swords kingslayer would theon died place lord karstark’s sons much ill would undone

 passed battleground catelyn glimpsed signs carnage overturned helm filling rain splintered lance bones horse stone cairns raised men fallen scavengers already amidst tumbles rock spied brightly colored cloth bits shiny metal saw face peering shape skull beginning emerge beneath melting brown flesh

 made wonder ned come rest silent sisters taken bones north escorted hallis mollen small honor guard ned ever reached winterfell interred beside brother brandon dark crypts beneath castle door slam shut moat cailin hal sisters could pass

 thirtyfive hundred riders wound way along valley floor heart whispering wood catelyn stark seldom felt lonelier every league crossed took farther riverrun found wondering whether would ever see castle lost forever like much else

 five days later scouts rode back warn rising waters washed wooden bridge fairmarket galbart glover two bolder men tried swimming mounts across turbulent blue fork ramsford two horses swept drowned one riders glover managed cling rock could pull “the river hasn’t run high since spring” edmure said “and rain keeps falling go higher yet”

 “there’s bridge upstream near oldstones” remembered catelyn often crossed lands father “it’s older smaller still stands—”

 “it’s gone lady” galbart glover said “washed away even one fairmarket”

 robb looked catelyn “is another bridge”

 “no fords impassable” tried remember “if cannot cross blue fork we’ll go around sevenstreams hag’s mire”

 “bogs bad roads none all” warned edmure “the going slow we’ll get suppose”

 “lord walder wait i’m sure” said robb “lothar sent bird riverrun knows coming”

 “yes man prickly suspicious nature” said catelyn “he may take delay deliberate insult”

 “very well i’ll beg pardon tardiness well sorry king i’ll apologizing every second breath” robb made wry face “i hope bolton got across trident rains began kingsroad runs straight north he’ll easy march even afoot reach twins us”

 “and you’ve joined men seen brother married then” catelyn asked

 “north” robb scratched grey wind behind ear

 “by causeway moat cailin”

 gave enigmatic smile “that’s one way go” said knew tone would say wise king keeps counsel reminded

 reached oldstones eight days steady rain made camp upon hill overlooking blue fork within ruined stronghold ancient river kings foundations remained amongst weeds show walls keeps stood local smallfolk long ago made stones raise barns septs holdfasts yet center would castle’s yard great carved sepulcher still rested half hidden waisthigh brown grass amongst stand ash

 lid sepulcher carved likeness man whose bones lay beneath rain wind done work king worn beard could see otherwise face smooth featureless vague suggestions mouth nose eyes crown temples hands folded shaft stone warhammer lay upon chest warhammer would carved runes told name history centuries worn away stone cracked crumbling corners discolored spreading white splotches lichen wild roses crept king’s feet almost chest

 catelyn found robb standing somber gathering dusk grey wind beside rain stopped bareheaded “does castle name” asked quietly came

 “oldstones smallfolk called girl doubt name still hall kings” camped father way seagard petyr us too…

 “there’s song” remembered “‘jenny oldstones flowers hair’”

 “we’re songs end lucky” played jenny day even wound flowers hair petyr pretended prince dragonflies catelyn could twelve petyr boy

 robb studied sepulcher “whose grave this”

 “here lies tristifer fourth name king rivers hills” father told story “he ruled trident neck thousands years jenny prince days kingdoms first men falling one onslaught andals hammer justice called fought hundred battles nineandninety singers say raised castle strongest westeros” put hand son’s shoulder “he died hundredth battle seven andal kings joined forces fifth tristifer equal soon kingdom lost castle last line tristifer fifth died house mudd ruled riverlands thousand years andals came”

 “his heir failed him” robb ran hand rough weathered stone “i hoped leave jeyne child… tried often enough i’m certain…”

 “it always happen first time” though “nor even hundredth young”

 “young king” said “a king must heir die next battle kingdom must die law sansa next line succession winterfell north would pass her” mouth tightened “to lord husband tyrion lannister cannot allow allow dwarf must never north”

 “no” catelyn agreed “you must name another heir time jeyne gives son” considered moment “your father’s father siblings father sister married younger son lord raymar royce junior branch three daughters wed vale lordlings waynwood corbray certain youngest… might templeton but…”

 “mother” sharpness robb’s tone “you forget father four sons”

 forgotten wanted look yet “a snow stark”

 “jon’s stark lordlings vale never much set eyes winterfell”

 “jon brother night’s watch sworn take wife hold lands take black serve life”

 “so knights kingsguard stop lannisters stripping white cloaks ser barristan selmy ser boros blount use send watch hundred men jon’s place i’ll wager find way release vows”

 set catelyn knew stubborn son could “a bastard cannot inherit”

 “not unless he’s legitimized royal decree” said robb “there precedent releasing sworn brother oath”

 “precedent” said bitterly “yes aegon fourth legitimized bastards deathbed much pain grief war murder grew know trust jon trust sons sons blackfyre pretenders troubled targaryens five generations barristan bold slew last stepstones make jon legitimate way turn bastard wed breed sons may jeyne never safe”

 “jon would never harm son mine”

 “no theon greyjoy would harm bran rickon”

 grey wind leapt atop king tristifer’s crypt teeth bared robb’s face cold “that cruel unfair jon theon”

 “so pray considered sisters rights agree north must permitted pass imp arya law comes sansa… sister trueborn…”

 “…and dead one seen heard arya since cut father’s head lie arya’s gone bran rickon they’ll kill sansa dwarf gets child jon brother remains die without issue want succeed king north hoped would support choice”

 “i cannot” said “in else robb everything this… folly ask it”

 “i don’t i’m king” robb turned walked grey wind bounding tomb loping

 done catelyn thought wearily stood alone tristifer’s stone sepulcher first anger edmure robb done speak truth men fragile cannot bear hear might wept sky begun could walk back tent sit silence

 days followed robb everywhere anywhere riding head van greatjon scouting grey wind racing back robin flint rearguard men said proudly young wolf first rise dawn last sleep night catelyn wondered whether sleeping grows lean hungry direwolf

 “my lady” maege mormont said one morning rode steady rain “you seem somber aught amiss”

 lord husband dead father two sons murdered daughter given faithless dwarf bear vile children daughter vanished likely dead last son brother angry could possibly amiss truth lady maege would wish hear however “this evil rain” said instead “we suffered much peril grief ahead need face boldly horns blowing banners flying bravely rain beats us banners hang limp sodden men huddle cloaks scarcely speak one another evil rain would chill hearts need burn hot”

 dacey mormont looked sky “i would sooner water raining arrows”

 catelyn smiled despite “you braver fear bear island women warriors”

 “shebears aye” said lady maege “we needed olden days ironmen would come raiding longboats wildlings frozen shore men would fishing like wives left behind defend children else carried off”

 “there’s carving gate” said dacey “a woman bearskin child one arm suckling breast hand holds battleaxe she’s proper lady one always loved her”

 “my nephew jorah brought home proper lady once” said lady maege “he tourney hated carving”

 “aye rest” said dacey “she hair like spun gold lynesse skin like cream soft hands never made axes”

 “nor teats giving suck” mother said bluntly

 catelyn knew spoke jorah mormont brought second wife winterfell feasts guested fortnight remembered young lady lynesse fair unhappy one night several cups wine confessed catelyn north place hightower oldtown “there tully riverrun felt once” answered gently trying console “but time found much could love”

 lost reflected winterfell ned bran rickon sansa arya gone robb remains much lynesse hightower little starks would known wield axe perhaps might able protect better

 day followed day still rain kept falling way blue fork rode past sevenstreams river unraveled confusion rills brooks hag’s mire glistening green pools waited swallow unwary soft ground sucked hooves horses like hungry babe mother’s breast going worse slow half wayns abandoned muck loads distributed amongst mules draft horses

 lord jason mallister caught amidst bogs hag’s mire hour daylight remaining rode column robb called halt ser raynald westerling came escort catelyn king’s tent found son seated beside brazier map across lap grey wind slept feet greatjon along galbart glover maege mormont edmure man catelyn know fleshy balding man cringing look lordling one knew moment laid eyes stranger even warrior

 jason mallister rose offer catelyn seat hair almost much white brown lord seagard still handsome man tall lean chiseled cleanshaven face high cheekbones fierce bluegrey eyes “lady stark ever pleasure bring good tidings hope”

 “we sore need lord” sat listening rain patter noisily canvas overhead

 robb waited ser raynald close tent flap “the gods heard prayers lords lord jason brought us captain myraham merchanter oldtown captain tell told me”

 “aye grace” licked thick lips nervously “my last port call afore seagard lordsport pyke ironmen kept more’n half year king balon’s command well long short he’s dead”

 “balon greyjoy” catelyn’s heart skipped beat “you telling us balon greyjoy dead”

 shabby little captain nodded “you know pyke’s built headland part rocks islands shore bridges way heard lordsport blow coming west rain thunder old king balon crossing one bridges wind got hold tore thing pieces washed two days later bloated broken crabs ate eyes hear”

 greatjon laughed “king crabs hope sup upon royal jelly eh”

 captain bobbed head “aye that’s no” leaned forward “the brother’s back”

 “victarion” asked galbart glover surprised

 “euron crow’s eye call black pirate ever raised sail he’s gone years lord balon sooner cold sailing lordsport silence black sails red hull crewed mutes he’d asshai back heard wherever though he’s home marched right pyke sat arse seastone chair drowned lord botley cask seawater objected ran back myraham slipped anchor hoping could get away whilst things confused am”

 “captain” said robb man done “you thanks go unrewarded lord jason take back ship done pray wait outside”

 “that grace will”

 sooner left king’s pavilion greatjon began laugh robb silenced look “euron greyjoy man’s notion king half theon said true theon rightful heir unless he’s dead… victarion commands iron fleet can’t believe would remain moat cailin euron crow’s eye holds seastone chair go back”

 “there’s daughter well” galbart glover reminded “the one holds deepwood motte robett’s wife child”

 “if stays deepwood motte that’s hope hold” said robb “what’s true brothers even true need sail home oust euron press claim” son turned lord jason mallister “you fleet seagard”

 “a fleet grace half dozen longships two war galleys enough defend shores raiders could hope meet iron fleet battle”

 “nor would ask ironborn setting sail toward pyke expect theon told people think every captain king deck want voice succession lord need two longships sail around cape eagles neck greywater watch”

 lord jason hesitated “a dozen streams drain wetwood shallow silty uncharted would even call rivers channels ever drifting changing endless sandbars deadfalls tangles rotting trees greywater watch moves ships find it”

 “go upriver flying banner crannogmen find want two ships double chances message reaching howland reed lady maege shall go one galbart second” turned two he’d named “you’ll carry letters lords mine remain north commands within false case misfortune taken happens must tell sailing north back bear island stony shore” tapped finger map “moat cailin key lord balon knew sent brother victarion hard heart greyjoy strength”

 “succession squabbles ironborn fools abandon moat cailin” said lady maege

 “no” robb admitted “victarion leave best part garrison i’d guess every man takes one less man need fight however take many captains count leaders need men speak hopes sit seastone chair”

 “you cannot mean attack causeway grace” said galbart glover “the approaches narrow way deploy one ever taken moat”

 “from south” said robb “but attack north west simultaneously take ironmen rear beating think main thrust causeway chance link lord bolton freys twelve thousand men mean divide three battles start causeway halfday apart greyjoys eyes south neck see whole strength rushing headlong moat cailin

 “roose bolton rearguard command center greatjon shall lead van moat cailin attack must fierce ironborn leisure wonder anyone creeping north”

 greatjon chuckled “your creepers best come fast men swarm walls win moat show face i’ll make gift come dawdling up”

 “that’s gift glad have” said robb

 edmure frowning “you talk attacking ironmen rear sire mean get north them”

 “there ways neck map uncle ways known crannogmen—narrow trails bogs wet roads reeds boats follow” turned two messengers “tell howland reed send guides two days started causeway center battle standard flies three hosts leave twins two reach moat cailin mine battle melt away neck reemerge fever move swiftly uncle’s wed position year’s end fall upon moat three sides first day new century ironmen waking hammers beating heads mead they’ll quaff night before”

 “i like plan” said greatjon “i like well”

 galbart glover rubbed mouth “there risks crannogmen fail you…”

 “we worse fail father knew worth howland reed” robb rolled map looked catelyn “mother”

 tensed “do part me”

 “your part stay safe journey neck dangerous naught battle awaits us north lord mallister kindly offered keep safe seagard war done comfortable know”

 punishment opposing jon snow woman worse mother took moment realize watching known realized catelyn surprised friends freeing kingslayer heard greatjon say women place battlefield

 anger must blazed across face galbart glover spoke said word “my lady grace wise it’s best come us”

 “seagard brightened presence lady catelyn” said lord jason mallister

 “you would make prisoner” said

 “an honored guest” lord jason insisted

 catelyn turned son “i mean offense lord jason” said stiffly “but cannot continue would sooner return riverrun”

 “i left wife riverrun want mother elsewhere keep treasures one purse make easier would rob wedding shall go seagard royal command” robb stood quick fate settled picked sheet parchment “one matter lord balon left chaos wake hope would yet son yet brothers bran rickon dead sister wed lannister i’ve thought long hard might follow command true loyal lords fix seals document witnesses decision”

 king indeed catelyn thought defeated could hope trap he’d planned moat cailin worked well one he’d caught





 samwell


 whitetree sam thought please let whitetree remembered whitetree whitetree maps he’d drawn way north village whitetree knew please wanted badly forgot feet little bit forgot ache calves lower back stiff frozen fingers could scarcely feel even forgot lord mormont craster wights others whitetree sam prayed god might listening

 wildling villages looked much alike though huge weirwood grew center one… white tree mean whitetree necessarily hadn’t weirwood whitetree bigger one maybe remembering wrong face carved bone pale trunk long sad red tears dried sap leaked eyes looked came north sam couldn’t recall

 around tree stood handful oneroom hovels sod roofs longhall built logs grown moss stone well sheepfold… sheep people wildlings gone join mance rayder frostfangs taking owned except houses sam thankful night coming would good sleep beneath roof tired seemed though walking half life boots falling pieces blisters feet burst turned callus new blisters callus toes getting frostbitten

 either walk die sam knew gilly still weak childbirth carrying babe besides needed horse second horse died three days craster’s keep wonder lasted long poor halfstarved thing sam’s weight probably done might tried riding double afraid thing would happen it’s better walk

 sam left gilly longhall make fire poked head hovels better making fires could never seem get kindling catch last time he’d tried strike spark flint steel managed cut knife gilly bound gash hand stiff sore even clumsier knew wash wound change binding afraid look besides cold hated taking gloves

 sam know hoped find empty houses maybe wildlings left food behind take look jon searched huts whitetree way north inside one hovel sam heard rustling rats dark corner otherwise nothing old straw old smells ashes beneath smoke hole

 turned back weirwood studied carved face moment face saw admitted tree’s half big one whitetree red eyes wept blood didn’t remember either clumsily sam sank knees “old gods hear prayer seven father’s gods said words joined watch help us fear might lost we’re hungry cold don’t know gods believe but… please you’re help us gilly little son” could think say dusk deepening leaves weirwood rustling softly waving like thousand bloodred hands whether jon’s gods heard could say

 time returned longhall gilly fire going sat close furs opened babe breast he’s hungry sam thought old women smuggled food craster’s eaten sam hopeless hunter even horn hill game plentiful hounds huntsmen help endless empty forest chances catching anything remote efforts fishing lakes halffrozen streams dismal failures well

 “how much longer sam” gilly asked “is far still”

 “not far far was” sam shrugged pack eased awkwardly floor tried cross legs back ached abominably walking would liked lean one carved wooden pillars supported roof fire center hall beneath smoke hole craved warmth even comfort “another days see us there”

 sam maps wasn’t whitetree weren’t going much use went far east get around lake fretted maybe far west tried double back coming hate lakes rivers never ferry bridge meant walking way around lakes searching places ford rivers easier follow game trail struggle brush easier circle ridge instead climbing bannen dywen us we’d castle black warming feet common room bannen dead though dywen gone grenn dolorous edd others

 wall three hundred miles long seven hundred feet high sam reminded kept going south find sooner later certain going south day took directions sun clear nights could follow ice dragon’s tail though hadn’t traveled much night since second horse died even moon full dark beneath trees would easy sam last garron break leg well south

 wasn’t certain far east west might strayed would reach wall yes… day fortnight couldn’t farther surely surely… gate castle black needed find way wall hundred leagues

 “is wall big craster used say” gilly asked

 “bigger” sam tried sound cheerful “so big can’t even see castles hidden behind they’re you’ll see wall ice castles stone wood tall towers deep vaults huge longhall great fire burning hearth day night it’s hot gilly you’ll hardly believe it”

 “could stand fire boy long time till we’re good warm”

 “you stand fire long like you’ll food drink hot mulled wine bowl venison stewed onions hobb’s bread right oven hot burn fingers” sam peeled glove wriggle fingers near flames soon regretted numb cold feeling returned hurt much almost cried “sometimes one brothers sing” said take mind pain “dareon sang best sent eastwatch there’s still halder though toad real name todder looks like toad call likes sing awful voice”

 “do sing” gilly rearranged furs moved babe one breast

 sam blushed “i… know songs little liked sing danced lord father never liked said wanted prance around yard sword hand”

 “could sing southron song babe”

 “if like” sam thought moment “there’s song septon used sing sisters little time us go sleep ‘the song seven’ it’s called” cleared throat softly sang





 father’s face stern strong

 sits judges right wrong

 weighs lives short long

 loves little children





 mother gives gift life

 watches every wife

 gentle smile ends strife

 loves little children





 warrior stands foe

 protecting us e’er go

 sword shield spear bow

 guards little children





 crone wise old

 sees fates unfold

 lifts lamp shining gold

 lead little children





 smith labors day night

 put world men right

 hammer plow fire bright

 builds little children





 maiden dances sky

 lives every lover’s sigh

 smiles teach birds fly

 give dreams little children





 seven gods made us

 listening call

 close eyes shall fall

 see little children

 close eyes shall fall

 see little children





 sam remembered last time he’d sung song mother lull baby dickon sleep father heard voices come barging angry “i that” lord randyll told wife harshly “you ruined one boy soft septon’s songs mean babe” looked sam said “go sing sisters must sing don’t want near son”

 gilly’s babe gone sleep tiny thing quiet sam feared didn’t even name asked gilly said bad luck name child two many died

 tucked nipple back inside furs “that pretty sam sing good”

 “you hear dareon voice sweet mead”

 “we drank sweetest mead day craster made wife summer cold” gilly gave puzzled look “did sing six gods craster always told us southrons seven”

 “seven” agreed “but one sings stranger” stranger’s face face death even talking made sam uncomfortable “we eat something bite two”

 nothing left black sausages hard wood sam sawed thin slices effort made wrist ache hungry enough persist chewed slices long enough softened tasted good craster’s wives seasoned garlic

 finished sam begged pardon went relieve look horse biting wind blowing north leaves trees rattled passed break thin scum ice top stream horse could get drink better bring inside want wake break day find horse frozen death night gilly would keep going even happened girl brave like wished knew going back castle black kept saying she’d wife wanted black brothers didn’t keep wives besides tarly horn hill could never wed wildling i’ll think something long reach wall alive rest doesn’t matter doesn’t matter one little bit

 leading horse longhall simple enough getting door sam persisted gilly already dozing time got garron inside hobbled horse corner fed fresh wood fire took heavy cloak wriggled furs beside wildling woman cloak big enough cover three keep warmth bodies

 gilly smelled milk garlic musty old fur used good smells far sam concerned liked sleeping next made remember times long past shared huge bed horn hill two sisters ended lord randyll decided making soft girl sleeping alone cold cell never made harder braver though wondered father would say could see killed one others lord imagined saying stabbed obsidian dagger sworn brothers call sam slayer even fancies lord randyll scowled disbelieving

 dreams strange night back horn hill castle father sam’s castle jon snow lord mormont old bear grenn dolorous edd pyp toad brothers watch wore bright colors instead black sam sat high table feasted cutting thick slices roast father’s greatsword heartsbane sweet cakes eat honeyed wine drink singing dancing everyone warm feast done went sleep lord’s bedchamber mother father lived room shared sisters instead sisters gilly waiting huge soft bed wearing nothing big shaggy fur milk leaking breasts

 woke suddenly cold dread

 fire burned smouldering red embers air seemed frozen cold corner garron whinnying kicking logs hind legs gilly sat beside fire hugging babe sam sat groggy breath puffing pale open mouth longball dark shadows black blacker hair arms standing

 it’s nothing told i’m cold that’s

 door one shadows moved big one

 still dream sam prayed oh make i’m still asleep make nightmare he’s dead he’s dead saw die “he’s come babe” gilly wept “he smells babe freshborn stinks o’ life he’s come life”

 huge dark shape stooped lintel hall shambled toward dim light fire shadow became small paul

 “go away” sam croaked “we don’t want here”

 paul’s hands coal face milk eyes shone bitter blue hoarfrost whitened beard one shoulder hunched raven pecking cheek eating dead white flesh sam’s bladder let go felt warmth running legs “gilly calm horse lead that”

 arya


 reached top ridge saw river sandor clegane reined hard cursed

 rain falling black iron sky pricking green brown torrent ten thousand swords must mile across arya thought tops half hundred trees poked swirling waters limbs clutching sky like arms drowning men thick mats sodden leaves choked shoreline farther channel glimpsed something pale swollen deer perhaps dead horse moving swiftly downstream sound low rumble edge hearing like sound dog makes growls

 arya squirmed saddle felt links hound’s mail digging back arms encircled left burned arm he’d donned steel vambrace protection she’d seen change dressings flesh beneath still raw seeping burns pained though sandor clegane gave hint

 “is blackwater rush” ridden far rain darkness trackless woods nameless villages arya lost sense

 “it’s river need cross that’s need know” clegane would answer time time warned talk back given lot warnings first day “the next time hit i’ll tie hands behind back” he’d said “the next time try run i’ll bind feet together scream shout bite i’ll gag ride double throw across back horse trussed like sow slaughter choice”

 chosen ride first time made camp she’d waited thought asleep found big jagged rock smash ugly head quiet shadow told crept toward wasn’t quiet enough hound hadn’t asleep maybe he’d woken whichever eyes opened mouth twitched took rock away baby best could kick “i’ll give one” said flung rock bushes “but you’re stupid enough try i’ll hurt you”

 “why don’t kill like mycah” arya screamed still defiant angry scared

 answered grabbing front tunic yanking within inch burned face “the next time say name i’ll beat bad you’ll wish killed you”

 rolled horse blanket every night went sleep tied ropes around top bottom bound tight babe swaddling clothes

 blackwater arya decided watched rain lash river hound joffrey’s dog taking back red keep hand joffrey queen wished sun would come could tell way going looked moss trees confused got blackwater wasn’t wide king’s landing rains

 “the fords gone” sandor clegane said “and wouldn’t care try swim neither”

 there’s way across thought lord beric catch us sure clegane pushed big black stallion hard doubling back thrice throw pursuit even riding half mile center swollen stream… arya still expected see outlaws every time looked back tried help scratching name trunks trees went bushes make water fourth time caught end doesn’t matter arya told thoros find flames hadn’t yet anyway crossed river…

 “harroway town shouldn’t far” hound said “where lord roote stables old king andahar’s twoheaded water horse maybe we’ll ride across”

 arya never heard old king andahar she’d never seen horse two heads either especially one could run water knew better ask held tongue sat stiff hound turned stallion’s head trotted along ridgeline following river downstream least rain backs way she’d enough stinging eyes halfblind washing cheeks like crying wolves never cry reminded

 could much past noon sky dark dusk seen sun days could count arya soaked bone saddlesore sniffling achy fever sometimes shivered uncontrollably she’d told hound sick he’d snarled “wipe nose shut mouth” told half time slept saddle trusting stallion follow whatever rutted farm track game trail horse heavy courser almost big destrier much faster stranger hound called arya tried steal clegane taking piss tree thinking could ride could catch stranger almost bitten face gentle old gelding master otherwise temper black never known horse quick bite kick

 rode beside river hours splashing across two muddy vassal streams reached place sandor clegane spoken “lord harroway’s town” said saw “seven hells” town drowned desolate rising waters overflowed riverbanks remained harroway town upper story daubandwattle inn sevensided dome sunken sept twothirds stone roundtower moldy thatch roofs forest chimneys

 smoke coming tower arya saw one arched window wide flatbottomed boat chained tight boat dozen oarlocks pair great carved wooden horse heads mounted fore aft twoheaded horse realized wooden house sod roof right middle deck hound cupped hands around mouth shouted two men came spilling third appeared window roundtower clutching loaded crossbow “what want” shouted across swirling brown waters

 “take us over” hound shouted back

 men boat conferred one another one grizzled greyhaired man thick arms bent back stepped rail “it cost you”

 “then i’ll pay”

 arya wondered outlaws taken clegane’s gold maybe lord beric left silver copper ferry ride shouldn’t cost coppers…

 ferrymen talking finally bentbacked one turned away gave shout six men appeared pulling hoods keep rain heads still squirmed holdfast window leapt onto deck half looked enough like bentbacked man kin undid chains took long poles others slid heavy widebladed oars locks ferry swung began creep slowly toward shallows oars stroking smoothly either side sandor clegane rode hill meet

 aft end boat slammed hillside ferrymen opened wide door beneath carved horse’s head extended heavy oaken plank stranger balked water’s edge hound put heels courser’s flank urged gangway bentbacked man waiting deck “wet enough ser” asked smiling

 hound’s mouth gave twitch “i need boat bloody wit” dismounted pulled arya beside one boatmen reached stranger’s bridle “i wouldn’t” clegane said horse kicked man leapt back slipped rainslick deck crashed onto arse cursing

 ferryman bent back wasn’t smiling longer “we get across” said sourly “it cost gold piece another horse third boy”

 “three dragons” clegane gave bark laughter “for three dragons bloody ferry”

 “last year might could river i’ll need extra hands poles oars see don’t get swept hundred miles sea here’s choice three dragons teach hellhorse walk water”

 “i like honest brigand way three dragons… put us ashore safe north bank”

 “i’ll don’t go” man thrust thick callused hand palm

 clegane rattled longsword loosen blade scabbard “here’s choice gold north bank steel south”

 ferryman looked hound’s face arya could tell didn’t like saw dozen men behind strong men oars hardwood poles hands none rushing forward help together could overwhelm sandor clegane though he’d likely kill three four took “how know you’re good it” bentbacked man asked moment

 he’s wanted shout instead bit lip

 “knight’s honor” hound said unsmiling

 he’s even knight say either

 “that do” ferryman spat “come across dark tie horse don’t want spooking we’re way there’s brazier cabin son want get warm”

 “i’m stupid son” said arya furiously even worse taken boy angry might told really sandor clegane grabbed back collar hoisted onehanded deck “how many times need tell shut bloody mouth” shook hard teeth rattled let fall “get get dry like man said”

 arya told big iron brazier glowing red filling room sullen suffocating heat felt pleasant stand beside warm hands dry little bit soon felt deck move feet slipped back forward door

 twoheaded horse eased slowly shallows picking way chimneys rooftops drowned harroway dozen men labored oars four used long poles push whenever came close rock tree sunken house bentbacked man rudder rain pattered smooth planks deck splashed tall carved horseheads fore aft arya getting soaked didn’t care wanted see man crossbow still stood window roundtower saw eyes followed ferry slid underneath wondered lord roote hound mentioned doesn’t look much like lord didn’t look much like lady either

 beyond town river proper current grew much stronger grey haze rain arya could make tall stone pillar far shore surely marked ferry landing sooner seen realized pushed away downstream oarsmen rowing vigorously fighting rage river leaves broken branches swirled past fast they’d fired scorpion men poles leaned shoved away anything came close windier whenever turned look upstream arya got face full blowing rain stranger screaming kicking deck moved underfoot

 jumped side river would wash away hound even knew gone looked back shoulder saw sandor clegane struggling frightened horse trying calm would never better chance get away might drown though jon used say swam like fish even fish might trouble river still drowning might better king’s landing thought joffrey crept prow river murky brown mud lashed rain looking like soup water arya wondered cold would couldn’t get much wetter put hand rail

 sudden shout snapped head could leap ferrymen rushing forward poles hand moment understand happening saw uprooted tree huge dark coming straight tangle roots limbs poked water came like reaching arms great kraken oarsmen backing water frantically trying avoid collision could capsize stove hull old man wrenched rudder horse prow swinging downstream slowly glistening brown black tree rushed toward like battering ram

 could ten feet prow two boatmen somehow caught long poles one snapped long splintering craaaack made sound ferry breaking beneath second man managed give trunk hard shove enough deflect away tree swept past ferry inches spare branches scrabbling like claws horsehead seemed clear one monster’s upper limbs dealt glancing thump ferry seemed shudder arya slipped landing painfully one knee man broken pole lucky heard shout stumbled side raging brown water closed gone time took arya climb back feet one boatmen snatched coil rope one throw

 maybe he’ll wash someplace downstream arya tried tell thought hollow ring lost desire go swimming sandor clegane shouted get back inside beat bloody went meekly ferry fighting turn back course river wanted nothing carry sea

 finally came ashore good two miles downriver usual landing boat slammed bank hard another pole snapped arya almost lost feet sandor clegane lifted onto stranger’s back weighed doll boatmen stared dull exhausted eyes bentbacked man held hand “six dragons” demanded “three passage three man lost”

 sandor clegane rummaged pouch shoved crumpled wad parchment boatman’s palm “there take ten”

 “ten” ferryman confused “what’s now”

 “a dead man’s note good nine thousand dragons nearabouts” hound swung saddle behind arya smiled unpleasantly “ten i’ll back rest one day see don’t go spending it”

 man squinted parchment “writing good’s writing promised gold knight’s honor said”

 “knights bloody honor time learned old man” hound gave stranger spur galloped rain ferrymen threw curses backs one two threw stones clegane ignored rocks words alike long lost gloom trees river dwindling roar behind “the ferry won’t cross back till morning” said “and lot won’t taking paper promises next fools come along friends chasing us they’re going need bloody strong swimmers”

 arya huddled held tongue valar morghulis thought sullenly ser ilyn ser meryn king joffrey queen cersei dunsen polliver raff sweetling ser gregor tickler hound hound hound

 time rain stopped clouds broke shivering sneezing badly clegane called halt night even tried make fire wood gathered proved wet though nothing tried enough make spark catch finally kicked apart disgust “seven bloody hells” swore “i hate fires”

 sat damp rocks beneath oak tree listening slow patter water dripping leaves ate cold supper hardbread moldy cheese smoked sausage hound sliced meat dagger narrowed eyes caught arya looking knife “don’t even think it”

 “i wasn’t” lied

 snorted show thought gave thick slice sausage arya worried teeth watching “i never beat sister” hound said “but i’ll beat make stop trying think ways kill none bit good”

 nothing say gnawed sausage stared coldly hard stone thought

 “at least look face i’ll give little shewolf like it”

 “i don’t it’s burned ugly”

 clegane offered chunk cheese point dagger “you’re little fool good would get away you’d get caught someone worse”

 “i would not” insisted “there one worse”

 “you never knew brother gregor killed man snoring man” grinned burned side face pulled tight twisting mouth queer unpleasant way lips side stump ear

 “i know brother” maybe mountain worse arya thought “him dunsen polliver raff sweetling tickler”

 hound seemed surprised “and would ned stark’s precious little daughter come know likes gregor never brings pet rats court”

 “i know village” ate cheese reached hunk hardbread “the village lake caught gendry hot pie caught lommy greenhands raff sweetling killed leg hurt”

 clegane’s mouth twitched “caught brother caught you” made laugh sour sound part rumble part snarl “gregor never knew couldn’t would dragged back kicking screaming king’s landing dumped cersei’s lap oh that’s bloody sweet i’ll sure tell cut heart out”

 wasn’t first time talked killing mountain “but he’s brother” arya said dubiously

 “didn’t ever brother wanted kill” laughed “or maybe sister” must seen something face leaned closer “sansa that’s isn’t wolf bitch wants kill pretty bird”

 “no” arya spat back “i’d like kill you”

 “because hacked little friend two i’ve killed lot promise think makes monster well maybe saved sister’s life day mob pulled horse cut brought back castle else would gotten lollys stokeworth got sang didn’t know sister sang sweet little song”

 “you’re lying” said

 “you don’t know half much think blackwater seven hells think think we’re going”

 scorn voice made hesitate “back king’s landing” said “you’re bringing joffrey queen” wrong realized sudden way asked questions say something

 “stupid blind little wolf bitch” voice rough hard iron rasp “bugger joffrey bugger queen bugger twisted little gargoyle calls brother i’m done city done kingsguard done lannisters what’s dog lions ask you” reached waterskin took long pull wiped mouth offered skin arya said “the river trident girl trident blackwater make map head morrow reach kingsroad we’ll make good time straight twins it’s going hands mother noble lightning lord flaming fraud priest monster” grinned look face “you think outlaw friends ones smell ransom dondarrion took gold took you’re worth twice stole i’d say maybe even sold back lannisters like fear won’t even dog gets tired kicked young wolf wits gods gave toad he’ll make lordling beg enter service needs though may know yet maybe i’ll even kill gregor he’d like that”

 “he’ll never take you” spat back “not you”

 “then i’ll take much gold carry laugh face ride doesn’t take he’d wise kill won’t much father’s son hear fine either way win shewolf stop whimpering snapping i’m sick keep mouth shut tell maybe we’ll even time uncle’s bloody wedding”





 jon


 mare blown jon could let reach wall magnar would slept saddle he’d one lacking hard enough stay ahorse awake wounded leg grew ever painful dare rest long enough let heal instead ripped open anew time mounted

 crested rise saw brown rutted kingsroad wending way north hill plain patted mare’s neck said “now need follow road girl soon wall” leg gone stiff wood fever made lightheaded twice found riding wrong direction

 soon wall pictured friends drinking mulled wine common hall hobb would kettles donal noye forge maester aemon rooms beneath rookery old bear sam grenn dolorous edd dywen wooden teeth… jon could pray escaped fist

 ygritte much thoughts well remembered smell hair warmth body… look face slit old man’s throat wrong love voice whispered wrong leave different voice insisted wondered father torn way he’d left jon’s mother return lady catelyn pledged lady stark pledged night’s watch

 almost rode mole’s town feverish know village hidden underground handful small hovels seen light waning moon brothel shed bigger privy red lantern creaking wind bloodshot eye peering blackness jon dismounted adjoining stable halfstumbling mare’s back shouted two boys awake “i need fresh mount saddle bridle” told tone brooked argument brought skin wine well half loaf brown bread “wake village” told “warn wildlings south wall gather goods make castle black” pulled onto black gelding they’d given gritting teeth pain leg rode hard north

 stars began fade eastern sky wall appeared rising trees morning mists moonlight glimmered pale ice urged gelding following muddy slick road saw stone towers timbered halls castle black huddled like broken toys beneath great cliff ice wall glowed pink purple first light dawn

 sentries challenged rode past outbuildings one came forth bar way castle black seemed much ruin greyguard brown brittle weeds grew cracks stones courtyards old snow covered roof flint barracks lay drifts north side hardin’s tower jon used sleep made old bear’s steward fingers soot streaked lord commander’s tower smoke boiled windows mormont moved king’s tower fire jon saw lights either ground could tell sentries walking wall seven hundred feet saw one huge switchback stair climbed south face ice like great wooden thunderbolt

 jon grasped door stay upright “who told that”

 “jarman buckwell returned fortnight past scouts claim saw eyes riding along beside wildling column wearing sheepskin cloak” noye eyed “i see last part’s true”

 jon swallowed groan “feints mance wants us spread thin don’t see” bowen marsh obliged “the gate attack here”

 noye crossed room “your leg drenched blood”

 jon looked dully true wound opened “an arrow wound…”

 “a wildling arrow” question noye one arm thick muscle slid jon’s help support “you’re white milk burning hot besides i’m taking aemon”

 “there’s time wildlings south wall coming queenscrown open gate”

 “how many” noye halfcarried jon door

 “where’s wolf” noye asked crossed yard

 “ghost leave climbed wall i’d hoped he’d make way back here”

 “i’m sorry lad there’s sign him” limped maester’s door long wooden keep beneath rookery armorer gave kick “clydas”

 fire burning hearth room almost stuffy warmth made jon sleepy soon noye eased onto back closed eyes stop world spinning could hear ravens quorking complaining rookery “snow” one bird saying “snow snow snow” sam’s jon remembered samwell tarly made home safely wondered birds

 maester aemon long coming moved slowly one spotted hand clydas’s arm shuffled forward small careful steps around thin neck chain hung heavy gold silver links glinting amongst iron lead tin base metals “jon snow” said “you must tell you’ve seen done stronger donal put kettle wine fire irons well want redhot clydas shall need good sharp knife yours” maester hundred years old shrunken frail hairless quite blind milky eyes saw nothing wits still sharp ever

 “there wildlings coming” jon told clydas ran blade leg breeches slicing heavy black cloth crusty old blood sodden new “from south climbed wall…”

 maester aemon gave jon’s crude bandage sniff clydas cut away “we”

 “i qhorin halfhand commanded join them” jon winced maester’s finger explored wound poking prodding “the magnar thenn—aaaaah hurts” clenched teeth “where old bear”

 “jon… grieves say lord commander mormont murdered craster’s keep hands sworn brothers”

 “bro… men” aemon’s words hurt hundred times worse fingers jon remembered old bear last he’d seen standing tent raven arm croaking corn mormont gone feared ever since he’d seen aftermath battle fist yet less blow “who turned him”

 jon bitten lip struggles could taste blood mingled thick chalky potion could retch back

 clydas brought basin warm water maester aemon washed pus blood wound gentle even lightest touch made jon want scream “the magnar’s men disciplined bronze armor” told talking helped keep mind leg

 catelyn


 heard green fork saw endless susurrus like growl great beast river boiling torrent half wide last year robb divided army vowed take frey bride price crossing needed lord walder bridge needs even catelyn’s heart full misgivings watched murky green waters swirl past way ford swim across could moon’s turn waters fall

 neared twins robb donned crown summoned catelyn edmure ride beside ser raynald westerling bore banner direwolf stark icewhite field

 gatehouse towers emerged rain like ghosts hazy grey apparitions grew solid closer rode frey stronghold one castle two mirror images wet stone standing opposite sides water linked great arched bridge center span rose water tower river running straight swift channels cut banks form moats made twin island rains turned moats shallow lakes

 across turbulent waters catelyn could see several thousand men encamped around eastern castle banners hanging like many drowned cats lances outside tents rain made impossible distinguish colors devices grey seemed though beneath skies whole world seemed grey

 “tread lightly robb” cautioned son “lord walder thin skin sharp tongue sons doubtless take father must let provoked”

 “i know freys mother know much wronged much need shall sweet septon”

 catelyn shifted seat uncomfortably “if offered refreshment arrive account refuse take offered eat drink see nothing offered ask bread cheese cup wine”

 “i’m wet hungry…”

 “robb listen eaten bread salt guest right laws hospitality protect beneath roof”

 robb looked amused afraid “i army protect mother don’t need trust bread salt pleases lord walder serve stewed crow smothered maggots i’ll eat ask second bowl”

 four freys rode western gatehouse wrapped heavy cloaks thick grey wool catelyn recognized ser ryman son late ser stevron lord walder’s firstborn father dead ryman heir twins face saw beneath hood fleshy broad stupid three likely sons lord walder’s great grandsons

 edmure confirmed much “edwyn eldest pale slender man constipated look wiry one beard black walder nasty bit business petyr bay lad unfortunate face petyr pimple brothers call year two older robb lord walder married ten woman thrice age gods hope roslin doesn’t take him”

 halted let hosts come robb’s banner drooped staff steady sound rainfall mingled rush swollen green fork right grey wind edged forward tail stiff watching slitted eyes dark gold freys halfdozen yards away catelyn heard growl deep rumble seemed almost one rush river robb looked startled “grey wind me”

 instead direwolf leapt forward snarling

 ser ryman’s palfrey shied whinny fear petyr pimple’s reared threw black walder kept mount hand reached hilt sword “no” robb shouting “grey wind here” catelyn spurred direwolf horses mud spattered hooves mare cut front grey wind wolf veered away seemed hear robb calling

 “is stark makes amends” black walder shouted naked steel hand “a poor greeting call set wolf upon us you’ve come”

 ser ryman dismounted help petyr pimple back feet lad muddy unhurt

 “i’ve come make apology wrong house see uncle wed” robb swung saddle “petyr take horse almost back stable”

 petyr looked father said “i ride behind one brothers”

 freys made sign obeisance “you come late” ser ryman declared

 “the rains delayed us” said robb “i sent bird”

 “i see woman”

 woman ser ryman meant jeyne westerling knew lady catelyn smiled apologetically “queen jeyne weary much travel sers doubt pleased visit times settled”

 “my grandfather displeased” though black walder sheathed sword tone friendlier “i’ve told much lady wished behold eyes”

 edwyn cleared throat “we chambers prepared water tower grace” told robb careful courtesy “as well lord tully lady stark lords bannermen also welcome shelter roof partake wedding feast”

 “and men” asked robb

 “my lord grandfather regrets cannot feed house large host sore pressed find fodder provender levies nonetheless men shall neglected cross set camp beside bring enough casks wine ale drink health lord edmure bride thrown three great feast tents far bank provide shelter rains”

 “your lord father kind men thank long wet ride”

 edmure tully edged horse forward “when shall meet betrothed”

 “she waits within” promised edwyn frey “you forgive seems shy know awaiting day anxiously poor maid perhaps might continue rain”

 “truly” ser ryman mounted pulling petyr pimple behind “if would follow father awaits” turned palfrey’s head back toward twins

 edmure fell beside catelyn “the late lord frey might seen fit welcome us person” complained “i liege lord well sontobe robb’s king”

 “when oneandninety brother see eager go riding rain” yet wondered whole truth lord walder normally went covered litter would kept worst rain deliberate slight might first many yet come

 trouble gatehouse grey wind balked middle drawbridge shook rain howled portcullis robb whistled impatiently “grey wind grey wind me” direwolf bared teeth like place catelyn thought robb squat speak softly wolf would consent pass beneath portcullis lame lothar walder rivers come “it’s sound water fears” rivers said “beasts know avoid river flood”

 “a dry kennel leg mutton see right again” said lothar cheerfully “shall summon master hounds”

 “he’s direwolf dog” said robb “and dangerous men trust ser raynald stay won’t take lord walder’s hall like this”

 deftly done catelyn decided robb keeps westerling lord walder’s sight well

 gout brittle bones taken toll old walder frey found propped high seat cushion beneath ermine robe across lap chair black oak back carved semblance two stout towers joined arched bridge massive embrace turned old man grotesque child something vulture lord walder rather weasel bald head spotted age thrust scrawny shoulders long pink neck loose skin dangled beneath receding chin eyes runny clouded toothless mouth moved constantly sucking empty air babe sucks mother’s breast

 eighth lady frey stood beside lord walder’s high seat feet sat somewhat younger version stooped thin man fifty whose costly garb blue wool grey satin strangely accented crown collar ornamented tiny brass bells likeness lord striking save eyes lord frey’s small dim suspicious other’s large amiable vacant catelyn recalled one lord walder’s brood fathered halfwit long years ago past visits lord crossing always taken care hide one away always wear fool’s crown meant mockery robb question dare ask

 frey sons daughters children grandchildren husbands wives servants crowded rest hall old man spoke “you forgive kneel know legs longer work though hangs ’em serves well enough heh” mouth split toothless smile eyed robb’s crown “some would say it’s poor king crowns bronze grace”

 “bronze iron stronger gold silver” robb answered “the old kings winter wore swordcrown”

 “i left riverrun lord weary travel told ser ryman”

 “that makes grievous sad wanted behold mine weak eyes heh isn’t lady”

 pale wispy lady frey seemed startled would called upon speak “yyes lord wanted pay homage queen jeyne must fair look on”

 “she fair lady” icy stillness robb’s voice reminded catelyn father

 old man either hear refused pay heed “fairer get heh elsewise could face form made king’s grace forget solemn promise”

 robb suffered rebuke dignity “no words set right know come make apologies wrong house beg forgiveness lord”

 “apologies heh yes vowed make one recall i’m old don’t forget things like kings seems young remember nothing see pretty face nice firm pair teats isn’t might say still heh heh they’d wrong though wrong you’re make amends girls spurned though mayhaps it’s hear beg pardon grace maiden girls look them” waggled fingers flurry femininity left places walls line beneath dais jinglebell started rise well bells ringing merrily lady frey grabbed lackwit’s sleeve tugged back

 “it would impossible choice lord” said robb careful courtesy “they’re lovely”

 lord walder snorted “and say eyes bad well enough suppose others… well makes matter weren’t good enough king north heh say”

 “my ladies” robb looked desperately uncomfortable known moment must come faced without flinching “all men keep word kings pledged marry one broke vow fault done slight loved another words set right know yet come ask forgiveness freys crossing starks winterfell may friends”

 smaller girls fidgeted anxiously older sisters waited lord walder black oak throne jinglebell rocked back forth bells chiming collar crown

 “good” lord crossing said “that good grace ‘no words set right’ heh well said well said wedding feast hope refuse dance daughters would please old man’s heart heh” bobbed wrinkled pink head much way lackwit grandson though lord walder wore bells “and lord edmure daughter roslin precious little blossom heh”

 “my lord kind” lady roslin said edmure

 “my lady beautiful” edmure took hand drew feet “but crying”

 “for joy” roslin said “i weep joy lord”

 “they shan’t get lost” lord walder complained “they’ve crossed haven’t came north wanted crossing gave never said mayhaps heh suit lead man across hand like it’s naught me”

 “my lord” catelyn almost forgotten “some food would welcome ridden many leagues rain”

 walder frey’s mouth moved “food heh loaf bread bite cheese mayhaps sausage”

 “bread salt heh course course” old man clapped hands together servants came hall bearing flagons wine trays bread cheese butter lord walder took cup red raised high spotted hand “my guests” said “my honored guests welcome beneath roof table”

 “we thank hospitality lord” robb replied edmure echoed along greatjon ser marq piper others drank wine ate bread butter catelyn tasted wine nibbled bread felt much better safe thought

 “now we’re inside” edmure stood fire letting warmth wash “what make roslin”

 small delicate childbirth go hard brother seemed well pleased girl said “sweet”

 “i believe liked crying”

 “she’s maid eve wedding tears expected” lysa wept lakes morning wedding though managed dryeyed radiant jon arryn swept creamandblue cloak shoulders

 “she’s prettier dared hope” edmure raised hand could speak “i know important things spare sermon septa even so… see maids frey trotted one twitch shaking sickness twins craters eruptions faces petyr pimple saw lot knew roslin would bald oneeyed jinglebell’s wits black walder’s temper seems gentle well fair” looked perplexed “why would old weasel refuse let choose unless meant foist someone hideous”

 “your fondness pretty face well known” catelyn reminded “perhaps lord walder actually wants happy bride” like want balking boil upsetting plans “or may roslin old man’s favorite lord riverrun much better match daughters hope for”

 “true” brother still seemed uncertain however “is possible girl barren”

 “lord walder wants grandson inherit riverrun would serve give barren wife”

 “it rids daughter one else would take”

 “small good walder frey peevish man stupid one”

 “still… possible”

 “yes” catelyn conceded reluctantly “there illnesses girl childhood leave unable conceive there’s reason believe lady roslin afflicted though” looked round room “the freys received us kindly anticipated truth told”

 edmure laughed “a barbed words unseemly gloating that’s courtesy expected old weasel piss wine make us praise vintage”

 jest left catelyn strangely disquieted “if excuse change wet clothes”

 “as wish” edmure yawned “i may nap hour”

 lord walder’s black oak throne empty entered hall sons drinking fire lame lothar rose clumsily saw “lady catelyn thought would resting may service”

 “are brothers” asked

 “brothers halfbrothers good brothers nephews raymund shared mother lord lucias vypren halfsister lythene’s husband ser damon son halfbrother ser hosteen believe know ser leslyn haigh sons ser harys ser donnel”

 “well met sers ser perwyn helped escort storm’s end back robb sent speak lord renly looking forward seeing again”

 “perwyn away” lame lothar said “i shall give regards know regret missed you”

 “surely return time lady roslin’s wedding”

 “he hoped to” said lame lothar “but rain… saw rivers ran lady”

 “i indeed” said catelyn “i wonder would good direct maester”

 “are unwell lady” asked ser hosteen powerful man square strong jaw

 “a woman’s complaint nothing concern ser”

 lothar ever gracious escorted hall steps across covered bridge another stair “you find maester brenett turret top lady”

 catelyn half expected maester would yet another son walder frey’s brenett look great fat man bald doublechinned none clean judge raven droppings stained sleeves robes yet seemed amiable enough told edmure’s concerns lady roslin’s fertility chuckled “your lord brother need fear lady catelyn she’s small i’ll grant narrow hips mother lady bethany gave lord walder child every year”

 “how many lived past infancy” asked bluntly

 “five” ticked fingers plump sausages “ser perwyn ser benfrey maester willamen took vows last year serves lord hunter vale olyvar squired son lady roslin youngest four boys one girl lord edmure sons knows with”

 “i sure please him” girl like fertile well fair face put edmure’s mind ease lord walder left brother cause complaint far could see

 catelyn return room leaving maester instead went robb found robin flint ser wendel manderly along greatjon son still called smalljon though threatened overtop father damp another man still wetter stood fire pale pink cloak trimmed white fur “lord bolton” said

 “lady catelyn” replied voice faint “it pleasure look even trying times”

 “you kind say so” catelyn could feel gloom room even greatjon seemed somber subdued looked grim faces said “what’s happened”

 “lannisters trident” said ser wendel unhappily “my brother taken again”

 “and lord bolton brought us word winterfell” robb added “ser rodrik good man die cley cerwyn leobald tallhart slain well”

 “cley cerwyn boy” said saddened “is true dead winterfell gone”

 bolton’s pale eyes met “the ironmen burned castle winter town people taken back dreadfort son ramsay”

 “your bastard accused grievous crimes” catelyn reminded sharply “of murder rape worse”

 “yes” roose bolton said “his blood tainted cannot denied yet good fighter cunning fearless ironmen cut ser rodrik leobald tallhart soon fell ramsay lead battle swears shall sheathe sword long single greyjoy remains north perhaps service might atone small measure whatever crimes bastard blood led commit” shrugged “or war done grace must weigh judge hope trueborn son lady walda”

 cold man catelyn realized first time

 “did ramsay mention theon greyjoy” robb demanded “was slain well flee”

 roose bolton removed ragged strip leather pouch belt “my son sent letter”

 ser wendel turned fat face away robin flint smalljon umber exchanged look greatjon snorted like bull “is that… skin” said robb

 “the skin little finger theon greyjoy’s left hand son cruel confess yet… little skin lives two young princes mother lady may offer this… small token revenge”

 part catelyn wanted clutch grisly trophy heart made resist “put away please”

 “flaying theon bring brothers back” robb said “i want head skin”

 “he balon greyjoy’s living son” lord bolton said softly forgotten “and rightful king iron islands captive king great value hostage”

 “hostage” word raised catelyn’s hackles hostages oft exchanged “lord bolton hope suggesting free man killed sons”

 “whoever wins seastone chair want theon greyjoy dead” bolton pointed “even chains better claim uncles hold say demand concessions ironborn price execution”

 robb considered reluctantly end nodded “yes well keep alive present hold secure dreadfort till we’ve retaken north”

 catelyn turned back roose bolton “ser wendel said something lannisters trident”

 “he lady blame delayed long leaving harrenhal aenys frey departed several days crossed trident ruby ford though without difficulty time came river torrent choice ferry men across small boats twothirds strength north side lannisters attacked still waiting cross norrey locke burley men chiefly ser wylis manderly white harbor knights rear guard wrong side trident powerless help ser wylis rallied men best could gregor clegane attacked heavy horse drove river many drowned cut fled rest taken captive”

 gregor clegane always ill news catelyn reflected would robb need march south deal mountain coming “is clegane across river then”

 “no” bolton’s voice soft certain “i left six hundred men ford spearmen rills mountains white knife hundred hornwood longbows freeriders hedge knights strong force stout cerwyn men stiffen ronnel stout ser kyle condon command ser kyle late lord cerwyn’s right hand i’m sure know lady lions swim better wolves long river runs high ser gregor cross”

 “the last thing need mountain backs start causeway” said robb “you well lord”

 “your grace kind suffered grievous losses green fork glover tallhart worse duskendale”

 “duskendale” robb made word curse “robett glover answer see promise you”

 “a folly” lord bolton agreed “but glover heedless learned deepwood motte fallen grief fear man”

 duskendale done cold battles still come worried catelyn “how many men brought son” asked roose bolton pointedly

 queer colorless eyes studied face moment answered “some five hundred horse three thousand foot lady dreadfort men chief karhold loyalty karstarks doubtful thought best keep close regret more”

 “it enough” said robb “you command rear guard lord bolton mean start neck soon uncle wedded bedded we’re going home”

 i’ll rid arya thought

 road running mostly northwest turned due west apple orchard field drowned corn beaten rain passed last apple trees crested rise castles river camps appeared hundreds horses thousands men milling three huge feast tents stood side side facing castle gates like three great canvas longhalls robb made camp well back walls higher drier ground green fork overflown bank even claimed carelessly placed tents

 arya


 feast tents behind squished wet clay torn grass light back gloom ahead loomed castle gatehouse could see torches moving walls flames dancing blowing wind light shone dully wet mail helms torches moving dark stone bridge joined twins column streaming west bank east

 “the castle’s closed” arya said suddenly sergeant said would wrong portcullis drawn upward even watched drawbridge already lowered span swollen moat afraid lord frey’s guardsmen would refuse let half heartbeat chewed lip anxious smile

 hound reined suddenly almost fell wayn “seven bloody buggering hells” arya heard curse left wheel began sink soft mud wayn tilted slowly “get down” clegane roared slamming heel hand shoulder knock sideways landed light way syrio taught bounced face full mud “why that” screamed hound leapt well tore seat front wayn reached swordbelt he’d hidden beneath

 arya looked around saw two huge feast tents three one middle collapsed moment understand seeing flames went licking fallen tent two collapsing heavy oiled cloth settling men beneath flight fire arrows streaked air second tent took fire third screams grew loud could hear words music dark shapes moved front flames steel armor shining orange afar

 battle arya knew it’s battle riders…

 tyrion


 supped alone often

 “the pease overcooked” wife ventured

 “no matter” said “so mutton”

 jest sansa took criticism “i sorry lord”

 “why cook sorry pease province sansa”

 “i… sorry lord husband displeased”

 “any displeasure i’m feeling naught pease joffrey sister displease lord father three hundred bloody dornishmen” settled prince oberyn lords cornerfort facing city far tyrells could put without evicting red keep entirely nearly far enough already brawl flea bottom potshop left one tyrell manatarms dead two lord gargalen’s scalded ugly confrontation yard mace tyrell’s wizened little mother called ellaria sand “the serpent’s whore” every time chanced see oberyn martell prince asked justice would served overcooked pease least tyrion’s troubles saw point burdening young wife sansa enough griefs

 “the pease suffice” told curtly “they green round one expect pease i’ll another serving please lady” beckoned podrick payne spooned many pease onto plate tyrion lost sight mutton stupid told eat she’ll sorry

 supper ended strained silence many suppers afterward pod removing cups platters sansa asked tyrion leave visit godswood

 “as wish” become accustomed wife’s nightly devotions prayed royal sept well often lit candles mother maid crone tyrion found piety excessive truth told place might want help gods well “i confess know little old gods” said trying pleasant “perhaps someday might enlighten could even accompany you”

 “no” sansa said “you… kind offer but… devotions lord priests songs candles trees silent prayer would bored”

 “no doubt you’re right” knows better thought “though sound rustling leaves might pleasant change septon droning seven aspects grace” tyrion waved “i won’t intrude dress warmly lady wind brisk there” tempted ask prayed sansa dutiful might actually tell didn’t think wanted know

 went back work left trying track golden dragons labyrinth littlefinger’s ledgers petyr baelish believed letting gold sit grow dusty certain tyrion tried make sense accounts head hurt well talk breeding dragons instead locking treasury ventures smelled worse weekold fish wouldn’t quick let joffrey fling antler men walls i’d known many bloody bastards taken loans crown would send bronn find heirs feared would prove fruitful trying squeeze silver silverfish

 summons lord father arrived first time tyrion could ever recall pleased see ser boros blount closed ledgers gratefully blew oil lamp tied cloak around shoulders waddled across castle tower hand wind brisk he’d warned sansa smell rain air perhaps lord tywin done go godswood fetch home got soaked

 went straight head entered hand’s solar find cersei ser kevan grand maester pycelle gathered lord tywin king joffrey almost bouncing cersei savoring smug little smile though lord tywin looked grim ever wonder could smile even wanted “what’s happened” tyrion asked

 father offered roll parchment someone flattened still wanted curl “roslin caught fine fat trout” message read “her brothers gave pair wolf pelts wedding” tyrion turned inspect broken seal wax silverygrey pressed twin towers house frey “does lord crossing imagine he’s poetic meant confound us” tyrion snorted “the trout would edmure tully pelts…”

 “he’s dead” joffrey sounded proud happy might thought he’d skinned robb stark

 first greyjoy stark tyrion thought child wife praying godswood even praying father’s gods bring brother victory keep mother safe doubt old gods paid heed prayer new ones would seem perhaps take comfort “kings falling like leaves autumn” said “it would seem little war winning itself”

 “wars win tyrion” cersei said poisonous sweetness “our lord father war”

 “nothing long enemies field” lord tywin warned

 “the river lords fools” queen argued “without northmen cannot hope stand combined power highgarden casterly rock dorne surely choose submission rather destruction”

 “most” agreed lord tywin “riverrun remains long walder frey holds edmure tully hostage blackfish dare mount threat jason mallister tytos blackwood fight honor’s sake freys keep mallisters penned seagard right inducement jonos bracken persuaded change allegiance attack blackwoods end bend knee yes mean offer generous terms castle yields us spared save one”

 “harrenhal” said tyrion knew sire

 “the realm best rid brave companions commanded ser gregor put castle sword”

 gregor clegane appeared lord father meant mine mountain every last nugget ore turning dornish justice brave companions would end heads spikes littlefinger would stroll harrenhal without much spot blood fine clothes wondered petyr baelish reached vale yet gods good ran storm sea sank gods ever especially good

 “they put sword” joffrey declared suddenly “the mallisters blackwoods brackens… they’re traitors want killed grandfather won’t generous terms” king turned grand maester pycelle “and want robb stark’s head write lord frey tell king commands i’m going served sansa wedding feast”

 “sire” ser kevan said shocked voice “the lady aunt marriage”

 “a jest” cersei smiled “joff mean it”

 “yes did” joffrey insisted “he traitor want stupid head i’m going make sansa kiss it”

 “no” tyrion’s voice hoarse “sansa longer torment understand monster”

 joffrey sneered “you’re monster uncle”

 “am i” tyrion cocked head “perhaps speak softly monsters dangerous beasts kings seem dying like flies”

 “i could tongue saying that” boy king said reddening “i’m king”

 cersei put protective hand son’s shoulder “let dwarf make threats likes joff want lord father uncle see is”

 lord tywin ignored joffrey addressed “aerys also felt need remind men king passing fond ripping tongues well could ask ser ilyn payne though you’ll get reply”

 “ser ilyn never dared provoke aerys way imp provokes joff” said cersei “you heard ‘monster’ said king’s grace threatened him…”

 “be quiet cersei joffrey enemies defy must serve steel fire go knees however must help back feet elsewise man ever bend knee man must say ‘i king’ true king aerys never understood i’ve war restore king’s peace king’s justice head need concern margaery tyrell’s maidenhead”

 joffrey sullen sulky look got cersei firmly shoulder perhaps throat boy surprised instead scuttling safely back rock joff drew defiantly said “you talk aerys grandfather scared him”

 oh hasn’t gotten interesting tyrion thought

 lord tywin studied grandchild silence gold flecks shining pale green eyes “joffrey apologize grandfather” said cersei

 wrenched free “why everyone knows it’s true father battles killed prince rhaegar took crown father hiding casterly rock” boy gave grandfather defiant look “a strong king acts boldly doesn’t talk”

 “thank wisdom grace” lord tywin said courtesy cold like freeze ears “ser kevan see king tired please see safely back bedchamber pycelle perhaps gentle potion help grace sleep restfully”

 “dreamwine lord”

 “i don’t want dreamwine” joffrey insisted

 lord tywin would paid heed mouse squeaking corner “dreamwine serve cersei tyrion remain”

 ser kevan took joffrey firmly arm marched door two kingsguard waiting grand maester pycelle scurried fast shaky old legs could take tyrion remained

 “father sorry” cersei said door shut “joff always willful warn you…”

 “there long league’s worth difference willful stupid ‘a strong king acts boldly’ told that”

 “not promise you” said cersei “most like something heard robert say…”

 “the part hiding casterly rock sound like robert” tyrion didn’t want lord tywin forgetting bit

 “yes recall now” cersei said “robert often told joff king must bold”

 “and telling pray fight war seat robert second iron throne gave understand boy cared nothing father”

 “why would robert ignored would beat i’d allowed brute made marry hit boy hard knocked two baby teeth mischief cat told i’d kill sleep ever never sometimes would say things…”

 “it appears things needed said” lord tywin waved two fingers brusque dismissal “go”

 went seething

 “not robert second” tyrion said “aerys third”

 “the boy thirteen time yet” lord tywin paced window unlike upset wished show “he requires sharp lesson”

 tyrion gotten sharp lesson thirteen felt almost sorry nephew hand one deserved “enough joffrey” said “wars quills ravens wasn’t said must congratulate long walder frey plotting this”

 “i mislike word” lord tywin said stiffly

 “and mislike left dark”

 “there reason tell part this”

 “was cersei told” tyrion demanded know

 “no one told save part play told much needed know ought know way keep secret—here especially object rid us dangerous enemy cheaply could indulge curiosity make sister feel important” closed shutters frowning “you certain cunning tyrion plain truth talk much loose tongue undoing”

 “you let joff tear out” suggested tyrion

 “you would well tempt me” lord tywin said “i’ll hear considering best appease oberyn martell entourage”

 “oh something i’m allowed know leave discuss yourself”

 father ignored sally “prince oberyn’s presence unfortunate brother cautious man reasoned man subtle deliberate even indolent degree man weighs consequences every word every action oberyn always halfmad”

 “is true tried raise dorne viserys”

 “no one speaks yes ravens flew riders rode secret messages never knew jon arryn sailed sunspear return prince lewyn’s bones sat prince doran ended talk war robert never went dorne thereafter prince oberyn seldom left it”

 “well he’s half nobility dorne tail grows impatient every day” said tyrion “perhaps show brothels king’s landing might distract tool every task isn’t works tool father never let said house lannister blew trumpets respond”

 lord tywin’s mouth tightened “very droll shall sew suit motley little hat bells it”

 “if wear leave say anything want grace king joffrey”

 lord tywin seated said “i made suffer father’s follies suffer enough”

 “very well ask pleasantly red viper going pleasant fear… content ser gregor’s head alone”

 “all reason give him”

 “not to…” tyrion shocked “i thought agreed woods full beasts”

 “lesser beasts” lord tywin’s fingers laced together chin “ser gregor served us well knight realm inspires terror enemies”

 “oberyn knows gregor one who…”

 “he knows nothing heard tales stable gossip kitchen calumnies crumb proof ser gregor certainly confess mean keep well away long dornishmen king’s landing”

 “and oberyn demands justice he’s come for”

 “i tell ser amory lorch killed elia children” lord tywin said calmly “so asks”

 “ser amory lorch dead” tyrion said flatly

 “precisely vargo hoat ser amory torn apart bear fall harrenhal ought sufficiently grisly appease even oberyn martell”

 “you may call justice…”

 “it justice ser amory brought girl’s body must know found hiding father’s bed believed rhaegar could still protect princess elia babe nursery floor below”

 “well it’s tale ser amory’s like deny tell oberyn asks gave lorch orders”

 “ser amory acted hope winning favor new king robert’s hatred rhaegar scarcely secret”

 might serve tyrion concede snake happy “far question cunning father place believe i’d let robert baratheon bloody hands”

 lord tywin stared lost wits “you deserve motley come late robert’s cause necessary demonstrate loyalty laid bodies throne man could doubt forsaken house targaryen forever robert’s relief palpable stupid even knew rhaegar’s children die throne ever secure yet saw hero heroes kill children” father shrugged “i grant done brutally elia need harmed sheer folly nothing”

 “then mountain kill her”

 “because tell spare doubt mentioned pressing concerns ned stark’s van rushing south trident feared might come swords us aerys murder jaime cause spite thing feared jaime might do” closed fist “nor yet grasp gregor clegane huge terrible battle rape… even accuse giving command would hope ser amory almost bestial rhaenys asked afterward required half hundred thrusts kill girl of… two three said she’d kicked would stop screaming lorch half wits gods gave turnip would calmed sweet words used soft silk pillow” mouth twisted distaste “the blood him”

 father blood tywin lannister “was soft silk pillow slew robb stark”

 “it arrow edmure tully’s wedding feast boy wary field kept men good order surrounded outriders bodyguards”

 “so lord walder slew roof table” tyrion made fist “what lady catelyn”

 “slain well i’d say pair wolfskins frey intended keep captive perhaps something went awry”

 “so much guest right”

 “the blood walder frey’s hands mine”

 “walder frey peevish old man lives fondle young wife brood slights he’s suffered doubt hatched ugly chicken would never dared thing without promise protection”

 “i suppose would spared boy told lord frey need allegiance would driven old fool right back stark’s arms another year war explain noble kill ten thousand men battle dozen dinner” tyrion reply father continued “the price cheap measure crown shall grant riverrun ser emmon frey blackfish yields lancel daven must marry frey girls joy wed one lord walder’s natural sons she’s old enough roose bolton becomes warden north takes home arya stark”

 “arya stark” tyrion cocked head “and bolton might known frey would stomach act alone arya… varys ser jacelyn searched half year arya stark surely dead”

 “so renly blackwater”

 “what mean”

 “perhaps littlefinger succeeded varys failed lord bolton wed girl bastard son shall allow dreadfort fight ironborn years see bring stark’s bannermen heel come spring end strength ready bend knee north go son sansa stark… ever find enough manhood breed one lest forget joffrey must needs take maidenhead”

 forgotten though i’d hoped “and imagine sansa fertile” tyrion asked father tones dripped acid “before tell murdered mother brother”





 davos


 moment seemed though king heard stannis showed pleasure news anger disbelief even relief stared painted table teeth clenched hard “you certain” asked

 “i seeing body kingliness” said salladhor saan “yet city lions prance dance red wedding smallfolk calling swear lord frey boy’s head hacked sewed head direwolf place nailed crown ears lady mother slain well thrown naked river”

 wedding thought davos sat slayer’s board guest beneath roof freys cursed could smell burning blood hear leech hissing spitting brazier’s hot coals

 “it lord’s wrath slew him” ser axell florent declared “it hand r’hllor”

 “praise lord light” sang queen selyse pinched thin hard woman large ears hairy upper lip

 “is hand r’hllor spotted palsied” asked stannis “this sounds walder frey’s handiwork god’s”

 “r’hllor chooses instruments requires” ruby melisandre’s throat shone redly “his ways mysterious man may withstand fiery will”

 “no man may withstand him” queen cried

 “be quiet woman nightfire now” stannis considered painted table “the wolf leaves heirs kraken many lions devour unless… saan require fastest ships carry envoys iron islands white harbor shall offer pardons” way snapped teeth showed little liked word “full pardons repent treason swear fealty rightful king must see…”

 “they not” melisandre’s voice soft “i sorry grace end false kings soon rise take crowns who’ve died”

 “more” stannis looked though would gladly throttled “more usurpers traitors”

 “i seen flames”

 queen selyse went king’s side “the lord light sent melisandre guide glory heed beg r’hllor’s holy flames lie”

 “there lies lies woman even flames speak truly full tricks seems me”

 “an ant hears words king may comprehend saying” melisandre said “and men ants fiery face god sometimes mistaken warning prophecy prophecy warning fault lies reader book know certainty—envoys pardons serve leeches must show realm sign sign proves power”

 “power” king snorted “i thirteen hundred men dragonstone another three hundred storm’s end” hand swept painted table “the rest westeros hands foes fleet salladhor saan’s coin hire sellswords prospect plunder glory lure freeriders cause”

 “lord husband” said queen selyse “you men aegon three hundred years ago lack dragons”

 look stannis gave dark “nine mages crossed sea hatch aegon third’s cache eggs baelor blessed prayed half year aegon fourth built dragons wood iron aerion brightflame drank wildfire transform mages failed king baelor’s prayers went unanswered wooden dragons burned prince aerion died screaming”

 queen selyse adamant “none chosen r’hllor red comet blazed across heavens herald coming none wielded lightbringer red sword heroes none paid price lady melisandre tell lord death pay life”

 “the boy” king almost spat words

 “the boy” agreed queen

 “the boy” ser axell echoed

 “i sick unto death wretched boy even born” king complained “his name roaring ears dark cloud upon soul”

 “give boy need never hear name spoken again” melisandre promised

 you’ll hear screaming burns davos held tongue wiser speak king commanded

 “give boy r’hllor” red woman said “and ancient prophecy shall fulfilled dragon shall awaken spread stony wings kingdom shall yours”

 ser axell went one knee “on bended knee beg sire wake stone dragon let traitors tremble like aegon begin lord dragonstone like aegon shall conquer let false fickle feel flames”

 “your wife begs well lord husband” queen selyse went knees king hands clasped prayer “robert delena defiled bed laid curse upon union boy foul fruit fomications lift shadow womb bear many trueborn sons know it” threw arms around legs “he one boy born brother’s lust cousin’s shame”

 “he mine blood stop clutching woman” king stannis put hand shoulder awkwardly untangling grasp “perhaps robert curse marriage bed swore never meant shame drunk never knew bedchamber entered night matter boy fault whatever truth”

 melisandre put hand king’s arm “the lord light cherishes innocent sacrifice precious king’s blood untainted fire dragon shall born”

 stannis pull away melisandre’s touch queen’s red woman selyse young fullbodied strangely beautiful heartshaped face coppery hair unearthly red eyes “it would wondrous thing see stone come life” admitted grudging “and mount dragon… remember first time father took court robert hold hand could older four would made five six agreed afterward king noble dragons fearsome” stannis snorted “years later father told us aerys cut throne morning hand taken place tywin lannister who’d impressed us” fingers touched surface table tracing path lightly across varnished hills “robert took skulls donned crown could bear destroyed dragon wings westeros… would a…”

 “your grace” davos edged forward “might speak”

 stannis closed mouth hard teeth snapped “my lord rainwood think made hand speak” king waved hand “say will”

 warrior make brave “i know little dragons less gods… queen spoke curses man cursed kinslayer eyes gods men”

 “there gods save r’hllor whose name must spoken” melisandre’s mouth made hard red line “and small men curse cannot understand”

 “i small man” davos admitted “so tell need boy edric storm wake great stone dragon lady” determined say boy’s name often could

 “only death pay life lord great gift requires great sacrifice”

 “where greatness baseborn child”

 “he kings’ blood veins seen even little blood could do—”

 “i saw burn leeches”

 “and two false kings dead”

 “robb stark murdered lord walder crossing heard balon greyjoy fell bridge leeches kill”

 “do doubt power r’hllor”

 davos remembered well living shadow squirmed womb night beneath storm’s end black hands pressing thighs must go carefully shadow may come seeking well “even onion smuggler knows two onions three short king lady”

 stannis gave snort laughter “he lady two three”

 “to sure grace one king might die chance even two… three joffrey die midst power surrounded armies kingsguard would show power lord work”

 “it might” king spoke grudged word

 “or not” davos best hide fear

 “joffrey shall die” queen selyse declared serene confidence

 “it may dead already” ser axell added

 stannis looked annoyance “are trained crows croak turns enough”

 “husband hear me—” queen entreated

 “why two three kings count well smugglers may go” stannis turned back

 melisandre helped queen feet selyse swept stiffly chamber red woman trailing behind ser axell lingered long enough give davos one last look ugly look ugly face thought met stare

 others gone davos cleared throat king looked “why still here”

 “sire edric storm…”

 stannis made sharp gesture “spare me”

 davos persisted “your daughter takes lessons plays every day aegon’s garden”

 “i know that”

 “her heart would break anything ill should—”

 “i know well”

 “if would see him—”

 “i seen looks like robert aye worships shall tell often beloved father ever gave thought brother liked making children well enough birth bother”

 “he asks every day he—”

 “you making angry davos hear bastard boy”

 “his name edric storm sire”

 “i know name ever name apt proclaims bastardy high birth turmoil brings edric storm said satisfied lord hand”

 “edric—” started

 “—is one boy may best boy ever drew breath would matter duty realm” hand swept across painted table “how many boys dwell westeros many girls many men many women darkness devour says night never ends talks prophecies… hero reborn sea living dragons hatched dead stone… speaks signs swears point never asked asked king yet dare disregard her” ground teeth “we choose destinies yet must… must duty great small must duty melisandre swears seen flames facing dark lightbringer raised high lightbringer” stannis gave derisive snort “it glimmers prettily i’ll grant blackwater magic sword served better common steel dragon would turned battle aegon stood looking table think would name aegon conqueror today dragons”

 “your grace” said davos “the cost…”

 “i know cost last night gazing hearth saw things flames well saw king crown fire brows burning… burning davos crown consumed flesh turned ash think need melisandre tell means you” king moved shadow fell upon king’s landing “if joffrey die… life one bastard boy kingdom”

 “everything” said davos softly

 stannis looked jaw clenched “go” king said last “before talk back dungeon”

 sometimes storm winds blow strong man choice furl sails “aye grace” davos bowed stannis seemingly forgotten already

 chilly yard left stone drum wind blew briskly cast making banners snap flap noisily along walls davos could smell salt air sea loved smell made want walk deck raise canvas sail south marya two small ones thought every day even night part wanted nothing much take devan go home cannot yet lord king’s hand must fail

 raised eyes gaze walls place merlons thousand grotesques gargoyles looked different others wyvems griffins demons manticores minotaurs basilisks hellhounds cockatrices thousand queerer creatures sprouted castle’s battlements they’d grown dragons everywhere great hall dragon lying belly men entered open mouth kitchens dragon curled ball smoke steam ovens vented nostrils towers dragons hunched walls poised flight windwyrm seemed scream defiance sea dragon tower gazed serenely across waves smaller dragons framed gates dragon claws emerged walls grasp torches great stone wings enfolded smith armory tails formed arches bridges exterior stairs

 davos often heard said wizards valyria cut chisel common masons worked stone fire magic potter might work clay wondered real dragons somehow turned stone

 “if red woman brings life castle come crashing thinking kind dragons full rooms stairs furniture windows chimneys privy shafts”

 lyseni laughed “a crew tongues even better big strong mutes cannot read write” grew somber “but glad know someone watches back old friend king give boy red priestess think one little dragon could end great big war”

 old habit made reach luck fingerbones longer hung neck found nothing “he it” said davos “he could harm blood”

 “lord renly glad hear this”

 “renly traitor arms edric storm innocent crime grace man”

 salla shrugged “we shall seeing shall returning sea even rascally smugglers may sailing across blackwater bay hoping avoid paying lord’s lawful duties” slapped davos back “take care mute friends grown great yet higher man climbs farther fall”

 davos reflected words climbed steps sea dragon tower maester’s chambers rookery need salla tell risen high cannot read cannot write lords despise know nothing ruling king’s hand belong deck ship castle tower

 jon used crutch limp across tower top king’s tower castle’s tallest—the high slim crumbling lance held honor though othell yarwyck heard say might topple day king’s tower strongest—the tower guards beside kingsroad would tougher nut crack tall enough strong enough well placed beside wall overlooking gate foot wooden stair

 first time seen castle black eyes jon wondered anyone would foolish build castle without walls could defended

 wasn’t really climbing way used climb walking steps night’s watch hewn hundreds thousands years ago remembered maester luwin saying nightfort castle steps cut ice wall maybe uncle benjen newer castles wooden steps stone ones long ramps earth gravel ice treacherous uncle who’d told said outer surface wall wept icy tears sometimes though core inside stayed frozen hard rock steps must melted refrozen thousand times since last black brothers left castle every time shrunk little got smoother rounder treacherous

 smaller it’s almost like wall swallowing back meera reed surefooted even going slowly moving nub nub two places steps hardly got fours worse comes bran thought watching even wished reached top crawling icy knobs remained highest steps meera vanished sight

 “when come down” bran asked jojen

 “when ready want good look… wall what’s beyond here”

 “hodor” said hodor doubtfully

 “we might find something” jojen insisted

 something might find us bran couldn’t say though want jojen think craven

 went exploring jojen reed leading bran basket hodor’s back summer padding side direwolf bolted dark door returned moment later grey rat teeth rat cook bran thought wrong color big cat rat cook white almost huge sow…

 lot dark doors nightfort lot rats bran could hear scurrying vaults cellars maze pitchblack tunnels connected jojen wanted go poking around hodor said “hodor” bran said “no” worse things rats dark beneath nightfort

 “this seems old place” jojen said walked gallery sunlight fell dusty shafts empty windows

 “twice old castle black” bran said remembering “it first castle wall largest” also first abandoned way back time old king even threequarters empty costly maintain good queen alysanne suggested watch replace smaller newer castle spot seven miles east wall curved along shore beautiful green lake deep lake paid queen’s jewels built men old king sent north black brothers abandoned nightfort rats

 two centuries past though deep lake stood empty castle replaced nightfort…

 “there ghosts here” bran said hodor heard stories jojen might “old ghosts old king even aegon dragon seventynine deserters went south outlaws one lord ryswell’s youngest son reached barrowlands sought shelter castle lord ryswell took captive returned nightfort lord commander holes hewn top wall put deserters sealed alive ice spears horns face north seventynine sentinels they’re called left posts life death watch goes forever years later lord ryswell old dying carried nightfort could take black stand beside son he’d sent back wall honor’s sake loved still came share watch”

 spent half day poking castle towers fallen others looked unsafe climbed bell tower bells gone rookery birds gone beneath brewhouse found vault huge oaken casks boomed hollowly hodor knocked found library shelves bins collapsed books gone rats everywhere found dank dimlit dungeon cells enough hold five hundred captives bran grabbed hold one rusted bars broke hand one crumbling wall remained great hall bathhouse seemed sinking ground huge thornbush conquered practice yard outside armory black brothers labored spear shield sword armory forge still stood however though cobwebs rats dust taken places blades bellows anvil sometimes summer would hear sounds bran seemed deaf bare teeth nothing fur back neck bristling… rat cook never put appearance seventynine sentinels mad axe bran much relieved maybe ruined empty castle

 time meera returned sun sword’s breath western hills “what see” brother jojen asked

 “i saw haunted forest” said wistful tone “hills rising wild far eye see covered trees axe ever touched saw sunlight glinting lake clouds sweeping west saw patches old snow icicles long pikes even saw eagle circling think saw waved him”

 “did see way down” asked jojen

 shook head “no it’s sheer drop ice smooth… might able make descent good rope axe chop handholds but…”

 “…but us” jojen finished

 “no” sister agreed “are sure place saw dream maybe wrong castle”

 “no castle gate here”

 yes thought bran it’s blocked stone ice

 sun began set shadows towers lengthened wind blew harder sending gusts dry dead leaves rattling yards gathering gloom put bran mind another old nan’s stories tale night’s king thirteenth man lead night’s watch said warrior knew fear “and fault him” would add “for men must know fear” woman downfall woman glimpsed atop wall skin white moon eyes like blue stars fearing nothing chased caught loved though skin cold ice gave seed gave soul well

 brought back nightfort proclaimed queen king strange sorceries bound sworn brothers thirteen years ruled night’s king corpse queen till finally stark winterfell joramun wildlings joined free watch bondage fall found sacrificing others records night’s king destroyed name forbidden

 “some say bolton” old nan would always end “some say magnar skagos say umber flint norrey would think woodfoot ruled bear island ironmen came never stark brother man brought down” always pinched bran nose would never forget “he stark winterfell say mayhaps name brandon mayhaps slept bed room”

 bran thought walked castle we’ll sleep tonight like notion much night’s king man light day old nan would always say night rule it’s getting dark

 reeds decided would sleep kitchens stone octagon broken dome looked offer better shelter buildings even though crooked weirwood burst slate floor beside huge central well stretching slantwise toward hole roof bonewhite branches reaching sun queer kind tree skinnier weirwood bran ever seen faceless well made feel old gods least

 thing liked kitchens though roof mostly they’d dry rained didn’t think would ever get warm could feel cold seeping slate floor bran like shadows either huge brick ovens surrounded like open mouths rusted meat hooks scars stains saw butcher’s block along one wall rat cook chopped prince pieces knew baked pie one ovens

 well thing liked least though good twelve feet across stone steps built side circling darkness walls damp covered niter none could see water bottom even meera sharp hunter’s eyes “maybe doesn’t bottom” bran said uncertainly

 hodor peered kneehigh lip well said “hodor” word echoed well “hodorhodorhodorhodor” fainter fainter “hodorhodorhodorhodor” less whisper hodor looked startled laughed bent scoop broken piece slate floor

 “hodor don’t” said bran late hodor tossed slate edge “you shouldn’t done don’t know what’s might hurt something or… woken something up”

 hodor looked innocently “hodor”

 far far far heard sound stone found water wasn’t splash truly gulp whatever opened quivering gelid mouth swallow hodor’s stone faint echoes traveled well moment bran thought heard something moving thrashing water “maybe shouldn’t stay here” said uneasily

 “by well” asked meera “or nightfort”

 “yes” said bran

 laughed sent hodor gather wood summer went almost dark direwolf wanted hunt

 hodor returned alone arms full deadwood broken branches jojen reed took flint knife set lighting fire meera boned fish she’d caught last stream they’d crossed bran wondered many years passed since last supper cooked kitchens nightfort wondered cooked though maybe better know

 flames blazing nicely meera put fish least it’s meat pie rat cook cooked son andal king big pie onions carrots mushrooms lots pepper salt rasher bacon dark red dornish wine served father praised taste second slice afterward gods transformed cook monstrous white rat could eat young roamed nightfort ever since devouring children still hunger sated “it murder gods cursed him” old nan said “nor serving andal king son pie man right vengeance slew guest beneath roof gods cannot forgive”

 “we sleep” jojen said solemnly full fire burning low stirred stick “perhaps i’ll another green dream show us way”

 hodor already curled snoring lightly time time thrashed beneath cloak whimpered something might “hodor” bran wriggled closer fire warmth felt good soft crackling flames soothed sleep would come outside wind sending armies dead leaves marching across courtyards scratch faintly doors windows sounds made think old nan’s stories could almost hear ghostly sentinels calling atop wall winding ghostly warhorns pale moonlight slanted hole dome painting branches weirwood strained toward roof looked tree trying catch moon drag well old gods bran prayed hear don’t send dream tonight make good dream gods made answer

 bran made close eyes maybe even slept maybe drowsing floating way half awake half asleep trying think mad axe rat cook thing came night

 heard noise

 eyes opened held breath dream stupid nightmare didn’t want wake meera jojen bad dream but… there… soft scuffling sound far off… leaves it’s leaves rattling walls outside rustling together… wind could wind… sound wasn’t coming outside though bran felt hairs arm start rise sound’s inside it’s us it’s getting louder pushed onto elbow listening wind blowing leaves well something else footsteps someone coming way something coming way

 wasn’t sentinels knew sentinels never left wall might ghosts nightfort ones even terrible remembered old nan said mad axe took boots prowled castle halls barefoot dark never sound tell except drops blood fell axe elbows end wet red beard maybe wasn’t mad axe maybe thing came night ’prentice boys saw old nan said afterward told lord commander every description different three died within year fourth went mad hundred years later thing come ’prentice boys seen shambling along behind chains

 story though scaring thing comes night maester luwin said ever thing gone world like giants dragons it’s nothing bran thought

 sounds louder

 it’s coming well realized made even afraid something coming ground coming dark hodor woke woke stupid piece slate it’s coming hard hear hodor’s snores thumping heart sound blood made dripping axe faint faroff rattling ghostly chains bran listened harder footsteps definitely footsteps one little louder one couldn’t tell many though well made sounds echo didn’t hear dripping chains either something else… high thin whimpering sound like someone pain heavy muffled breathing footsteps loudest footsteps coming closer

 bran frightened shout fire burned faint embers friends asleep almost slipped skin reached wolf summer might miles away couldn’t leave friends helpless dark face whatever coming well told come thought miserably told ghosts told go castle black

 footfalls sounded heavy bran slow ponderous scraping stone must huge mad axe big man old nan’s story thing came night monstrous back winterfell sansa told demons dark couldn’t touch hid beneath blanket almost remembered prince almost man grown

 bran wriggled across floor dragging dead legs behind could reach touch meera foot woke never known anyone wake quick meera reed alert fast bran pressed finger mouth she’d know speak heard sound could see face echoing footfalls faint whimpering heavy breathing

 meera rose feet without word reclaimed weapons threepronged frog spear right hand folds net dangling left slipped barefoot toward well jojen dozed oblivious hodor muttered thrashed restless sleep kept shadows moved stepped around shaft moonlight quiet cat bran watching even could barely see faint sheen spear can’t let fight thing alone thought summer far away but…

 …he slipped skin reached hodor

 like sliding summer easy bran hardly thought harder like trying pull left boot right foot fit wrong boot scared boot didn’t know happening boot pushing foot away tasted vomit back hodor’s throat almost enough make flee instead squirmed shoved sat gathered legs him—his huge strong legs—and rose i’m standing took step i’m walking strange feeling almost fell could see cold stone floor little broken thing wasn’t broken grabbed hodor’s longsword breathing loud blacksmith’s bellows

 well came wail piercing creech went like knife huge black shape heaved darkness lurched toward moonlight fear rose bran thick could even think drawing hodor’s sword way he’d meant found back floor hodor roaring “hodor hodor hodor” way lake tower whenever lightning flashed thing came night screaming thrashing wildly folds meera’s net bran saw spear dart darkness snap thing staggered fell struggling net wailing still coming well even louder floor black thing flopped fought screeching “no don’t please don’t…”

 meera stood moonlight shining silver prongs frog spear “who you” demanded

 “i’m sam” black thing sobbed “sam sam i’m sam let stabbed me…” rolled puddle moonlight flailing flopping tangles meera’s net hodor still shouting “hodor hodor hodor”

 jojen fed sticks fire blew flames leapt crackling light bran saw pale thinfaced girl lip well bundled furs skins beneath enormous black cloak trying shush screaming baby arms thing floor pushing arm net reach knife loops wouldn’t let wasn’t monster beast even mad axe drenched gore big fat man dressed black wool black fur black leather black mail “he’s black brother” said bran “meera he’s night’s watch”

 “hodor” hodor squatted haunches peer man net “hodor” said hooting

 “the night’s watch yes” fat man still breathing like bellows “i’m brother watch” one cord chins forcing head others digging deep cheeks “i’m crow please let this”

 bran suddenly uncertain “are threeeyed crow” can’t threeeyed crow

 “i don’t think so” fat man rolled eyes two “i’m sam samwell tarly let it’s hurting me” began struggle

 meera made disgusted sound “stop flopping around tear net i’ll throw back well lie still i’ll untangle you”

 “who you” jojen asked girl baby

 “gilly” said “for gillyflower he’s sam never meant scare you” rocked baby murmured finally stopped crying

 meera untangling fat brother jojen went well peered “where come from”

 “from craster’s” girl said “are one”

 jojen turned look “the one”

 “he said sam wasn’t one” explained “there someone else said one sent find”

 “who said” bran demanded

 “coldhands” gilly answered softly

 meera peeled back one end net fat man managed sit shaking bran saw still struggling catch breath “he said would people” huffed “people castle didn’t know you’d right top steps though didn’t know you’d throw net stab stomach” touched belly blackgloved hand “am bleeding can’t see”

 “it poke get feet” said meera “here let look” went one knee felt around navel “you’re wearing mail never got near skin”

 “well hurt same” sam complained

 “are really brother night’s watch” bran asked

 fat man’s chins jiggled nodded skin looked pale saggy “only steward took care lord mormont’s ravens” moment looked like going cry “i lost fist though fault got us lost couldn’t even find wall it’s hundred leagues long seven hundred feet high couldn’t find it”

 “well you’ve found now” said meera “lift rump ground want net back”

 “how get wall” jojen demanded sam struggled feet “does well lead underground river came you’re even wet…”

 “there’s gate” said fat sam “a hidden gate old wall black gate called it”

 reeds exchanged look “we’ll find gate bottom well” asked jojen

 sam shook head “you won’t take you”

 “why” meera demanded “if there’s gate…”

 “you won’t find wouldn’t open it’s black gate” sam plucked faded black wool sleeve “only man night’s watch open said sworn brother said words”

 “he said” jojen frowned “this… coldhands”

 “that wasn’t true name” said gilly rocking “we called sam hands cold ice saved us dead men ravens brought us elk”

 “his elk” said bran wonderstruck

 “his elk” said meera startled

 “his ravens” said jojen

 “hodor” said hodor

 “was green” bran wanted know “did antlers”

 fat man confused “the elk”

 “coldhands” said bran impatiently “the green men ride elks old nan used say sometimes antlers too”

 “he wasn’t green man wore blacks like brother watch pale wight hands cold first afraid wights blue eyes though don’t tongues they’ve forgotten use them” fat man turned jojen “he’ll waiting go anything warmer wear black gate cold side wall even colder you—”

 “why didn’t come you” meera gestured toward gilly babe “they came didn’t bring black gate too”

 “he… can’t”

 “why not”

 “the wall wall ice stone said spells woven it… old ones strong cannot pass beyond wall”

 grew quiet castle kitchen bran could hear soft crackle flames wind stirring leaves night creak skinny weirwood reaching moon beyond gates monsters live giants ghouls remembered old nan saying cannot pass long wall stands strong go sleep little brandon baby boy needn’t fear monsters

 “i one told bring” jojen reed told fat sam stained baggy blacks “he is”

 “oh” sam looked uncertainly might realized bran crippled “i don’t… i’m strong enough carry i…”

 “hodor carry me” bran pointed basket “i ride back”

 sam staring “you’re jon snow’s brother one fell…”

 “no” said jojen “that boy dead”

 “don’t tell” bran warned “please”

 sam looked confused moment finally said “i… keep secret gilly too” looked girl nodded “jon… jon brother best friend ever went qhorin halfhand scout frostfangs never came back waiting fist when… when…”

 “jon’s here” bran said “summer saw wildlings killed man jon took horse escaped bet went castle black”

 sam turned big eyes meera “you’re certain jon saw him”

 “i’m meera” meera said smile “summer is…”

 shadow detached broken dome leapt moonlight even injured leg wolf landed light quiet snowfall girl gilly made frightened sound clutched babe hard began cry

 “he won’t hurt you” bran said “that’s summer”

 “jon said wolves” sam pulled glove “i know ghost” held shaky hand fingers white soft fat little sausages summer padded closer sniffed gave hand lick

 bran made mind “we’ll go you”

 “all you” sam seemed surprised

 meera ruffled bran’s hair “he’s prince”

 summer circled well sniffing paused top step looked back bran wants go

 “will gilly safe leave till come back” sam asked

 “she be” said meera “she’s welcome fire”

 jojen said “the castle empty”

 gilly looked around “craster used tell us tales castles never knew they’d big”

 it’s kitchens bran wondered she’d think saw winterfell ever

 took minutes gather things hoist bran wicker seat hodor’s back time ready go gilly sat nursing babe fire “you’ll come back me” said sam

 “as soon can” promised “then we’ll go somewhere warm” heard part bran wondered ever go someplace warm

 “i’ll go first know way” sam hesitated top “there’s many steps” sighed started jojen followed summer hodor bran riding back meera took rear spear net hand

 long way top well bathed moonlight grew smaller dimmer every time went around footsteps echoed damp stones water sounds grew louder “should brought torches” jojen asked

 “your eyes adjust” said sam “keep one hand wall won’t fall”

 well grew darker colder every turn bran finally lifted head around look back shaft top well bigger halfmoon “hodor” hodor whispered “hodorhodorhodorhodorhodorhodor” well whispered back water sounds close bran peered saw blackness

 turn two later sam stopped suddenly quarter way around well bran hodor six feet farther yet bran could barely see could see door though black gate sam called wasn’t black

 white weirwood face

 glow came wood like milk moonlight faint scarcely seemed touch anything beyond door even sam standing right face old pale wrinkled shrunken looks dead mouth closed eyes cheeks sunken brow withered chin sagging man could live thousand years never die grow older face might come look like

 door opened eyes

 white blind “who you” door asked well whispered “whowhowhowhowhowhowho”

 “i sword darkness” samwell tarly said “i watcher walls fire burns cold light brings dawn horn wakes sleepers shield guards realms men”

 “then pass” door said lips opened wide wider wider still nothing remained great gaping mouth ring wrinkles sam stepped aside waved jojen ahead summer followed sniffing went bran’s turn hodor ducked low enough door’s upper lip brushed softly top bran’s head drop water fell ran slowly nose strangely warm salty tear

 meereen large astapor yunkai combined like sister cities built brick astapor red yunkai yellow meereen made bricks many colors walls higher yunkai’s better repair studded bastions anchored great defensive towers every angle behind huge sky could seen top great pyramid monstrous thing eight hundred feet tall towering bronze harpy top

 “the harpy craven thing” daario naharis said saw “she woman’s heart chicken’s legs small wonder sons hide behind walls”

 hero hide rode city gates armored scales copper jet mounted upon white charger whose striped pinkandwhite barding matched silk cloak flowing hero’s shoulders lance bore fourteen feet long swirled pink white hair shaped teased lacquered two great curling ram’s horns back forth rode beneath walls multicolored bricks challenging besiegers send champion forth meet single combat

 bloodriders fever go meet almost came blows “blood blood” dany told “your place man buzzing fly ignore soon gone” aggo jhogo rakharo brave warriors young valuable risk kept khalasar together best scouts

 “that wisely done” ser jorah said watched front pavilion “let fool ride back forth shout horse goes lame us harm”

 “he does” arstan whitebeard insisted “wars swords spears alone ser two hosts equal strength may come together one break run whilst stands hero builds courage hearts men plants seeds doubt ours”

 ser jorah snorted “and champion lose sort seed would plant”

 “a man fears battle wins victories ser”

 “we’re speaking battle meereen’s gates open fool falls risk life naught”

 “for honor would say”

 “this challenge must met” arstan said

 “it be” dany said hero tucked penis away “tell strong belwas need him”

 found huge brown eunuch sitting shade pavilion eating sausage finished three bites wiped greasy hands clean trousers sent arstan whitebeard fetch steel aged squire honed belwas’s arakh every evening rubbed bright red oil

 whitebeard brought sword strong belwas squinted edge grunted slid blade back leather sheath tied swordbelt vast waist arstan brought shield well round steel disk larger pie plate eunuch grasped hand rather strapping forearm manner westeros “find liver onions whitebeard” belwas said “not killing makes strong belwas hungry” wait reply lumbered olive grove toward oznak zo pahl

 “why one khaleesi” rakharo demanded “he fat stupid”

 “strong belwas slave fighting pits highborn oznak fall great masters shamed wins… well poor victory one noble one meereen take pride in” unlike ser jorah daario brown ben three bloodriders eunuch lead troops plan battles give counsel nothing eat boast bellow arstan belwas man could easily spare time learned sort protector magister illyrio sent

 thrum excitement went siege lines belwas seen plodding toward city walls towers meereen came shouts jeers oznak zo pahl mounted waited striped lance held upright charger tossed head impatiently pawed sandy earth massive eunuch looked small beside hero horse

 “a chivalrous man would dismount” said arstan

 oznak zo pahl lowered lance charged

 belwas stopped legs spread wide one hand small round shield curved arakh arstan tended care great brown stomach sagging chest bare yellow silk sash knotted waist wore armor studded leather vest absurdly small even cover nipples “we given chainmail” dany said suddenly anxious

 “mail would slow him” said ser jorah “they wear armor fighting pits it’s blood crowds come see”

 dust flew hooves white charger oznak thundered toward strong belwas striped cloak streaming shoulders whole city meereen seemed screaming besiegers’ cheers seemed thin comparison unsullied stood silent ranks watching stone faces belwas might made stone well stood horse’s path vest stretched tight across broad back oznak’s lance leveled center chest bright steel point winked sunlight he’s going impaled thought… eunuch spun sideways quick blink eye horseman beyond wheeling raising lance belwas made move strike meereenese walls screamed even louder “what doing” dany demanded

 “giving mob show” ser jorah said

 oznak brought horse around belwas wide circle dug spurs charged belwas waited spun knocked point lance aside could hear eunuch’s booming laughter echoing across plain hero went past “the lance long” ser jorah said “all belwas needs avoid point instead trying spit prettily fool ride right him”

 oznak zo pahl charged third time dany could see plainly riding past belwas way westerosi knight might ride opponent tilt rather like dothraki riding foe flat level ground allowed charger get good speed also made easy eunuch dodge cumbersome fourteenfoot lance

 “so much hero meereen” said daario laughing

 “a victory without meaning” ser jorah cautioned “we win meereen killing defenders one time”

 “no” dany agreed “but i’m pleased killed one”

 defenders walls began firing crossbows belwas bolts fell short skittered harmlessly along ground eunuch turned back steeltipped rain lowered trousers squatted shat direction city wiped oznak’s striped cloak paused long enough loot hero’s corpse put dying horse agony trudging back olive grove

 besiegers gave raucous welcome soon reached camp dothraki hooted screamed unsullied sent great clangor banging spears shields “well done” ser jorah told brown ben tossed eunuch ripe plum said “a sweet fruit sweet fight” even dothraki handmaids words praise “we would braid hair hang bell strong belwas” said jhiqui “but hair braid”

 “strong belwas needs tinkly bells” eunuch ate brown ben’s plum four big bites tossed aside stone “strong belwas needs liver onions”

 “you shall it” said dany “strong belwas hurt” stomach red blood sheeting meaty gash beneath breasts

 “it nothing let man cut kill him” slapped bloody belly “count cuts know many strong belwas slain”

 dany lost khal drogo similar wound willing let go untreated sent missandei find certain yunkish freedman renowned skill healing arts belwas howled complained dany scolded called big bald baby let healer stanch wound vinegar sew shut bind chest strips linen soaked fire wine lead captains commanders inside pavilion council

 “i must city” told sitting crosslegged pile cushions dragons irri jhiqui poured wine “her granaries full bursting figs dates olives growing terraces pyramids casks salt fish smoked meat buried cellars”

 “and fat chests gold silver gemstones well” daario reminded “let us forget gemstones”

 “i’ve look landward walls see point weakness” said ser jorah mormont “given time might able mine beneath tower make breach eat we’re digging stores exhausted”

 “no weakness landward walls” said dany meereen stood jut sand stone slow brown skahazadhan flowed slaver’s bay city’s north wall ran along riverbank west along bay shore “does mean might attack river sea “

 “with three ships we’ll want captain groleo take good look wall along river unless it’s crumbling that’s wetter way die”

 “what build siege towers brother viserys told tales know made”

 “from wood grace” ser jorah said “the slavers burnt every tree within twenty leagues without wood trebuchets smash walls ladders go siege towers turtles rams storm gates axes sure but…”

 “did see bronze heads gates” asked brown ben plumm “rows harpy heads open mouths meereenese squirt boiling oil mouths cook axemen stand”

 daario naharis gave grey worm smile “perhaps unsullied wield axes boiling oil feels like warm bath heard”

 “this false” grey worm return smile “these ones feel burns men yet oil blinds kills unsullied fear die though give ones rams batter gates die attempt”

 “you would die” said brown ben yunkai took command second sons claimed veteran hundred battles “though say fought bravely old sellswords bold sellswords old bold sellswords” saw true

 dany sighed “i throw away unsullied lives grey worm perhaps starve city out”

 ser jorah looked unhappy “we’ll starve long grace there’s food fodder mules horses like river water either meereen shits skahazadhan draws drinking water deep wells already we’ve reports sickness camps fever brownleg three cases bloody flux remain slaves weak march”

 “freedmen” dany corrected “they slaves longer”

 “slave free hungry they’ll soon sick city better provisioned resupplied water three ships enough deny access river sea”

 “then advise ser jorah”

 “you like it”

 “i would hear same”

 “as wish say let city cannot free every slave world khaleesi war westeros”

 “i forgotten westeros” dany dreamt nights fabled land never seen “if let meereen’s old brick walls defeat easily though ever take great stone castles westeros”

 “as aegon did” ser jorah said “with fire time reach seven kingdoms dragons grown siege towers trebuchets well things lack here… way across lands long summer long grueling dangers cannot know stopped astapor buy army start war save spears swords seven kingdoms queen leave meereen meereenese march west pentos”

 “defeated” said dany bristling

 “when cowards hide behind great walls defeated khaleesi” ko jhogo said

 bloodriders concurred “blood blood” said rakharo “when cowards hide burn food fodder great khals must seek braver foes known”

 “it known” jhiqui agreed poured

 “not me” dany set great store ser jorah’s counsel leave meereen untouched could stomach could forget children posts birds tearing entrails skinny arms pointing coast road “ser jorah say food left march west feed freedmen”

 “you can’t sorry khaleesi must feed starve many die along march yes hard way save need put scorched earth well behind us”

 dany left trail corpses behind crossed red waste sight never meant see “no” said “i march people die” children “there must way city”

 “i know way” brown ben plumm stroked speckled greyandwhite beard “sewers”

 “sewers mean”

 “great brick sewers empty skahazadhan carrying city’s wastes might way escaped meereen scarb lost head” brown ben made face “the smell never left dream nights”

 ser jorah looked dubious “easier go would seem sewers empty river say would mean mouths right walls”

 “and closed iron grates” brown ben admitted “though rusted else would drowned shit inside long foul climb pitchdark maze brick man could lose forever filth never lower waist high rise head stains saw walls there’s things biggest rats ever saw worse things nasty”

 daario naharis laughed “as nasty came crawling man fool enough try every slaver meereen would smell moment emerged”

 brown ben shrugged “her grace asked way told her… ben plumm isn’t going sewers gold seven kingdoms there’s others want try though they’re welcome”

 aggo jhogo grey worm tried speak dany raised hand silence “these sewers sound promising” grey worm would lead unsullied sewers commanded knew bloodriders would less none suited task dothraki horsemen strength unsullied discipline battlefield send men die dark slender hope “i must think return duties”

 captains bowed left handmaids dragons brown ben leaving viserion spread pale white wings flapped lazily head one wings buffeted sellsword face white dragon landed awkwardly one foot man’s head one shoulder shrieked flew “he likes ben” said dany

 “well” said brown ben “there old plumm sunset kingdoms wed dragon princess grandmama told tale lived king aegon’s day”

 “which king aegon” dany asked “five aegons ruled westeros” brother’s son would sixth usurper’s men dashed head wall

 “five well that’s confusion could give number queen old plumm lord though must famous fellow day talk land thing begging royal pardon cock six foot long”

 three bells dany’s braid tinkled laughed “you mean inches think”

 “feet” brown ben said firmly “if inches who’d want talk grace”

 dany giggled like little girl “did grandmother claim she’d actually seen prodigy”

 “that old crone never halfibbenese halfqohorik never westeros grandfather must told dothraki killed born”

 “and grandfather’s knowledge come from”

 “one tales told teat i’d guess” brown ben shrugged “that’s know aegon unnumbered old lord plumm’s mighty manhood fear best see sons”

 sansa


 sweet dream sansa thought drowsily back winterfell running godswood lady father brothers warm safe dreaming could make so…

 threw back coverlets must brave torments would soon ended one way lady would afraid lady dead though robb bran rickon arya father mother even septa mordane dead alone world

 lord husband beside used tyrion bad sleeper often rose dawn usually found solar hunched beside candle lost old scroll leatherbound book sometimes smell morning bread ovens took kitchens sometimes would climb roof garden wander alone traitor’s walk

 threw back shutters shivered gooseprickles rose along arms clouds massing eastern sky pierced shafts sunlight look like two huge castles afloat morning sky sansa could see walls tumbled stone mighty keeps barbicans wispy banners swirled atop towers reached fastfading stars sun coming behind watched go black grey thousand shades rose gold crimson soon wind mushed together one castle two

 heard door open maids brought hot water bath new service tyrion said women who’d tended previously cersei’s spies sansa always suspected “come see” told “there’s castle sky”

 came look “it’s made gold” shae short dark hair bold eyes asked sometimes gave sansa insolent looks “a castle gold there’s sight i’d like see”

 “a castle it” brella squint “that tower’s tumbling looks like it’s ruins is”

 sansa want hear falling towers ruined castles closed shutters said “we expected queen’s breakfast lord husband solar”

 “no m’lady” said brella “i seen him”

 “might went see father” shae declared “might king’s hand need counsel”

 brella gave sniff “lady sansa you’ll wanting get tub water gets cool”

 sansa let shae pull shift head climbed big wooden tub tempted ask cup wine calm nerves wedding midday great sept baelor across city come evenfall feast would held throne room thousand guests seventyseven courses singers jugglers mummers first came breakfast queen’s ballroom lannisters tyrell men—the tyrell women would breaking fast margaery—and hundred odd knights lordlings made lannister sansa thought bitterly

 brella sent shae fetch hot water washed sansa’s back “you trembling m’lady”

 “the water hot enough” sansa lied

 maids dressing tyrion appeared podrick payne tow “you look lovely sansa” turned squire “pod good pour cup wine”

 “there wine breakfast lord” sansa said

 “there’s wine don’t expect face sister sober surely it’s new century lady three hundredth year since aegon’s conquest” dwarf took cup red podrick raised high “to aegon fortunate fellow two sisters two wives three big dragons could man ask for” wiped mouth back hand

 imp’s clothing soiled unkempt sansa noticed looked though he’d slept “will changing fresh garb lord new doublet handsome”

 “the doublet handsome yes” tyrion put cup aside “come pod let us see find garments make look less dwarfish would want shame lady wife”

 imp returned short time later presentable enough even little taller podrick payne changed well looked almost proper squire although rather large red pimple fold beside nose spoiled effect splendid purple white gold raiment timid boy sansa wary tyrion’s squire first payne cousin ser ilyn payne taken father’s head however she’d soon come realize pod frightened cousin whenever spoke turned alarming shade red

 “are purple gold white colors house payne podrick” asked politely

 “no mean yes” blushed “the colors arms purple white chequy lady gold coins checks purple white both” studied feet

 “there’s tale behind coins” said tyrion “no doubt pod confide toes one day expected queen’s ballroom however shall we”

 sansa tempted beg could tell tummy upset moon’s blood come wanted nothing crawl back bed pull drapes must brave like robb told took lord husband stiffly arm

 queen’s ballroom broke fast honeycakes baked blackberries nuts gammon steaks bacon fingerfish crisped breadcrumbs autumn pears dornish dish onions cheese chopped eggs cooked fiery peppers “nothing like hearty breakfast whet one’s appetite seventysevencourse feast follow” tyrion commented plates filled flagons milk flagons mead flagons light sweet golden wine wash musicians strolled among tables piping fluting fiddling ser dontos galloped broomstick horse moon boy made farting sounds cheeks sang rude songs guests

 tyrion scarce touched food sansa noticed though drank several cups wine tried little dornish eggs peppers burned mouth otherwise nibbled fruit fish honeycakes every time joffrey looked tummy got fluttery felt though she’d swallowed bat

 food cleared away queen solemnly presented joff wife’s cloak would drape margaery’s shoulders “it cloak donned robert took queen cloak mother lady joanna wore wed lord father” sansa thought looked threadbare truth told perhaps used

 time gifts traditional reach give presents bride groom morning wedding morrow would receive presents couple today’s tokens separate persons

 jalabhar xho joffrey received great bow golden wood quiver long arrows fletched green scarlet feathers lady tanda pair supple riding boots ser kevan magnificent red leather jousting saddle red gold brooch wrought shape scorpion dornishman prince oberyn silver spurs ser addam marbrand red silk tourney pavilion lord mathis rowan lord paxter redwyne brought forth beautiful wooden model war galley two hundred oars built even arbor “if please grace called king joffrey’s valor” said joff allowed pleased indeed “i make flagship sail dragonstone kill traitor uncle stannis” said

 plays gracious king today joffrey could gallant suited sansa knew seemed suit less less indeed courtesy vanished tyrion presented gift huge old book called lives four kings bound leather gorgeously illuminated king leafed interest “and uncle”

 book sansa wondered joffrey moved fat wormy lips read

 “grand maester kaeth’s history reigns daeron young dragon baelor blessed aegon unworthy daeron good” small husband answered

 “a book every king read grace” said ser kevan

 “my father time books” joffrey shoved tome across table “if read less uncle imp perhaps lady sansa would baby belly now” laughed… king laughs court laughs “don’t sad sansa i’ve gotten queen margaery child i’ll visit bedchamber show little uncle it’s done”

 sansa reddened glanced nervously tyrion afraid might say could turn nasty bedding feast dwarf filled mouth wine instead words

 lord mace tyrell came forward present gift golden chalice three feet tall two ornate curved handles seven faces glittering gemstones “seven faces grace’s seven kingdoms” bride’s father explained showed face bore sigil one great houses ruby lion emerald rose onyx stag silver trout blue jade falcon opal sun pearl direwolf

 “a splendid cup” said joffrey “but we’ll need chip wolf put squid place think”

 sansa pretended heard

 “margaery shall drink deep feast good father” joffrey lifted chalice head everyone admire

 “the damned thing’s tall am” tyrion muttered low voice “half chalice joff falling drunk”

 good thought perhaps he’ll break neck

 lord tywin waited last present king gift longsword scabbard made cherrywood gold oiled red leather studded golden lions’ heads lions ruby eyes saw ballroom fell silent joffrey unsheathed blade thrust sword head red black ripples steel shimmered morning light

 “magnificent” declared mathis rowan

 “a sword sing sire” said lord redwyne

 “a king’s sword” said ser kevan lannister

 king joffrey looked wanted kill someone right excited slashed air laughed “a great sword must great name lords shall call it”

 sansa remembered lion’s tooth sword arya flung trident hearteater one he’d made kiss battle wondered he’d want margaery kiss one

 guests shouting names new blade joff dismissed dozen heard one liked “widow’s wail” cried “yes shall make many widow too” slashed “and face uncle stannis break magic sword clean two” joff tried downcut forcing ser balon swann take hasty step backward laughter rang hall look ser balon’s face

 “have care grace” ser addam marbrand warned king “valyrian steel perilously sharp”

 “i remember” joffrey brought widow’s wail savage twohanded slice onto book tyrion given heavy leather cover parted stroke “sharp told stranger valyrian steel” took half dozen cuts hack thick tome apart boy breathless time done sansa could feel husband struggling fury ser osmund kettleblack shouted “i pray never turn wicked edge sire”

 “see never give cause ser” joffrey flicked chunk lives four kings table swordpoint slid widow’s wail back scabbard

 “your grace” ser garlan tyrell said “perhaps know westeros four copies book illuminated kaeth’s hand”

 “now three” joffrey undid old swordbelt new one “you lady sansa owe better present uncle imp one chopped pieces”

 tyrion staring nephew mismatched eyes “perhaps knife sire match sword dagger fine valyrian steel… dragonbone hilt say”

 joff gave sharp look “you… yes dagger match sword good” nodded “a… gold hilt rubies dragonbone plain”

 “as wish grace” tyrion drank another cup wine might alone solar attention paid sansa time came leave wedding took hand

 crossing yard prince oberyn dorne fell beside blackhaired paramour arm sansa glanced woman curiously baseborn unwed borne two bastard daughters prince fear look even queen eye shae told ellaria worshiped lysene love goddess “she almost whore found m’lady” maid confided “and she’s near princess” sansa never close dornishwoman truly beautiful thought something draws eye

 “i great good fortune see citadel’s copy lives four kings” prince oberyn telling lord husband “the illuminations wondrous behold kaeth kind half king viserys”

 tyrion gave sharp look “too kind scants viserys shamefully view lives five kings”

 prince laughed “viserys hardly reigned fortnight”

 “he reigned year” said tyrion

 oberyn gave shrug “a year fortnight matter poisoned nephew gain throne nothing it”

 “baelor starved death fasting” said tyrion “his uncle served loyally hand served young dragon viserys might reigned year ruled fifteen daeron warred baelor prayed” made sour face “and remove nephew blame someone save realm baelor’s follies”

 sansa shocked “but baelor blessed great king walked boneway barefoot make peace dorne rescued dragonknight snakepit vipers refused strike pure holy”

 prince oberyn smiled “if viper lady would want bite bloodless stick like baelor blessed i’d sooner save fangs someone juicier…”

 “my prince playing lady sansa” said woman ellaria sand “the septons singers like say snakes bite baelor truth different bitten half hundred times died it”

 “if viserys would reigned dozen years” said tyrion “and seven kingdoms might better served believe baelor deranged venom”

 “yes” said prince oberyn “but i’ve seen snakes red keep account joffrey”

 “i prefer to” tyrion inclined head stiffly “if excuse us litter awaits” dwarf helped sansa inside clambered awkwardly “close curtains lady you’d good”

 “must lord” sansa want shut behind curtains “the day lovely”

 “the good people king’s landing like throw dung litter see inside us kindness lady close curtains “

 bid sat time air grew warm stuffy around “i sorry book lord” made say

 “it joffrey’s book might learned thing two he’d read it” sounded distracted “i known better seen… good many things”

 “perhaps dagger please more”

 dwarf grimaced scar tightened twisted “the boy’s earned dagger wouldn’t say” thankfully tyrion wait reply “joff quarreled brother robb winterfell tell ill feeling bran grace well”

 “bran” question confused “before fell mean” try think back long ago “bran sweet boy everyone loved tommen fought wooden swords remember play”

 tyrion lapsed back moody silence sansa heard distant clank chains outside portcullis drawn moment later shout litter swayed motion deprived passing scenery chose stare folded hands uncomfortably aware husand’s mismatched eyes looking way

 “you loved brothers much love jaime”

 lannister trap make speak treason “my brothers traitors they’ve gone traitors’ graves treason love traitor “

 little husband snorted “robb rose arms rightful king law made traitor others died young know treason was” rubbed nose “sansa know happened bran winterfell”

 “bran fell always climbing things finally fell always feared would theon greyjoy killed later”

 “theon greyjoy” tyrion sighed “your lady mother accused me… well burden ugly details accused falsely never harmed brother bran mean harm you”

 want say “that good know lord” wanted something sansa know looks like starving child food give won’t leave

 tyrion rubbed scarred scabby nose yet ugly habit drew eye ugly face “you never asked robb died lady mother”

 “i… would sooner know would give bad dreams”

 “then say more”

 “that… that’s kind you”

 “oh yes” said tyrion “i soul kindness know bad dreams”

 “no names” man said “in boat” sat hunched oars old man tall gangling long white hair great hooked nose eyes shaded cowl “get quick it” muttered “we need away”

 safe aboard cowled man slid blades water put back oars rowing toward channel behind bells still tolling boy king’s death dark river

 slow steady rhythmic strokes threaded way downstream sliding sunken galleys past broken masts burned hulls torn sails oarlocks muffled moved almost soundlessly mist rising water sansa saw embattled ramparts one imp’s winch towers looming great chain lowered rowed unimpeded past spot thousand men burned shore fell away fog grew thicker sound bells began fade finally even lights gone lost somewhere behind blackwater bay world shrank dark water blowing mist silent companion stooped oars “how far must go” asked

 “no talk” oarsman old stronger looked voice fierce something oddly familiar face though sansa could say

 “not far” ser dontos took hand rubbed gently “your friend near waiting you”

 deck rocked beneath feet sansa felt world grown unsteady “they think tyrion poisoned joffrey ser dontos said seized him”

 littlefinger smiled “widowhood become sansa”

 thought made tummy flutter might never need share bed tyrion she’d wanted… wasn’t

 cabin low cramped featherbed laid upon narrow sleeping shelf make comfortable thick furs piled atop “it snug know shouldn’t uncomfortable” littlefinger pointed cedar chest porthole “you’ll find fresh garb within dresses smallclothes warm stockings cloak wool linen fear unworthy maid beautiful they’ll serve keep dry clean find something finer”

 jaime


 king dead told never knowing joffrey son well sovereign

 “the imp opened throat dagger” costermonger declared roadside inn spent night “he drank blood big gold chalice” man recognize bearded onehanded knight big bat shield said things might otherwise swallowed known listening

 “it poison deed” innkeep insisted “the boy’s face turned black plum”

 “may father judge justly” murmured septon

 “the dwarf’s wife murder him” swore archer lord rowan’s livery “afterward vanished hall puff brimstone ghostly direwolf seen prowling red keep blood dripping jaws”

 jaime sat silent letting words wash horn ale forgotten one good hand joffrey blood firstborn son tried bring boy’s face mind features kept turning cersei’s mourning hair disarray eyes red crying mouth trembling tries speak cry sees though she’ll fight tears sister seldom wept could stand others think weak twin show wounds look comfort revenge

 rode hard next day jaime’s insistence son dead sister needed

 saw city watchtowers dark gathering dusk jaime lannister cantered steelshanks walton behind nage peace banner

 “what’s awful stink” northman complained

 death thought jaime said “smoke sweat shit king’s landing short good nose smell treachery you’ve never smelled city before”

 “i smelled white harbor never stank like this”

 “white harbor king’s landing brother tyrion ser gregor clegane”

 nage led low hill seventailed peace banner lifting turning wind polished sevenpointed star shining bright upon staff would see cersei soon tyrion father could brother truly killed boy jaime found hard believe

 curiously calm men supposed go mad grief children died knew supposed tear hair roots curse gods swear red vengeance felt little boy lived died believing robert baratheon sire

 jaime seen born true though cersei child never held “how would look” sister warned women finally left “bad enough joff looks like without mooning him” jaime yielded hardly fight boy squalling pink thing demanded much cersei’s time cersei’s love cersei’s breasts robert welcome

 he’s dead pictured joff lying still cold face black poison still felt nothing perhaps monster claimed father came offer back son hand jaime knew would choose second son seed enough many cersei wants another child i’ll give one… time i’ll hold others take like robert rotting grave jaime sick lies

 “king’s landing” jaime announced found “our journey’s done lady you’ve kept vow delivered king’s landing fingers hand”

 brienne’s eyes listless “that half vow told lady catelyn would bring back daughters sansa least now…”

 davos


 voices rose like cinders swirling purple evening sky “lead us darkness lord fill hearts fire may walk shining path”

 nightfire burned gathering dark great bright beast whose shifting orange light threw shadows twenty feet tall across yard along walls dragonstone army gargoyles grotesques seemed stir shift

 davos looked arched window gallery watched melisandre lift arms embrace shivering flames “r’hllor” sang voice loud clear “you light eyes fire hearts heat loins sun warms days stars guard us dark night”

 “lord light defend us night dark full terrors” queen selyse led responses pinched face full fervor king stannis stood beside jaw clenched hard points redgold crown shimmering whenever moved head davos thought princess shireen mottled grey patches face neck almost black firelight

 “lord light protect us” queen sang king respond others staring flames davos wondered saw another vision war come something closer home

 “r’hllor gave us breath thank you” sang melisandre “r’hllor gave us day thank you”

 “we thank sun warms us” queen selyse worshipers replied “we thank stars watch us thank hearths torches keep savage dark bay” fewer voices saying responses night seemed davos fewer faces flushed orange light fire would fewer still morrow…

 voice ser axell florent rang loud trumpet stood barrelchested bandylegged firelight washing face like monstrous orange tongue davos wondered ser axell would thank work tonight might well make king’s hand dreamed

 melisandre cried “we thank stannis grace king thank pure white fire goodness red sword justice hand love bears leal people guide defend r’hllor grant strength smite foes”

 “grant strength” answered queen selyse ser axell devan rest “grant courage grant wisdom”

 boy septons taught davos pray crone wisdom warrior courage smith strength mother prayed keep sweet son devan safe red woman’s demon god

 “lord davos we’d best it” ser andrew touched elbow gently “my lord”

 “fire living thing” red woman told asked teach see future flames “it always moving always changing… like book whose letters dance shift even try read takes years training see shapes beyond flames years still learn tell shapes may even comes hard hard understand men sunset lands” davos asked ser axell learned trick quickly smiled enigmatically said “any cat may stare fire see red mice play”

 lied king’s men “the red woman may see intend” warned

 “we start killing then” urged lewys fishwife “i know place could waylay four us sharp swords…”

 “you’d doom us all” said davos “maester cressen tried kill knew flames i’d guess seems quick sense threat person surely cannot see everything ignore perhaps might escape notice”

 “there honor hiding sneaking” objected ser triston tally hill sunglass man lord guncer went melisandre’s fires

 “is honorable burn” davos asked “you saw lord sunglass die want don’t need men honor need smugglers no”

 gods good

 maester pylos leading edric storm sums davos pushed open door ser andrew close behind others left guard steps cellar door maester broke “that enough edric”

 boy puzzled intrusion “lord davos ser andrew sums”

 ser andrew smiled “i hated sums age coz”

 “i don’t mind much like history best though it’s full tales”

 “edric” said maester pylos “run get cloak you’re go lord davos”

 “i am” edric got feet “where going” mouth set stubbornly “i won’t go pray lord light warrior’s man like father”

 “we know” davos said “come lad must dawdle”

 edric donned thick hooded cloak undyed wool maester pylos helped fasten pulled hood shadow face “are coming us maester” boy asked

 “no” pylos touched chain many metals wore neck “my place dragonstone go lord davos says king’s hand remember tell king’s hand”

 “the hand speaks king’s voice”

 young maester smiled “that’s go now”

 davos uncertain pylos perhaps resented taking old cressen’s place could admire man’s courage could mean life well

 outside maester’s chambers ser gerald gower waited steps edric storm looked curiously made descent asked “where going lord davos”

 “to water ship awaits you”

 boy stopped suddenly “a ship”

 “one salladhor saan’s salla good friend mine”

 “i shall go cousin” ser andrew assured “there’s nothing frightened of”

 “i frightened” edric said indignantly “only… shireen coming too”

 “no” said davos “the princess must remain father mother”

 “i see then” edric explained “to say farewells otherwise she’ll sad”

 sad sees burn “there time” davos said “i tell princess thinking write get you’re going”

 boy frowned “are sure must go would uncle send dragonstone displease never meant to” got stubborn look “i want see uncle want see king stannis”

 bastard nightsong joined cellar door walked quickly across shadowed yard steps stone tail frozen dragon lewys fishwife omer blackberry waited postern gate two guards bound trussed feet “the boat” davos asked

 “it’s there” lewys said “four oarsmen galley anchored past point mad prendos”

 davos chuckled ship named madman yes that’s fitting salla streak pirate’s black humor

 went one knee edric storm “i must leave now” said “there’s boat waiting row galley it’s across sea robert’s son know brave matter happens”

 “i only…” boy hesitated

 “think adventure lord” davos tried sound hale cheerful “it’s start life’s great adventure may warrior defend you”

 “and may father judge justly lord davos” boy went cousin ser andrew postern gate others followed bastard nightsong may father judge justly davos thought ruefully king’s judgment concerned

 “these two” asked ser rolland guards closed barred gate

 “drag cellar” said davos “you cut free edric’s safely way”

 bastard gave curt nod words say easy part done davos pulled glove wishing lost luck better man braver one bag bones around neck ran shortened fingers thinning brown hair wondered needed cut must look presentable stood king

 dragonstone never seemed dark fearsome walked slowly footsteps echoing black walls dragons stone dragons never wake pray stone drum loomed huge ahead guards door uncrossed spears approached onion knight king’s hand davos hand going least wondered would coming ever do…

 steps seemed longer steeper perhaps tired mother never made tasks like risen high fast mountain air thin breathe boy he’d dreamed riches long ago later grown wanted acres good land hall grow old better life sons blind bastard used tell clever smuggler overreach draw much attention acres timbered roof “ser” name content survived night would take devan sail home cape wrath gentle marya grieve together dead sons raise living ones good men speak kings

 chamber painted table dark empty davos entered king would still nightfire melisandre queen’s men knelt made fire hearth drive chill round chamber chase shadows back corners went around room window turn opening heavy velvet curtains unlatching wooden shutters wind came strong smell salt sea pulled plain brown cloak

 north window leaned sill breath cold night air hoping catch glimpse mad prendos raising sail sea seemed black empty far eye could see gone already could pray boy half moon sliding amongst thin high clouds davos could see familiar stars galley sailing west crone’s lantern four bright stars enclosed golden haze clouds hid ice dragon bright blue eye marked due north sky full smugglers’ stars old friends stars davos hoped meant good luck

 lowered gaze sky castle ramparts certain wings stone dragons cast great black shadows light nightfire tried tell carvings cold lifeless place place dragons dragonlords seat house targaryen targaryens blood old valyria…

 wind sighed chamber hearth flames gusted swirled listened logs crackle spit davos left window shadow went tall thin fell across painted table like sword stood long time waiting heard boots stone steps ascended king’s voice went “…is three” saying

 “three three” came melisandre’s answer “i swear grace saw die heard mother’s wail”

 “in nightfire” stannis melisandre came door together “the flames full tricks may cannot tell certainty…”

 “your grace” davos stepped forward “lady melisandre saw true nephew joffrey dead”

 king surprised find painted table gave sign “lord davos” said “he nephew though years believed was”

 “he choked morsel food wedding feast” davos said “it may poisoned”

 “he third” said melisandre

 “i count woman” stannis walked along table past oldtown arbor toward shield islands mouth mander “weddings become perilous battles would seem poisoner known”

 “his uncle it’s said imp”

 stannis ground teeth “a dangerous man learned blackwater come report”

 “the lyseni still trade king’s landing salladhor saan reason lie me”

 “i suppose not” king ran fingers across table “joffrey… remember kitchen cat… cooks wont feed scraps fish heads one told boy kittens belly thinking might want one joffrey opened poor thing dagger see true found kittens brought show father robert hit boy hard thought he’d killed him” king took crown placed table “dwarf leech killer served kingdom well must send now”

 “they not” said melisandre “joffrey brother”

 “tommen” king said name grudgingly

 “they crown tommen rule name”

 stannis made fist “tommen gentler joffrey born incest another monster making another leech upon land westeros needs man’s hand child’s”

 melisandre moved closer “save sire let wake stone dragons three three give boy”

 “edric storm” davos said

 stannis rounded cold fury “i know name spare reproaches like duty realm duty…” turned back melisandre “you swear way swear life promise shall die inches lie”

 “you must stand one whose coming prophesied five thousand years ago red comet herald prince promised fail world fails you” melisandre went red lips parted ruby throbbing “give boy” whispered “and give kingdom”

 “he can’t” said davos “edric storm gone”

 “gone” stannis turned “what mean gone”

 “he aboard lyseni galley safely sea” davos watched melisandre’s pale heartshaped face saw flicker dismay sudden uncertainty see

 king’s eyes dark blue bruises hollows face “the bastard taken dragonstone without leave galley say lysene pirate thinks use boy squeeze gold me—”

 “this hand’s work sire” melisandre gave davos knowing look “you bring back lord will”

 “the boy reach” said davos “and reach well lady”

 red eyes made squirm “i left dark ser know done”

 “my duty”

 “some might call treason” stannis went window stare night looking ship “i raised dirt davos” sounded tired angry “was loyalty much hope for”

 “four sons died blackwater might died loyalty always” davos seaworth thought long hard words said next knew life depended “your grace made swear give honest counsel swift obedience defend realm foes protect people edric storm one people one swore protect kept oath could treason”

 stannis ground teeth “i never asked crown gold cold heavy head long king duty… must sacrifice one child flames save million dark… sacrifice… never easy davos true sacrifice tell lady”

 melisandre said “azor ahai tempered lightbringer heart’s blood beloved wife man thousand cows gives one god nothing man offers cow owns…”

 “she talks cows” davos told king “i speaking boy daughter’s friend brother’s son”

 “a king’s son power kingsblood veins” melisandre’s ruby glowed like red star throat “do think you’ve saved boy onion knight long night falls edric storm shall die rest wherever hidden sons well darkness cold cover earth meddle matters understand”

 “there’s much don’t understand” davos admitted “i never pretended elsewise know seas rivers shapes coasts rocks shoals lie know hidden coves boat land unseen know king protects people king all”

 stannis’s face darkened “do mock face must learn king’s duty onion smuggler”

 davos knelt “if offended take head i’ll die lived loyal man hear first hear sake onions brought fingers took”

 stannis slid lightbringer scabbard glow filled chamber “say say quickly” muscles king’s neck stood like cords

 davos fumbled inside cloak drew crinkled sheet parchment seemed thin flimsy thing yet shield “a king’s hand able read write maester pylos teaching me” smoothed letter flat upon knee began read light magic sword

 afterward would seem jon snow he’d dreamt night side side straw soldiers longbows crossbows clutched halffrozen hands archers launched hundred flights arrows men never saw time time wildling arrow came flying back answer sent men smaller catapults filled air jagged rocks size giant’s fist darkness swallowed man might swallow handful nuts mammoths trumpeted gloom strange voices called stranger tongues septon cellador prayed loudly drunkenly dawn come jon tempted chuck edge heard mammoth dying feet saw another lurch burning woods trampling men trees alike wind blew cold colder hobb rode chain cups onion broth owen clydas served archers stood could gulp arrows zei took place among crossbow hours repeated jars shocks knocked something loose righthand trebuchet counterweight came crashing free suddenly catastrophically wrenching throwing arm sideways splintering crash lefthand trebuchet kept throwing wildlings quickly learned shun place loads landing

 twenty trebuchets two mounted sledges turntables could move futile thought might well wish another thousand men maybe dragon three

 donal noye return who’d gone hold black cold tunnel wall mine jon reminded whenever felt strength flagging taken longbow fingers felt crabbed stiff halffrozen fever back well leg would tremble uncontrollably sending whitehot knife pain right one arrow i’ll rest told half hundred times one whenever quiver empty one orphaned moles would bring another one quiver i’m done couldn’t long dawn

 morning came none quite realized first world still dark black turned grey shapes beginning emerge halfseen gloom jon lowered bow stare mass heavy clouds covered eastern sky could see glow behind perhaps dreaming notched another arrow

 rising sun broke send pale lances light across battleground jon found holding breath looked halfmile swath cleared land lay wall edge forest half night turned wasteland blackened grass bubbling pitch shattered stone corpses carcass burned mammoth already drawing crows giants dead ground well behind them…

 someone moaned left heard septon cellador say “mother mercy oh oh oh oh mother mercy”

 beneath trees wildlings world raiders giants wargs skinchangers mountain men salt sea sailors ice river cannibals cave dwellers dyed faces dog chariots frozen shore hornfoot men soles like boiled leather queer wild folk mance gathered break wall land jon wanted shout place go away could hear tormund giantsbane laughing “you know nothing jon snow” ygritte would said flexed sword hand opening closing fingers though knew full well swords would come

 chilled feverish suddenly weight longbow much battle magnar nothing realized night fight less nothing probe dagger dark try catch unprepared real battle beginning

 “i never knew would many” satin said

 jon seen like drawn battle array march wildling column sprawled long leagues like enormous worm never saw now…

 “here come” someone said hoarse voice

 mammoths centered wildling line saw hundred giants backs clutching mauls huge stone axes giants loped beside pushing along tree trunk great wooden wheels end sharpened point ram thought bleakly gate still stood kisses thing would soon turn splinters either side giants came wave horsemen boiled leather harness firehardened lances mass running archers hundreds foot spears slings clubs leathern shields bone chariots frozen shore clattered forward flanks bouncing rocks roots behind teams huge white dogs fury wild jon thought listened skirl skins dogs barking baying mammoths trumpeting free folk whistling screaming giants roaring old tongue drums echoed ice like rolling thunder

 could feel despair around “there must hundred thousand” satin wailed “how stop many”

 “the wall stop them” jon heard say turned said louder “the wall stop wall defends itself” hollow words needed say almost much brothers needed hear “mance wants unman us numbers think we’re stupid” shouting leg forgotten every man listening “the chariots horsemen fools foot… going us ever see mammoth climb wall” laughed pyp owen half dozen laughed “they’re nothing they’re less use straw brothers can’t reach us can’t hurt us don’t frighten us they”

 “no” grenn shouted

 “they’re we’re here” jon said “and long hold gate cannot pass cannot pass” shouting roaring words back waving swords longbows air cheeks flushed red jon saw kegs standing warhorn slung beneath arm “brother” told “sound battle “

 grinning kegs lifted horn lips blew two long blasts meant wildlings horns took call wall seemed shudder echo great deepthroated moans drowned sound

 “archers” jon said horns died away “you’ll aim giants ram every bloody one loose command giants ram want arrows raining every step we’ll wait till they’re range man wastes arrow need climb fetch back hear me”

 “i do” shouted owen oaf “i hear lord snow”

 jon laughed laughed like drunk madman men laughed chariots racing horsemen flanks well ahead center saw wildlings crossed third half mile yet battle line dissolving “load trebuchet caltrops” jon said “owen kegs angle catapults toward center scorpions load fire spears loose command” pointed mole’s town boys “you stand torches”

 wildling archers shot advanced would dash forward stop loose run another ten yards many air constantly full arrows falling woefully short waste jon thought want discipline showing smaller hornandwood bows free folk outranged great yew longbows night’s watch wildlings trying shoot men seven hundred feet “let shoot” jon said “wait hold” cloaks flapping behind “the wind faces cost us range wait” closer closer skins wailed drums thundered wildling arrows fluttered fell

 “draw” jon lifted bow pulled arrow ear satin grenn owen oaf spare boot black jack bulwer arron emrick zei hoisted crossbow shoulder jon watching ram come mammoths giants lumbering forward either side small could crushed one hand seemed hand big enough killing ground came hundred crows rose carcass dead mammoth wildlings thundered past either side closer closer until…

 “loose”

 black arrows hissed downward like snakes feathered wings jon wait see struck reached second arrow soon first left bow “notch draw loose” soon arrow flew found another “notch draw loose” jon shouted trebuchet heard creak heavy thud hundred spiked steel caltrops went spinning air “catapults” called “scorpions bowmen loose will” wildling arrows striking wall hundred feet second giant spun staggered notch draw loose mammoth veered another beside spilling giants ground notch draw loose ram done saw giants who’d pushed dead dying “fire arrows” shouted “i want ram burning” screams wounded mammoths booming cries giants mingled drums pipes make awful music yet still archers drew loosed they’d gone deaf dead dick follard might dregs order men night’s watch near enough made matter that’s shall pass

 one mammoths running berserk smashing wildlings trunk crushing archers underfoot jon pulled back bow launched another arrow beast’s shaggy back urge east west flanks wildling host reached wall unopposed chariots drew turned horsemen milled aimlessly beneath looming cliff ice “at gate” shout came spare boot maybe “mammoth gate”

 “fire” jon barked “grenn pyp”

 grenn thrust bow aside wrestled barrel oil onto side rolled edge wall pyp hammered plug sealed stuffed twist cloth set alight torch shoved together hundred feet struck wall burst filling air shattered staves burning oil grenn rolling second barrel precipice kegs one well pyp lit “got him” satin shouted head sticking far jon certain fall “got got got him” could hear roar fire flaming giant lurched view stumbling rolling ground

 suddenly mammoths fleeing running smoke flames smashing behind terror went backward giants wildlings behind scrambling get way half heartbeat whole center collapsing horsemen flanks saw abandoned decided fall back well one much blooded even chariots rumbled done nothing look fearsome make lot noise break break hard jon snow thought watched reel away drums gone silent like music mance like taste dornishman’s wife “do anyone hurt” asked

 “the bloody buggers got leg” spare boot plucked arrow waved head “the wooden one”

 ragged cheer went zei grabbed owen hands spun around circle gave long wet kiss right see tried kiss jon held shoulder pushed gently firmly away “no” said done kissing suddenly weary stand leg agony knee groin fumbled crutch “pyp help cage grenn wall”

 “me” said grenn “him” said pyp hard tell horrified “but” grenn stammered “bbut wildlings attack again”

 “stop them” jon told

 rode cage pyp took helm wiped brow “frozen sweat anything disgusting frozen sweat” laughed “gods don’t think ever hungry could eat aurochs whole swear think hobb cook grenn us” saw jon’s face smile died “what’s wrong leg”

 “my leg” jon agreed even words effort

 “not battle though battle”

 “ask i’ve seen gate” jon said grimly want fire hot meal warm bed something make leg stop hurting told first check tunnel find become donal noye

 battle thenns taken almost day clear ice broken beams away inner gate spotted pate kegs builders argued heatedly ought leave debris another obstacle mance would meant abandoning defense tunnel though noye none men murder holes archers spears behind inner grate determined brothers could hold hundred times many wildlings clog way corpses mean give mance rayder free passage ice pick spade ropes moved broken steps aside dug back gate

 jon waited cold iron bars pyp went maester aemon spare key surprisingly maester returned clydas lantern “come see done” old man told jon pyp fumbling chains “i need change dressing apply fresh poultice want dreamwine pain”

 jon nodded weakly door swung open pyp led followed clydas lantern jon could keep maester aemon ice pressed close around could feel cold seeping bones weight wall head felt like walking gullet ice dragon tunnel took twist another pyp unlocked second iron gate walked farther turned saw light ahead faint pale ice that’s bad jon knew that’s bad

 pyp said “there’s blood floor”

 last twenty feet tunnel they’d fought died outer door studded oak hacked broken finally torn hinges one giants crawled splinters lantern bathed grisly scene sullen reddish light pyp turned aside retch jon found envying maester aemon blindness

 noye men waiting within behind gate heavy iron bars like two pyp unlocked two crossbows gotten dozen quarrels giant struggled toward spearmen must come fore stabbing bars still giant found strength reach twist head spotted pate seize iron gate wrench bars apart links broken chain lay strewn across floor one giant work one giant

 “are dead” maester aemon asked softly

 “yes donal last” noye’s sword sunk deep giant’s throat halfway hilt armorer always seemed big man jon locked giant’s massive arms looked almost like child “the giant crushed spine don’t know died first” took lantern moved forward better look “mag” last giants could feel sadness time sadness “it mag mighty king giants”

 needed sun cold dark inside tunnel stench blood death suffocating jon gave lantern back clydas squeezed around bodies twisted bars walked toward daylight see lay beyond splintered door

 huge carcass dead mammoth partially blocked way one beast’s tusks snagged cloak tore edged past three giants lay outside half buried beneath stone slush hardened pitch could see fire melted wall great sheets ice come sloughing heat shatter blackened ground looked they’d come stand seems immense crush

 jon went back inside others waited “we need repair outer gate best block section tunnel rubble chunks ice anything way second gate ser wynton need take command he’s last knight left needs move giants back know tell him—”

 “tell will” said maester aemon gently “he smile nod forget thirty years ago ser wynton stout came within dozen votes lord commander would made fine one ten years ago would still capable longer know well donal jon”

 true “you give order then” jon told maester “you wall whole life men follow close gate”

 “i maester chained sworn order serves jon give counsel commands”

 “someone must—”

 “you must lead”

 “no”

 “yes jon need long time garrison returns donal chose qhorin halfhand lord commander mormont made steward son winterfell nephew benjen stark must one wall jon snow”





 arya


 could feel hole inside every morning woke wasn’t hunger though sometimes hollow place emptiness heart brothers lived parents head hurt bad first still pretty bad arya used though least lump going hole inside stayed hole never feel better told went sleep

 mornings arya want wake would huddle beneath cloak eyes squeezed shut try back sleep hound would left alone would slept day night

 dreamed best part dreaming dreamed wolves every night great pack wolves head bigger stronger swifter faster could outrun horses outfight lions bared teeth even men would run belly never empty long fur kept warm even wind blowing cold brothers sisters many fierce terrible would never leave

 nights full wolves days belonged dog sandor clegane made get every morning whether wanted would curse raspy voice yank feet shake dumped helm full cold water head bounced sputtering shivering tried kick laughed “dry feed bloody horses” told

 two stranger sorrel palfrey mare arya named craven sandor said she’d likely run twins they’d found wandering riderless field morning slaughter good enough horse arya could love coward stranger would fought still tended mare best knew better riding double hound craven might coward young strong well arya thought might able outrun stranger came

 hound longer watched closely sometimes seem care whether stayed went longer bound cloak night one night i’ll kill sleep told never one day i’ll ride away craven won’t able catch thought never either would go winterfell gone grandfather’s brother riverrun didn’t know knew maybe lady smallwood would take acorn hall maybe wouldn’t besides arya wasn’t even sure could find acorn hall sometimes thought might go back sharna’s inn floods hadn’t washed away could stay hot pie maybe lord beric would find anguy would teach use bow could ride gendry outlaw like wenda white fawn songs

 stupid like something sansa might dream hot pie gendry left soon could lord beric outlaws wanted ransom like hound none wanted around never pack even hot pie gendry stupid think stupid little girl wolf

 stayed hound rode every day never sleeping twice place avoiding towns villages castles best could asked sandor clegane going “away” said “that’s need know you’re worth spit don’t want hear whining let run bloody castle”

 “you have” agreed thinking mother

 “you’d dead ought thank ought sing pretty little song way sister did”

 “did hit axe too”

 “i hit flat axe stupid little bitch i’d hit blade there’d still chunks head floating green fork shut bloody mouth sense i’d give silent sisters cut tongues girls talk much”

 wasn’t fair say aside one time arya hardly talked whole days passed neither said anything empty talk hound angry could feel fury could see face way mouth would tighten twist looks gave whenever took axe chop wood fire would slide cold rage hacking savagely tree deadfall broken limb twenty times much kindling firewood they’d needed sometimes would sore tired afterward would lie go right sleep without even lighting fire arya hated happened hated nights stared longest axe looks awfully heavy bet could swing wouldn’t hit flat either

 sometimes wanderings glimpsed people farmers fields swineherds pigs milkmaid leading cow squire carrying message rutted road never wanted speak either lived distant land spoke queer alien tongue nothing

 besides wasn’t safe seen time time columns horsemen passed winding farm roads twin towers frey flying “hunting stray northmen” hound said passed “any time hear hooves get head fast it’s like friend”

 one day earthen hollow made roots fallen oak came face face another survivor twins badge breast showed pink maiden dancing swirl silk told ser marq piper’s man bowman though he’d lost bow left shoulder twisted swollen met arm blow mace said broken shoulder smashed chainmail deep flesh “a northman was” wept “his badge bloody man saw mine made jape red man pink maiden maybe get together drank lord bolton drank ser marq drank together lord edmure lady roslin king north killed me” eyes fever bright said arya could tell true shoulder swollen grotesquely pus blood stained whole left side stink smells like corpse man begged drink wine

 “if i’d wine i’d drunk myself” hound told “i give water gift mercy”

 archer looked long said “you’re joffrey’s dog “

 “my dog want water”

 “aye” man swallowed “and mercy please”

 passed small pond short ways back sandor gave arya helm told fill trudged back water’s edge mud squished toe boots used dog’s head pail water ran eyeholes bottom helm still held lot

 came back archer turned face poured water mouth gulped fast could pour couldn’t gulp ran cheeks brown blood crusted whiskers pale pink tears dangled beard water gone clutched helm licked steel “good” said “i wish wine though wanted wine”

 “me too” hound eased dagger man’s chest almost tenderly weight body driving point surcoat ringmail quilting beneath slid blade back wiped dead man looked arya “that’s heart girl that’s kill man”

 that’s one way “will bury him”

 “why” sandor said “he don’t care we’ve got spade leave wolves wild dogs brothers mine” gave hard look “first rob though”

 two silver stags archer’s purse almost thirty coppers dagger pretty pink stone hilt hound hefted knife hand flipped toward arya caught hilt slid belt felt little better wasn’t needle steel dead man quiver arrows arrows weren’t much good without bow boots big arya small hound left took kettle helm well even though came almost past nose tilt back see “he must horse well wouldn’t got away” clegane said peering “but it’s bloody well gone i’d say telling long he’s here”

 time found foothills mountains moon rains mostly stopped arya could see sun moon stars seemed heading eastward “where going” asked

 time hound answered “you aunt eyrie might she’ll want ransom scrawny arse though gods know find high road follow way bloody gate”

 aunt lysa thought left arya feeling empty mother wanted mother’s sister didn’t know mother’s sister knew great uncle blackfish gone castle didn’t really know mother dead robb either wasn’t like they’d seen die anything maybe lord frey taken captive maybe chained dungeon maybe freys taking king’s landing joffrey could chop heads didn’t know “we go back” suddenly decided “we go back twins get mother can’t dead help her”

 “i thought sister one head full songs” hound growled “frey might kept mother alive ransom that’s true there’s way seven hells i’m going pluck castle bloody self”

 “not i’d come too”

 made sound almost laugh “that scare piss old man”

 “you’re afraid die” said scornfully

 clegane laugh “death don’t scare fire quiet i’ll cut tongue save silent sisters bother it’s vale us”

 arya didn’t think he’d really cut tongue saying way pinkeye used say he’d beat bloody wasn’t going try sandor clegane pinkeye pinkeye didn’t cut people half hit axes even flat axes

 night went sleep thinking mother wondering kill hound sleep rescue lady catelyn closed eyes saw mother’s face back eyelids she’s close could almost smell her…

 …and could smell scent faint beneath smells beneath moss mud water stench rotting reeds rotting men padded slowly soft ground river’s edge lapped drink lifted head sniff sky grey thick cloud river green full floating things dead men clogged shallows still moving water pushed others washed banks brothers sisters swarmed around tearing rich ripe flesh

 crows screaming wolves filling air feathers blood hotter one sisters snapped one took flight caught wing made want crow wanted taste blood hear bones crunch teeth fill belly warm flesh instead cold hungry meat around knew could eat

 scent stronger pricked ears listened grumbles pack shriek angry crows whirr wings sound running water somewhere far could hear horses calls living men mattered scent mattered sniffed air saw something pale white drifting river turning brushed snag reeds bowed

 splashed noisily shallows threw deeper water legs churning current strong stronger swam following nose river smells rich wet smells pulled paddled sharp red whisper cold blood sweet cloying stench death chased often chased red deer trees end ran jaw closed around pale white arm shook make move death blood mouth tiring could pull body back shore dragged muddy bank one little brothers came prowling tongue lolling mouth snarl drive else would fed stop shake water fur white thing lay facedown mud dead flesh wrinkled pale cold blood trickling throat rise thought rise eat run us

 sound horses turned head men coming downwind smelled almost men horses flapping black yellow pink wings long shiny claws hand younger brothers bared teeth defend food they’d found snapped scattered way wild deer hares crows fled wolves wolves fled men abandoned cold white prize mud dragged ran felt shame

 morning came hound need shout arya shake awake woken change even watered horses broke fast silence sandor said “this thing mother…”

 “it doesn’t matter” arya said dull voice “i know she’s dead saw dream”

 hound looked long time nodded said rode toward mountains

 higher hills came upon tiny isolated village surrounded greygreen sentinels tall blue soldier pines clegane decided risk going “we need food” said “and roof heads they’re like know happened twins luck won’t know me”

 villagers building wooden palisade around homes saw breadth hound’s shoulders offered food shelter even coin work “if there’s wine well i’ll it” growled end settled ale drank sleep night

 dream selling arya lady arryn died hills though “there’s frost us snow high passes” village elder said “if don’t freeze starve shadowcats get cave bears there’s clans well burned men fearless since timett oneeye came back war half year ago gunthor son gurn led stone crows village eight miles took every woman every scrap grain killed half men steel good swords mail hauberks watch high road—the stone crows milk snakes sons mist might you’d take end they’d kill make daughter”

 i’m daughter arya might shouted hadn’t felt tired one’s daughter one arya weasel nan arry squab even lumpyhead girl ran dog day dreamed wolves night

 quiet village beds stuffed straw many lice food plain filling air smelled pines arya soon decided hated villagers cowards none would even look hound’s face least long women tried put dress make needlework weren’t lady smallwood none one girl took following village elder’s daughter age arya child cried skinned knee carried stupid cloth doll everywhere went doll made look like manatarms sort girl called ser soldier bragged kept safe “go away” arya told half hundred times “just leave be” wouldn’t though finally arya took doll away ripped open pulled rag stuffing belly finger “now really looks like soldier” said threw doll brook girl stopped pestering arya spent days grooming craven stranger walking woods sometimes would find stick practice needlework would remember happened twins smash tree broke

 “might stay awhile” hound told fortnight drunk ale brooding sleepy “we’d never reach eyrie freys still hunting survivors riverlands sounds like need swords clansmen raiding rest maybe find way get letter aunt” arya’s face darkened heard didn’t want stay nowhere go either next morning hound went chop trees haul logs crawled back bed

 work done tall wooden palisade finished village elder made plain place “come winter hard pressed feed own” explained “and you… man like brings blood him”

 sandor’s mouth tightened “so know am”

 “aye don’t get travelers that’s go market fairs know king joffrey’s dog”

 “when stone crows come calling might glad dog”

 “might be” man hesitated gathered courage “but say lost belly fighting blackwater say—”

 “i know say” sandor’s voice sounded like two woodsaws grinding together “pay we’ll gone”

 left hound pouch full coppers skin sour ale new sword old sword truth told though new swapped owner longaxe he’d taken twins one he’d used raise lump arya’s head ale gone less day clegane sharpened sword every night cursing man he’d swapped every nick spot rust lost belly fighting care sword sharp question arya dared ask thought lot he’d run twins carried

 back riverlands found rains ebbed away flood waters begun recede hound turned south back toward trident “we’ll make riverrun” told arya roasted hare he’d killed “maybe blackfish wants buy shewolf”

 “he doesn’t know won’t even know i’m really me” arya tired making riverrun making riverrun years seemed without ever getting every time made riverrun ended someplace worse “he won’t give ransom he’ll probably hang you”

 “he’s free try” turned spit

 doesn’t talk like he’s lost belly fighting “i know could go” arya said still one brother left jon want even one else he’ll call “little sister” muss hair long way though didn’t think could get hadn’t even able reach riverrun “we could go wall”

 sandor’s laugh half growl “the little wolf bitch wants join night’s watch she”

 “my brother’s wall” said stubbornly

 mouth gave twitch “the wall’s thousand leagues we’d need fight bloody freys reach neck there’s lizard lions swamps eat wolves every day breakfast reach north skins intact there’s ironborn half castles thousands bloody buggering northmen well”

 “are scared them” asked “have lost belly fighting”

 moment thought going hit hare brown though skin crackling grease popping dripped cookfire sandor took stick ripped apart big hands tossed half arya’s lap “there’s nothing wrong belly” said pulled leg “but don’t give rat’s arse brother brother too”





 tyrion


 “tyrion” ser kevan lannister said wearily “if indeed innocent joffrey’s death difficulty proving trial”

 tyrion turned window “who judge me”

 “justice belongs throne king dead father remains hand since son stands accused grandson victim asked lord tyrell prince oberyn sit judgment him”

 tyrion scarcely reassured mace tyrell joffrey’s goodfather however briefly red viper was… well snake “will allowed demand trial battle”

 “i would advise that”

 “why not” saved vale “answer uncle allowed trial battle champion prove innocence”

 “certainly wish however best know sister means name ser gregor clegane champion event trial”

 bitch checks moves make pity didn’t choose kettleblack bronn would make short work three brothers mountain rides kettle different color “i shall need sleep this” need speak bronn soon didn’t want think like cost bronn lofty notion skin worth “does cersei witnesses me”

 “more every day”

 “then must witnesses own”

 “tell would ser addam send watch bring trial”

 “i would sooner find myself”

 “you stand accused regicide kinslaying truly imagine allowed come go please” ser kevan waved table “you quill ink parchment write names witnesses require shall power produce word lannister shall leave tower except go trial”

 tyrion would demean begging “will permit squire come go boy podrick payne”

 “certainly wish shall send you”

 “do sooner would better later would better sooner” waddled writing table heard door open turned back said “uncle”

 ser kevan paused “yes”

 “i this”

 “i wish could believe tyrion”

 door closed tyrion lannister pulled chair sharpened quill pulled blank parchment speak dipped quill inkpot

 sheet still maiden podrick payne appeared sometime later “my lord” boy said

 tyrion put quill “find bronn bring tell there’s gold gold he’s ever dreamt see don’t return without him”

 “yes lord mean won’t return” went

 returned sunset moonrise tyrion fell asleep window seat wake stiff sore dawn serving man brought porridge apples break fast horn ale ate table blank parchment hour later serving man returned bowl “have seen squire” tyrion asked man shook head

 sighing turned back table dipped quill sansa wrote upon parchment sat staring name teeth clenched hard hurt

 assuming joffrey simply choked death bit food even tyrion found hard swallow sansa must poisoned joff practically put cup lap he’d given ample reason doubts tyrion might vanished wife one flesh one heart one soul mouth twisted wasted time proving much vows meant well expect dwarf

 yet… would sansa gotten poison could believe girl acted alone really want find would judges believe tyrion’s child bride poisoned king without husband’s knowledge wouldn’t cersei would insist done deed together

 even gave parchment uncle next day ser kevan frowned “lady sansa witness”

 “i think others time”

 “best think judges mean begin trial three days hence”

 “that’s soon shut guard find witnesses innocence”

 “your sister’s difficulty finding witnesses guilt” ser kevan rolled parchment “ser addam men hunting wife varys offered hundred stags word whereabouts hundred dragons girl girl found found shall bring see harm husband wife sharing cell giving comfort one another”

 “you kind seen squire”

 “i sent yesterday come”

 “he came” tyrion admitted “and went”

 “i shall send again”

 next morning podrick payne returned stepped inside room hesitantly fear written face bronn came behind sellsword knight wore jerkin studded silver heavy riding cloak pair finetooled leather gloves thrust swordbelt

 one look bronn’s face gave tyrion queasy feeling pit stomach “it took long enough”

 “the boy begged wouldn’t come expected castle stokeworth supper”

 “stokeworth” tyrion hopped bed “and pray stokeworth”

 “a bride” bronn smiled like wolf contemplating lost lamb “i’m wed lollys day next”

 “lollys” perfect bloody perfect lady tanda’s lackwit daughter gets knightly husband father sorts bastard belly ser bronn blackwater climbs another rung cersei’s stinking fingers “my bitch sister sold lame horse girl’s dimwitted”

 “if wanted wits i’d marry you”

 “lollys big another man’s child”

 “and pops i’ll get big mine”

 “she’s even heir stokeworth” tyrion pointed “she elder sister falyse married sister”

 “married ten years still barren” said bronn “her lord husband shuns bed it’s said prefers virgins”

 “he could prefer goats wouldn’t matter lands still pass wife lady tanda dies”

 “unless falyse die mother”

 tyrion wondered whether cersei notion sort serpent she’d given lady tanda suckle would care “why then”

 bronn shrugged “you told anyone ever asked sell you’d double price”

 yes “is two wives want two castles”

 “one would serve want kill gregor clegane best damned big castle”

 seven kingdoms full highborn maidens even oldest poorest ugliest spinster realm would balk wedding lowborn scum bronn unless soft body soft head fatherless child belly raped half hundred times lady tanda desperate find husband lollys even pursued tyrion time half king’s landing enjoyed doubt cersei sweetened offer somehow bronn knight made suitable match younger daughter minor house

 “i find woefully short castles highborn maidens moment” tyrion admitted “but offer gold gratitude before”

 “i gold buy gratitude”

 “you might surprised lannister pays debts”

 “your sister lannister too”

 “my lady wife heir winterfell emerge head still shoulders may one day rule north name could carve big piece it”

 “if might be” said bronn “and it’s bloody cold lollys soft warm close could poking two nights hence”

 “not prospect would relish”

 “is so” bronn grinned “admit imp given choice fucking lollys fighting mountain you’d breeches cock man could blink”

 knows bloody well tyrion tried different tack “i’d heard ser gregor wounded red fork duskendale wounds bound slow him”

 bronn looked annoyed “he never fast freakish big freakish strong i’ll grant he’s quicker you’d expect man size monstrous long reach doesn’t seem feel blows way normal man would”

 “does frighten much” asked tyrion hoping provoke

 “if didn’t frighten i’d bloody fool” bronn gave shrug “might could take dance around tired hacking couldn’t lift sword get feet somehow they’re flat backs don’t matter tall even it’s chancy one misstep i’m dead risk like well enough ugly little whoreson are… fight battle lose either way either mountain spills guts kill lose stokeworth sell sword don’t give away i’m bloody brother”

 “no” said tyrion sadly “you’re not” waved hand “begone run stokeworth lady lollys may find joy marriage bed ever found mine”

 bronn hesitated door “what imp”

 “kill gregor won’t make jolly song”

 “i hope hear sing it” bronn grinned one last time walked door castle life

 pod shuffled feet “i’m sorry”

 “why fault bronn’s insolent blackhearted rogue he’s always insolent blackhearted rogue that’s liked him” tyrion poured cup wine took window seat outside day grey rainy prospect still cheerful could send podrick payne questing shagga supposed many hiding places deep kingswood outlaws often evaded capture decades pod sometimes difficulty finding kitchens send cheese timett son timett would likely back mountains moon despite he’d told bronn going ser gregor clegane person would bigger farce joffrey’s jousting dwarfs intend die gales laughter ringing ears much trial combat

 ser kevan paid another call later day day sansa found uncle informed politely fool ser dontos who’d vanished night tyrion witnesses wished summon bloody well prove didn’t poison wine thousand people saw fill joff’s cup

 sleep night

 instead lay dark staring canopy counting ghosts saw tysha smiling kissed saw sansa naked shivering fear saw joffrey clawing throat blood running neck face turned black saw cersei’s eyes bronn’s wolfish smile shae’s wicked grin even thought shae could arouse fondled thinking perhaps woke cock satisfied might rest easily afterward good

 dawn time trial begin

 ser kevan came morning ser addam marbrand dozen gold cloaks tyrion broken fast boiled eggs burned bacon fried bread dressed finest “ser addam” said “i thought father might send kingsguard escort trial still member royal family not”

 “you lord fear kingsguard stand witness lord tywin felt would proper serve guards”

 “gods forbid anything improper please lead on”

 tried throne room joffrey died ser addam marched towering bronze doors long carpet felt eyes upon hundreds crowded see judged least hoped come know they’re witnesses spied queen margaery gallery pale beautiful mourning twice wed twice widowed sixteen mother stood tall one side grandmother small ladies waiting father’s household knights packing rest gallery

 dais still stood beneath empty iron throne though one table removed behind sat stout lord mace tyrell gold mantle green slender prince oberyn martell flowing robes striped orange yellow scarlet lord tywin lannister sat perhaps there’s hope yet dornishman highgardener despised find way use that…

 high septon began prayer asking father guide justice done father leaned forward say “tyrion kill king joffrey”

 would waste heartbeat “no”

 “well that’s relief” said oberyn martell dryly

 “did sansa stark then” lord tyrell demanded

 would i’d yet wherever sansa whatever part might remained wife wrapped cloak protection shoulders though he’d stand fool’s back “the gods killed joffrey choked pigeon pie”

 lord tyrell reddened “you would blame bakers”

 “them pigeons leave it” tyrion heard nervous laughter knew he’d made mistake guard tongue little fool digs grave

 “there witnesses you” lord tywin said “we shall hear first may present witnesses speak leave”

 naught tyrion could nod

 ser addam told true first man ushered ser balon swann kingsguard “lord hand” began high septon sworn speak truth “i honor fight beside son bridge ships brave man size believe thing”

 murmur went hall tyrion wondered mad game cersei playing offer witness believes innocent soon learned ser balon spoke reluctantly pulled tyrion away joffrey day riot “he strike grace that’s fit wroth summer storm mob near killed us all”

 “in days targaryens man struck one blood royal would lose hand struck with” observed red viper dorne “did dwarf regrow little hand white swords forget duty”

 “he blood royal himself” ser balon answered “and king’s hand beside”

 “no” lord tywin said “he acting hand stead”

 ser meryn trant pleased expand ser balon’s account took place witness “he knocked king ground began kicking shouted unjust grace escaped unharmed mobs”

 tyrion began grasp sister’s plan began man known honest milked would give every witness follow tell worse tale seem bad maegor cruel aerys mad together pinch aegon unworthy spice

 ser meryn went relate tyrion stopped joffrey’s chastisement sansa stark “the dwarf asked grace knew happened aerys targaryen ser boros spoke defense king imp threatened killed”

 blount came next echo sorry tale whatever mislike ser boros might harbor toward cersei dismissing kingsguard said words wanted

 tyrion could longer hold tongue “tell judges joffrey don’t you”

 big jowly man glared “you told savages kill opened mouth that’s i’ll tell them”

 “tyrion” lord tywin said “you speak call upon take warning”

 tyrion subsided seething

 kettleblacks came next three turn osney osfryd told tale supper cersei battle blackwater threats he’d made

 “he told grace meant harm” said ser osfryd “to hurt her” brother osney elaborated “he said would wait day happy make joy turn ashes mouth” neither mentioned alayaya

 ser osmund kettleblack vision chivalry immaculate scale armor white wool cloak swore king joffrey long known uncle tyrion meant murder “it day gave white cloak lords” told judges “that brave boy said ‘good ser osmund guard well uncle loves means king place’”

 oh good thought tyrion savagely farce trial execution almost come relief

 night sat window drinking heard voices outside door ser kevan come answer thought uncle entered

 tyrion rose give prince oberyn mocking bow “are judges permitted visit accused”

 “princes permitted go told guards” red viper took seat

 “my father displeased you”

 “the happiness tywin lannister never high list concerns dornish wine you’re drinking”

 “from arbor”

 oberyn made face “red water poison him”

 “no you”

 prince smiled “do dwarfs tongues like someone going cut one days”

 “you first tell perhaps cut seems make end trouble”

 “so i’ve seen think may drink lord redwyne’s grape juice all”

 “as like” tyrion served cup

 man took sip sloshed mouth swallowed “it serve moment send strong dornish wine morrow” took another sip “i turned goldenhaired whore hoping for”

 “so found chataya’s”

 “at chataya’s bedded blackskinned girl alayaya believe called exquisite despite stripes back whore referred sister”

 “has seduced yet” tyrion asked unsurprised

 oberyn laughed aloud “no meet price queen even hinted marriage grace needs another husband better prince dorne ellaria believes accept thought cersei bed makes wet randy wench even need pay dwarf’s penny sister requires one head somewhat overlarge missing nose”

 “and” said tyrion waiting

 way answer prince oberyn swirled wine said “when young dragon conquered dorne long ago left lord highgarden rule us submission sunspear tyrell moved tail keep keep chasing rebels making certain knees stayed bent would arrive force take castle stay moon’s turn ride next castle custom turn lords chambers take beds one night found beneath heavy velvet canopy sash hung near pillows wish summon wench taste dornish women lord tyrell blame pulled upon sash canopy split open hundred red scorpions fell upon head death lit fire soon swept across dorne undoing young dragon’s victories fortnight kneeling men stood free again”

 “i know tale” said tyrion “what it”

 “just ever find sash beside bed pull would sooner scorpions fall upon queen naked beauty”

 tyrion grinned “we much common then”

 “to sure much thank sister accusation feast might well judging instead judging you” prince’s eyes dark amusement “who knows poison red viper dorne better reason want keep tyrells far crown joffrey grave dornish law iron throne pass next sister myrcella happens betrothed mine nephew thanks you”

 “dornish law apply” tyrion ensnared troubles he’d never stopped consider succession “my father crown tommen count that”

 “he may indeed crown tommen king’s landing say brother may crown myrcella sunspear father make war niece behalf nephew sister” gave shrug “perhaps marry queen cersei condition support daughter son think would”

 never tyrion wanted say word caught throat cersei always resented excluded power account sex dornish law applied west would heir casterly rock right jaime twins cersei come first world took championing myrcella’s cause would championing “i know sister would choose tommen myrcella” admitted “it makes matter father never give choice”

 “your father” said prince oberyn “may live forever”

 something way said made hairs back tyrion’s neck bristle suddenly mindful elia oberyn said crossed field ashes wants head spoke words hand swung sword “it wise speak treasons red keep prince little birds listening”

 “let treason say man mortal valar morghulis said valyria old men must die doom came proved true” dornishman went window gaze night “it said witnesses us”

 “i hoping one look sweet face mine would enough persuade innocence”

 “you mistaken lord fat flower highgarden quite convinced guilt determined see die precious margaery drinking chalice reminded us half hundred times”

 “and you” said tyrion

 “men seldom appear look guilty convinced innocence still likely condemned justice short supply side mountains none elia aegon rhaenys perhaps joffrey’s real killer eaten bear seems happen quite often king’s landing oh wait bear harrenhal remember”

 “is game playing” tyrion rubbed scarred nose nothing lose telling oberyn truth “there bear harrenhal kill ser amory lorch”

 “how sad him” said red viper “and noseless men lie badly wonder”

 “i lying ser amory dragged princess rhaenys father’s bed stabbed death menatarms know names” leaned forward “it ser gregor clegane smashed prince aegon’s head wall raped sister elia blood brains still hands”

 “what truth lannister” oberyn smiled coldly “your father gave commands yes”

 “no” spoke lie without hesitation never stopped ask

 dornishman raised one thin black eyebrow “such dutiful son feeble lie lord tywin presented sister’s children king robert wrapped crimson lannister cloaks”

 “perhaps ought discussion father rock still young thought thing legs good pissing”

 “yes difficulty would say innocence may plain scar face save father will” dornish prince smiled “but might”

 “you” tyrion studied “you one judge three could save me”

 “not judge champion”

 ser meryn answered “the king’s family bride’s family grand maester pycelle high septon…”

 “there’s poisoner” suggested ser oswald kettleblack sly grin “too holy half old man never liked look o’ myself” laughed

 “no” knight flowers said unamused “sansa stark poisoner forget sister drinking chalice well sansa stark person hall reason want margaery dead well king poisoning wedding cup could hope kill run afterward unless guilty”

 boy makes sense tyrion might yet innocent one closer finding girl however perhaps jaime look start would good know gotten castle varys may notion two one knew red keep better eunuch

 “aye command lord”

 “dismissed” left jaime turned ser balon swann “ser balon watched tilt many time fought mêlées i’m told proved valor hundred times battle blackwater kingsguard honored presence”

 “my father old man lord well past forty fighting days done”

 “and brother”

 “donnel wounded battle yielded ser elwood harte ransomed afterward pledged fealty king joffrey many captives”

 “so did” said jaime “even so… renly stannis joffrey tommen come omit balon greyjoy robb stark might first knight realm swear fealty six kings”

 ser balon’s unease plain “donnel erred tommen’s man word”

 “it’s ser donnel constant concerns it’s you” jaime leaned forward “what brave ser donnel gives sword yet another usurper one day comes storming throne room stand white king blood do”

 “i… lord never happen”

 “and you’re older” boy said “my lord”

 laugh absurd tyrion would mock unmercifully could hear comparing cocks green boy “older wiser ser learn me”

 “as learned ser boros ser meryn”

 “dead men every one”

 he’s jaime realized suddenly speaking cocksure arrogance empty chivalry good young

 swordfight sometimes best try different stroke “it’s said fought magnificently battle… almost well lord renly’s ghost beside sworn brother secrets lord commander tell ser wearing renly’s armor”

 moment loras tyrell looked though might refuse end remembered vows “my brother” said sullenly “renly taller broader chest armor loose suited garlan well”

 “was masquerade notion his”

 “lord littlefinger suggested said would frighten stannis’s ignorant menatarms”

 “and did” knights lordlings “well gave singers something make rhymes suppose that’s despised renly”

 “i buried mine hands place showed squire storm’s end one shall ever find disturb rest” looked jaime defiantly “i defend king tommen strength swear give life need never betray renly word deed king best them”

 best dressed perhaps jaime thought say arrogance gone ser loras moment began speak renly answered truly proud reckless full piss false yet “as say one thing may return duties”

 “yes lord”

 “i still brienne tarth tower cell”

 “yes” jaime prompted sensing doubt

 “the gorget cut one clean stroke steel gorget renly’s armor best finest steel could tried possible she’s freakish strong woman even mountain would needed heavy axe armor cut throat” gave jaime confused look “if though… could shadow”

 “ask her” jaime came decision “go cell ask questions hear answers still convinced murdered lord renly see answers choice accuse release ask judge fairly honor knight”

 jon


 day night axes rang

 jon could remember last time slept closed eyes dreamed fighting woke fought even king’s tower could hear ceaseless thunk bronze flint stolen steel biting wood louder tried rest warming shed atop wall mance sledgehammers work well long saws teeth bone flint drifting exhausted sleep came great cracking haunted forest sentinel tree came crashing cloud dirt needles

 awake owen came lying restless pile furs floor warming shed “lord snow” said owen shaking shoulder “the dawn” gave jon hand help pull back onto feet others waking well jostling one another pulled boots buckled swordbelts close confines shed one spoke tired talk ever left wall days took long ride cage castle black abandoned maester aemon ser wynton stout others old ill fight

 “i dream king come” owen said happily “maester aemon sent raven king robert came strength dreamed saw golden banners”

 jon made smile “that would welcome sight see owen” ignoring twinge pain leg swept black fur cloak shoulders gathered crutch went onto wall face another day

 gust wind sent icy tendrils wending long brown hair half mile north wildling encampments stirring campfires sending smoky fingers scratch pale dawn sky along edge forest raised tents hide fur even crude longhall logs woven branches horselines east mammoths west men everywhere sharpening swords putting points crude spears donning makeshift armor hide horn bone every man could see jon knew score unseen wood brush gave shelter elements hid eyes hated crows

 sooner tyrion taken place judges another group gold cloaks led shae

 cold hand tightened round heart varys betrayed thought remembered betrayed left lollys course they’d question sansa’s maids i’d tyrion rubbed slick scar nose wondering cersei bothered shae knows nothing hurt

 “they plotted together” said girl he’d loved “the imp lady sansa plotted young wolf died sansa wanted revenge brother tyrion meant throne going kill sister next lord father could hand prince tommen year tommen got old would killed take crown head”

 “how could know this” demanded prince oberyn “why would imp divulge plans wife’s maid”

 “i overheard m’lord” said shae “and m’lady let things slip lips wasn’t lady sansa’s maid whore time king’s landing morning wedding dragged keep dragon skulls fucked monsters around cried said ought grateful wasn’t every girl got king’s whore told meant king said poor boy joffrey would never know bride way knowing me” started sobbing “i never meant whore m’lords married squire good brave boy gentle born imp saw green fork put boy meant marry front rank van killed sent wildlings bring tent shagga big one timett burned eye said didn’t pleasure he’d give brought city i’d close wanted made shameful things…”

 prince oberyn looked curious “what sorts things”

 “unspeakable things” tears rolled slowly pretty face doubt every man hall wanted take shae arms comfort “with mouth and… parts m’lord parts used every way and… used make tell big giant call giant lannister”

 “nothing sort” said tyrion “of joffrey’s death innocent guilty monstrous crime” took step toward father “i born lived guilty dwarf confess matter many times good father forgave persisted infamy”

 “this folly tyrion” declared lord tywin “speak matter hand trial dwarf”

 “that err lord trial dwarf entire life”

 lord tywin’s face dark half heartbeat tyrion wondered he’d drunk poisoned wine well slammed fist table angry speak mace tyrell turned tyrion asked question “do champion defend innocence”

 “he lord” prince oberyn dorne rose feet “the dwarf quite convinced me”

 night surprisingly tyrion lannister slept long deep rose first light well rested hearty appetite broke fast fried bread blood sausage applecakes double helping eggs cooked onions fiery dornish peppers begged leave guards attend champion ser addam gave consent

 tyrion found prince oberyn drinking cup red wine donned armor attended four younger dornish lordlings “good morrow lord” prince said “will take cup wine”

 “should drinking battle”

 “i always drink battle”

 “that could get killed worse could get killed”

 prince oberyn laughed “the gods defend innocent innocent trust”

 “only killing joffrey” tyrion admitted “i hope know face gregor clegane is—”

 “—large heard”

 “he almost eight feet tall must weigh thirty stone muscle fights twohanded greatsword needs one hand wield known cut men half single blow armor heavy lesser man could bear weight let alone move it”

 prince oberyn unimpressed “i killed large men trick get feet go they’re dead” dornishman sounded blithely confident tyrion felt almost reassured turned said “daemon spear” ser daemon tossed red viper snatched air

 “you mean face mountain spear” made tyrion uneasy battle ranks massed spears made formidable front single combat skilled swordsman different matter

 “we fond spears dorne besides way counter reach look lord imp see touch” spear turned ash eight feet long shaft smooth thick heavy last two feet steel slender leafshaped spearhead narrowing wicked spike edges looked sharp enough shave oberyn spun haft palms hand glistened black oil poison tyrion decided would sooner know “i hope good that” said doubtfully

 “plan lengthy visit” prince oberyn sipped wine “you doran many matters mutual interest discuss music trade history wine dwarf’s penny… laws inheritance succession doubt uncle’s counsel would benefit queen myrcella trying times ahead”

 varys little birds listening oberyn giving ripe earful “i believe cup wine” said tyrion queen myrcella would tempting sansa tucked beneath cloak declared myrcella tommen would north follow red viper hinting treason could tyrion truly take arms tommen father cersei would spit blood might worth alone

 “which offer took outrage”

 “it even see surely”

 “oh surely” goes back back tyrion thought mothers fathers puppets dancing strings came us one day children take strings dance steads “well prince rhaegar married elia dorne cersei lannister casterly rock would seem mother tilt”

 “she thought so” prince oberyn agreed “but father man forget slights taught lesson lord lady tarbeck reynes castamere king’s landing taught sister helm dagos” manwoody handed high golden helm copper disk mounted brow sun dorne visor removed tyrion saw “elia children waited long justice” prince oberyn pulled soft red leather gloves took spear “but day shall it”

 dany broke fast persimmon tree grew terrace garden watching dragons chase apex great pyramid huge bronze harpy stood meereen score lesser pyramids none stood even half tall could see whole city narrow twisty alleys wide brick streets temples granaries hovels palaces brothels baths gardens fountains great red circles fighting pits beyond walls pewter sea winding skahazadhan dry brown hills burnt orchards blackened fields garden dany sometimes felt like god living atop highest mountain world

 “how many” one old woman asked sobbing “how many must spare us”

 “one hundred sixtythree” answered

 nailed wooden posts around plaza man pointing next anger fierce hot inside gave command made feel like avenging dragon later passed men dying posts heard moans smelled bowels blood…

 “noble ghael” said missandei dialect astapor “is cleon owned grazdan mo ullhor”

 voice guileless yet question plainly made envoy anxious “the same” admitted “a great man”

 missandei leaned close dany “he butcher grazdan’s kitchen” girl whispered ear “it said could slaughter pig faster man astapor”

 given astapor butcher king dany felt ill knew must let envoy see “i pray king cleon rules well wisely would me”

 ghael rubbed mouth “perhaps speak privily grace”

 “i secrets captains commanders”

 “a marriage me”

 ghael smiled teeth brown rotten “great cleon give many strong sons”

 dany found bereft words little missandei came rescue “did first wife give sons”

 “my queen” daario stepped forward “the riverside full meereenese begging leave allowed sell qartheen thicker flies”

 dany shocked “they want slaves”

 “the ones come well spoken gently born sweet queen slaves prized free cities tutors scribes bed slaves even healers priests sleep soft beds eat rich foods dwell manses lost live fear squalor”

 “i see” perhaps shocking tales astapor true dany thought moment “any man wishes sell slavery may woman” raised hand “but may sell children man wife”

 “in astapor city took tenth part price time slave changed hands” missandei told

 “we’ll same” dany decided wars gold much swords “a tenth part gold silver coin ivory meereen need saffron cloves zorse hides”

 “some truths hard hear robert a… good knight… chivalrous brave… spared life lives many others… prince viserys boy would years fit rule and… forgive queen asked truth… even child brother viserys oft seemed father’s son ways rhaegar never did”

 “his father’s son” dany frowned “what mean”

 old knight blink “your father called ‘the mad king’ westeros one ever told you”

 “viserys did” mad king “the usurper called usurper dogs” mad king “it lie”

 “why ask truth” ser barristan said softly “if close ears it” hesitated continued “i told used false name lannisters would know i’d joined less half grace truth wanted watch time pledging sword make certain not…”

 “…my father’s daughter” father’s daughter

 “…mad” finished “but see taint you”

 “taint” dany bristled

 “i maester quote history grace swords life books every child knows targaryens always danced close madness father first king jaehaerys told madness greatness two sides coin every time new targaryen born said gods toss coin air world holds breath see land”

 jaehaerys old man knew grandfather thought gave pause knew westeros come brother rest ser jorah ser barristan would forgotten two ever known man tell came “so coin hands god saying ser”

 “no” ser barristan replied “you trueborn heir westeros end days shall remain faithful knight find worthy bear sword content serve strong belwas squire”

 “what decide you’re worthy fool” dany asked scornfully “or perhaps cook”

 “i would honored grace” selmy said quiet dignity “i bake apples boil beef well man i’ve roasted many duck campfire hope like greasy charred skin bloody bones”

 “all spied sold enemies”

 “for time” said grudgingly “i stopped”

 “when stop”

 “i made one report qarth but—”

 “from qarth” dany hoping ended much earlier “what write qarth man wanted schemes” ser jorah could meet eyes “when khal drogo died asked go yi ti jade sea wish robert’s”

 “that protect you” insisted “to keep away knew snakes were…”

 “snakes ser” something unspeakable occurred “you told carrying drogo’s child…”

 “khaleesi…”

 “do think deny ser” ser barristan said sharply “i eunuch told council robert decreed grace child must die source ser even talk might deed pardon”

 “a lie” ser jorah’s face darkened “i would never… daenerys stopped drinking wine”

 “your grace slavers brought doom themselves” said daario naharis

 “you brought freedom well” missandei pointed

 jaime


 king sat head table stack cushions arse signing document presented

 “only grace” ser kevan lannister assured “this bill attainder lord edmure tully stripping riverrun lands incomes rebelling lawful king similar attainder uncle ser brynden tully blackfish” tommen signed one dipping quill carefully writing name broad childish hand

 jaime watched foot table thinking lords aspired seat king’s small council bloody well mine power taste like tedium feel especially powerful watching tommen dip quill inkpot felt bored

 sore every muscle body ached ribs shoulders bruised battering they’d gotten courtesy ser addam marbrand thinking made wince could hope man would keep mouth shut jaime known marbrand since boy serving page casterly rock trusted much trusted anyone enough ask take shields tourney swords wanted know could fight left hand

 knowledge painful beating ser addam given beating bad could hardly dress morning fighting earnest jaime would died two dozen deaths seemed simple changing hands wasn’t every instinct wrong think everything he’d moved thinking marbrand thumping left hand couldn’t even seem hold longsword properly ser addam disarmed thrice sending blade spinning

 “this grants said lands incomes castle ser emmon frey lady wife lady genna” ser kevan presented another sheaf parchments king tommen dipped signed “this decree legitimacy natural son lord roose bolton dreadfort names lord bolton warden north” tommen dipped signed dipped signed “this grants ser rolph spicer title castle castamere raises rank lord” tommen scrawled name

 gone ser ilyn payne jaime reflected king’s justice friend marbrand might well beat bloody… without tongue like boast afterward would take would one chance remark ser addam cups whole world would soon know useless he’d become lord commander kingsguard cruel jape that… though quite cruel gift father sent

 “this royal pardon lord gawen westerling lady wife daughter jeyne welcoming back king’s peace” ser kevan said “this pardon lord jonos bracken stone hedge pardon lord vance lord goodbrook lord mooton maidenpool”

 jaime pushed feet “you seem matters well hand uncle shall leave grace you”

 “as wish” ser kevan rose well “jaime go father breach you—”

 “—is mend sending mocking gifts tell pry away tyrells long enough”

 uncle looked distressed “the gift heartfelt thought might encourage you—”

 “—to grow new hand” jaime turned tommen though joffrey’s golden curls green eyes new king shared little else late brother inclined plumpness face pink round even liked read still shy nine son mine boy man would seven years tommen ruling right realm would remain firmly hands lord grandfather “sire” asked “do leave go”

 “as like ser uncle” tommen looked back ser kevan “can seal greatuncle” pressing royal seal hot wax favorite part king far

 jaime strode council chamber outside door found ser meryn trant standing stiff guard white scale armor snowy cloak one learn feeble kettleblack blount hear it… “remain grace done” said “then escort back maegor’s”

 trant inclined head “as say lord”

 outer ward crowded noisy morning jaime made stables large group men saddling horses “steelshanks” called “are then”

 “as soon m’lady mounted” said steelshanks walton “my lord bolton expects us now”

 groom led fine grey mare stable door back mounted skinny holloweyed girl wrapped heavy cloak grey like dress beneath trimmed white satin clasp pinned breast wrought shape wolf’s head slitted opal eyes girl’s long brown hair blew wild wind pretty face thought eyes sad wary

 saw inclined head “ser jaime” said thin anxious voice “you kind see off”

 jaime studied closely “you know then”

 bit lip “you may recall lord littler then… honor meet winterfell king robert came visit father lord eddard” lowered big brown eyes mumbled “i’m arya stark”

 jaime never paid much attention arya stark seemed girl older “i understand you’re married”

 “i wed lord bolton’s son ramsay used snow grace made bolton say he’s brave happy”

 sound frightened “i wish joy lady” jaime turned back steelshanks “you coin promised”

 “aye we’ve shared thanks” northman grinned “a lannister always pays debts”

 “always” said jaime last glance girl wondered much resemblance mattered real arya stark buried unmarked grave flea bottom likelihood brothers dead parents would dare name one fraud “good speed” told steelshanks nage raised peace banner northmen formed column ragged fur cloaks trotted castle gate thin girl grey mare looked small forlorn midst

 horses still shied away dark splotch hardpacked ground earth drunk life’s blood stableboy gregor clegane killed clumsily sight made jaime angry told kingsguard keep crowd way oaf ser boros let distracted duel fool boy shared blame sure dead dornishman well clegane blow took boy’s arm mischance second cut…

 well gregor paying grand maester pycelle tending man’s wounds howls heard ringing maester’s chambers suggested healing going well might “the flesh mortifies wounds ooze pus” pycelle told council “even maggots touch foulness convulsions violent gag prevent biting tongue cut away much tissue dare treated rot boiling wine bread mold avail veins arm turning black leeched leeches died lords must know malignant substance prince oberyn used spear let us detain dornishmen forthcoming”

 lord tywin refused “there trouble enough sunspear prince oberyn’s death mean make matters worse holding companions captive”

 “then fear ser gregor may die”

 “undoubtedly swore much letter sent prince doran brother’s body must seen sword king’s justice slays poisoned spear heal him”

 grand maester pycelle blinked dismay “my lord—”

 “heal him” lord tywin said vexed “you aware lord varys sent fishermen waters around dragonstone report token force remains defend island lyseni gone bay great part lord stannis’s strength them”

 “well good” announced pycelle “let stannis rot lys say well rid man ambitions”

 “did turn utter fool tyrion shaved beard stannis baratheon man fight bitter end gone mean intends resume war likely land storm’s end try rouse storm lords he’s finished bolder man might roll dice dorne win sunspear cause might prolong war years offend martells reason dornishmen free go heal ser gregor”

 mountain screamed day night lord tywin lannister could cow even stranger would seem

 jaime climbed winding steps white sword tower could hear ser boros snoring cell ser balon’s door shut well king tonight would sleep day aside blount’s snores tower quiet suited jaime well enough ought rest last night dance ser addam he’d sore sleep

 stepped bedchamber found sister waiting

 stood beside open window looking curtain walls sea bay wind swirled around flattening gown body way quickened jaime’s pulse white gown like hangings wall draperies bed swirls tiny emeralds brightened ends wide sleeves spiraled bodice larger emeralds set golden spiderweb bound golden hair gown cut low bare shoulders tops breasts beautiful wanted nothing take arms

 “cersei” closed door softly “why here”

 “where else could go” turned tears eyes “father’s made clear longer wanted council jaime won’t talk him”

 jaime took cloak hung peg wall “i talk lord tywin every day”

 “must stubborn wants…”

 “…is force kingsguard send back casterly rock”

 “that need terrible sending back casterly rock well wants far away he’ll free hand tommen tommen son his”

 “tommen king”

 “he boy frightened little boy saw brother murdered wedding telling must marry girl twice age twice widow”

 eased chair trying ignore ache bruised muscles “the tyrells insisting see harm tommen’s lonely since myrcella went dorne likes margaery ladies let wed”

 “he son…”

 “he seed he’s never called father joffrey ever warned thousand times never show undue interest them”

 “to keep safe well would looked brother played father king’s children even robert might grown suspicious”

 “well he’s beyond suspicion now” robert’s death still left bitter taste jaime’s mouth killed cersei “i wished he’d died hands” still two “if i’d let kingslaying become habit liked say could taken wife world see i’m ashamed loving things i’ve done hide boy winterfell…”

 “did tell throw window you’d gone hunting begged nothing would happened could wait returned city”

 “i’d waited long enough hated watching robert stumble bed every night always wondering maybe night he’d decide claim rights husband” jaime suddenly remembered something else troubled winterfell “at riverrun catelyn stark seemed convinced i’d sent footpad slit son’s throat i’d given dagger”

 “that” said scornfully “tyrion asked that”

 “there dagger scars lady catelyn’s hands real enough showed you…”

 “oh don’t absurd” cersei closed window “yes hoped boy would die even robert thought would best ‘we kill horses break leg dogs go blind weak give mercy crippled children’ told blind time drink”

 robert jaime guarded king long enough know robert baratheon said things cups would denied angrily next day “were alone robert said this”

 “you don’t think said ned stark hope course alone us children” cersei removed hairnet draped bedpost shook golden curls “perhaps myrcella sent man dagger think so”

 meant mockery she’d cut right heart jaime saw “not myrcella joffrey”

 cersei frowned “joffrey love robb stark younger boy nothing child  “

 “a child hungry pat head sot let believe father” uncomfortable thought “tyrion almost died bloody dagger knew whole thing joffrey’s work might why…”

 “i don’t care why” cersei said “he take reasons hell seen joff died… fought jaime fought every breath malign spirit hands throat terror eyes… little he’d run scared hurt would protect night nothing could tyrion murdered front nothing could do” cersei sank knees chair took jaime’s good hand “joff dead myrcella’s dorne tommen’s left mustn’t let father take jaime please”

 “lord tywin asked approval talk listen…”

 “he agree leave kingsguard”

 “i’m leaving kingsguard”

 sister fought back tears “jaime you’re shining knight cannot abandon need stealing son sending away… unless stop father going force wed again”

 jaime surprised words blow gut harder ser addam marbrand dealt “who”

 “does matter lord someone father thinks needs don’t care another husband man want bed ever again”

 “then tell that”

 pulled hands away “you talking madness would us ripped apart mother time caught us playing tommen would lose throne myrcella marriage… want wife belong never jaime brother sister”

 “the targaryens…”

 “we targaryens”

 “quiet” said scornfully “so loud you’ll wake sworn brothers can’t people might learn come see me”

 “jaime” sobbed “don’t think want much makes matter wed want side want bed want inside nothing changed us let prove you” pushed tunic began fumble laces breeches

 jaime felt responding “no” said “not here” never done white sword tower much less lord commander’s chambers “cersei place”

 “you took sept different” drew cock bent head

 jaime pushed away stump right hand “no said” forced stand

 instant could see confusion bright green eyes fear well rage replaced cersei gathered together got feet straightened skirts “was hand hacked harrenhal manhood” shook head hair tumbled around bare white shoulders “i fool come lacked courage avenge joffrey would think you’d protect tommen tell imp killed three children would made wroth”

 “tyrion going harm tommen myrcella still certain killed joffrey”

 mouth twisted anger “how say threats—”

 “threats mean nothing swears it”

 “oh swears dwarfs don’t lie think”

 “not would”

 “you great golden fool he’s lied thousand times i” bound hair scooped hairnet bedpost she’d hung “think little monster black cell soon ser ilyn head perhaps you’d like keepsake” glanced pillow “he watch sleep alone cold white bed eyes rot is”

 “you best go cersei you’re making angry”

 “oh angry cripple terrifying” laughed “a pity lord tywin lannister never son could heir wanted lacked cock speaking best tuck away brother looks rather sad small hanging breeches like that”

 gone jaime took advice fumbling onehanded laces felt bonedeep ache phantom fingers i’ve lost hand father son sister lover soon enough lose brother yet keep telling house lannister war

 jaime donned cloak went downstairs found ser boros blount cup wine common room “when you’re done drink tell ser loras i’m ready see her”

 ser boros much coward much glower “you ready see who”

 “just tell loras”

 “aye” ser boros drained cup “aye lord commander”

 took good time though else knight flowers proved hard find several hours passed time arrived slim handsome youth big ugly maid jaime sitting alone round room leafing idly white book “lord commander” ser loras said “you wished see maid tarth”

 “i did” jaime waved closer left hand “you talked take it”

 “as commanded lord”

 “and”

 lad tensed “i… may happened says ser stannis cannot certain”

 “varys tells castellan storm’s end perished strangely well” said jaime

 “ser cortnay penrose” said brienne sadly “a good man”

 “a stubborn man one day stood square way king dragonstone next leapt tower” jaime stood “ser loras talk later may leave brienne me”

 wench looked ugly awkward ever decided tyrell left someone dressed woman’s clothes dress fit much better hideous pink rag goat made wear “blue good color lady” jaime observed “it goes well eyes” astonishing eyes

 brienne glanced flustered “septa donyse padded bodice give shape said sent me” lingered door meant flee second “you look…”

 “different” managed halfsmile “more meat ribs fewer lice hair that’s stump’s close door come here”

 bid “the white cloak…”

 “…is new i’m sure i’ll soil soon enough”

 “that wasn’t… say becomes you”

 came closer hesitant “jaime mean told ser loras about… king renly shadow”

 jaime shrugged “i would killed renly we’d met battle care cut throat”

 “you said honor…”

 “i’m bloody kingslayer remember say honor that’s like whore vouchsafing maidenhood” leaned back looked “steelshanks way back north deliver arya stark roose bolton”

 “you gave him” cried dismayed “you swore oath lady catelyn…”

 “with sword throat never mind lady catelyn’s dead could give back daughters even girl father sent steelshanks arya stark”

 “not arya stark”

 “you heard lord father found skinny northern girl less age less coloring dressed white grey gave silver wolf pin cloak sent wed bolton’s bastard” lifted stump point “i wanted tell went galloping rescue got killed good purpose you’re half bad sword you’re good enough take two hundred men yourself”

 brienne shook head “when lord bolton learns father paid false coin…”

 “oh knows lannisters lie remember makes matter girl serves purpose well going say isn’t arya stark everyone girl close dead except sister disappeared”

 “why would tell it’s true betraying father’s secrets”

 hand’s secrets thought longer father “i pay debts like every good little lion promise lady stark daughters… one still alive brother may know isn’t saying cersei convinced sansa helped murder joffrey”

 wench’s mouth got stubborn “i believe gentle girl poisoner lady catelyn said loving heart brother trial ser loras said”

 “two trials actually words swords failed bloody mess watch window”

 “my cell faces sea heard shouting though”

 “prince oberyn dorne dead ser gregor clegane lies dying tyrion stands condemned eyes gods men they’re keeping black cell till kill him”

 brienne looked “you believe it”

 jaime gave hard smile “see wench know well tyrion’s wanted since took first step he’d never follow kingslaying sansa stark killed joffrey brother’s kept silent protect gets fits gallantry time time last one cost nose time mean head”

 “no” brienne said “it lady’s daughter could her”

 “there’s stubborn stupid wench remember”

 reddened “my name is…”

 “brienne tarth” jaime sighed “i gift you” reached lord commander’s chair brought wrapped folds crimson velvet

 brienne approached bundle like bite reached huge freckled hand flipped back fold cloth rubies glimmered light picked treasure gingerly curled fingers around leather grip slowly slid sword free scabbard blood black ripples shone finger reflected light ran red along edge “is valyrian steel never seen colors”

 “nor time would given right hand wield sword like appears blade wasted take it” could think refuse went “a sword fine must bear name would please would call one oathkeeper one thing blade comes price”

 face darkened “i told never serve…”

 “…such foul creatures us yes recall hear brienne us swore oaths concerning sansa stark cersei means see girl found killed wherever gone ground…”

 brienne’s homely face twisted fury “if believe would harm lady’s daughter sword you—”

 “just listen” snapped angered assumption “i want find sansa first get somewhere safe else two us going make good stupid vows precious dead lady catelyn

 wench blinked “i… thought…”

 “i know thought” suddenly jaime sick sight bleats like bloody sheep “when ned stark died greatsword given king’s justice” told “but father felt fine blade wasted mere headsman gave ser ilyn new sword ice melted reforged enough metal two new blades you’re holding one you’ll defending ned stark’s daughter ned stark’s steel makes difference you”

 “ser i… owe apolo…”

 “jaime…”

 “kingslayer” reminded “best use sword clean wax ears wench we’re done”

 stubbornly persisted “joffrey your…”

 “my king leave that”

 “you say sansa killed protect her”

 joff squirt seed cersei’s cunt deserved die “i made kings unmade sansa stark last chance honor” jaime smiled thinly “besides kingslayers band together ever going go”

 big hand wrapped tight around oathkeeper “i find girl keep safe lady mother’s sake yours” bowed stiffly whirled went

 wind blowing wild east strong heavy cage would rock whenever gust got teeth skirled along wall shivering ice making jon’s cloak flap bars sky slate grey sun faint patch brightness behind clouds across killing ground could see glimmer thousand campfires burning lights seemed small powerless gloom cold

 grim day jon snow wrapped gloved hands around bars held tight wind hammered cage looked straight past feet ground lost shadow lowered bottomless pit well death bottomless pit sorts reflected day’s work done name shadowed forever

 jon kept face still ice foul enough slay man tent truce must murder front wife child born closed fingers sword hand mance wearing armor sword sheathed left hip weapons tent daggers dirks bow quiver arrows bronzeheaded spear lying beside big black…

 …horn

 jon sucked breath

 warhorn bloody great warhorn

 “yes” mance said “the horn winter joramun blew wake giants earth”

 horn huge eight feet along curve wide mouth could put arm inside elbow came aurochs biggest ever lived first thought bands around bronze moved closer realized gold old gold brown yellow graven runes

 “ygritte said never found horn”

 “did think crows could lie liked well enough bastard… never trusted man needs earn trust”

 jon faced “if you’ve horn joramun along haven’t used bother building turtles sending thenns kill us beds horn songs say sound done”

 dalla answered dalla great child lying pile furs beside brazier “we free folk know things kneelers forgotten sometimes short road safest jon snow horned lord said sorcery sword without hilt safe way grasp it”

 mance ran hand along curve great horn “no man goes hunting one arrow quiver” said “i hoped styr jarl would take brothers unawares open gate us drew garrison away feints raids secondary attacks bowen marsh swallowed lure knew would band cripples orphans proved stubborn anticipated don’t think you’ve stopped us though truth many could continue attack still send ten thousand men cross bay seals rafts take eastwatch rear could storm shadow tower know approaches well man alive could send men mammoths dig gates castles you’ve abandoned once”

 “why don’t then” jon could drawn longclaw wanted hear wildling say

 “blood” said mance rayder “i’d win end yes you’d bleed people bled enough”

 “your losses haven’t heavy”

 “not hands” mance studied jon’s face “you saw fist first men know happened know facing”

 “the others…”

 “they grow stronger days grow shorter nights colder first kill send dead giants able stand thenns ice river clans hornfoots”

 “nor you”

 “nor me” anger admission bitterness deep words “raymun redbeard bael bard gendel gorne horned lord came south conquer i’ve come tail legs hide behind wall” touched horn “if sound horn winter wall fall songs would believe among people want nothing more…”

 “but wall fallen” dalla said “what stop others”

 mance gave fond smile “it’s wise woman i’ve found true queen” turned back jon “go back tell open gate let us pass give horn wall stand end days”

 open gate let pass easy say must follow giants camping ruins winterfell cannibals wolfswood chariots sweeping across barrowlands free folk stealing daughters shipwrights silversmiths white harbor fishwives stony shore “are true king” jon asked suddenly

 “i’ve never crown head sat arse bloody throne that’s you’re asking” mance replied “my birth low man’s get septon’s ever smeared head oils don’t castles queen wears furs amber silk sapphires champion fool harpist don’t become kingbeyondthewall father free folk won’t follow name don’t care brother born first follow fighters left shadow tower five men making noises might stuff kings tormund one magnar another three slew made plain they’d sooner fight follow”

 “you kill enemies” jon said bluntly “but rule friends let people pass strong enough make keep king’s peace obey laws”

 “whose laws laws winterfell king’s landing” mance laughed “when want laws we’ll make keep king’s justice king’s taxes i’m offering horn freedom kneel you”

 “what refuse offer” jon doubt would old bear might least listened though would balked notion letting thirty forty thousand wildlings loose seven kingdoms alliser thorne janos slynt would dismiss notion hand

 “if refuse” mance rayder said “tormund giantsbane sound horn winter three days hence dawn”

 could carry message back castle black tell horn left mance still alive lord janos ser alliser would seize proof turncloak thousand thoughts flickered jon’s head destroy horn smash now… could begin think heard low moan horn made faint tent’s hide walls mance heard frowning went door jon followed

 warhorn louder outside call stirred wildling camp three hornfoot men jogged past carrying long spears horses whinnying snorting giants roaring old tongue even mammoths restless

 “outrider’s horn” tormund told mance

 “something’s coming” varamyr sat crosslegged halffrozen ground wolves circled restlessly around shadow swept jon looked see eagle’s bluegrey wings “coming east”

 dead walk walls stakes swords mean nothing remembered cannot fight dead jon snow man knows half well

 harma scowled “east wights behind us”

 “east” skinchanger repeated “something’s coming”

 “the others” jon asked

 mance shook head “the others never come sun up” chariots rattling across killing ground jammed riders waving spears sharpened bone king groaned “where bloody hell think they’re going quenn get fools back belong someone bring horse mare stallion i’ll want armor too” mance glanced suspiciously wall atop icy parapets straw soldiers stood collecting arrows sign activity “harma mount raiders tormund find sons give triple line spears”

 “aye” said tormund striding

 mousy little skinchanger closed eyes said “i see they’re coming along streams game trails…”

 “who”

 “men men horses men steel men black”

 “crows” mance made word curse turned jon “did old brothers think they’d catch breeches attacked talking”

 “if planned attack never told it” jon believe lord janos lacked men attack wildling camp besides wrong side wall gate sealed rubble different sort treachery mind can’t work

 “if you’re lying won’t leaving alive” mance warned guards brought horse armor elsewhere around camp jon saw people running cross purposes men forming storm wall others slipped woods women driving dog carts east mammoths wandering west reached back shoulder drew longclaw thin line rangers emerged fringes wood three hundred yards away wore black mail black halfhelms black cloaks halfarmored mance drew sword “you knew nothing you” said jon coldly

 slow honey cold morning rangers swept wildling camp picking way clumps gorse stands trees roots rocks wildlings flew meet shouting war cries waving clubs bronze swords axes made flint galloping headlong ancient enemies shout slash fine brave death jon heard brothers say free folk’s way fighting

 “believe will” jon told kingbeyondthewall “but knew nothing attack”

 harma thundered past mance could reply riding head thirty raiders standard went dead dog impaled spear raining blood every stride mance watched smashed rangers “might you’re telling true” said “those look like eastwatch men sailors horses cotter pyke always guts sense took lord bones long barrow might thought he’s fool doesn’t men he—”

 “mance” shout came scout bursting trees lathered horse “mance there’s they’re around us iron men iron host iron men”

 cursing mance swung saddle “varamyr stay see harm comes dalla” kingbeyondthewall pointed sword jon “and keep extra eyes crow runs rip throat “

 “aye i’ll that” skinchanger head shorter jon slumped soft shadowcat could disembowel one paw “they’re coming north too” varamyr told mance “you best go”

 mance donned helm raven wings men mounted well “arrowhead” mance snapped “to form wedge” yet slammed heels mare flew across field rangers men raced catch lost semblance formation

 jon took step toward tent thinking horn winter shadowcat blocked tail lashing beast’s nostrils flared slaver ran curved front teeth smells fear missed ghost ever two wolves behind growling

 “banners” heard varamyr murmur “i see golden banners oh…” mammoth lumbered trumpeting halfdozen bowmen wooden tower back “the king… no…”

 skinchanger threw back head screamed

 sound shocking earpiercing thick agony varamyr fell writhing ’cat screaming too… high high eastern sky wall cloud jon saw eagle burning heartbeat flamed brighter star wreathed red gold orange wings beating wildly air could fly pain higher flew higher higher still

 scream brought val tent whitefaced “what what’s happened” varamyr’s wolves fighting shadowcat raced trees man still twisting ground “what’s wrong him” val demanded horrified “where’s mance”

 “there” jon pointed “gone fight” king led ragged wedge knot rangers sword flashing

 “gone can’t gone it’s started”

 “the battle” watched rangers scatter harma’s bloody dog’s head raiders screamed hacked chased men black back trees men coming wood column horse knights heavy horse jon saw harma regroup wheel meet half men raced far ahead

 “the birth” val shouting

 trumpets blowing around loud brazen wildlings trumpets warhorns knew well sound sent free folk running confusion toward fighting others away mammoth stomping flock sheep three men trying herd west drums beating wildlings ran form squares lines late disorganized slow enemy emerging forest east northeast north three great columns heavy horse dark glinting steel bright wool surcoats men eastwatch line scouts army king jon confused wildlings could robb returned boy iron throne finally bestirred “you best get back inside tent” told val

 across field one column washed harma dogshead another smashed flank tormund’s spearmen sons desperately tried turn giants climbing onto mammoths though knights barded horses like could see coursers destriers screamed scattered sight lumbering mountains fear wildling side well hundreds women children rushing away battle blundering right hooves garrons saw old woman’s dog cart veer path three chariots send crashing

 “gods” val whispered “gods this”

 “go inside tent stay dalla it’s safe here” wouldn’t great deal safer inside didn’t need hear

 “i need find midwife” val said

 “you’re midwife i’ll stay mance comes back” lost sight mance found cutting way knot mounted men mammoths shattered center column two closing like pincers eastern edge camps archers loosing fire arrows tents saw mammoth pluck knight saddle fling forty feet flick trunk wildlings streamed past women children running battle men hurrying along gave jon dark looks longclaw hand one troubled even varamyr fled crawling hands knees

 men pouring trees knights freeriders mounted bowmen menatarms jacks kettle helms dozens men hundreds men blaze banners flew wind whipping wildly jon see sigils glimpsed seahorse field birds ring flowers yellow much yellow yellow banners red device whose arms

 east north northeast saw bands wildlings trying stand fight attackers rode right free folk still numbers attackers steel armor heavy horses thickest part fray jon saw mance standing tall stirrups redandblack cloak ravenwinged helm made easy pick sword raised men rallying wedge knights smashed lance sword longaxe mance’s mare went hind legs kicking spear took breast steel tide washed

 it’s done jon thought they’re breaking wildlings running throwing weapons hornfoot men cave dwellers thenns bronze scales running mance gone someone waving harma’s head pole tormund’s lines broken giants mammoths holding hairy islands red steel sea fires leaping tent tent tall pines going well smoke another wedge armored riders came barded horses floating largest banners yet royal standards big sheets yellow one long pointed tongues showed flaming heart another like sheet beaten gold black stag prancing rippling wind

 robert jon thought one mad moment remembering poor owen trumpets blew knights charged name cried “stannis stannis stannis”

 jon turned away went inside tent





 arya


 outside inn weathered gibbet woman’s bones twisting rattling every gust wind

 know inn hadn’t gibbet outside door slept sister sansa watchful eye septa mordane though “we don’t want go in” arya decided suddenly “there might ghosts”

 “you know long it’s since cup wine” sandor swung saddle “besides need learn holds ruby ford stay horses want it’s hair arse”

 “what know you” sandor longer troubled hide face longer seemed care knew “they might want take captive”

 “let try” loosened longsword scabbard pushed door

 arya would never better chance escape could ride craven take stranger chewed lip led horses stables went

 know silence told wasn’t worst thing knew skinny innkeep women fieldhands hearth others soldiers knew soldiers

 “looking brother sandor” polliver’s hand bodice girl lap slid

 “looking cup wine innkeep flagon red” clegane threw handful coppers floor

 “i don’t want trouble ser” innkeep said

 “then don’t call ser” mouth twitched “are deaf fool ordered wine” man ran clegane shouted “two cups girl’s thirsty too”

 three arya thought polliver gave fleeting glance boy beside never looked third one gazed long hard man middling height build face ordinary hard say old tickler tickler polliver boy squire judging age dress big white pimple one side nose red ones forehead “is lost puppy ser gregor spoke of” asked tickler “the one piddled rushes ran off”

 tickler put warning hand boy’s arm gave short sharp shake head arya read plain enough

 squire didn’t else didn’t care “ser said puppy brother tucked tail legs battle got warm king’s landing said ran whimpering” gave hound stupid mocking grin

 clegane studied boy never said word polliver shoved girl lap got feet “the lad’s drunk” said manatarms almost tall hound though heavily muscled spadeshaped beard covered jaws jowls thick black neatly trimmed head bald “he can’t hold wine all”

 “then shouldn’t drink”

 “the puppy doesn’t scare…” boy began till tickler casually twisted ear thumb forefinger words became squeal pain

 innkeep came scurrying back two stone cups flagon pewter platter sandor lifted flagon mouth arya could see muscles neck working gulped slammed back table half wine gone “now pour best pick coppers it’s coin you’re like see today”

 “we’ll pay we’re done drinking” said polliver

 “when you’re done drinking you’ll tickle innkeep see keeps gold way always do”

 innkeep suddenly remembered something kitchen locals leaving girls gone sound common room faint crackling fire hearth go arya knew

 “if you’re looking ser come late” polliver said “he harrenhal he’s queen sent him” wore three blades belt arya saw longsword left hip right dagger slimmer blade long dirk short sword “king joffrey’s dead know” added “poisoned wedding feast”

 arya edged farther room joffrey’s dead could almost see blond curls mean smile fat soft lips joffrey’s dead knew ought make happy somehow still felt empty inside joffrey dead robb dead matter

 “so much brave brothers kingsguard” hound gave snort contempt “who killed him”

 “the imp it’s thought little wife”

 “what wife”

 “i forgot you’ve hiding rock northern girl winterfell’s daughter heard killed king spell afterward changed wolf big leather wings like bat flew tower window left dwarf behind cersei means head”

 that’s stupid arya thought sansa knows songs spells she’d never marry imp

 hound sat bench closest door mouth twitched burned side “she ought dip wildfire cook tickle till moon turns black” raised wine cup drained straightaway

 he’s one arya thought saw bit lip hard tasted blood he’s like kill sleeps

 “so gregor took harrenhal” sandor said

 “didn’t require much taking” said polliver “the sellswords fled soon knew coming one cooks opened postern gate us get back hoat cutting foot” chuckled “we kept cook us couple wenches warm beds put rest sword”

 “all rest” arya blurted

 “well ser kept hoat pass time”

 sandor said “the blackfish still riverrun”

 “not long” said polliver “he’s siege old frey’s going hang edmure tully unless yields castle real fighting’s around raventree blackwoods brackens brackens now”

 hound poured cup wine arya another drank staring hearthfire “the little bird flew away well bloody good shit imp’s head flew off”

 “they’ll find her” said polliver “if takes half gold casterly rock”

 “a pretty girl hear” said tickler “honey sweet” smacked lips smiled

 “and courteous” hound agreed “a proper little lady like bloody sister”

 “they found too” said polliver “the sister she’s bolton’s bastard hear”

 arya sipped wine could see mouth didn’t understand polliver talking sansa sister sandor clegane laughed aloud

 “what’s bloody funny” asked polliver

 hound never flicked eye arya “if i’d wanted know i’d told ships saltpans”

 “saltpans know traders back maidenpool heard randyll tarly took castle locked mooton tower cell haven’t heard shit saltpans”

 tickler leaned forward “would put sea without bidding farewell brother” gave arya chills hear ask question “ser would sooner returned harrenhal us sandor bet would king’s landing…”

 “bugger bugger bugger you”

 tickler shrugged straightened reached hand behind head rub back neck everything seemed happen sandor lurched feet polliver drew longsword tickler’s hand whipped around blur send something silver flashing across common room hound moving knife might cored apple throat instead grazed ribs wound quivering wall near door laughed laugh cold hollow come bottom deep well “i hoping you’d something stupid” sword slid scabbard time knock aside polliver’s first cut

 arya took step backward long steel song began tickler came bench shortsword one hand dagger even chunky brownhaired squire fumbling swordhilt snatched wine cup table threw face aim better twins cup hit right big white pimple went hard tail

 polliver grim methodical fighter pressed sandor steadily backward heavy longsword moving brutal precision hound’s cuts sloppier parries rushed feet slow clumsy he’s drunk arya realized dismay drank much fast food belly tickler sliding around wall get behind grabbed second wine cup flung quicker squire ducked head time look gave cold promise gold hidden village could hear ask stupid squire clutching edge table pulling knees arya could taste beginnings panic back throat fear cuts deeper swords fears cuts deeper…

 sandor gave grunt pain burned side face ran red temple cheek stub ear gone seemed make angry drove back polliver furious attack hammering old nicked longsword swapped hills bearded man gave way none cuts much touched tickler leapt bench quick snake slashed back hound’s neck edge short sword

 they’re killing arya cups something better throw drew dagger they’d robbed dying archer tried fling tickler way he’d done wasn’t throwing rock crabapple though knife wobbled hit arm hilt first never even felt intent clegane

 stabbed clegane twisted violently aside winning half heartbeat’s respite blood ran face gash neck mountain’s men came hard polliver hacking head shoulders tickler darted stab back belly heavy stone flagon still table arya grabbed two hands lifted someone grabbed arm flagon slipped fingers crashed floor wrenched around found nose nose squire stupid forgot big white pimple burst saw

 “are puppy’s puppy” sword right hand arm left hands free jerked knife sheath sheathed belly twisting wasn’t wearing mail even boiled leather went right way needle killed stableboy king’s landing squire’s eyes got big let go arm arya spun door wrenched tickler’s knife wall

 polliver tickler driven hound corner behind bench one given ugly red gash upper thigh go wounds sandor leaning wall bleeding breathing noisily looked though could barely stand let alone fight “throw sword we’ll take back harrenhal” polliver told

 “so gregor finish himself”

 tickler said “maybe he’ll give me”

 “if want come get me” sandor pushed away wall stood halfcrouch behind bench sword held across body

 “you think won’t” said polliver “you’re drunk”

 “might be” said hound “but you’re dead” foot lashed caught bench driving hard polliver’s shins somehow bearded man kept feet hound ducked wild slash brought sword vicious backhand cut blood spattered ceiling walls blade caught middle polliver’s face hound wrenched loose half head came

 tickler backed away arya could smell fear shortsword hand suddenly seemed almost toy long blade hound holding wasn’t armored either moved swiftly light feet never taking eyes sandor clegane easiest thing world arya step behind stab

 “is gold hidden village” shouted drove blade back “is silver gems” stabbed twice “is food lord beric” top still stabbing “where go many men many knights many bowmen many many many many many many gold village”

 hands red sticky sandor dragged “enough” said bleeding like butchered pig dragging one leg walked

 “there’s one more” arya reminded

 squire pulled knife belly trying stop blood hands hound yanked upright screamed started blubber like baby “mercy” wept “please don’t kill mother mercy”

 “do look like bloody mother” hound looked like nothing human “you killed one too” told arya “pricked bowels that’s end he’ll long time dying though”

 boy didn’t seemed hear “i came girls” whimpered “…make man polly said… oh gods please take castle… maester take maester father’s got gold… girls… mercy ser”

 hound gave crack across face made scream “don’t call ser” turned back arya “this one shewolf it”

 knew meant arya went polliver knelt blood long enough undo swordbelt hanging beside dagger slimmer blade long dirk short man’s sword… felt right hand

 “you remember heart is” hound asked

 nodded squire rolled eyes “mercy”

 needle slipped ribs gave

 “good” sandor’s voice thick pain “if three whoring gregor must hold ford well harrenhal pets could ride moment we’ve killed enough bloody buggers one day”

 “where go” asked

 “saltpans” put big hand shoulder keep falling “get wine shewolf take whatever coin well we’ll need there’s ships saltpans reach vale sea” mouth twitched blood ran ear “maybe lady lysa marry little robert there’s match i’d like see” started laugh groaned instead

 time came leave needed arya’s help get back stranger tied strip cloth neck another around thigh taken squire’s cloak peg door cloak green green arrow white bend hound wadded pressed ear soon turned red arya afraid would collapse moment set somehow stayed saddle

 could risk meeting whoever held ruby ford instead following kingsroad angled south east weedy fields woods marshes hours reached banks trident river returned meekly accustomed channel arya saw wet brown rage vanished rains it’s tired thought

 close water’s edge found willows rising jumble weathered rocks together rocks trees formed sort natural fort could hide river trail “here do” hound said “water horses gather deadwood fire” dismounted catch tree limb keep falling

 “won’t smoke seen”

 “anyone wants find us need follow blood water wood bring wineskin first”

 got fire going sandor propped helm flames emptied half wineskin collapsed back jut mosscovered stone never meant rise made arya wash squire’s cloak cut strips went helm well “if wine i’d drink till dead world maybe ought send back bloody inn another skin three “

 “no” arya said wouldn’t would i’ll leave ride

 sandor laughed fear face “a jest wolf girl bloody jest find stick long big around wash mud hate taste mud”

 didn’t like first two sticks brought time found one suited flames scorched dog’s snout black way eyes inside wine boiling madly “get cup bedroll dip half full” told “be careful knock damn thing send back take wine pour wounds think that” arya nodded “then waiting for” growled

 knuckles brushed steel first time filled cup burning badly got blisters arya bite lip keep screaming hound used stick purpose clamping teeth poured gash thigh first shallower cut back neck sandor coiled right hand fist beat ground leg came neck bit stick hard broke find new one could see terror eyes “turn head” trickled wine raw red flesh ear fingers brown blood red wine crept jaw scream despite stick passed pain

 arya figured rest fished strips they’d made squire’s cloak bottom helm used bind cuts came ear wrap half head stop bleeding dusk settling trident let horses graze hobbled night made comfortable could niche two rocks fire burned died arya watched moon branches overhead

 “ser gregor mountain” said softly “dunsen raff sweetling ser ilyn ser meryn queen cersei” made feel queer leave polliver tickler joffrey glad dead wished could see die maybe kill polliver said sansa killed imp could true imp lannister sansa… wish could change wolf grow wings fly away

 sansa gone starks jon wall thousand leagues away snow different aunts uncles hound wanted sell weren’t starks either weren’t wolves

 sandor moaned rolled onto side look left name realized done tried think mycah hard remember he’d looked like hadn’t known long ever play swords “the hound” whispered “valar morghulis” maybe he’d dead morning…

 pale dawn light came filtering trees woke toe boot dreamed wolf chasing riderless horse hill pack behind foot brought back closing kill

 hound still weak every movement slow clumsy slumped saddle sweated ear began bleed bandage needed strength keep falling stranger mountain’s men come hunting doubted would even able lift sword arya glanced shoulder nothing behind crow flitting tree tree sound river

 long noon sandor clegane reeling hours daylight still remaining called halt “i need rest” said time dismounted fall instead trying get back crawled weakly tree leaned trunk “bloody hell” cursed “bloody hell” saw arya staring said “i’d skin alive cup wine girl”

 brought water instead drank little complained tasted mud slid noisy fevered sleep touched skin burning arya sniffed bandages way maester luwin done sometimes treating cut scrape face bled worst wound thigh smelled funny

 wondered far saltpans whether could find wouldn’t kill rode left he’d die he’ll die fever lie beneath tree end days maybe would better killed killed squire inn hadn’t done anything except grab arm hound killed mycah mycah bet he’s killed hundred mycahs probably would killed ransom

 needle glinted drew polliver kept nice sharp least turned body sideways water dancer’s stance without even thinking dead leaves crunched beneath feet quick snake thought smooth summer silk

 eyes opened “you remember heart is” asked hoarse whisper

 still stone stood “i… only…”

 “don’t lie” growled “i hate liars hate gutless frauds even worse go it” arya move said “i killed butcher’s boy cut near half laughed after” made queer sound took moment realize sobbing “and little bird pretty sister stood white cloak let beat took bloody song never gave meant take fucked bloody ripped heart leaving dwarf” spasm pain twisted face “do mean make beg bitch gift mercy… avenge little michael…”

 “mycah” arya stepped away “you don’t deserve gift mercy”

 hound watched saddle craven eyes bright fever attempt rise stop mounted said “a real wolf would finish wounded animal”

 maybe real wolves find arya thought maybe they’ll smell sun goes would learn wolves dogs “you shouldn’t hit axe” said “you saved mother” turned horse rode away never looked back

 bright morning six days later came place trident began widen air smelled salt trees stayed close water passing fields farms little midday town appeared saltpans hoped small castle dominated town holdfast really single tall square keep bailey curtain wall shops inns alehouses around harbor plundered burned though looked still inhabited port eastward spread bay crabs waters shimmering blue green sun

 ships

 three thought arya three two river galleys shallow draft boats made ply waters trident third bigger salt sea trader two banks oars gilded prow three tall masts furled purple sails hull painted purple arya rode craven docks get better look strangers strange port little villages one seemed care

 need silver realization made bite lip found stag dozen coppers polliver eight silvers pimply squire she’d killed couple pennies tickler’s purse hound told pull boots slice open blooddrenched clothes she’d turned stag toe three golden dragons sewn lining jerkin sandor kept though wasn’t fair mine much given gift mercy… hadn’t though couldn’t go back could beg help begging help never gets would sell craven hope brought enough

 stable burnt learned boy docks woman who’d owned still trading behind sept arya found easily big robust woman good horsey smell liked craven first look asked arya she’d come grinned answer “she’s wellbred horse that’s plain enough don’t doubt belonged knight sweetling” said “but knight wasn’t dead brother o’ dealing castle many year know gentleborn folk like mare wellbred you’re not” poked finger arya’s chest “found stole never mind that’s way scruffy little thing like comes ride palfrey”

 arya bit lip “does mean won’t buy her”

 woman chuckled “it means you’ll take give sweetling else go castle maybe get nothing even hanged stealing good knight’s horse”

 halfdozen saltpans folks around going business arya knew couldn’t kill woman instead bite lip let cheated purse got pitifully flat asked saddle bridle blanket woman laughed

 would never cheated hound thought long walk back docks distance seemed grown miles since she’d ridden

 purple galley still ship sailed robbed would much bear cask mead rolled plank arrived tried follow sailor deck shouted tongue know “i want see captain” arya told shouted louder commotion drew attention stout greyhaired man coat purple wool spoke common tongue “i captain here” said “what wish quick child tide catch”

 “i want go north wall pay” gave purse “the night’s watch castle sea”

 “eastwatch” captain spilled silver onto palm frowned “is have”

 enough arya knew without told could see face “i wouldn’t need cabin anything” said “i could sleep hold or…”

 “take cabin girl” said passing oarsman bolt wool one shoulder “she sleep me”

 “mind tongue” captain snapped

 “i could work” said arya “i could scrub decks scrubbed castle steps could row…”

 “no” said “you couldn’t” gave back coins “it would make difference could child north nothing us ice war pirates saw dozen pirate ships making north rounded crackclaw point wish meet bend oars home suggest same”

 home arya thought pack don’t even horse

 captain turning away said “what ship lord”

 paused long enough give weary smile “this galleas titan’s daughter free city braavos”

 “wait” arya said suddenly “i something else” stuffed inside smallclothes keep safe dig deep find oarsmen laughed captain lingered obvious impatience “one silver make difference child” finally said

 “it’s silver” fingers closed “it’s iron here” pressed hand small black iron coin jaqen h’ghar given worn man whose head bore features it’s probably worthless but…

 captain turned blinked looked “this… how…”

 jaqen said say words arya crossed arms chest “valar morghulis” said loud she’d known meant

 “valar dohaeris” replied touching brow two fingers “of course shall cabin”

 “i want see him” val said “i want show son deserves much kill him”

 sam tried explain “no one permitted see maester aemon lady”

 “it’s believe that” sam assured “ser alliser friends brothers know better king stannis knows well i’ll wager brought horn winter captured mance rayder’s son”

 “all protect val babe looters wildlings fled keep rangers found us never captured anyone king stannis keeps men well hand that’s plain lets plunder i’ve heard three wildling women raped men gelded suppose killing free folk ran ser alliser putting time bared sword defend foes failed kill mance rayder league says”

 “i never win anything” dolorous edd complained “the gods always smiled watt though wildlings knocked bridge skulls somehow landed nice deep pool water lucky missing rocks”

 “was long fall” grenn wanted know “did landing pool water save life”

 “not good hopes becoming lord commander certainly” said maester aemon “yet may good night’s watch end us say ten days unduly long choosing lasted near two years seven hundred votes brothers come decision time”

 yes sam thought decision

 later cups watered wine privacy pyp’s cell sam’s tongue loosened found thinking aloud “cotter pyke ser denys mallister losing ground still almost twothirds” told pyp grenn “either one would fine lord commander someone needs convince one withdraw support other”

 “someone” said grenn doubtfully “what someone”

 “grenn dumb thinks someone might him” said pyp “maybe someone done pyke mallister convince king stannis marry queen cersei too”

 “king stannis married” grenn objected

 “what going sam” sighed pyp

 “cotter pyke ser denys don’t like much” grenn argued stubbornly “they fight everything”

 “yes different ideas what’s best watch” said sam “if explained—”

 “we” said pyp “how someone change i’m mummer’s monkey remember grenn well grenn” smiled sam wiggled ears “you now… you’re lord’s son maester’s steward…”

 “and sam slayer” said grenn “you slew other”

 “it dragonglass killed it” sam told hundredth time

 “i could” said sam sounding gloomy dolorous edd “if wasn’t craven face them”





 jon


 jon prowled around satin slow circle sword hand forcing turn “get shield up” said

 “it’s heavy” oldtown boy complained

 “it’s heavy needs stop sword” jon said “now get up” stepped forward slashing satin jerked shield time catch sword rim swung blade jon’s ribs “good” jon said felt impact shield “that good need put body get weight behind steel you’ll damage arm strength alone come try drive keep shield i’ll ring head like bell…”

 instead satin took step backward raised visor “jon” said anxious voice

 turned standing behind half dozen queen’s men around small wonder yard grew quiet glimpsed melisandre nightfires coming going castle never close she’s beautiful thought… something little unsettling red eyes “my lady”

 “the king would speak jon snow”

 jon thrust practice sword earth “might allowed change fit state stand king”

 “we shall await atop wall” said melisandre jon heard it’s say true queen one left eastwatch

 hung mail plate inside armory returned cell discarded sweatstained clothes donned fresh set blacks would cold windy cage knew colder windier still top ice chose heavy hooded cloak last collected longclaw slung bastard sword across back

 melisandre waiting base wall sent queen’s men away “what grace want me” jon asked entered cage

 “all give jon snow king”

 shut door pulled bell cord winch began turn rose day bright wall weeping long fingers water trickling face glinting sun close confines iron cage acutely aware red woman’s presence even smells red scent reminded mikken’s forge way iron smelled redhot scent smoke blood kissed fire thought remembering ygritte wind got amongst melisandre’s long red robes sent flapping jon’s legs stood beside “you cold lady” asked

 laughed “never” ruby throat seemed pulse time beating heart “the lord’s fire lives within jon snow feel” put hand cheek held felt warm “that life feel” told “only death cold”

 found stannis baratheon standing alone edge wall brooding field battle great green forest beyond dressed black breeches tunic boots brother night’s watch might wear cloak set apart heavy golden cloak trimmed black fur pinned brooch shape flaming heart “i brought bastard winterfell grace” said melisandre

 stannis turned study beneath heavy brow eyes like bottomless blue pools hollow cheeks strong jaw covered shortcropped blueblack beard little conceal gauntness face teeth clenched neck shoulders clenched well right hand jon found remembering something donal noye said baratheon brothers robert true steel stannis pure iron black hard strong brittle way iron gets he’ll break bends uneasily knelt wondering brittle king need

 “rise heard much lord snow”

 “i lord sire” jon rose “i know heard turncloak craven slew brother qhorin halfhand wildlings would spare life rode mance rayder took wildling wife”

 “aye warg say skinchanger walks night wolf” king stannis hard smile “how much true”

 “i direwolf ghost left climbed wall near greyguard seen since qhorin halfhand commanded join wildlings knew would make kill prove told whatever asked woman named ygritte broke vows swear father’s name never turned cloak”

 “i believe you” king said

 startled “why”

 stannis snorted “i know janos slynt knew ned stark well father friend mine fool would doubt honor honesty look” big man stannis baratheon towered jon gaunt looked ten years older “i know might think jon snow know found dragonglass dagger randyll tarly’s son used slay other”

 “ghost found blade wrapped ranger’s cloak buried beneath fist first men blades well… spearheads arrowheads dragonglass”

 “i know held gate here” king stannis said “if would come late”

 “donal noye held gate died tunnel fighting king giants”

 stannis grimaced “noye made first sword robert’s warhammer well god seen fit spare would made better lord commander order fools squabbling now”

 “cotter pyke ser denys mallister fools sire” jon said “they’re good men capable othell yarwyck well way lord mormont trusted them”

 “your lord mormont trusted easily else would died speaking forgotten brought us magic horn captured mance rayder’s wife son”

 “dalla died” jon saddened still “val sister babe require much capturing grace put wildlings flight skinchanger mance left guard queen went mad eagle burned” jon looked melisandre “some say doing”

 smiled long copper hair tumbling across face “the lord light fiery talons jon snow”

 jon nodded turned back king “your grace spoke val asked see mance rayder bring son would a… kindness”

 “the man deserter order brothers insisting death kindness”

 jon answer “if val sister’s sake child’s mother”

 “you fond val”

 “i scarcely know her”

 “they tell comely”

 “very” jon admitted

 “beauty treacherous brother learned lesson cersei lannister murdered doubt father jon arryn well” scowled “you rode wildlings honor think”

 “yes” jon said “but sort honor sire”

 “in mance rayder”

 “yes think so”

 “in lord bones”

 jon hesitated “rattleshirt called treacherous bloodthirsty there’s honor hides beneath suit bones”

 “and man tormund many names eluded us battle answer truly”

 “tormund giantsbane seemed sort man would make good friend bad enemy grace”

 stannis gave curt nod “your father man honor friend saw worth brother rebel traitor meant steal half kingdom man question courage you”

 want say love jon’s voice stiff formal said “i man night’s watch”

 “words words wind think abandoned dragonstone sailed wall lord snow”

 “i lord sire came sent hope though could say took long it”

 surprisingly stannis smiled “you’re bold enough stark yes come sooner hand might come lord seaworth man humble birth reminded duty could think rights cart horse davos said trying win throne save kingdom trying save kingdom win throne” stannis pointed north “there i’ll find foe born fight”

 “his name may spoken” melisandre added softly “he god night terror jon snow shapes snow creatures”

 “they tell slew one walking corpses save lord mormont’s life” stannis said “it may war well lord snow give help”

 “my sword pledged night’s watch grace” jon snow answered carefully

 please king stannis ground teeth said “i need sword you”

 jon lost “my lord”

 “i need north”

 north “i… brother robb king north…”

 “your brother rightful lord winterfell stayed home done duty instead crowning riding conquer riverlands might alive today may robb robert”

 harsh words blown away whatever sympathy jon might stannis “i loved brother” said

 “and mine yet true king westeros north south ned stark’s bastard” stannis studied dark blue eyes “tywin lannister named roose bolton warden north reward betraying brother ironmen fighting amongst since balon greyjoy’s death yet still hold moat cailin deepwood motte torrhen’s square stony shore father’s lands bleeding neither strength time stanch wounds needed lord winterfell loyal lord winterfell”

 looking jon thought stunned “winterfell theon greyjoy put torch”

 “granite burn easily” stannis said “the castle rebuilt time it’s walls make lord it’s man northmen know reason love yet need strength battles yet come need son eddard stark win banner”

 would make lord winterfell wind gusting jon felt lightheaded half afraid would blow wall “your grace” said “you forget snow stark”

 “it’s forgetting” king stannis replied

 melisandre put warm hand jon’s arm “a king remove taint bastardy stroke lord snow”

 lord snow ser alliser thorne named mock bastard birth many brothers taken using well affection others wound suddenly different sound jon’s ears sounded… real “yes” said hesitantly “kings legitimized bastards but… still brother night’s watch knelt heart tree swore hold lands father children”

 “jon” melisandre close could feel warmth breath “r’hllor true god vow sworn tree power one sworn shoes open heart let light lord come burn weirwoods accept winterfell gift lord light”

 jon young young understand meant bastard used dream one day winterfell might later older ashamed dreams winterfell would go robb sons bran rickon robb die childless came sansa arya even dream otherwise seemed disloyal betraying heart wishing deaths never wanted thought stood blueeyed king red woman loved robb loved them… never wanted harm come there’s say word would jon stark nevermore snow pledge king fealty winterfell do…

 …was forswear vows

 time would ruse claim father’s castle must turn father’s gods

 king stannis gazed north gold cloak streaming shoulders “it may mistaken jon snow know things said bastards may lack father’s honor brother’s skill arms weapon lord given found found cache dragonglass beneath fist mean make use even azor ahai win war alone killed thousand wildlings took another thousand captive scattered rest know return melisandre seen fires tormund thunderfist likely reforming even planning new assault bleed weaker shall real enemy falls upon us”

 jon come realization “as say grace” wondered king going

 “whilst brothers struggling decide shall lead speaking mance rayder” ground teeth “a stubborn man one prideful leave choice give flames took captives well leaders one calls lord bones clan chiefs new magnar thenn brothers like father’s lords mean allow wildlings wall… swear fealty pledge keep king’s peace king’s laws take lord light god even giants great knees bend settle gift wrested away new lord commander cold winds rise shall live die together time made alliance common foe” looked jon “would agree”

 “my father dreamed resettling gift” jon admitted “he uncle benjen used talk it” never thought settling wildlings though… never rode wildlings either fool free folk would make unruly subjects dangerous neighbors yet weighed ygritte’s red hair cold blue eyes wights choice easy “i agree”

 “good” king stannis said “for surest way seal new alliance marriage mean wed lord winterfell wildling princess”

 perhaps jon ridden free folk long could help laugh “your grace” said “captive think give val fear deal learn wildling women whoever weds best prepared climb tower window carry swordpoint…”

 “whoever” stannis gave measuring look “does mean wed girl warn part price must pay want father’s name father’s castle match necessary help assure loyalty new subjects refusing jon snow”

 “no” jon said quickly winterfell king speaking winterfell lightly refused “i mean… come suddenly grace might beg time consider”

 “as wish consider quickly patient man black brothers discover” stannis put thin fleshless hand jon’s shoulder “say nothing we’ve discussed today anyone return need bend knee lay sword feet pledge service shall rise jon stark lord winterfell”





 tyrion


 heard noises thick wooden door cell tyrion lannister prepared die

 past time thought come come make end pushed feet legs asleep folded bent rubbed knives go stumbling waddling headsman’s block

 wondered whether would kill dark drag city ser ilyn payne could lop head mummer’s farce trial sweet sister loving father might prefer dispose quietly rather risk public execution could tell mob choice things let speak would foolish

 keys rattled door cell pushed inward creaking tyrion pressed back dampness wall wishing weapon still bite kick i’ll die taste blood mouth that’s something wished he’d able think rousing last words “bugger all” like earn much place histories

 torchlight fell across face shielded eyes hand “come frightened dwarf son poxy whore” voice grown hoarse disuse

 “is way speak lady mother” man moved forward torch left hand “this even ghastly cell riverrun though quite dank”

 moment tyrion could breathe “you”

 “well me” jaime gaunt hair hacked short “i left hand harrenhal bringing brave companions across narrow sea one father’s better notions” lifted arm tyrion saw stump

 bark hysterical laughter burst lips “oh gods” said “jaime sorry but… gods good look two us handless noseless lannister boys”

 “there days hand smelled bad wished noseless” jaime lowered torch light bathed brother’s face “an impressive scar”

 tyrion turned away glare “they made fight battle without big brother protect me”

 “i heard tell almost burned city down”

 “a filthy lie burned river” abruptly tyrion remembered “are kill me”

 “now that’s ungrateful perhaps leave rot you’re going discourteous”

 “rotting fate cersei mind me”

 “well truth told you’re beheaded morrow old tourney grounds”

 tyrion laughed “will food you’ll help last words wits running like rat root cellar”

 “you won’t need last words i’m rescuing you” jaime’s voice strangely solemn

 “who said required rescue”

 “you know i’d almost forgotten annoying little man you’ve reminded believe i’ll let cersei cut head all”

 “oh won’t” waddled cell “is day night i’ve lost sense time”

 “three hours past midnight city sleeps” jaime slid torch back sconce wall cells

 corridor poorly lit tyrion almost stumbled turnkey sprawled across cold stone floor prodded toe “is dead”

 “asleep three well eunuch dosed wine sweetsleep enough kill swears waiting back stair dressed septon’s robe you’re going sewers river galley waiting bay varys agents free cities see lack funds… try conspicuous cersei send men doubt might well take another name”

 “another name oh certainly faceless men come kill i’ll say ‘no wrong man i’m different dwarf hideous facial scar’” lannisters laughed absurdity jaime went one knee kissed quickly cheek lips brushing puckered ribbon scar tissue

 “thank brother” tyrion said “for life”

 “it was… debt owed you” jaime’s voice strange

 “a debt” cocked head “i understand”

 “good doors best left closed”

 “oh dear” said tyrion “is something grim ugly behind could someone said something cruel i’ll try weep tell me”

 “tyrion…”

 jaime afraid “tell me” tyrion said

 brother looked away “tysha” said softly

 “tysha” stomach tightened “what her”

 “she whore never bought lie father commanded tell tysha was… seemed crofter’s daughter chance met road”

 tyrion could hear faint sound breath whistling hollowly scar nose jaime could meet eyes tysha tried remember looked like girl girl older sansa “my wife” croaked “she wed me”

 “for gold father said lowborn lannister casterly rock wanted gold made different whore so… would lie truly and… said required sharp lesson would learn thank later…”

 “thank you” tyrion’s voice choked “he gave guards barracks full guards made me… watch” aye watch took too… wife…

 “i never knew would must believe me”

 “oh must i” tyrion snarled “why believe anything ever wife”

 “tyrion—”

 hit slap backhanded put strength fear rage pain jaime squatting unbalanced blow sent tumbling backward floor “i… suppose earned that”

 “oh you’ve earned jaime sweet sister loving father yes can’t begin tell you’ve earned you’ll swear lannister always pays debts” tyrion waddled away almost stumbling turnkey haste gone dozen yards bumped iron gate closed passage oh gods could scream

 jaime came behind “i gaoler’s keys”

 “then use them” tyrion stepped aside

 jaime unlocked gate pushed open stepped looked back shoulder “are coming”

 “not you” tyrion stepped “give keys go find varys own” cocked head stared brother mismatched eyes “jaime flght lefthanded”

 “rather less well you” jaime said bitterly

 “good well matched ever meet cripple dwarf”

 jaime handed ring keys “i gave truth owe kill him”

 question another knife twisting guts “are sure want know” asked tyrion “joffrey would worse king aerys ever stole father’s dagger gave footpad slit throat brandon stark know that”

 “i… thought might have”

 “well son takes father joff would killed well came power crime short ugly conspicuously guilty”

 “you answered question”

 “you poor stupid blind crippled fool must spell every little thing well cersei lying whore she’s fucking lancel osmund kettleblack probably moon boy know monster say yes killed vile son” made grin must hideous sight see torchlit gloom

 jaime turned without word walked away

 tyrion watched go striding long strong legs part wanted call tell wasn’t true beg forgiveness thought tysha held silence listened receding footsteps could hear longer waddled look varys

 eunuch lurking dark twisting turnpike stair garbed motheaten brown robe hood hid paleness face “you long feared something gone amiss” said saw tyrion

 “oh no” tyrion assured poisonous tones “what could possibly gone amiss” twisted head back stare “i sent trial”

 “i could come queen watched night day dared help you”

 “you’re helping now”

 “am ah” varys giggled seemed strangely place place cold stone echoing darkness “your brother persuasive”

 “varys cold slimy slug anyone ever told best kill perhaps ought return favor”

 eunuch sighed “the faithful dog kicked matter spider weaves never loved slay fear lord may never find way back daylight” eyes glittered shifting torchlight dark wet “these tunnels full traps unwary”

 tyrion snorted “unwary i’m wariest man ever lived helped see that” rubbed nose “so tell wizard innocent maiden wife”

 “i found trace lady sansa king’s landing sad say ser dontos hollard rights turned somewhere drunk seen together serpentine steps night vanished nothing much confusion night little birds silent” varys gave gentle tug dwarf’s sleeve pulled stair “my lord must away path down”

 that’s lie least tyrion waddled along eunuch’s wake heels scraping rough stone descended cold within stairwell damp bonechilling cold set shivering “what part dungeons these” asked

 “maegor cruel decreed four levels dungeons castle” varys replied “on upper level large cells common criminals may confined together narrow windows set high walls second level smaller cells highborn captives held windows torches halls cast light bars third level cells smaller doors wood black cells men call kept eddard stark level lower still man taken fourth level never sees sun hears human voice breathes breath free agonizing pain maegor cells fourth level built torment” reached bottom steps unlighted door opened “this fourth level give hand lord safer walk darkness things would wish see”

 tyrion hung back moment varys already betrayed knew game eunuch playing better place murder man darkness place one knew existed body might never found

 hand choice go back steps walk main gate would serve

 jaime would afraid thought remembered jaime done took eunuch hand let led black following soft scrape leather stone varys walked quickly time time whispering “careful three steps ahead” “the tunnel slopes downward lord” arrived king’s hand riding gates head sworn men tyrion reflected leave like rat scuttling dark holding hands spider

 light appeared ahead dim daylight grew hurried toward could see arched doorway closed another iron gate varys produced key stepped small round chamber five doors opened room barred iron opening ceiling well series rungs set wall leading upward ornate brazier stood one side fashioned shape dragon’s head coals beast’s yawning mouth burnt embers still glowed sullen orange light dim light welcome blackness tunnel

 juncture otherwise empty floor mosaic threeheaded dragon wrought red black tiles something niggled tyrion moment came place shae told varys first led bed “we tower hand”

 “yes” frozen hinges screamed protest varys pulled open longclosed door flakes rust drifted floor “this take us river”

 tyrion walked slowly ladder ran hand across lowest rung “this take bedchamber”

 “your lord father’s bedchamber now”

 looked shaft “how far must climb”

 “my lord weak follies besides time must go”

 “i business far”

 “two hundred thirty rungs whatever intend—”

 “two hundred thirty rungs then”

 “the tunnel left hear me—”

 “how far along bedchamber” tyrion lifted foot lowest rung ladder

 “no sixty feet keep one hand wall go feel doors bedchamber third” sighed “this folly lord brother given life back would cast away mine it”

 “varys thing value less life wait here” turned back eunuch began climb counting silently went

 rung rung ascended darkness first could see dim outline rung grasped rough grey texture stone behind climbed black grew thicker thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen thirty arms trembled strain pulling paused moment catch breath glanced circle faint light shone far half obscured feet tyrion resumed ascent thirtynine forty fortyone fifty legs burned ladder endless numbing sixtyeight sixtynine seventy eighty back dull agony yet still climbed could said one thirteen one fourteen one fifteen

 two hundred thirty shaft black pitch could feel warm air flowing tunnel left like breath great beast poked awkwardly foot edged ladder tunnel even cramped shaft man normal size would crawl hands knees tyrion short enough walk upright last place made dwarfs boots scuffed softly stone walked slowly counting steps feeling gaps walls soon began hear voices muffled indistinct first clearer listened closely two father’s guardsmen joking imp’s whore saying sweet would fuck bad must want real cock place dwarf’s stunted little thing “most like it’s got crook it” said lum led discussion tyrion would die morrow “he’ll weep like woman beg mercy you’ll see” lum insisted lester figured he’d face axe brave lion lannister willing bet new boots “ah shit boots” said lum “you know they’d never fit feet o’ mine tell win scour bloody mail fortnight”

 space feet tyrion could hear every word haggling moved voices faded quickly small wonder varys want climb bloody ladder tyrion thought smiling dark little birds indeed

 came third door fumbled long time fingers brushed small iron hook set two stones pulled soft rumble sounded loud avalanche stillness square dull orange light opened foot left

 hearth almost laughed fireplace full hot ash black log hot orange heart burning within edged past gingerly taking quick steps burn boots warm cinders crunching softly heels found bedchamber stood long moment breathing silence father heard would reach sword raise hue cry

 “m’lord” woman’s voice called

 might hurt still felt pain first step hardest reached bed tyrion pulled draperies aside turning toward sleepy smile lips died saw pulled blankets chin would protect

 “were expecting someone taller sweetling”

 big wet tears filled eyes “i never meant things said queen made please father frightens so” sat letting blanket slide lap beneath naked chain throat chain linked golden hands holding next

 “my lady shae” tyrion said softly “all time sat black cell waiting die kept remembering beautiful silk roughspun nothing all…”

 “m’lord back soon go or… come take away”

 “did ever like it” cupped cheek remembering times done times he’d slid hands around waist squeezed small firm breasts stroked short dark hair touched lips cheeks ears times opened finger probe secret sweetness make moan “did ever like touch”

 “more anything” said “my giant lannister”

 worst thing could said sweetling

 tyrion slid hand father’s chain twisted links tightened digging neck “for hands gold always cold woman’s hands warm” said gave cold hands another twist warm ones beat away tears

 afterward found lord tywin’s dagger bedside table shoved belt lionheaded mace poleaxe crossbow hung walls poleaxe would clumsy wield inside castle mace high reach large woodandiron chest placed wall directly crossbow climbed pulled bow leather quiver packed quarrels jammed foot stirrup pushed bowstring cocked slipped bolt notch

 jaime lectured drawbacks crossbows lum lester emerged wherever talking he’d never time reload least he’d take one hell lum choice you’ll clean mail lum lose

 waddling door listened moment eased open slowly lamp burned stone niche casting wan yellow light empty hallway flame moving tyrion slid holding crossbow leg

 found father knew he’d find seated dimness privy tower bedrobe hiked around hips sound steps lord tywin raised eyes

 tyrion gave mocking half bow “my lord”

 “tyrion” afraid tywin lannister gave hint “who released cell”

 “i’d love tell swore holy oath”

 “the eunuch” father decided “i’ll head crossbow put down”

 “will punish refuse father”

 “this escape folly killed fear it’s still intent send wall could without lord tyrell’s consent put crossbow go back chambers talk it”

 “we talk well perhaps don’t choose go wall father it’s bloody cold believe i’ve enough coldness tell something i’ll way one simple question owe much”

 “i owe nothing”

 “you’ve given less life you’ll give tysha”

 “tysha”

 even remember name “the girl married”

 “oh yes first whore”

 tyrion took aim father’s chest “the next time say word i’ll kill you”

 “you courage”

 “shall find it’s short word seems come easily lips” tyrion gestured impatiently bow “tysha little lesson”

 “i don’t recall”

 “try harder killed”

 father pursed lips “there reason she’d learned place… well paid day’s work seem recall suppose steward sent way never thought inquire”

 “on way where”

 “wherever whores go”

 tyrion’s finger clenched crossbow whanged lord tywin started rise bolt slammed groin sat back grunt quarrel sunk deep right fletching blood seeped around shaft dripping pubic hair bare thighs “you shot me” said incredulously eyes glassy shock

 “you always quick grasp situation lord” tyrion said “that must you’re hand king”

 “you… no… son mine”

 “now that’s you’re wrong father believe i’m writ small kindness die quickly ship catch”

 father tyrion asked proof sudden stench bowels loosened moment death well right place tyrion thought stink filled privy gave ample evidence oftrepeated jape father another lie

 samwell


 king angry sam saw

 black brothers entered one one knelt stannis shoved away breakfast hardbread salt beef boiled eggs eyed coldly beside red woman melisandre looked found scene amusing

 place sam thought anxiously red eyes fell upon someone help maester aemon steps don’t look i’m maester’s steward others contenders old bear’s command bowen marsh withdrawn contest remained castellan lord steward sam understand melisandre seem interested

 king stannis kept black brothers knees extraordinarily long time “rise” said last sam gave maester aemon shoulder help back

 sound lord janos slynt clearing throat broke strained silence “your grace let say pleased summoned saw banners wall knew realm saved ‘there comes man neer forgets duty’ said good ser alliser ‘a strong man true king’ may congratulate victory savages singers make much know—”

 “the singers may like” stannis snapped “spare fawning janos serve you” rose feet frowned “lady melisandre tells yet chosen lord commander displeased much longer must folly last”

 “sire” said bowen marsh defensive tone “no one achieved twothirds vote yet ten days”

 “nine days long captives dispose realm order war fight choices must made decisions involve wall night’s watch rights lord commander voice decisions”

 “he yes” said janos slynt “but must said brothers simple soldiers soldiers yes grace know soldiers comfortable taking orders would benefit royal guidance seems good realm help choose wisely”

 suggestion outraged others “do want king wipe arses us too” said cotter pyke angrily “the choice lord commander belongs sworn brothers alone” insisted ser denys mallister “if choose wisely won’t choosing me” moaned dolorous edd maester aemon calm always said “your grace night’s watch choosing leader since brandon builder raised wall jeor mormont nine hundred ninetyseven lords commander unbroken succession chosen men would lead tradition many thousands years old”

 stannis ground teeth “it wish tamper rights traditions royal guidance janos mean ought tell brothers choose courage say so”

 took lord janos aback smiled uncertainly began sweat bowen marsh beside said “who better command black cloaks man commanded gold sire”

 “any would think even cook” look king gave slynt cold “janos hardly first gold cloak ever take bribe grant may first commander fatten purse selling places promotions end must half officers city watch paying part wages isn’t janos”

 slynt’s neck purpling “lies lies strong man makes enemies grace knows whisper lies behind back naught ever proven man came forward…”

 “two men prepared come forward died suddenly rounds” stannis narrowed eyes “do trifle lord saw proof jon arryn laid small council king would lost office promise robert shrugged away little lapses ‘they steal’ recall saying ‘better thief know one don’t next man might worse’ lord petyr’s words brother’s mouth i’ll warrant littlefinger nose gold i’m certain arranged matters crown profited much corruption yourself”

 lord slynt’s jowls quivering could frame protest maester aemon said “your grace law man’s past crimes transgressions wiped clean says words becomes sworn brother night’s watch”

 “i aware happens lord janos best night’s watch offer shall grit teeth choke naught man chosen long make choice war fight”

 “your grace” said ser denys mallister tones wary courtesy “if speaking wildlings…”

 “i know ser”

 “and must know whilst thankful aid rendered us mance rayder offer help contest throne night’s watch takes part wars seven kingdoms eight thousand years—”

 “i know history ser denys” king said brusquely “i give word shall ask lift swords rebels usurpers plague expect continue defend wall always have”

 “we’ll defend wall last man” said cotter pyke

 “probably me” said dolorous edd resigned tone

 stannis crossed arms “i shall require things well things may quick give want castles want gift”

 blunt words burst among black brothers like pot wildfire tossed onto brazier marsh mallister pyke tried speak king stannis let talk done said “i three times men take lands wish would prefer legally consent”

 “the gift given night’s watch perpetuity grace” bowen marsh insisted

 “which means cannot lawfully seized attainted taken given given again”

 “what gift” demanded cotter pyke

 “make better use castles eastwatch castle black shadow tower shall remain garrison always must take others garrisons hold wall”

 “you men” objected bowen marsh

 “some abandoned castles scarce ruins” said othell yarwyck first builder

 “ruins rebuilt”

 “rebuilt” yarwyck said “but work”

 “that concern shall require list detailing present state every castle might required restore mean garrisoned within year nightfires burning gates”

 “nightfires” bowen marsh gave melisandre uncertain look “we’re light nightfires now”

 “you are” woman rose swirl scarlet silk long copperbright hair tumbling shoulders “swords alone cannot hold darkness back light lord make mistake good sers valiant brothers war we’ve come fight petty squabble lands honors war life fail world dies us”

 officers know take sam could see bowen marsh othell yarwyck exchanged doubtful look janos slynt fuming threefinger hobb looked though would sooner back chopping carrots seemed surprised hear maester aemon murmur “it war dawn speak lady prince promised”

 “he stands you” melisandre declared “though eyes see stannis baratheon azor ahai come warrior fire prophecies fulfilled red comet blazed across sky herald coming bears lightbringer red sword heroes”

 words seemed make king desperately uncomfortable sam saw stannis ground teeth said “you called came lords must live die best get used that” made brusque gesture “that’s maester stay moment tarly rest may go”

 sam thought stricken brothers bowing making way want

 “you one killed creature snow” king stannis said four remained

 “sam slayer” melisandre smiled

 sam felt face turning red “no lady grace mean yes i’m samwell tarly yes”

 “your father able soldier” king stannis said “he defeated brother ashford mace tyrell pleased claim honors victory lord randyll decided matters tyrell ever found battlefield slew lord cafferen great valyrian sword sent head aerys” king rubbed jaw finger “you sort son would expect man have”

 “i… sort son wanted sire”

 “if taken black would make useful hostage” stannis mused

 “he taken black sire” maester aemon pointed

 “i well aware that” king said “i aware know aemon targaryen”

 old man inclined head “i aemon sire give house names forge maester’s chains”

 king gave curt nod say knew care “you slew creature obsidian dagger told” said sam

 “yyes grace jon snow gave me”

 “dragonglass” red woman’s laugh music “frozen fire tongue old valyria small wonder anathema cold children other”

 “on dragonstone seat much obsidian seen old tunnels beneath mountain” king told sam “chunks boulders ledges great part black recall green well red even purple sent word ser rolland castellan begin mining hold dragonstone much longer fear perhaps lord light shall grant us enough frozen fire arm creatures castle falls”

 sam cleared throat “ssire dagger… dragonglass shattered tried stab wight”

 melisandre smiled “necromancy animates wights yet still dead flesh steel fire serve ones call others something more”

 “demons made snow ice cold” said stannis baratheon “the ancient enemy enemy matters” considered sam “i told wildling girl passed beneath wall magic gate”

 “the bblack gate” sam stammered “below nightfort”

 “the nightfort largest oldest castles wall” king said “that intend make seat whilst fight war show gate”

 “i” said sam “i wwill if…” still open man black if…

 “you will” snapped stannis “i shall tell when”

 maester aemon smiled “your grace” said “before go wonder would us great honor showing us wondrous blade heard much of”

 “you want see lightbringer blind man”

 “sam shall eyes”

 king frowned “everyone else seen thing blind man” swordbelt scabbard hung peg near hearth took belt drew longsword steel scraped wood leather radiance filled solar shimmering shifting dance gold orange red light bright colors fire

 “tell samwell” maester aemon touched arm

 “it glows” said sam hushed voice “as fire flames steel yellow red orange flashing glimmering like sunshine water prettier wish could see maester”

 “i see sam sword full sunlight lovely behold” old man bowed stiffly “your grace lady kind “

 king stannis sheathed shining sword room seemed grow dark despite sunlight streaming window “very well you’ve seen may return duties remember said brothers chose lord commander tonight shall make wish had”

 maester aemon lost thought sam helped narrow turnpike stair crossing yard said “i felt heat sam”

 “heat sword” thought back “the air around shimmering way hot brazier”

 “yet felt heat scabbard held sword wood leather yes heard sound grace drew blade leather scorched sam wood seem burnt blackened”

 “no” sam admitted “not could see”

 maester aemon nodded back chambers asked sam set fire help chair beside hearth “it hard old” sighed settled onto cushion “and harder still blind miss sun books miss books all” aemon waved hand “i shall need till choosing”

 “the choosing… maester isn’t something could king said lord janos…”

 “i recall” maester aemon said “but sam maester chained sworn duty counsel lord commander whoever might would proper seen favor one contender another”

 “i’m maester” said sam “could something”

 aemon turned blind white eyes toward sam’s face smiled softy “why don’t know samwell could you”

 could sam thought right away hesitated certain lose courage man night’s watch reminded hurried across yard time quaked squeaked lord mormont much looked old sam fist first men craster’s keep wights coldhands dead horse braver gilly made braver he’d told jon true true

 cotter pyke scarier two commanders sam went first courage still hot found old shieldhall dicing three eastwatch men redheaded sergeant come dragonstone stannis

 sam begged leave speak though pyke barked order others took dice coins left

 man would ever call cotter pyke handsome though body studded brigantine roughspun breeches lean hard wiry strong eyes small closeset nose broken widow’s peak sharply pointed head spear pox ravaged face badly beard he’d grown hide scars thin scraggly

 “sam slayer” said way greeting “are sure stabbed child’s snow knight”

 isn’t starting well “it dragonglass killed lord” sam explained feebly

 “aye doubt well slayer maester send me”

 “the maester” sam swallowed “i… left lord” wasn’t truly lie pyke chose read wrong might make inclined listen sam took deep breath launched plea

 pyke cut he’d said twenty words “you want kneel kiss hem mallister’s pretty cloak might known lordlings flock like sheep well tell aemon he’s wasted breath time anyone withdraws mallister man’s bloody old job maybe ought go tell choose we’re like back year choosing someone else”

 “he’s old” sam agreed “but he’s well exexperienced”

 “at sitting tower fussing maps maybe plan write letters wights he’s knight well good he’s fighter don’t give kettle piss unhorsed fool tourney fifty years ago halfhand fought battles even old blind man see need fighter ever bloody king top us today it’s ruins empty fields well good grace want come morrow think mallister belly stand stannis baratheon red bitch” laughed “i don’t”

 “you won’t support then” said sam dismayed

 “are sam slayer deaf dick won’t support him” pyke jabbed finger face “understand boy don’t want bloody job never fight best deck beneath horse castle black far sea i’ll buggered redhot sword turn night’s watch preening eagle shadow tower run back old man tell said asks” stood “get sight”

 took courage sam left say “wwhat someone else could ssupport someone else”

 “who bowen marsh man counts spoons othell’s follower he’s told well more’n slynt… well men like i’ll grant would almost worth stick royal craw see stannis gagged there’s much king’s landing one toad grows wings thinks he’s bloody dragon” pyke laughed “who leave hobb could pick suppose who’s going boil mutton slayer look like man likes bloody mutton”

 nothing say defeated sam could stammer thanks take leave better ser denys tried tell walked castle ser denys knight highborn wellspoken treated sam courteously he’d found gilly road ser denys listen

 commander shadow tower born beneath booming tower seagard looked every inch mallister sable trimmed collar accented sleeves black velvet doublet silver eagle fastened claws gathered folds cloak beard white snow hair largely gone face deeply lined true yet still grace movements teeth mouth years dimmed neither bluegrey eyes courtesy

 “my lord tarly” said steward brought sam lance shadow tower men staying “i pleased see you’ve recovered ordeal might offer cup wine lady mother florent recall one day must tell time unhorsed grandfathers tourney today though know pressing concerns come maester aemon sure counsel offer me”

 sam took sip wine chose words care “a maester chained sworn… would proper seen influenced choice lord commander…”

 old knight smiled “which come yes quite understand samwell aemon old men wise matters say came say”

 wine sweet ser denys listened sam’s plea grave courtesy unlike cotter pyke done old knight shook head “i agree would dark day history king name lord commander king especially like keep crown long truly samwell ought pyke withdraws support better suited office”

 “you are” sam agreed “but cotter pyke might serve it’s said oft proved battle” mean offend ser denys praising rival else could convince withdraw

 “many brothers proved battle enough matters cannot settled battleaxe maester aemon understand though cotter pyke lord commander night’s watch lord first foremost must able treat lords… kings well must man worthy respect” ser denys leaned forward “we sons great lords know importance birth blood early training ne’er replaced squire twelve knight eighteen champion twoandtwenty commander shadow tower thirtythree years blood birth training fitted deal kings pyke… well hear morning asking grace would wipe bottom samwell habit speak unkindly brothers let us frank… ironborn race pirates thieves cotter pyke raping murdering still half boy maester harmune reads writes letters years loath disappoint maester aemon could honor stand aside pyke eastwatch”

 time sam ready “might someone else someone suitable”

 ser denys considered moment “i never desired honor sake last choosing stepped aside gratefully lord mormont’s name offered lord qorgyle choosing long night’s watch remains good hands content bowen marsh equal task othell yarwyck socalled lord harrenhal butcher’s whelp upjumped lannisters small wonder venal corrupt”

 “there’s another man” sam blurted “lord commander mormont trusted donal noye qhorin halfhand though he’s highly born comes old blood castleborn castleraised learned sword lance knight letters maester citadel father lord brother king”

 ser denys stroked long white beard “mayhaps” said long moment “he young but… mayhaps might serve grant though would suitable doubt would wiser choice”

 jon said could honor lie told right reason sam said “if choose lord commander tonight king stannis means name cotter pyke said much maester aemon morning left”

 “i see” ser denys rose “i must think thank samwell give thanks maester aemon well”

 sam trembling time left lance done thought said caught lie would… send wall rip entrails turn wight suddenly seemed absurd could frightened cotter pyke ser denys mallister seen raven eating small paul’s face

 “i need moment more” sam promised “you won’t withdraw ser denys said might someone else”

 “who time slayer you”

 “no fighter donal noye gave wall wildlings came old bear’s squire thing he’s bastardborn”

 cotter pyke laughed “bloody hell would shove spear mallister’s arse wouldn’t might worth bad could boy be” snorted “i’d better though i’m what’s needed fool see that”

 “any fool” sam agreed “even but… well shouldn’t telling but… king stannis means force ser denys us choose man tonight heard tell maester aemon rest sent away”

 iron emmett long lanky young ranger whose endurance strength swordsmanship pride eastwatch jon always came away sessions stiff sore woke next day covered bruises way wanted would never get better going likes satin horse even grenn

 days gave good got jon liked think today hardly slept last night hour restless tossing given even attempt dressed walked top wall till sun came wrestling stannis baratheon’s offer lack sleep catching emmett hammering mercilessly across yard driving back heels one long looping cut another slamming shield time time good measure jon’s arm gone numb shock impact edgeless practice sword seemed growing heavier every passing moment

 almost ready lower blade call halt emmett feinted low came shield savage forehand slash caught jon temple staggered helm head ringing force blow half heartbeat world beyond eyeslit blur

 years gone back winterfell wearing quilted leather coat place mail plate sword made wood robb stood facing iron emmett

 every morning trained together since big enough walk snow stark spinning slashing wards winterfell shouting laughing sometimes crying one else see little boys fought knights mighty heroes “i’m prince aemon dragonknight” jon would call robb would shout back “well i’m florian fool” robb would say “i’m young dragon” jon would reply “i’m ser ryam redwyne”

 morning called first “i’m lord winterfell” cried hundred times time time robb answered “you can’t lord winterfell you’re bastardborn lady mother says can’t ever lord winterfell”

 thought forgotten jon could taste blood mouth blow he’d taken

 end halder horse pull away iron emmett one man either arm ranger sat ground dazed shield half splinters visor helm knocked askew sword six yards away “jon enough” halder shouting “he’s disarmed enough”

 enough never enough jon let sword drop “i’m sorry” muttered “emmett hurt”

 iron emmett pulled battered helm “was part yield could comprehend lord snow” said amiably though emmett amiable man loved song swords “warrior defend me” groaned “now know qhorin halfhand must felt”

 much jon wrenched free friends retreated armory alone ears still ringing blow emmett dealt sat bench buried head hands angry asked stupid question lord winterfell could lord winterfell father’s heir

 sound voices echoing vaulted ceiling brought back castle black “i don’t know” man saying voice thick doubts “maybe knew man better… lord stannis didn’t much good say i’ll tell that”

 “when stannis baratheon ever much good say anyone” ser alliser’s flinty voice unmistakable “if let stannis choose lord commander become bannermen name tywin lannister like forget know lord tywin wins end he’s already beaten stannis blackwater”

 “lord tywin favors slynt” said bowen marsh fretful anxious voice “i show letter othell ‘our faithful friend servant’ called him”

 going back sleep sansa realized head tumult pushed pillow away reluctantly threw back blankets went window opened shutters

 snow falling eyrie

 outside flakes drifted soft silent memory woke already snowfall lay thick upon garden blanketing grass dusting shrubs statues white weighing branches trees sight took sansa back cold nights long ago long summer childhood

 last seen snow day she’d left winterfell lighter fall remembered robb melting flakes hair hugged snowball arya tried make kept coming apart hands hurt remember happy morning hullen helped mount she’d ridden snowflakes swirling around see great wide world thought song beginning day almost done

 sansa left shutters open dressed would cold knew though eyrie’s towers encircled garden protected worst mountain winds donned silken smallclothes linen shift warm dress blue lambswool two pairs hose legs boots laced knees heavy leather gloves finally hooded cloak soft white fox fur

 maid rolled tightly blanket snow began drift window sansa eased open door made way winding stair opened door garden lovely held breath unwilling disturb perfect beauty snow drifted ghostly silence lay thick unbroken ground color fled world outside place whites blacks greys white towers white snow white statues black shadows black trees dark grey sky pure world sansa thought belong

 yet stepped boots tore ankledeep holes smooth white surface snow yet made sound sansa drifted past frosted shrubs thin dark trees wondered still dreaming drifting snowflakes brushed face light lover’s kisses melted cheeks center garden beside statue weeping woman lay broken halfburied ground turned face sky closed eyes could feel snow lashes taste lips taste winterfell taste innocence taste dreams

 sansa opened eyes knees remember falling seemed sky lighter shade grey dawn thought another day another new day old days hungered prayed could pray garden meant godswood knew soil thin stony weirwood take root godswood without gods empty

 snow kept falling piling drifts around buildings fast raised patting pitched roof great hall heard voice looked see maid calling window lady well wish break fast sansa shook head went back shaping snow adding chimney one end great hall hearth would stand inside

 dawn stole garden like thief grey sky grew lighter still trees shrubs turned dark green beneath stoles snow servants came watched time paid mind soon went back inside warmer sansa saw lady lysa gazing balcony wrapped blue velvet robe trimmed fox fur looked aunt gone maester colemon popped rookery peered skinny shivering curious

 “that give strength enough stand i’d think” petyr said “may come castle lady”

 sansa wary “don’t break be…”

 “…gentle” smiled “winterfell withstood flercer enemies winterfell not”

 “yes” sansa admitted

 face grew serious “yes played false that… one thing well”

 sansa’s stomach aflutter “what thing”

 “i told nothing could please help castle fear lie well something else would please more” stepped closer “this”

 sansa tried step back pulled arms suddenly kissing feebly tried squirm succeeded pressing tightly mouth swallowing words tasted mint half heartbeat yielded kiss… turned face away wrenched free “what doing”

 petyr straightened cloak “kissing snow maid”

 “you’re supposed kiss her” sansa glanced lysa’s balcony empty “your lady wife”

 “i lysa cause complaint” smiled “i wish could see lady beautiful you’re crusted snow like little bear cub face flushed scarcely breathe long must cold let warm sansa take gloves give hands”

 “i won’t” sounded almost like marillion night he’d gotten drunk wedding time lothor brune would appear save ser lothor petyr’s man “you shouldn’t kiss might daughter…”

 “might been” admitted rueful smile “but you’re eddard stark’s daughter cat’s think might even beautiful mother age”

 “petyr please” voice sounded weak “please…”

 “a castle”

 “did make snow castle lord littlefinger”

 “alayne lord”

 sansa said “it’s meant winterfell”

 “winterfell” robert small eight stick boy splotchy skin eyes always runny one arm clutched threadbare cloth doll carried everywhere

 “it’s great” boy knelt gatehouse “look comes giant knock down” stood doll snow moved jerkily “tromp tromp i’m giant i’m giant” chanted “ho ho ho open gates i’ll mash smash them” swinging doll legs knocked top one gatehouse tower

 sansa could stand “robert stop that” instead swung doll foot wall exploded grabbed hand caught doll instead loud ripping sound thin cloth tore suddenly doll’s head robert legs body ragandsawdust stuffing spilling snow

 lord robert’s mouth trembled “you killlllllllllled him” wailed began shake started little shivering within short heartbeats collapsed across castle limbs flailing violently white towers snowy bridges shattered fell sides sansa stood horrified petyr baelish seized cousin’s wrists shouted maester

 guards serving girls arrived within instants help restrain boy maester colemon short time later robert arryn’s shaking sickness nothing new people eyrie lady lysa trained come rushing boy’s first cry maester held little lord’s head gave half cup dreamwine murmuring soothing words slowly violence fit seemed ebb away till nothing remained small shaking hands “help chambers” colemon told guards “a leeching help calm him”

 “it fault” sansa showed doll’s head “i ripped doll two never meant but…”

 “his lordship destroying castle” said petyr

 “a giant” boy whispered weeping “it wasn’t giant hurt castle killed hate she’s bastard hate don’t want leeched”

 “my lord blood needs thinning” said maester colemon “it bad blood makes angry rage brings shaking come now”

 led boy away lord husband sansa thought contemplated ruins winterfell snow stopped colder wondered lord robert would shake wedding least joffrey sound body mad rage seized hold picked broken branch smashed torn doll’s head top pushed atop shattered gatehouse snow castle servants looked aghast littlefinger saw she’d done laughed “if tales true that’s first giant end head winterfell’s walls”

 “those stories” said left

 back bedchamber sansa took cloak wet boots sat beside fire doubt would made answer lord robert’s fit perhaps lady lysa send away aunt quick banish anyone displeased nothing displeased quite much people suspected mistreating son

 sansa would welcomed banishment gates moon much larger eyrie livelier well lord nestor royce seemed gruff stern daughter myranda kept castle everyone said frolicsome even sansa’s supposed bastardy might count much one king robert’s baseborn daughters service lord nestor lady myranda said fast friends close sisters

 tell aunt don’t want marry robert even high septon could declare woman married refused say vows wasn’t beggar matter aunt said thirteen woman flowered wed heir winterfell sansa felt sorry little cousin sometimes could imagine ever wanting wife would sooner married tyrion lady lysa knew surely she’d send away… away robert’s pouts shakes runny eyes away marillion’s lingering looks away petyr’s kisses tell

 late afternoon lady lysa summoned sansa marshaling courage day sooner marillion appear door doubts returned “lady lysa requires presence high hall” singer’s eyes undressed spoke used

 marillion comely denying boyish slender smooth skin sandy hair charming smile made well hated vale everyone aunt little lord robert hear servants talk sansa first maid suffer advances others lothor brune defend lady lysa would hear complaints since coming eyrie singer become favorite sang lord robert sleep every night tweaked noses lady lysa’s suitors verses made mock foibles aunt showered gold gifts costly clothes gold arm ring belt studded moonstones fine horse even given late husband’s favorite falcon served make marillion unfailingly courteous lady lysa’s presence unfailingly arrogant outside

 “thank you” sansa told stiffly “i know way”

 would leave “my lady said bring you”

 bring like sound “are guardsman now” littlefinger dismissed eyrie’s captain guards put ser lothor brune place

 “do require guarding” marillion said lightly “i composing new song know song sweet sad melt even frozen heart ‘the roadside rose’ mean call baseborn girl beautiful bewitched every man laid eyes upon her”

 stark winterfell longed tell instead nodded let escort tower steps along bridge high hall closed long she’d eyrie sansa wondered aunt opened normally preferred comfort solar cozy warmth lord arryn’s audience chamber view waterfall

 two guards skyblue cloaks flanked carved wooden doors high hall spears hand “no one enter long alayne lady lysa” marillion told

 “aye” men let pass crossed spears marillion swung doors shut barred third spear longer thicker guards borne

 sansa felt prickle unease “why that”

 “my lady awaits you”

 looked uncertainly lady lysa sat dais highbacked chair carved weirwood alone right second chair taller stack blue cushions piled seat lord robert sansa hoped he’d recovered marillion like tell though

 sansa walked blue silk carpet rows fluted pillars slim lances floors walls high hall made milkwhite marble veined blue shafts pale daylight slanted narrow arched windows along eastern wall windows torches mounted high iron sconces none lit footsteps fell softly carpet outside wind blew cold lonely

 amidst much white marble even sunlight looked chilly somehow… though half chilly aunt lady lysa dressed gown creamcolored velvet necklace sapphires moonstones auburn hair done thick braid fell across one shoulder sat high seat watching niece approach face red puffy beneath paint powder wall behind hung huge banner moonandfalcon house arryn cream blue

 sansa stopped dais curtsied “my lady sent me” could still hear sound wind soft chords marillion playing foot hall

 “i saw did” lady lysa said

 sansa smoothed folds skirt “i trust lord robert better never meant rip doll smashing snow castle only…”

 “will play coy deceiver me” aunt said “i speaking robert’s doll saw kissing him”

 high hall seemed grow little colder walls floor columns might turned ice “he kissed me”

 lysa’s nostrils flared “and would wife loves woman grown little girl need likes confess child threw way it”

 sansa took step backward “that’s true”

 “where going afraid wanton behavior must punished hard keep whipping boy robert custom free cities health delicate bear rod shall find common girl take whipping first must you’ve done cannot abide liar alayne”

 “i building snow castle” sansa said “lord petyr helping kissed that’s saw”

 “have honor” aunt said sharply “or take fool don’t take fool yes see fool think man want you’re young beautiful don’t think haven’t seen looks give marillion know everything happens eyrie little lady known like mistaken think big eyes strumpet’s smiles win petyr mine” rose feet “they tried take lord father husband mother… catelyn liked kiss petyr oh yes did”

 sansa retreated another step “my mother”

 “yes mother precious mother sweet sister catelyn don’t think play innocent vile little liar years riverrun played petyr little toy teased smiles soft words wanton looks made nights torment”

 “no” mother dead wanted shriek sister she’s dead “she didn’t wouldn’t”

 “how would know there” lysa descended high seat skirts swirling “did come lord bracken lord blackwood time visited lay feud father lord bracken’s singer played us catelyn danced six dances petyr night six counted lords began argue father took audience chamber one stop us drinking edmure got drunk young was… petyr tried kiss mother pushed away laughed looked wounded thought heart would burst afterward drank passed table uncle brynden carried bed father could find like remember none you” looked angrily “do you”

 drunk mad “i born lady”

 “you born presume tell true know true kissed him”

 “he kissed me” sansa insisted “i never wanted—”

 “be quiet haven’t given leave speak enticed mother night riverrun smiles dancing think could forget night stole bed give comfort bled sweetest hurt told loved called cat fell back sleep even stayed sky began lighten mother deserve would even give favor wear fought brandon stark would given favor gave everything mine catelyn’s yours”

 sansa’s resolve withered face aunt’s onslaught lysa arryn frightening much queen cersei ever “he’s lady” said trying sound meek contrite “may leave go”

 “you may not” aunt’s breath smelled wine “if anyone else would banish send lord nestor gates moon back fingers would like spend life bleak shore surrounded slatterns sheep pellets father meant petyr everyone thought stupid duel brandon stark wasn’t father said ought thank gods great lord jon arryn willing take soiled knew swords marry jon father would turned brother petyr meant telling understand much love long suffered dreamed one another made baby together precious little baby” lysa put hands flat belly child still “when stole made promise would never let happen jon wished send sweet robert dragonstone sot king would given cersei lannister never let them… i’ll let steal petyr littlefinger hear alayne sansa whatever call hear telling you”

 “yes swear won’t ever kiss or… entice him” sansa thought aunt wanted hear

 “so admit thought wanton mother” lysa grabbed wrist “come something want show you”

 “you’re hurting me” sansa squirmed “please aunt lysa haven’t done anything swear it”

 aunt ignored protests “marillion” shouted “i need marillion need you”

 singer remained discreetly rear hall lady arryn’s shout came “my lady”

 “play us song play ‘the false fair’”

 marillions fingers brushed strings “the lord came ariding upon rainy day heynonny heynonny heynonnyhey…”

 lady lysa pulled sansa’s arm either walk dragged chose walk halfway hall pair pillars white weirwood door set marble wall door firmly closed three heavy bronze bars hold place sansa could hear wind outside worrying edges saw crescent moon carved wood planted feet “the moon door” tried yank free “why showing moon door”

 “you squeak like mouse bold enough garden weren’t bold enough snow”

 “the lady sat asewing upon rainy day” marillion sang “heynonny heynonny heynonnyhey”

 “open door” lysa commanded “open say i’ll send guards” shoved sansa forward “your mother brave least lift bars”

 says let go sansa grabbed one bronze bars yanked loose tossed second bar clattered marble third barely touched latch heavy wooden door flew inward slammed back wall bang snow piled around frame came blowing borne blast cold air left sansa shivering tried step backward aunt behind lysa seized wrist put hand shoulder blades propelling forcefully toward open door

 beyond white sky falling snow nothing else

 “look down” said lady lysa “look down”

 tried wrench free aunt’s fingers digging arm like claws lysa gave another shove sansa shrieked left foot broke crust snow knocked loose nothing front empty air waycastle six hundred feet clinging side mountain “don’t” sansa screamed “you’re scaring me” behind marillion still playing woodharp singing “heynonny heynonny heynonnyhey”

 “do still want leave go you”

 “no” sansa planted feet tried squirm backward aunt budge “not way please…” put hand fingers scrabbling doorframe could get grip feet sliding wet marble floor lady lysa pressed forward inexorably aunt outweighed three stone “the lady lay akissing upon mound hay” marillion singing sansa twisted sideways hysterical fear one foot slipped void screamed “heynonny heynonny heynonnyhey” wind flapped skirts bit bare legs cold teeth could feel snowflakes melting cheeks sansa flailed found lysa’s thick auburn braid clutched tight “my hair” aunt shrieked “let go hair” shaking sobbing teetered edge far heard guards pounding door spears demanding let marillion broke song

 “lysa what’s meaning this” shout cut sobs heavy breathing footsteps echoed high hall “get back lysa doing” guards still beating door littlefinger come back way lords’ entrance behind dais

 lysa turned grip loosened enough sansa rip free stumbled knees petyr baelish saw stopped suddenly “alayne trouble here”

 “her” lady lysa grabbed handful sansa’s hair “she’s trouble kissed you”

 “tell her” sansa begged “tell building castle…”

 “be quiet” aunt screamed “i never gave leave speak one cares castle”

 “she’s child lysa cat’s daughter think doing”

 “i going marry robert gratitude no… decency kiss teaching lesson all”

 “i see” stroked chin “i think understands isn’t alayne”

 “yes” sobbed sansa “i understand”

 “i don’t want here” aunt’s eyes shiny tears “why bring vale petyr isn’t place doesn’t belong here”

 “we’ll send away back king’s landing like” took step toward “let let away door”

 “no” lysa gave sansa’s head another wrench snow eddied around making skirts snap noisily “you can’t want can’t she’s stupid emptyheaded little girl doesn’t love way i’ve always loved i’ve proved haven’t i” tears ran aunt’s puffy red face “i gave maiden’s gift would given son murdered moon tea tansy mint wormwood spoon honey drop pennyroyal wasn’t never knew drank father gave me…”

 “that’s past done lysa lord hoster’s dead old maester well” littlefinger moved closer “have wine ought talk much don’t want alayne know marillion”

 lady lysa ignored “cat never gave anything got first post made jon bring court could close one another promised would never forget that”

 “nor we’re together always wanted always planned let go sansa’s hair…”

 “i won’t saw kissing snow she’s like mother catelyn kissed godswood never meant never wanted love best always meeee”

 “i know love” took another step “and need take hand come on” held “there’s cause tears”

 “tears tears tears” sobbed hysterically “no need tears… that’s said king’s landing told put tears jon’s wine robert us wrote catelyn told lannisters killed lord husband said clever… always clever told father said petyr’s clever he’ll rise high he’s sweet gentle little baby belly… kiss we’re together we’re together long long would want kiss herrrrrr”

 “lysa” petyr sighed “after storms we’ve suffered trust better swear shall never leave side long shall live”

 “truly” asked weeping “oh truly”

 “truly unhand girl come give kiss”

 lysa threw littlefinger’s arms sobbing hugged sansa crawled moon door hands knees wrapped arms around nearest pillar could feel heart pounding snow hair right shoe missing must fallen shuddered hugged pillar tighter

 littlefinger let lysa sob chest moment put hands arms kissed lightly “my sweet silly jealous wife” said chuckling “i’ve loved one woman promise you”

 lysa arryn smiled tremulously “only one oh petyr swear one”

 “only cat” gave short sharp shove

 lysa stumbled backward feet slipping wet marble gone never screamed longest time sound wind

 marillion gasped “you… you…”

 guards shouting outside door pounding butts heavy spears lord petyr pulled sansa feet “you’re hurt” shook head said “run let guards quick there’s time lose singer’s killed lady wife”





 epilogue


 road oldstones went twice around hill reaching summit overgrown stony would slow going even best times last night’s snow left muddy well snow autumn riverlands it’s unnatural merrett thought gloomily much snow true enough blanket ground night started melting away soon sun came still merrett took bad omen rains floods fire war lost two harvests good part third early winter would mean famine across riverlands great many people would go hungry would starve merrett hoped wouldn’t one may though luck may never luck

 beneath castle ruins lower slopes hill thickly forested half hundred outlaws could well lurking could watching even merrett glanced saw nothing gorse bracken thistle sedge blackberry bushes pines greygreen sentinels elsewhere skeletal elm ash scrub oaks choked ground like weeds saw outlaws meant little outlaws better hiding honest men

 merrett hated woods truth told hated outlaws even “outlaws stole life” known complain cups often cups father said often loudly true thought ruefully needed sort distinction twins else liable forget alive reputation biggest drinker castle done little enhance prospects he’d found hoped greatest knight ever couched lance gods took away shouldn’t cup wine time time helps headaches besides wife shrew father despises children worthless stay sober

 sober though well he’d two horns ale broke fast small cup red set keep head pounding merrett could feel headache building behind eyes knew gave half chance would soon feel thunderstorm raging ears sometimes headaches got bad even hurt much weep could rest bed dark room damp cloth eyes curse luck nameless outlaw done

 thinking made anxious could wise afford headache bring petyr back home safely luck change gold needed climb top oldstones meet bloody outlaws ruined castle make exchange simple ransom even could muck up… unless got headache one bad left unable ride supposed ruins sunset weeping huddle side road merrett rubbed two fingers temple around hill message come stepped forward offer carry ransom father squinted said “you merrett” started laughing nose hideous heh heh heh laugh merrett practically beg they’d give bloody bag gold

 something moved underbrush along side road merrett reined hard reached sword squirrel “stupid” told shoving sword back scabbard without ever gotten “outlaws don’t tails bloody hell merrett get hold yourself” heart thumping chest green boy first campaign kingswood old brotherhood going face lightning lord’s sorry lot brigands moment tempted trot right back hill find nearest alehouse bag gold would buy lot ale enough forget petyr pimple let hang brought it’s deserves wandering bloody camp follower like stag rut

 head begun pound soft knew would get worse merrett rubbed bridge nose really right think ill petyr age case got pox still shouldn’t condemn whores charms especially face like petyr’s poor lad wife sure half problem twice age bedding brother walder talk true always lots talk around twins little ever true case merrett believed black walder man took wanted even brother’s wife he’d edwyn’s wife common knowledge fair walda known slip bed time time even said he’d known seventh lady frey deal better small wonder refused marry buy cow udders around begging milked

 cursing breath merrett jammed heels horse’s flanks rode hill tempting drink gold away knew didn’t come back petyr pimple well come back

 lord walder would soon turn twoandninety ears started go eyes almost gone gout bad carried everywhere could possibly last much longer sons agreed goes everything change better father querulous stubborn iron wasp’s tongue believe taking care even ones displeased disappointed even ones whose names can’t remember gone though…

 ser stevron heir one thing old man grooming stevron sixty years pounded head blood blood stevron died whilst campaigning young wolf west—“of waiting doubt” lame lothar quipped raven brought news—and sons grandsons different sort frey stevron’s son ser ryman stood inherit thickwitted stubborn greedy man ryman came sons edwyn black walder even worse “fortunately” lame lothar said “they hate even hate us”

 merrett wasn’t certain fortunate matter lothar might dangerous either lord walder ordered slaughter starks roslin’s wedding lame lothar plotted roose bolton way songs would played lothar amusing fellow get drunk merrett would never foolish turn back twins learned early full blood siblings could trusted far

 like every son old man died every daughter well new lord crossing would doubtless keep uncles nephews cousins twins ones happened like trust likely ones thought would prove useful rest us he’ll shove fend

 prospect worried merrett words could say would forty less three years old take life hedge knight… even he’d knight happened wasn’t land wealth owned clothes back much else even horse riding wasn’t clever enough maester pious enough septon savage enough sellsword gods gave gift birth stinted good son rich powerful house ninth son took grandsons greatgrandsons account merrett stood better chance chosen high septon inheriting twins

 luck thought bitterly never bloody luck big man broad around chest shoulders middling height last ten years grown soft fleshy knew he’d younger merrett almost robust ser hosteen eldest full brother commonly regarded strongest lord walder frey’s brood boy he’d packed crakehall serve mother’s family page old lord sumner made squire everyone assumed would ser merrett years outlaws kingswood brotherhood pissed plans fellow squire jaime lannister covering glory merrett first caught pox camp follower managed get captured woman one called white fawn lord sumner ransomed back outlaws next fight he’d felled blow mace broken helm left insensible fortnight everyone gave dead told later

 merrett hadn’t died fighting days done even lightest blow head brought blinding pain reduced tears circumstances knighthood question lord sumner told unkindly sent back twins face lord walder’s poisonous disdain

 merrett’s luck grown worse father managed make good marriage somehow wed one lord darry’s daughters back darrys stood high king aerys’s favor seemed sooner deflowered bride aerys lost throne unlike freys darrys prominent targaryen loyalists cost half lands wealth almost power lady wife found great disappointment first insisted popping nothing girls years three live ones stillbirth one died infancy finally produced son eldest daughter turned slut second glutton ami caught stables fewer three grooms he’d forced marry bloody hedge knight situation could possibly get worse he’d thought… ser pate decided could win renown defeating ser gregor clegane ami come running back widow merrett’s dismay undoubted delight every stablehand twins

 merrett dared hope luck finally changing roose bolton chose wed walda instead one slimmer comelier cousins bolton alliance important house frey daughter helped secure thought must surely count something old man soon disabused “he picked she’s fat” lord walder said “you think bolton gave mummer’s fart whelp think sat thinking ‘heh merrett muttonhead that’s man need goodfather’ walda’s sow silk that’s picked i’m like thank we’d alliance half price little porkling put spoon time time”

 final humiliation delivered smile lame lothar summoned discuss role roslin’s wedding “we must play part according gifts” halfbrother told “you shall one task one task merrett believe well suited want see greatjon umber bloody drunk hardly stand let alone fight”

 even failed he’d cozened huge northman drinking enough wine kill three normal men yet roslin bedded greatjon still managed snatch sword first man accost break arm snatching taken eight get chains effort left two men wounded one dead poor old ser leslyn haigh short half ear couldn’t fight hands longer umber fought teeth

 merrett paused moment closed eyes head throbbing like bloody drum they’d played wedding moment could stay saddle go told could bring back petyr pimple surely would put ser ryman’s good graces petyr might whisker hapless side wasn’t cold edwyn hot black walder boy grateful part father see i’m loyal man worth

 sunset gold merrett glanced sky right time needed something steady hands pulled waterskin hung saddle uncorked took long swallow wine thick sweet dark almost black gods tasted good

 curtain wall oldstones encircled brow hill like crown king’s head foundation remained waisthigh piles crumbling stone spotted lichen merrett rode along line wall came place gatehouse would stood ruins extensive dismount lead palfrey west sun vanished behind bank low clouds gorse bracken covered slopes inside vanished walls weeds chest high merrett loosened sword scabbard looked warily saw outlaws could come wrong day stopped rubbed temples thumbs nothing ease pressure behind eyes seven bloody hells…

 somewhere deep within castle faint music came drifting trees

 merrett found shivering despite cloak pulled open waterskin another drink wine could get back horse ride oldtown drink gold away good ever came dealing outlaws vile little bitch wenda burned fawn cheek arse captive wonder wife despised go petyr pimple might lord crossing one day edwyn sons black walder’s got bastards petyr remember came get took another swallow corked skin led palfrey broken stones gorse thin windwhipped trees following sounds castle ward

 fallen leaves lay thick upon ground like soldiers great slaughter man patched faded greens sitting crosslegged atop weathered stone sepulcher fingering strings woodharp music soft sad merrett knew song high halls kings gone jenny would dance ghosts…

 “get there” merrett said “you’re sitting king”

 “old tristifer don’t mind bony arse hammer justice called long since heard new songs” outlaw hopped trim slim narrow face foxy features mouth wide smile seemed touch ears strands thin brown hair blowing across brow pushed back free hand said “do remember lord”

 “no” merrett frowned “why would i”

 “i sang daughter’s wedding passing well thought pate married cousin we’re cousins sevenstreams didn’t stop turning niggard time pay me” shrugged “why lord father never play twins don’t make enough noise lordship likes loud hearing”

 “you bring gold” asked harsher voice behind

 merrett’s throat dry bloody outlaws always hiding bushes kingswood you’d think you’d caught five ten would spring nowhere

 turned around illfavored gaggle leathery old men smoothcheeked lads younger petyr pimple lot clad roughspun rags boiled leather bits dead men’s armor one woman bundled hooded cloak three times big merrett flustered count seemed dozen least maybe score

 “i asked question” speaker big bearded man crooked green teeth broken nose taller merrett though heavy belly halfhelm covered head patched yellow cloak broad shoulders “where’s gold”

 “in saddlebag hundred golden dragons” merrett cleared throat “you’ll get see petyr—”

 squat oneeyed outlaw strode forward could finish reached saddlebag bold please found sack merrett started grab thought better outlaw opened drawstring removed coin bit “tastes right” hefted sack “feels right too”

 they’re going take gold keep petyr merrett thought sudden panic “that’s whole ransom asked for” palms sweating wiped breeches “which one beric dondarrion” dondarrion lord turned outlaw might still man honor

 “why would me” said oneeyed man

 “you’re bloody liar jack” said big bearded man yellow cloak “it’s turn lord beric”

 “does mean thoros” singer laughed “my lord sad say lord beric needed elsewhere times troubled many battles fight we’ll sort would fear”

 merrett plenty fear head pounding much he’d sobbing “you gold” said “give nephew i’ll gone” petyr actually great halfnephew need go

 “he’s godswood” said man yellow cloak “we’ll take notch hold horse”

 merrett handed bridle reluctantly see choice “my water skin” heard say “a swallow wine settle my—”

 “we don’t drink sort” yellow cloak said curtly “it’s way follow me”

 leaves crunched beneath heels every step sent spike pain merrett’s temple walked silence wind gusting around last light setting sun eyes clambered mossy hummocks remained keep behind godswood

 petyr pimple hanging limb oak noose tight around long thin neck eyes bulged black face staring merrett accusingly came late seemed say hadn’t hadn’t come told “you killed him” croaked

 “sharp blade one” said oneeyed man

 aurochs thundering merrett’s head mother mercy thought “i brought gold”

 “that good you” said singer amiably “we’ll see it’s put good use”

 merrett turned away petyr could taste bile back throat “you… right”

 “we rope” said yellow cloak “that’s right enough”

 two outlaws seized merrett’s arms bound tight behind back deep shock struggle “no” could manage “i came ransom petyr said gold sunset wouldn’t harmed…”

 “well” said singer “you’ve got us lord lie sorts happens”

 oneeyed outlaw came forward long coil hempen rope looped one end around merrett’s neck pulled tight tied hard knot ear end threw limb oak big man yellow cloak caught

 “what doing” merrett knew stupid sounded could believe happening even “you’d never dare hang frey”

 yellow cloak laughed “that one pimply boy said thing”

 doesn’t mean cannot mean “my father pay i’m worth good ransom petyr twice much”

 singer sighed “lord walder might halfblind gouty he’s stupid snap bait twice next time he’ll send hundred swords instead hundred dragons fear”

 “he will” merrett tried sound stem voice betrayed “he’ll send thousand swords kill all”

 “he catch us first” singer glanced poor petyr “and can’t hang us twice he” drew melancholy air strings woodharp “here don’t soil need answer question i’ll tell let go”

 merrett would tell anything meant life “what want know i’ll tell true swear it”

 outlaw gave encouraging smile “well happens we’re looking dog ran away”

 “a dog” merrett lost “what kind dog”

 “he answers name sandor clegane thoros says making twins found ferrymen took across trident poor sod robbed kingsroad see wedding perchance”

 “the red wedding” merrett’s skull felt split best recall much confusion surely someone would mentioned joffrey’s dog sniffing round twins “he wasn’t castle main feast… might bastard feast camps but… someone would said…”

 “he would child him” said singer “a skinny girl ten perhaps boy age”

 “i don’t think so” said merrett “not knew”

 “no ah that’s pity well go”

 “no” merrett squealed loudly “no don’t gave answer said you’d let go”

 “seems said i’d tell let go” singer looked yellow cloak “lem let go”

 “go bugger yourself” big outlaw replied brusquely

 singer gave merrett helpless shrug began play “the day hanged black robin”

 “please” last merrett’s courage running leg “i’ve done harm brought gold way said answered question children”

 “that young wolf never will” said oneeyed outlaw

 merrett could hardly think pounding head “he shamed us whole realm laughing cleanse stain honor” father said

 “maybe bunch o’ bloody peasants know lord’s honor” yellow cloak wrapped end rope around hand three times “we know murder though”

 “not murder” voice shrill “it vengeance right vengeance war aegon called jinglebell poor lackwit never hurt anyone lady stark cut throat lost half hundred men camps ser garse goodbrook kyra’s husband ser tytos jared’s son… someone smashed head axe… stark’s direwolf killed four wolfhounds tore kennelmaster’s arm shoulder even we’d filled full quarrels…”

 “so sewed head robb stark’s neck o’ dead” said yellow cloak

 “my father drink wouldn’t kill man drinking” merrett remembered something something might saving “they say lord beric always gives man trial won’t kill man unless something’s proved can’t prove anything red wedding father’s work ryman’s lord bolton’s lothar rigged tents collapse put crossbowmen gallery musicians bastard walder led attack camps… they’re ones want drank wine… witness”

 “as happens you’re wrong there” singer turned hooded woman “milady”

 outlaws parted came forward saying word lowered hood something tightened inside merrett’s chest moment could breathe saw die dead day night stripped naked threw body river raymund opened throat ear ear dead

 cloak collar hid gash brother’s blade made face even worse remembered flesh gone pudding soft water turned color curdled milk half hair gone rest turned white brittle crone’s beneath ravaged scalp face shredded skin black blood raked nails eyes terrible thing eyes saw hated

 “she don’t speak” said big man yellow cloak “you bloody bastards cut throat deep remembers” turned dead woman said “what say m’lady part it”

 lady catelyn’s eyes never left nodded

 merrett frey opened mouth plead noose choked words feet left ground rope cutting deep soft flesh beneath chin air jerked kicking twisting

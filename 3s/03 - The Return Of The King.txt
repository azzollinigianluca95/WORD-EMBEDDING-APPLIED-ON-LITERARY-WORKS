 minas tirith

 pippin looked shelter gandalf's cloak wondered awake still sleeping still swiftmoving dream wrapped long since great ride began dark world rushing wind sang loudly ears could see nothing wheeling stars away right vast shadows sky mountains south marched past sleepily tried reckon times stages journey memory drowsy uncertain
 first ride terrible speed without halt dawn seen pale gleam gold come silent town great empty house hill hardly reached shelter winged shadow passed men wilted fear gandalf spoken soft words slept corner tired uneasy dimly aware comings goings men talking gandalf giving orders riding riding night second third night since looked stone hideous memory woke fully shivered noise wind became filled menacing voices
 light kindled sky blaze yellow fire behind dark barriers pippin cowered back afraid moment wondering dreadful country gandalf bearing rubbed eyes saw moon rising eastern shadows almost full night yet old hours dark journey would go stirred spoke
 'where gandalf' asked
 'in realm gondor' wizard answered 'the land an�rien still passing by'
 silence 'what that' cried pippin suddenly clutching gandalf's cloak 'look fire red fire dragons land look another'
 answer gandalf cried aloud horse 'on shadowfax must hasten time short see beacons gondor alight calling aid war kindled see fire amon d�n flame eilenach go speeding west nardol erelas minrimmon calenhad halifirien borders rohan'
 shadowfax paused stride slowing walk lifted head neighed darkness answering neigh horses came presently thudding hoofs heard three riders swept passed like flying ghosts moon vanished west shadowfax gathered together sprang away night flowed like roaring wind
 pippin became drowsy paid little attention gandalf telling customs gondor lord city beacons built tops outlying hills along borders great range maintained posts points fresh horses always readiness bear errandriders rohan north belfalas south 'it long since beacons north lit' said 'and ancient days gondor needed seven stones' pippin stirred uneasily
 'sleep afraid' said gandalf 'for going like frodo mordor minas tirith safe anywhere days gondor falls ring taken shire refuge'
 'you comfort me' said pippin nonetheless sleep crept last thing remembered fell deep dream glimpse high white peaks glimmering like floating isles clouds caught light westering moon wondered frodo already mordor dead know frodo far away looked moon set beyond gondor ere coming day

 pippin woke sound voices another day hiding night journey fleeted twilight cold dawn hand chill grey mists shadowfax stood steaming sweat held neck proudly showed sign weariness many tall men heavily cloaked stood beside behind mist loomed wall stone partly ruinous seemed already night passed sound hurried labour could heard beat hammers clink trowels creak wheels torches flares glowed dully fog gandalf speaking men barred way listened pippin became aware discussed
 'yea truly know mithrandir' said leader men 'and know passwords seven gates free go forward know companion dwarf mountains north wish strangers land time unless mighty men arms whose faith help trust'
 'i vouch seat denethor' said gandalf 'and valour cannot computed stature passed battles perils ingold though twice height comes storming isengard bear tidings great weariness would wake name peregrin valiant man'
 'man' said ingold dubiously others laughed
 'man' cried pippin thoroughly roused 'man indeed hobbit valiant man save perhaps necessity let gandalf deceive you'
 'many doer great deeds might say more' said ingold 'but hobbit'
 'a halfling' answered gandalf 'nay one spoken of' added seeing wonder men's faces 'not yet one kindred'
 'yes one journeyed him' said pippin 'and boromir city us saved snows north last slain defending many foes'
 'peace' said gandalf 'the news grief told first father'
 'it guessed already' said ingold 'for strange portents late pass quickly lord minas tirith eager see bear latest tidings son man or'
 'hobbit' said pippin 'little service offer lord would remembering boromir brave'
 'fare well' said ingold men made way shadow fax passed narrow gate wall 'may bring good counsel denethor need us mithrandir' ingold cried 'but come tidings grief danger wont say'
 'because come seldom help needed' answered gandalf 'and counsel would say overlate repairing wall pelennor courage best defence storm hand � hope bring tidings bring evil leave trowels sharpen swords'
 'the work finished ere evening' said ingold 'this last portion wall put defence least open attack looks towards friends rohan know aught answer summons think you'
 'yes come fought many battles back road road looks towards safety longer vigilant gandalf stormcrow would seen host foes coming an�rien riders rohan may yet fare well sleep not'

 gandalf passed wide land beyond rammas echor men gondor called wall built great labour ithilien fell shadow enemy ten leagues ran mountains' feet back enclosing fence fields pelennor fair fertile townlands long slopes terraces falling deep levels anduin furthest point great gate city northeastward wall four leagues distant frowning bank overlooked long flats beside river men made high strong point upon walled causeway road came fords bridges osgiliath passed guarded gate embattled towers nearest point wall little one league city southeastward anduin going wide knee hills emyn arnen south ithilien bent sharply west outwall rose upon brink beneath lay quays landings harlond craft came upstream southern fiefs
 townlands rich wide tilth many orchards homesteads oast garner fold byre many rills rippling green highlands anduin yet herdsmen husbandmen dwelt many part people gondor lived seven circles city high vales mountainborders lossarnach south fair lebennin five swift streams dwelt hardy folk mountains sea reckoned men gondor yet blood mingled short swarthy folk among whose sires came forgotten men housed shadow hills dark years ere coming kings beyond great fief belfalas dwelt prince imrahil castle dol amroth sea high blood folk also tall men proud seagrey eyes
 gandalf ridden time light day grew sky pippin roused looked left lay sea mist rising bleak shadow east right great mountains reared heads ranging west steep sudden end making land river burst great barrier carving mighty valley land battle debate times come white mountains ered nimrais came end saw gandalf promised dark mass mount mindolluin deep purple shadows high glens tall face whitening rising day upon outthrust knee guarded city seven walls stone strong old seemed builded carven giants bones earth
 even pippin gazed wonder walls passed looming grey white blushing faintly dawn suddenly sun climbed eastern shadow sent forth shaft smote face city pippin cried aloud tower ecthelion standing high within topmost walls' shone sky glimmering like spike pearl silver tall fair shapely pinnacle glittered wrought crystals white banners broke fluttered battlements morning breeze' high far heard clear ringing silver trumpets

 gandalf peregrin rode great gate men gondor rising sun iron doors rolled back
 'mithrandir mithrandir' men cried 'now know storm indeed nigh'
 'it upon you' said gandalf 'i ridden wings let pass must come lord denethor stewardship lasts whatever betide come end gondor known let pass'
 men fell back command voice questioned though gazed wonder hobbit sat horse bore people city used horses little seldom seen streets save ridden errandriders lord said 'surely one great steeds king rohan maybe rohirrim come soon strengthen us' shadowfax walked proudly long winding road

 fashion minas tirith built seven levels delved hill set wall wall gate gates set line great gate city wall east point circuit next faced half south third half north fro upwards paved way climbed towards citadel turned first way across face hill time passed line great gate went arched tunnel piercing vast pier rock whose huge outthrust bulk divided two circles city save first partly primeval shaping hill partly mighty craft labour old stood rear wide court behind gate towering bastion stone edge sharp shipkeel facing east rose even level topmost circle crowned battlement citadel might like mariners mountainous ship look peak sheer upon gate seven hundred feet entrance citadel also looked eastward delved heart rock thence long lamplit slope ran seventh gate thus men reached last high court place fountain feet white tower tall shapely fifty fathoms base pinnacle banner stewards floated thousand feet plain
 strong citadel indeed taken host enemies within could hold weapons unless foe could come behind scale lower skirts mindolluin come upon narrow shoulder joined hill guard mountain mass shoulder rose height fifth wall hedged great ramparts right precipice overhung western end space stood houses domed tombs bygone kings lords ever silent mountain tower

 pippin gazed growing wonder great stone city vaster splendid anything dreamed greater stronger isengard far beautiful yet truth falling year year decay already lacked half men could dwelt ease every street passed great house court whose doors arched gates carved many fair letters strange ancient shapes names pippin guessed great men kindreds dwelt yet silent footsteps rang wide pavements voice heard halls face looked door empty window
 last came shadow seventh gate warm sun shone beyond river frodo walked glades ithilien glowed smooth walls rooted pillars great arch keystone carven likeness crowned kingly head gandalf dismounted horse allowed citadel shadowfax suffered led away soft word master
 guards gate robed black helms strange shape highcrowned long cheekguards closefitting face cheekguards set white wings seabirds helms gleamed flame silver indeed wrought _mithril_ heirlooms glory old days upon black surcoats embroidered white tree blossoming like snow beneath silver crown manypointed stars livery heirs elendil none wore gondor save guards citadel court fountain white tree grown

 already seemed word coming gone admitted silently without question quickly gandalf strode across whitepaved court sweet fountain played morning sun sward bright green lay midst drooping pool stood dead tree falling drops dripped sadly barren broken branches back clear water
 pippin glanced hurried gandalf looked mournful thought wondered dead tree left place everything else well tended
 _seven stars seven stones one white tree_
 words gandalf murmured came back mind found doors great hall beneath gleaming tower behind wizard passed tall silent doorwardens entered cool echoing shadows house stone
 walked paved passage long empty went gandalf spoke softly pippin 'be careful words master peregrin time hobbit pertness th�oden kindly old man denethor another sort proud subtle man far greater lineage power though called king speak question much since tell son boromir loved greatly much perhaps unlike cover love think easier learn witches rather tell need leave quiet matter frodo's errand deal due time say nothing aragorn either unless must'
 'why wrong strider' pippin whispered 'he meant come he'll arriving soon anyway'
 'maybe maybe' said gandalf 'though comes likely way one expects even denethor better least come unheralded us'
 gandalf halted tall door polished metal 'see master pippin time instruct history gondor though might better learned something still birdsnesting playing truant woods shire bid scarcely wise bringing news death heir mighty lord speak much coming one comes claim kingship enough'
 'kingship' said pippin amazed
 'yes' said gandalf 'if walked days closed ears mind asleep wake now' knocked door

 door opened one could seen open pippin looked great hall lit deep windows wide aisles either side beyond rows tall pillars upheld roof monoliths black marble rose great capitals carved many strange figures beasts leaves far shadow wide vaulting gleamed dull gold inset flowing traceries many colours hangings storied webs things woven stuff wood seen long solemn hall pillars stood silent company tall images graven cold stone
 suddenly pippin reminded hewn rocks argonath awe fell looked avenue kings long dead far end upon dais many steps set high throne canopy marble shaped like crowned helm behind carved upon wall set gems image tree flower throne empty foot dais upon lowest step broad deep stone chair black unadorned sat old man gazing lap hand white rod golden knob look solemnly paced long floor towards stood three paces footstool gandalf spoke
 'hail lord steward minas tirith denethor son ecthelion come counsel tidings dark hour'
 old man looked pippin saw carven face proud bones skin like ivory long curved nose dark deep eyes reminded much boromir aragorn 'dark indeed hour' said old man 'and times wont come mithrandir though signs forebode doom gondor drawing nigh less darkness darkness told bring one saw son die he'
 'it is' said gandalf 'one twain th�oden rohan may come hereafter halflings see yet omens spoke'
 'yet halfling still' said denethor grimly 'and little love bear name since accursed words came trouble counsels drew away son wild errand death boromir need faramir gone stead'
 'he would gone' said gandalf 'be unjust grief boromir claimed errand would suffer masterful man one take desired journeyed far learned much mood speak death news ere came'
 'i received this' said denethor laying rod lifted lap thing gazing hand held one half great horn cloven middle wildox horn bound silver
 'that horn boromir always wore' cried pippin
 'verily' said denethor 'and turn bore eldest son house far back vanished years failing kings since vorondil father mardil hunted wild kine araw far fields rh�n heard blowing dim upon northern marches thirteen days ago river brought broken wind more' paused heavy silence suddenly turned black glance upon pippin 'what say halfling'
 'thirteen thirteen days' faltered pippin 'yes think would yes stood beside blew horn help came orcs'
 'so' said denethor looking keenly pippin's face 'you tell help come escape yet mighty man orcs withstand him'
 pippin flushed forgot fear 'the mightiest man may slain one arrow' said 'and boromir pierced many last saw sank beside tree plucked blackfeathered shaft side swooned made captive saw know honour memory valiant died save us kinsman meriadoc waylaid woods soldiery dark lord though fell failed gratitude none less'
 pippin looked old man eye pride stirred strangely within still stung scorn suspicion cold voice 'little service doubt great lord men think find hobbit halfling northern shire yet offer payment debt' twitching aside grey cloak pippin drew forth small sword laid denethor's feet
 pale smile like gleam cold sun winter's evening passed old man's face bent head held hand laying shards horn aside 'give weapon' said
 pippin lifted presented hilt 'whence came this' said denethor 'many many years lie surely blade wrought kindred north deep past'
 'it came mounds lie borders country ' said pippin 'but evil wights dwell willingly tell them'
 'i see strange tales woven you' said denethor 'and shown looks may belie man � halfling accept service daunted words courteous speech strange though sound may us south shall need folk courtesy great small days come swear now'
 'take hilt' said gandalf 'and speak lord resolved this'
 'i am' said pippin
 old man laid sword along lap pippin put hand hilt said slowly denethor
 'here swear fealty service gondor lord steward realm speak silent let come go need plenty peace war living dying hour henceforth lord release death take world end say peregrin son paladin shire halflings'
 hear denethor son ecthelion lord gondor steward high king forget fail reward given fealty love valour honour oathbreaking vengeance' pippin received back sword put sheath
 'and now' said denethor 'my first command speak silent tell full tale see recall boromir son sit begin' spoke struck small silver gong stood near footstool servants came forward pippin saw standing alcoves either side door unseen gandalf entered
 'bring wine food seats guests' said denethor 'and see none trouble us one hour'
 'it spare much else heed' said gandalf 'much import may seem yet less pressing maybe speak end day'
 'and earlier hoped' said gandalf 'for ridden hither isengard one hundred fifty leagues speed wind bring one small warrior however courteous naught th�oden fought great battle isengard overthrown broken staff saruman'
 'it much know already sufficient deeds counsel menace east' turned dark eyes gandalf pippin saw likeness two felt strain almost saw line smouldering fire drawn eye eye might suddenly burst flame
 denethor looked indeed much like great wizard gandalf kingly beautiful powerful older yet sense sight pippin perceived gandalf greater power deeper wisdom majesty veiled older far older 'how much older' wondered thought odd never thought treebeard said something wizards even thought gandalf one gandalf far time place come world would leave musings broke saw denethor gandalf still looked eye reading other's mind denethor first withdrew gaze
 'yea' said 'for though stones lost say still lords gondor keener sight lesser men many messages come sit now'

 men came bearing chair low stool one brought salver silver flagon cups white cakes pippin sat could take eyes old lord imagined spoke stones sudden gleam eye glanced upon pippin's face
 'now tell tale liege' said denethor half kindly half mockingly 'for words one son befriended welcome indeed'
 pippin never forgot hour great hall piercing eye lord gondor stabbed ever anon shrewd questions conscious gandalf side watching listening pippin felt holding check rising wrath impatience hour denethor rang gong pippin felt worn 'it cannot nine o'clock' thought 'i could eat three breakfasts end'
 'lead lord mithrandir housing prepared him' said denethor 'and companion may lodge present known sworn service shall known peregrin son paladin taught lesser passwords send word captains shall wait soon may third hour rung
 'and lord mithrandir shall come none shall hinder coming time save brief hours sleep let wrath old man's folly run return comfort'
 'folly' said gandalf 'nay lord dotard die use even grief cloak think understand purpose questioning hour one knows least sit by'
 'if understand content' returned denethor 'pride would folly disdained help counsel need deal gifts according designs yet lord gondor made tool men's purposes however worthy purpose higher world stands good gondor rule gondor lord mine man's unless king come again'
 'unless king come again' said gandalf 'well lord steward task keep kingdom still event look see task shall aid pleased ask say rule realm mine neither gondor great small worthy things peril world stands care part shall wholly fail task though gondor perish anything passes night still grow fair bear fruit flower days come also steward know' turned strode hall pippin running side
 gandalf look pippin speak word went guide brought doors hall led across court fountain lane tall buildings stone several turns came house close wall citadel upon north side far shoulder linked hill mountain within upon first floor street wide carven stair showed fair room light airy goodly hangings dull gold sheen unfigured sparely furnished small table two chairs bench either side curtained alcoves wellclad beds within vessels basins washing three high narrow windows looked northward great curve anduin still shrouded mists towards emyn muil rauros far away pippin climb bench look deep stone sill
 'are angry gandalf' said guide went closed door 'i best could'
 'you indeed' said gandalf laughing suddenly came stood beside pippin putting arm hobbit's shoulders gazing window pippin glanced wonder face close beside sound laugh gay merry yet wizard's face saw first lines care sorrow though looked intently perceived great joy fountain mirth enough set kingdom laughing gush forth
 'indeed best' said wizard 'and hope may long find tight corner two terrible old men still lord gondor learned may guessed pippin could hide fact boromir lead company moria one among high honour coming minas tirith famous sword men think much stories old days gondor denethor given long thought rhyme words _isildur's bane_ since boromir went away
 'he men time pippin whatever descent father son chance blood westernesse runs nearly true son faramir yet boromir loved best long sight perceive bends thither much passing minds men even dwell far difficult deceive dangerous try
 'remember sworn service know put head heart well done hinder generous deed checked cold counsel touched heart well may say pleasing humour least free move minas tirith � duty another side command forget wary still'
 fell silent sighed 'well need brood tomorrow may bring one thing tomorrow certain bring worse today many days come nothing help board set pieces moving one piece greatly desire find faramir heir denethor think city time gather news must go pippin must go lords' council learn enemy move open full game pawns likely see much peregrin son paladin soldier gondor sharpen blade'
 gandalf went door turned 'i haste pippin' said 'do favour go even rest weary go find shadowfax see housed people kindly beasts good wise folk less skill horses some'

 gandalf went came note clear sweet bell ringing tower citadel three strokes rang like silver air ceased third hour rising sun
 minute pippin went door stair looked street sun shining warm bright towers tall houses cast long clearcut shadows westward high blue air mount mindolluin lifted white helm snowy cloak armed men went fro ways city going striking hour changes post duty
 'nine o'clock we'd call shire' said pippin aloud 'just time nice breakfast open window spring sunshine like breakfast people ever dinner where'
 presently noticed man clad black white coming along narrow street centre citadel towards pippin felt lonely made mind speak man passed need man came straight
 'you peregrin halfling' said 'i told sworn service lord city welcome held hand pippin took
 'i named beregond son baranor duty morning sent teach passwords tell many things doubt wish know part would learn also never seen halfling land though heard rumour little said tale know moreover friend mithrandir know well'
 'well' said pippin 'i known _of_ short life might say lately travelled far much read book cannot claim seen page two yet perhaps know well aragorn one company think really knew him'
 'aragorn' said beregond 'who he'
 'oh' stammered pippin 'he man went us think rohan now'
 'you rohan hear much would ask land also put much little hope people forgetting errand first answer would ask would know master peregrin'
 'er well' said pippin 'if may venture say rather burning question mind present well breakfast mean mealtimes understand diningroom one inns looked never one could see rode though borne hope draught ale soon came homes wise courtly men'
 beregond looked gravely 'an old campaigner see' said 'they say men go warring afield look ever next hope food drink though travelled man yet eaten today'
 'well yes speak courtesy yes' said pippin 'but cup wine white cake two kindness lord racked hour questions hungry work'
 beregond laughed 'at table small men may greater deeds say broken fast well man citadel greater honour fortress tower guard posture war rise ere sun take morsel grey light go duties opening hour despair' laughed seeing dismay pippin's face 'those heavy duty take somewhat refresh strength midmorning nuncheon noon duties allow men gather daymeal mirth still may hour sunset
 'come walk little go find us refreshment eat drink battlement survey fair morning'
 'one moment' said pippin blushing 'greed hunger courtesy put mind gandalf mithrandir call asked see horse � shadowfax great steed rohan apple king's eye told though given mithrandir services think new master loves beast better loves many men good value city treat shadowfax honour greater kindness treated hobbit possible'
 'hobbit' said beregond
 'that call ourselves' said pippin
 'i glad learn it' said beregond 'for may say strange accents mar fair speech hobbits fairspoken folk come shall make acquainted good horse love beasts see seldom stony city people came mountainvales ithilien fear visit shall short mere call courtesy go thence butteries'

 pippin found shadowfax well housed tended sixth circle outside walls citadel fair stables swift horses kept hard lodgings errandriders lord messengers always ready go urgent command denethor chief captains horses riders away
 shadowfax whinnied pippin entered stable turned head 'good morning' said pippin 'gandalf come soon may busy sends greetings see well resting hope long labours'
 shadowfax tossed head stamped allowed beregond handle head gently stroke great flanks
 'he looks spoiling race newly come great journey' said beregond 'how strong proud harness rich fair'
 'none rich fair enough him' said pippin 'he none consent bear bear well bit bridle whip thong tame farewell shadowfax patience battle coming'
 shadowfax lifted head neighed stable shook covered ears took leave seeing manger well filled
 'and manger' said beregond led pippin back citadel door north side great tower went long cool stair wide alley lit lamps hatches walls side one open
 'this storehouse buttery company guard' said beregond 'greetings targon' called hatch 'it early yet newcomer lord taken service ridden long far tight belt sore labour morning hungry give us have'
 got bread butter cheese apples last winter store wrinkled sound sweet leather flagon newdrawn ale wooden platters cups put wicker basket climbed back sun beregond brought pippin place east end great outthrust battlement embrasure walls stone seat beneath sill could look morning world
 ate drank talked gondor ways customs shire strange countries pippin seen ever talked beregond amazed looked greater wonder hobbit swinging short legs sat seat standing tiptoe upon peer sill lands
 'i hide master peregrin' said beregond 'that us look almost one children lad nine summers yet endured perils seen marvels greybeards could boast thought whim lord take noble page manner kings old say see must pardon foolishness'
 'i do' said pippin 'though far wrong still little boy reckoning people four years yet "come age" say shire bother come look tell see'

 sun climbing mists vale drawn last floating away overhead wisps white cloud borne stiffening breeze east flapping tugging flags white standards citadel away valleybottom five leagues eye leaps great river could seen grey glittering coming northwest bending mighty sweep south west till lost view haze shimmer far beyond lay sea fifty leagues away
 pippin could see pelennor laid dotted distance farmsteads little walls barns byres nowhere could see kine beasts many roads tracks crossed green fields much coming going wains moving lines towards great gate others passing horseman would ride leap saddle hasten city traffic went along chief highway turned south bending swifter river skirted hills passed soon sight wide wellpaved along eastern edge ran broad green ridingtrack beyond wall ride horsemen galloped fro street seemed choked great covered wains going south soon pippin saw fact wellordered wains moving three lines one swifter drawn horses another slower great waggons fair housings many colours drawn oxen along west rim road many smaller carts hauled trudging men
 'that road vales tumladen lossarnach mountainvillages lebennin' said beregond 'there go last wains bear away refuge aged children women must go must gone gate road clear league noon order sad necessity' sighed 'few maybe sundered meet always children city nonesave young lads depart may find task son one them'
 fell silent pippin gazed anxiously eastward moment might see thousands orcs pouring fields 'what see there' asked pointing middle great curve anduin 'is another city it'
 'it city' said beregond 'the chief city gondor fortress ruin osgiliath either side anduin enemies took burned long ago yet back days youth denethor dwell hold outpost rebuild bridge passage arms came fell riders minas morgul'
 'the black riders' said pippin opening eyes wide dark old fear reawakened
 'yes black' said beregond 'and see know something though spoken tales'
 'i know them' said pippin softly 'but speak near near' broke lifted eyes river seemed could see vast threatening shadow perhaps mountains looming verge sight jagged edges softened wellnigh twenty leagues misty air perhaps cloudwall beyond yet deeper gloom even looked seemed eyes gloom growing gathering slowly slowly rising smother regions sun
 'so near mordor' said beregond quietly 'yes lies seldom name dwelt ever sight shadow sometimes seems fainter distant sometimes nearer darker growing darkening therefore fear disquiet grow fell riders less year ago back crossings many best men slain boromir drove enemy last back western shore hold still near half osgiliath little await new onslaught maybe chief onslaught war comes'
 'when' said pippin 'have guess saw beacons last night errandriders gandalf said sign war begun seemed desperate hurry everything seems slowed again'
 'only everything ready' said beregond 'it deep breath plunge'
 'but beacons lit last night'
 'it overlate send aid already besieged' answered beregond 'but know counsel lord captains many ways gathering news lord denethor unlike men sees far say sits alone high chamber tower night bends thought way read somewhat future times search even mind enemy wrestling old worn time however may lord faramir abroad beyond river perilous errand may sent tidings
 'but would know think set beacons ablaze news came yestereve lebennin great fleet drawing near mouths anduin manned corsairs umbar south long ceased fear might gondor allied enemy make heavy stroke cause attack draw much help looked lebennin belfalas folk hardy numerous thoughts go north rohan glad tidings victory bring
 'and yet' � paused stood looked round north east south � 'the doings isengard warn us caught great net strategy longer bickering fords raiding ithilien an�rien ambushing pillaging great war longplanned one piece whatever pride may say things move far east beyond inland sea reported north mirkwood beyond south harad realms shall put test stand fall � shadow
 'yet master peregrin honour ever bear brunt chief hatred dark lord hatred comes depths time deeps sea hammerstroke fall hardest reason mithrandir came hither haste fall shall stand master peregrin see hope shall stand'
 pippin answer looked great walls towers brave banners sun high sky gathering gloom east thought long fingers shadow orcs woods mountains treason isengard birds evil eye black riders even lanes shire � winged terror nazg�l shuddered hope seemed wither even moment sun second faltered obscured though dark wing passed across almost beyond hearing thought caught high far heavens cry faint heartquelling cruel cold blanched cowered wall
 'what that' asked beregond 'you also felt something'
 'yes' muttered pippin 'it sign fall shadow doom fell rider air'
 'yes shadow doom' said beregond 'i fear minas tirith shall fall night comes warmth blood seems stolen away'

 time sat together bowed heads speak suddenly pippin looked saw sun still shining banners still streaming breeze shook 'it passed' said 'no heart yet despair gandalf fell returned us may stand one leg least left still upon knees'
 'rightly said' cried beregond rising striding fro 'nay though things must come utterly end time gondor shall perish yet though walls taken reckless foe build hill carrion still fastnesses secret ways escape mountains hope memory shall live still hidden valley grass green'
 'all wish good ill' said pippin 'i warrior dislike thought battle waiting edge one can't escape worst long day seems already happier obliged stand watch making move striking nowhere first stroke would struck rohan think gandalf'
 'ah lay finger sore many feel' said beregond 'but things may change faramir returns bold bold many deem days men slow believe captain wise learned scrolls lore song yet man hardihood swift judgement field faramir less reckless eager boromir less resolute yet indeed cannot assault mountains � yonder realm reach shortened cannot strike till foe comes within hand must heavy' smote hilt sword
 pippin looked tall proud noble men yet seen land glitter eye thought battle 'alas hand feels light feather' thought said nothing 'a pawn gandalf say perhaps wrong chessboard'

 talked sun reached height suddenly noonbells rung stir citadel save watchmen going meal
 'will come me' said beregond 'you may join mess day know company assigned lord may hold command welcome well meet many men may yet time'
 'i shall glad come' said pippin 'i lonely tell truth left best friend behind rohan one talk jest perhaps could really join company captain could take speak me'
 'nay nay' beregond laughed 'i captain neither office rank lordship plain man arms third company citadel yet master peregrin man arms guard tower gondor held worthy city men honour land'
 'then far beyond me' said pippin 'take back room gandalf go like � guest'

 gandalf lodging sent message pippin went beregond made known men third company seemed beregond got much honour guest pippin welcome already much talk citadel mithrandir's companion long closeting lord rumour declared prince halflings come north offer allegiance gondor five thousand swords said riders came rohan would bring behind halfling warrior small maybe doughty
 though pippin regretfully destroy hopeful tale could rid new rank fitting men thought one befriended boromir honoured lord denethor thanked coming among hung words stories outlands gave much food ale could wish indeed trouble 'wary' according counsel gandalf let tongue wag freely manner hobbit among friends

 length beregond rose 'farewell time' said 'i duty till sundown others think lonely say maybe would like merry guide city son would go gladly good lad may say pleases go lowest circle ask old guesthouse rath celerdain lampwrights' street find lads remaining city may things worth seeing great gate ere closing'
 went soon others followed day still fine though growing hazy hot march even far southwards pippin felt sleepy lodging seemed cheerless decided go explore city took morsels saved shadowfax graciously accepted though horse seemed lack walked many winding ways
 people stared much passed face men gravely courteous saluting manner gondor bowed head hands upon breast behind heard many calls doors cried others within come see prince halflings companion mithrandir many used tongue common speech long learned least meant _ernil pheriannath_ knew title gone city
 came last arched streets many fair alleys pavements lowest widest circle directed lampwrights' street broad way running towards great gate found old guesthouse large building grey weathered stone two wings running back street narrow greensward behind manywindowed house fronted along whole width pillared porch flight steps grass boys playing among pillars children pippin seen minas tirith stopped look presently one caught sight shout sprang across grass came street followed several others stood front pippin looking
 'greetings' said lad 'where come stranger city'
 'i was' said pippin 'but say become man gondor'
 'oh come' said lad 'then men old name ten years already shall soon five feet taller father guard one tallest father'
 'which question shall answer first' said pippin 'my father farms lands round whitwell near tuckborough shire nearly twentynine pass though four feet likely grow save sideways'
 'twentynine' said lad whistled 'why quite old old uncle iorlas still' added hopefully 'i wager could stand head lay back'
 'maybe could let you' said pippin laugh 'and maybe could know wrestling tricks little country let tell considered uncommonly large strong never allowed anyone stand head came trial nothing else would serve might kill older learn folk always seem though may taken soft strangerlad easy prey let warn halfling hard bold wicked' pippin pulled grim face boy stepped back pace returned clenched fists light battle eye
 'no' pippin laughed 'don't believe strangers say either fighter would politer case challenger say is'
 boy drew proudly 'i bergil son beregond guards' said
 'so thought' said pippin 'for look like father know sent find you'
 'then say once' said bergil suddenly look dismay came face 'do tell changed mind send away maidens last wains gone'
 'his message less bad good' said pippin 'he says would prefer standing head might show round city cheer loneliness tell tales far countries return'
 bergil clapped hands laughed relief 'all well' cried 'come soon going gate look go now'
 'what happening there'
 'the captains outlands expected south road ere sundown come us see'

 bergil proved good comrade best company pippin since parted merry soon laughing talking gaily went streets heedless many glances men gave long found throng going towards great gate pippin went much esteem bergil spoke name password guard saluted let pass allowed take companion
 'that good' said bergil 'we boys longer allowed pass gate without elder shall see better'
 beyond gate crowd men along verge road great paved space ways minas tirith ran eyes turned southwards soon murmur rose 'there dust away coming'
 pippin bergil edged way forward front crowd waited horns sounded distance noise cheering rolled towards like gathering wind loud trumpetblast people shouting
 'forlong forlong' pippin heard men calling 'what say' asked
 'forlong come' bergil answered 'old forlong fat lord lossarnach grandsire lives hurrah good old forlong'
 leading line came walking big thicklimbed horse sat man wide shoulders huge girth old greybearded yet mailclad blackhelmed bearing long heavy spear behind marched proudly dusty line men wellarmed bearing great battleaxes grimfaced shorter somewhat swarthier men pippin yet seen gondor
 'forlong' men shouted 'true heart true friend forlong' men lossarnach passed muttered 'so two hundreds hoped ten times number new tidings black fleet sparing tithe strength still every little gain'

 passing grey company

 gandalf gone thudding hoofs shadowfax lost night merry came back aragorn light bundle lost pack parth galen useful things picked among wreckage isengard hasufel already saddled legolas gimli horse stood close
 'so four company still remain' said aragorn 'we ride together shall go alone thought king determined set since coming winged shadow desires return hills cover night'
 'and whither' said legolas
 'i cannot say yet' aragorn answered 'as king go muster commanded edoras four nights think hear tidings war riders rohan go minas tirith go   '
 'i one' cried legolas 'and gimli him' said dwarf
 'well myself' said aragorn 'it dark must go also minas tirith yet see road hour long prepared approaches'
 'don't leave behind' said merry 'i much use yet want laid aside like baggage called think riders want bothered though course king say sit came house tell shire'
 'yes' said aragorn 'and road lies think merry look mirth ending long fear ere th�oden sits ease meduseld many hopes wither bitter spring'
 soon ready depart twentyfour horses gimli behind legolas merry front aragorn presently riding swiftly night long passed mounds fords isen rider galloped rear line
 'my lord' said king 'there horsemen behind us crossed fords thought heard sure overtaking us riding hard'
 th�oden called halt riders turned seized spears aragorn dismounted set merry ground drawing sword stood king's stirrup �omer esquire rode back rear merry felt like unneeded baggage ever wondered fight supposing king's small escort trapped overcome escaped darkness � alone wild fields rohan idea endless miles 'no good' thought drew sword tightened belt
 sinking moon obscured great sailing cloud suddenly rode clear heard sound hoofs moment saw dark shapes coming swiftly path fords moonlight glinted points spears number pursuers could told seemed fewer king's escort least
 fifty paces �omer cried loud voice 'halt halt rides rohan'
 pursuers brought steeds sudden stand silence followed moonlight horseman could seen dismounting walking slowly forward hand showed white held palm outward token peace king's men gripped weapons ten paces man stopped tall dark standing shadow clear voice rang
 'rohan rohan say glad word seek land haste long afar'
 'you found it' said �omer 'when crossed fords yonder entered realm th�oden king none ride save leave haste'
 'halbarad d�nadan ranger north am' cried man 'we seek one aragorn son arathorn heard rohan'
 'and found also' cried aragorn giving reins merry ran forward embraced newcomer 'halbarad' said 'of joys least expected'
 merry breathed sigh relief thought last trick saruman's waylay king men seemed would need die th�oden's defence yet rate sheathed sword
 'all well' said aragorn turning back 'here kin far land dwelt come many halbarad shall tell us'
 'i thirty me' said halbarad 'that kindred could gathered haste brethren elladan elrohir ridden us desiring go war rode swiftly might summons came'
 'but summon you' said aragorn 'save wish thoughts often turned seldom tonight yet sent word come matters must wait find us riding haste danger ride us king give leave'
 th�oden indeed glad news 'it well' said 'if kinsmen way like lord aragorn thirty knights strength cannot counted heads'
 riders set aragorn rode d�nedain spoken tidings north south elrohir said
 'i bring word father _the days short thou art haste remember paths dead_'
 'always days seemed short achieve desire' answered aragorn 'but great indeed haste ere take road'
 'that soon seen' said elrohir 'but let us speak things upon open road'
 aragorn said halbarad 'what bear kinsman' saw instead spear bore tall staff standard closefurled black cloth bound many thongs
 'it gift bring lady rivendell' answered halbarad 'she wrought secret long making also sends word _the days short either hope cometh hopes end therefore send thee made thee fare well elfstone_'
 aragorn said 'now know bear bear still while' turned looked away north great stars fell silent spoke night's journey lasted
 night old east grey rode last deepingcoomb came back hornburg lie rest brief take counsel
 merry slept roused legolas gimli 'the sun high' said legolas 'all others come master sluggard look place may'
 'there battle three nights ago' said gimli 'and legolas played game single orc come see caves merry caves wonder shall visit legolas think'
 'nay time' said elf 'do spoil wonder haste given word return hither day peace freedom comes near noon hour eat set hear'
 merry got yawned hours' sleep nearly enough tired rather dismal missed pippin felt burden everybody making plans speed business fully understand 'where aragorn' asked
 'in high chamber burg' said legolas 'he neither rested slept think went thither hours ago saying must take thought kinsman halbarad went dark doubt care sits him'
 'they strange company newcomers' said gimli 'stout men lordly riders rohan look almost boys beside grim men face worn like weathered rocks part even aragorn silent'
 'but even aragorn courteous break silence' said legolas 'and marked brethren elladan elrohir less sombre gear others' fair gallant elvenlords wondered sons elrond rivendell'
 'why come heard' asked merry dressed flung grey cloak shoulders three passed together towards ruined gate burg
 'they answered summons heard' said gimli 'word came rivendell say _aragorn need kindred let d�nedain ride rohan_ whence message came doubt gandalf sent would guess'
 'nay galadriel' said legolas 'did speak gandalf ride grey company north'
 'yes it' said gimli 'the lady wood read many hearts desires wish kinsfolk legolas'
 legolas stood gate turned bright eyes away north east fair face troubled 'i think would come' answered 'they need ride war war already marches lands'
 three companions walked together speaking turn battle went broken gate passed mounds fallen greensward beside road stood helm's dike looked coomb death already stood black tall stony great trampling scoring grass huorns could plainly seen dunlendings many men garrison burg work dike fields battered walls behind yet seemed strangely quiet weary valley resting great storm soon turned back went midday meal hall burg
 king already soon entered called merry seat set side 'it would it' said th�oden 'for little like fair house edoras friend gone also may long ere sit high table meduseld time feasting return thither come eat drink let us speak together may shall ride me'
 'may i' said merry surprised delighted 'that would splendid' never felt grateful kindness words 'i afraid everybody's way' stammered 'but like anything could know'
 'i doubt not' said king 'i good hillpony made ready bear swift horse roads shall take ride burg mountain paths plain come edoras way dunharrow lady �owyn awaits shall esquire gear war place �omer swordthain could use'
 'there great weaponhoards lord' answered �omer 'maybe light helm might found fit mail sword one stature'
 'i sword' said merry climbing seat drawing black sheath small bright blade filled suddenly love old man knelt one knee took hand kissed 'may lay sword meriadoc shire lap th�oden king' cried 'receive service will'
 'gladly take it' said king laying long old hands upon brown hair hobbit blessed 'rise meriadoc esquire rohan household meduseld' said 'take sword bear unto good fortune'
 'as father shall me' said merry
 'for little while' said th�oden

 talked together ate presently �omer spoke 'it near hour set going lord' said 'shall bid men sound horns aragorn place empty eaten'
 'we make ready ride' said th�oden 'but let word sent lord aragorn hour nigh'
 king guard merry side passed gate burg riders assembling green many already mounted would great company king leaving small garrison burg could spared riding weapontake edoras thousand spears indeed already ridden away night still would five hundred go king part men fields dales westfold
 little apart rangers sat silent ordered company armed spear bow sword clad cloaks dark grey hoods cast helm head horses strong proud bearing roughhaired one stood without rider aragorn's horse brought north roheryn name gleam stone gold fair thing gear harness riders bear badge token save cloak pinned upon left shoulder brooch silver shaped like rayed star
 king mounted horse snowmane merry sat beside pony stybba name presently �omer came gate aragorn halbarad bearing great staff closefurled black two tall men neither young old much alike sons elrond could tell apart darkhaired greyeyed faces elvenfair clad alike bright mail beneath cloaks silvergrey behind walked legolas gimli merry eyes aragorn startling change saw one night many years fallen head grim face greyhued weary
 'i troubled mind lord' said standing king's horse 'i heard strange words see new perils far laboured long thought fear must change purpose tell th�oden ride dunharrow long ere come there'
 'it full hour past noon' said �omer 'before night third day come hold moon one night past full muster king commanded held day speed cannot make strength rohan gathered'
 aragorn silent moment 'three days' murmured 'and muster rohan begun see cannot hastened' looked seemed made decision face less troubled leave lord must take new counsel kindred must ride road longer secret time stealth passed ride east swiftest way take paths dead'
 'the paths dead' said th�oden trembled 'why speak them' �omer turned gazed aragorn seemed merry faces riders sat within hearing turned pale words 'if truth paths' said th�oden 'their gate dunharrow living man may pass it'
 'alas aragorn friend' said �omer 'i hoped ride war together seek paths dead parting come little likely shall ever meet sun'
 'that road take nonetheless' said aragorn 'but say �omer battle may yet meet though hosts mordor stand between'
 'you lord aragorn' said th�oden 'it doom maybe tread strange paths others dare parting grieves strength lessened must take mountainroads delay longer farewell'
 'farewell lord' said aragorn 'ride unto great renown farewell merry leave good hands better hoped hunted orcs fangorn legolas gimli still hunt hope shall forget you'
 'goodbye' said merry could find say felt small puzzled depressed gloomy words ever missed unquenchable cheerfulness pippin riders ready horses fidgeting wished would start arid get
 th�oden spoke �omer lifted hand cried aloud word riders set forth rode dike coomb turning swiftly eastwards took path skirted foothills mile bending south passed back among hills disappeared view aragorn rode dike watched till king's men far coomb turned halbarad
 'there go three love smallest least' said 'he knows end rides yet knew still would go on'
 'a little people great worth shirefolk' said halbarad 'little know long labour safekeeping borders yet grudge not'
 'and fates woven together' said aragorn 'and yet alas must part well must eat little also must hasten away come legolas gimli must speak eat'
 together went back burg yet time aragorn sat silent table hall others waited speak 'come' said legolas last 'speak comforted shake shadow happened since came back grim place grey morning'
 'a struggle somewhat grimmer part battle hornburg' answered aragorn 'i looked stone orthanc friends'
 'you looked accursed stone wizardry' exclaimed gimli fear astonishment face 'did say aught � even gandalf feared encounter'
 'you forget speak' said aragorn sternly eyes glinted 'did openly proclaim title doors edoras fear say nay gimli' said softer voice grimness left face looked like one laboured sleepless pain many nights 'nay friends lawful master stone right strength use judged right cannot doubted strength enough � barely'
 drew deep breath 'it bitter struggle weariness slow pass spoke word end wrenched stone alone find hard endure beheld yes master gimli saw guise see aid done ill think know lived walked earth blow heart deem knew till eyes orthanc see armour th�oden sauron forgotten isildur sword elendil hour great designs heir isildur sword revealed showed blade reforged mighty yet fear nay doubt ever gnaws him'
 'but wields great dominion nonetheless' said gimli 'and strike swiftly'
 'the hasty stroke goes oft astray' said aragorn 'we must press enemy longer wait upon move see friends mastered stone learned many things grave peril saw coming unlookedfor upon gondor south draw great strength defence minas tirith countered swiftly deem city lost ere ten days gone'
 'then lost must be' said gimli 'for help send thither could come time'
 'i help send therefore must go myself' said aragorn 'but one way mountains bring coastlands lost paths dead'
 'the paths dead' said gimli 'it fell name little liking men rohan saw living use road perish even pass way avail counter strokes mordor'
 'the living never used road since coming rohirrim' said aragorn 'for closed dark hour heir isildur may use dare listen word sons elrond bring father rivendell wisest lore _bid aragorn remember words seer paths dead_'
 'and may words seer' said legolas
 "thus spoke malbeth seer days arvedui last king fornost' said aragorn

 land lies long shadow
 westward reaching wings darkness
 tower trembles tombs kings
 doom approaches dead awaken
 hour come oathbreakers
 stone erech shall stand
 hear horn hills ringing
 whose shall horn shall call
 prey twilight forgotten people
 heir oath swore
 north shall come need shall drive
 shall pass door paths dead

 'dark ways doubtless said gimli darker staves me'
 'if would understand better bid come me' said aragorn 'for way shall take go gladly need drives therefore free would come find toil great fear maybe worse'
 'i go even paths dead whatever end may lead' said gimli
 'i also come' said legolas 'for fear dead'
 'i hope forgotten people forgotten fight' said gimli 'for otherwise see trouble them'
 'that shall know ever come erech' said aragorn 'but oath broke fight sauron must fight therefore fulfil erech stands yet black stone brought said n�menor isildur set upon hill upon king mountains swore allegiance beginning realm gondor sauron returned grew might isildur summoned men mountains fulfil oath would worshipped sauron dark years
 'then isildur said king "thou shalt last king west prove mightier thy black master curse lay upon thee thy folk rest never oath fulfilled war last years uncounted shall summoned ere end" fled wrath isildur dare go forth war sauron's part hid secret places mountains dealings men slowly dwindled barren hills terror sleepless dead lies hill erech places people lingered way must go since none living help me'
 stood 'come' cried drew sword flashed twilit hall burg 'to stone erech seek paths dead come will'
 legolas gimli made answer rose followed aragorn hall green waited still silent hooded rangers legolas gimli mounted aragorn sprang upon roheryn halbarad lifted great horn blast echoed helm's deep leapt away riding coomb like thunder men left dike burg stared amaze

 'indeed man would count journey wasted' said aragorn 'and yet lady could come hither road must take leads dunharrow'
 answered one likes said "then lord astray harrowdale road runs east south best return came'
 'nay lady' said 'i astray walked land ere born grace road valley road shall take tomorrow shall ride paths dead'
 stared one stricken face blanched long spoke sat silent 'but aragorn' said last 'is errand seek death find road suffer living pass'
 'they may suffer pass' said aragorn 'but least adventure road serve'
 'but madness' said 'for men renown prowess take shadows lead war men needed beg remain ride brother hearts gladdened hope brighter'
 'it madness lady' answered 'for go path appointed follow free wish remain ride rohirrim may shall take paths dead alone needs be'
 said ate silence eyes ever upon aragorn others saw great torment mind length arose took leave lady thanked care went rest
 aragorn came booth lodge legolas gimli companions gone came lady �owyn called turned saw glimmer night clad white eyes fire
 'aragorn' said 'why go deadly road'
 'because must' said 'only see hope part war sauron choose paths peril �owyn go heart dwells far north would wandering fair valley rivendell'
 silent pondering might mean suddenly laid hand arm 'you stern lord resolute' said 'and thus men win renown' paused 'lord' said 'if must go let ride following weary skulking hills wish face peril battle'
 'your duty people' answered
 'too often heard duty' cried 'but house eorl shieldmaiden drynurse waited faltering feet long enough since falter longer seems may spend life will'
 'few may honour' answered 'but lady accept charge govern people lord's return chosen marshal captain would set place could ride away charge weary no'
 'shall always chosen' said bitterly 'shall always left behind riders depart mind house win renown find food beds return'
 'a time may come soon' said 'when none return need valour without renown none shall remember deeds done last defence homes yet deeds less valiant unpraised'
 answered 'all words say woman part house men died battle honour leave burned house men need house eorl servingwoman ride wield blade fear either pain death'
 'what fear lady' asked
 'a cage' said 'to stay behind bars use old age accept chance great deeds gone beyond recall desire'
 'and yet counselled adventure road chosen perilous'
 'so may one counsel another' said 'yet bid flee peril ride battle sword may win renown victory would see thing high excellent cast away needlessly'
 'nor would i' said 'therefore say lady stay errand south'
 'neither others go thee go would parted thee � love thee' turned vanished night

 'i lady' said 'for could grant without leave king brother return tomorrow count every hour indeed every minute farewell'

 _chapter 3_
 muster rohan

 roads running together east meet coming war onset shadow even pippin stood great gate city saw prince dol amroth ride banners king rohan came hills
 day waning last rays sun riders cast long pointed shadows went darkness already crept beneath murmuring firwoods clothed steep mountainsides king rode slowly end day presently path turned round huge bare shoulder rock plunged gloom softsighing trees went long winding file last came bottom gorge found evening fallen deep places sun gone twilight lay upon waterfalls
 day far leaping stream run high pass behind cleaving narrow way pineclad walls stony gate flowed passed wider vale riders followed suddenly harrowdale lay loud noise waters evening white snowbourn joined lesser stream went rushing fuming stones edoras green hills plains away right head great dale mighty starkhorn loomed vast buttresses swathed cloud jagged peak clothed everlasting snow gleamed far world blueshadowed upon east redstained sunset west
 merry looked wonder upon strange country heard many tales upon long road skyless world eye dim gulfs shadowy air saw evermounting slopes great walls stone behind great walls frowning precipices wreathed mist sat moment half dreaming listening noise water whisper dark trees crack stone vast waiting silence brooded behind sound loved mountains loved thought marching edge stories brought far away borne insupportable weight middleearth longed shut immensity quiet room fire
 tired though ridden slowly ridden little rest hour hour nearly three weary days jogged passes long dales across many streams sometimes way broader ridden king's side noticing many riders smiled see two together hobbit little shaggy grey pony lord rohan great white horse talked th�oden telling home doings shirefolk listening turn tales mark mighty men old time especially last day merry ridden behind king saying nothing trying understand slow sonorous speech rohan heard men behind using language seemed many words knew though spoken richly strongly shire yet could piece words together times rider would lift clear voice stirring song merry felt heart leap though know
 lonely never day's end wondered strange world pippin got would become aragorn legolas gimli suddenly like cold touch heart thought frodo sam 'i forgetting them' said reproachfully 'and yet important rest us came help must hundreds miles away still alive' shivered
 'harrowdale last' said �omer 'our journey almost end' halted paths narrow gorge fell steeply glimpse tall window could seen great valley gloaming single small light could seen twinkling river
 'this journey maybe' said th�oden 'but far yet go last night moon full morning shall ride edoras gathering mark'
 'but would take counsel' said �omer low voice 'you would return hither war lost won'
 th�oden smiled 'nay son call speak soft words wormtongue old ears' drew looked back long line men fading dusk behind 'long years space days seems since rode west never lean staff war lost good hiding hills grief even fall spending last strength leave tonight lie hold dunharrow one evening peace least left us let us ride on'
 deepening dusk came valley snowbourn flowed near western walls dale soon path led ford shallow waters murmured loudly stones ford guarded king approached many men sprang shadow rocks saw king cried glad voices 'th�oden king th�oden king king mark returns'
 one blew long call horn echoed valley horns answered lights shone across river
 suddenly rose great chorus trumpets high sounding hollow place seemed gathered notes one voice sent rolling beating walls stone
 king mark came back victorious west dunharrow beneath feet white mountains found remaining strength people already assembled soon coming known captains rode meet ford bearing messages gandalf d�nhere chieftain folk harrowdale head
 'at dawn three days ago lord' said 'shadowfax came like wind west edoras gandalf brought tidings victory gladden hearts brought also word hasten gathering riders came winged shadow'
 'the winged shadow' said th�oden 'we saw also dead night gandalf left us'
 'maybe lord' said d�nhere 'yet another like flying darkness shape monstrous bird passed edoras morning men shaken fear stooped upon meduseld came low almost gable came cry stopped hearts gandalf counselled us assemble fields meet valley mountains bade us kindle lights fires barest need asked done gandalf spoke great authority trust would wish naught seen harrowdale evil things'
 'it well' said th�oden 'i ride hold go rest meet marshals captains let come soon may be'

 road led eastward straight across valley point little half mile width flats meads rough grass grey falling night lay front far side dale merry saw frowning wall last outlier great roots starkhorn cloven river ages past
 level spaces great concourse men thronged roadside hailing king riders west glad cries stretching away distance behind ordered rows tents booths lines picketed horses great store arms piled spears bristling like thickets newplanted trees great assembly falling shadow yet though nightchill blew cold heights lanterns glowed fires lit watchmen heavily cloaked paced fro
 merry wondered many riders could guess number gathering gloom looked like great army many thousands strong peering side side king's party came looming cliff eastern side valley suddenly path began climb merry looked amazement road like never seen great work men's hands years beyond reach song upwards wound coiling like snake boring way across sheer slope rock steep stair looped backwards forwards climbed horses could walk wains could slowly hauled enemy could come way except air defended turn road great standing stones carved likeness men huge clumsylimbed squatting crosslegged stumpy arms folded fat bellies wearing years lost features save dark holes eyes still stared sadly passersby riders hardly glanced p�kelmen called heeded little power terror left merry gazed wonder feeling almost pity loomed mournfully dusk
 looked back found already climbed hundreds feet valley still far could dimly see winding line riders crossing ford filing along road towards camp prepared king guard going hold
 last king's company came sharp brink climbing road passed cutting walls rock went short slope wide upland firienfeld men called green mountainfield grass heath high deepdelved courses snowbourn laid upon lap great mountains behind starkhorn southwards northwards sawtoothed mass irensaga faced riders grim black wall dwimorberg haunted mountain rising steep slopes sombre pines dividing upland two marched double line unshaped standing stones dwindled dusk vanished trees dared follow road came soon black dimholt dwimorberg menace pillar stone yawning shadow forbidden door
 dark dunharrow work longforgotten men name lost song legend remembered purpose made place town secret temple tomb kings none could say laboured dark years ever ship came western shores gondor d�nedain built vanished old p�kelmen left still sitting turnings road
 merry stared lines marching stones worn black leaning fallen cracked broken looked like rows old hungry teeth wondered could hoped king going follow darkness beyond saw clusters tents booths either side stony way set near trees seemed rather huddle away towards brink cliff greater number right firienfeld wider left smaller camp midst stood tall pavilion side rider came meet turned road
 drew near merry saw rider woman long braided hair gleaming twilight yet wore helm clad waist like warrior girded sword
 'hail lord mark' cried 'my heart glad returning'
 'and �owyn' said th�oden 'is well you'
 'all well' answered yet seemed merry voice belied would thought weeping could believed one stern face 'all well weary road people take torn suddenly homes hard words long since war driven us green fields evil deeds ordered see lodging prepared full tidings knew hour coming'
 'so aragorn come then' said �omer 'is still here'
 'no gone' said �owyn turning away looking mountains dark east south
 'whither go' asked �omer
 'i know' answered 'he came night rode away yestermorn ere sun climbed mountaintops gone'
 'you grieved daughter' said th�oden 'what happened tell speak road' pointed away along darkening lines stones towards dwimorberg 'of paths dead'
 'yes lord' said �owyn 'and passed shadows none returned could dissuade gone'
 'then paths sundered' said �omer 'he lost must ride without hope dwindles'
 slowly passed short heath upland grass speaking came king's pavilion merry found everything made ready forgotten little tent pitched beside king's lodging sat alone men passed fro going king taking counsel night came halfseen heads mountains westward crowned stars east dark blank marching stones faded slowly sight still beyond blacker gloom brooded vast crouching shadow dwimorberg
 'the paths dead' muttered 'the paths dead mean left gone doom gandalf pippin war east sam frodo mordor strider legolas gimli paths dead turn come soon enough suppose wonder talking king means must go goes now'
 midst gloomy thoughts suddenly remembered hungry got go see anyone else strange camp felt moment trumpet sounded man came summoning king's esquire wait king's board

 inner part pavilion small space curtained broidered hangings strewn skins small table sat th�oden �omer �owyn d�nhere lord harrowdale merry stood beside king's stool waited till presently old man coming deep thought turned smiled
 'come master meriadoc' said 'you shall stand shall sit beside long remain lands lighten heart tales'
 room made hobbit king's left hand one called tale indeed little speech ate drank part silence last plucking courage merry asked question tormenting
 'twice lord heard paths dead' said 'what strider mean lord aragorn gone'
 king sighed one answered last �omer spoke 'we know hearts heavy' said 'but paths dead walked first steps nay speak words ill omen road climbed approach door yonder dimholt lies beyond man knows'
 'no man knows' said th�oden 'yet ancient legend seldom spoken somewhat report old tales speak true come father son house eorl door dwimorberg leads secret way goes beneath mountain forgotten end none ever ventured search secrets since baldor son brego passed door never seen among men rash vow spoke drained horn feast brego made hallow newbuilt meduseld came never high seat heir
 'folk say dead men dark years guard way suffer living man come hidden halls whiles may seen passing door like shadows stony road people harrowdale shut fast doors shroud windows afraid dead come seldom forth times great unquiet coming death'
 'yet said harrowdale' said �owyn low voice 'that moonless nights little ago great host strange array passed whence came none knew went stony road vanished hill went keep tryst'
 'then aragorn gone way' asked merry 'don't know anything would explain it'
 'unless spoken words friend heard' said �omer 'none land living tell purpose'
 'greatly changed seemed since saw first king's house' said �owyn 'grimmer older fey thought like one dead call'
 'maybe called' said th�oden 'and heart tells shall see yet kingly man high destiny take comfort daughter since comfort seem need grief guest said eorlingas came north passed length snowbourn seeking strong places refuge time need brego son baldor climbed stair hold came door threshold sat old man aged beyond guess years tall kingly withered old stone indeed stone took moved said word sought pass enter voice came ground amaze spoke western tongue _the way shut_
 'then halted looked saw lived still look _the way shut_ voice said _it made dead dead keep time comes way shut_
 '_and time be_said baldor answer ever get old man died hour fell upon face tidings ancient dwellers mountains folk ever learned yet maybe last time foretold come aragorn may pass'
 'but shall man discover whether time come save daring door' said �omer 'and way would go though hosts mordor stood alone refuge alas fey mood fall man greathearted hour need evil things enough abroad without seeking earth war hand'
 paused moment noise outside man's voice crying name th�oden challenge guard
 presently captain guard thrust aside curtain 'a man lord' said 'an errandrider gondor wishes come once'
 'let come' said th�oden
 tall man entered merry choked back cry moment seemed boromir alive returned saw man stranger though like boromir one kin tall greyeyed proud clad rider cloak dark green coat fine mail front helm wrought small silver star hand bore single arrow blackfeathered barbed steel point painted red
 sank one knee presented arrow th�oden 'hail lord rohirrim friend gondor' said 'hirgon errandrider denethor bring token war gondor great need often rohirrim aided us lord denethor asks strength speed lest gondor fall last'
 'the red arrow' said th�oden holding one receives summons long expected yet dreadful comes hand trembled 'the red arrow seen mark years indeed come lord denethor reckon strength speed may be'
 'that best known lord' said hirgon 'but ere long may well come pass minas tirith surrounded unless strength break siege many powers lord denethor bids say judges strong arms rohirrim would better within walls without'
 'but knows people fight rather upon horseback open also scattered people time needed gathering riders true hirgon lord minas tirith knows sets message already war may seen find us unprepared gandalf grey among us even mustering battle east'
 'what lord denethor may know guess things cannot say' answered hirgon 'but indeed case desperate lord issue command begs remember old friendship oaths long spoken good may reported us many kings ridden east service mordor north field dagorlad skirmish rumour war south haradrim moving fear fallen coastlands little help come us thence make haste walls minas tirith doom time decided tide stemmed flow fair fields rohan even hold among hills shall refuge'
 'dark tidings' said th�oden 'yet unguessed say denethor even rohan felt peril still would come aid suffered much loss battles saruman traitor must still think frontier north east tidings make clear great power dark lord seems wield might well contain us battle city yet strike great force across river away beyond gate kings
 'but speak longer counsels prudence come weapontake set morrow ordered set ten thousand spears might sent riding plain dismay foes less fear leave strongholds unguarded yet six thousands least shall ride behind say denethor hour king mark come land gondor though maybe ride back long road man beast must reach end strength fight week may tomorrow's morn ere hear cry sons eorl coming north
 'a week' said hirgon 'if must must like find ruined walls seven days unless help unlookedfor comes still may least disturb orcs swarthy men feasting white tower'
 'at least that' said th�oden 'but newcome battle long journey go rest tarry night shall look muster rohan ride away gladder sight swifter rest morning counsels best night changes many thoughts

 king stood rose 'go rest' said 'and sleep well master meriadoc need tonight ready call soon sun risen'
 'i ready' said merry 'even bid ride paths dead'
 'speak words omen' said king 'for may roads one could bear name say would bid ride road good night'

 'i left behind called return' said merry 'i left won't' repeating fell asleep last tent
 wakened man shaking 'wake wake master holbytla' cried length merry came deep dreams sat start still seemed dark thought
 'what matter' asked
 'the king calls you'
 'but sun risen yet' said merry
 'no rise today master holbytla ever one would think cloud time stand still though sun lost make haste'
 flinging clothes merry looked outside world darkling air seemed brown things black grey shadowless great stillness shape cloud could seen unless far away westward furthest groping fingers great gloom still crawled onwards little light leaked overhead hung heavy roof sombre featureless light seemed rather failing growing
 merry saw many folk standing looking muttering faces grey sad afraid sinking heart made way king hirgon rider gondor beside stood another man like dressed alike shorter broader merry entered speaking king
 'it comes mordor lord' said 'it began last night sunset hills eastfold realm saw rise creep across sky night rode came behind eating stars great cloud hangs land mountains shadow deepening war already begun'
 king sat silent last spoke 'so come end' said 'the great battle time many things shall pass away least longer need hiding ride straight way open road speed muster shall begin wait none tarry good store minas tirith must ride haste must ride light meal water enough last us battle'
 'we great store long prepared' answered hirgon ride light swift may'
 'then call heralds �omer' said th�oden 'let riders marshalled'
 �omer went presently trumpets rang hold answered many others voices longer sounded clear brave seemed merry night dull seemed harsh heavy air braying ominously
 king turned merry 'i going war master meriadoc' said 'in little shall take road release service friendship shall abide shall serve lady �owyn govern folk stead'
 'but lord' merry stammered 'i offered sword want parted like th�oden king friends gone battle' ashamed stay behind'
 'but ride horses tall swift' said th�oden 'and great though heart cannot ride beasts'
 'then tie back one let hang stirrup something' said merry 'it long way run run shall cannot ride even wear feet arrive weeks late'
 th�oden smiled 'rather would bear snowmane' said 'but least shall ride edoras look meduseld way shall go far stybba bear great race begin till reach plains'
 �owyn rose 'come meriadoc' said 'i show gear prepared fur you' went together 'this request aragorn make me' said �owyn passed among tents 'that armed battle granted could heart tells need gear ere end'
 led merry booth among lodges king's guard armourer brought small helm round shield gear
 'no mail fit you' said �owyn 'nor time forging hauberk also stout jerkin leather belt knife sword have'
 merry bowed lady showed shield like shield given gimli bore device white horse 'take things' said 'and bear good fortune farewell master meriadoc yet maybe shall meet i'
 amid gathering gloom king mark made ready lead riders eastward road hearts heavy many quailed shadow stern people loyal lord little weeping murmuring heard even camp hold exiles edoras housed women children old men doom hung faced silently
 two swift hours passed king sat upon white horse glimmering half light proud tall seemed though hair flowed beneath high helm like snow many marvelled took heart see unbent unafraid
 wide flats beside noisy river marshalled many companies well nigh five fifty hundreds riders fully armed many hundreds men spare horses lightly burdened single trumpet sounded king raised hand silently host mark began move foremost went twelve king's householdmen riders renown king followed �omer right said farewell �owyn hold memory grievous turned mind road lay ahead behind merry rode stybba errand riders gondor behind twelve king's household passed long ranks waiting men stern unmoved faces come almost end line one looked glancing keenly hobbit young man merry thought returned glance less height girth caught glint clear grey eyes shivered came suddenly face one without hope goes search death
 grey road went beside snowbourn rushing stones hamlets underharrow upbourn many sad faces women looked dark doors without horn harp music men's voices great ride east began songs rohan busy many long lives men thereafter

 dark dunharrow dim morning
 thane captain rode thengel's son
 edoras came ancient halls

 golden timbers gloom mantled
 farewell bade free people

 long feasted ere light faded
 forth rode king fear behind

 forth rode th�oden five nights days
 east onward rode eorlingas
 folde fenmarch firienwood
 six thousand spears sunlending

 indeed deepening gloom king came edoras although noon hour halted short strengthened host three score riders came late weapontake eaten made ready set wished esquire kindly farewell merry begged last time parted
 'this journey steeds stybba told ' said th�oden 'and battle think make fields gondor would master meriadoc swordthain though greater heart stature'
 'as tell' answered merry 'but lord receive swordthain stay side would said song always left behind'
 'i received safekeeping' answered th�oden 'and also might bid none riders bear burden battle gates maybe deeds would remembered minstrels hundred leagues two mundburg denethor lord say more'
 merry bowed went away unhappily stared lines horsemen already companies preparing start men tightening girths looking saddles caressing horses gazed uneasily lowering sky unnoticed rider came spoke softly hobbit's ear
 '_where wants way opens_ say' whispered 'and found myself' merry looked saw young rider noticed morning 'you wish go whither lord mark goes see face'
 'i do' said merry
 'then shall go me' said rider 'i bear cloak far afield darkness yet darker good denied say man come'
 'thank indeed' said merry 'thank sir though know name'
 'do not' said rider softly 'then call dernhelm'

 thus came pass king set dernhelm sat meriadoc hobbit great grey steed windfola made little burden dernhelm less weight many men though lithe wellknit frame

 _chapter 4_
 siege gondor

 pippin roused gandalf candles lit chamber dim twilight came windows air heavy approaching thunder
 'what time' said pippin yawning
 'past second hour' said gandalf 'time get make presentable summoned lord city learn new duties'
 'and provide breakfast'
 'no provided get till noon food doled order'
 pippin looked ruefully small loaf thought inadequate pat butter set beside cup thin milk 'why bring here' said
 'you know quite well' said gandalf 'to keep mischief like remember brought yourself' pippin said
 long walking gandalf cold corridor door tower hall denethor sat grey gloom like old patient spider pippin thought seem moved since day beckoned gandalf seat pippin left standing unheeded presently old man turned
 'well master peregrin hope used yesterday profit liking though fear board barer city could wish'
 pippin uncomfortable feeling said done somehow known lord city much guessed thought well answer
 'what would service'
 'i thought sir would tell duties'
 'i learn fit for' said denethor 'but shall learn soonest maybe keep beside esquire chamber begged leave go outgarrison shall take place shall wait bear errands talk war council leave leisure sing'
 'yes' said pippin 'well yes well enough people songs fit great halls evil times lord seldom sing anything terrible wind rain songs things make us laugh food drink course'
 'and songs unfit halls hours lived long shadow may surely listen echoes land untroubled may feel vigil fruitless though may thankless'
 pippin's heart sank relish idea singing song shire lord minas tirith certainly comic ones knew best well rustic occasion however spared ordeal present commanded sing denethor turned gandalf asking questions rohirrim policies position �omer king's nephew pippin marvelled amount lord seemed know people lived far away though must thought many years since denethor ridden abroad
 presently denethor waved pippin dismissed 'go armouries citadel' said 'and get livery gear tower ready commanded yesterday return clad'
 said pippin soon found arrayed strange garments black silver small hauberk rings forged steel maybe yet black jet highcrowned helm small ravenwings either side set silver star centre circlet mail short surcoat black broidered breast silver token tree old clothes folded put away permitted keep grey cloak l�rien though wear duty looked known verily _ernil pheriannath_ prince halflings folk called felt uncomfortable gloom began weigh spirits
 dark dim day sunless dawn evening heavy shadow deepened hearts city oppressed far great cloud streamed slowly westward black land devouring light borne upon wind war air still breathless vale anduin waited onset ruinous storm
 eleventh hour released last service pippin came went search food drink cheer heavy heart make task waiting supportable messes met beregond come errand pelennor guardtowers upon causeway together strolled walls pippin felt imprisoned indoors stifled even lofty citadel sat side side embrasure looking eastward eaten talked day
 sunsethour great pall stretched far west sank last sea sun escape send brief farewell gleam night even frodo saw crossroads touching head fallen king fields pelennor shadow mindolluin came gleam brown drear
 already seemed years pippin since sat halfforgotten time still hobbit lighthearted wanderer touched little perils passed one small soldier city preparing great assault clad proud sombre manner tower guard
 time place pippin might pleased new array knew taking part play deadly earnest servant grim master greatest peril hauberk burdensome helm weighed upon head cloak cast aside upon seat turned tired gaze away darkling fields yawned sighed
 'you weary day' said beregond
 'yes' said pippin 'very tired idleness waiting kicked heels door master's chamber many slow hours debated gandalf prince great persons i'm used master beregond waiting hungry others eat sore trial hobbit doubt think feel honour deeply good honour indeed good even food drink creeping shadow mean air seems thick brown often glooms wind east'
 'nay' said beregond 'this weather world device malice broil fume mountain fire sends darken hearts counsel doth indeed wish lord faramir would return would dismayed knows ever come back across river darkness'
 'yes' said pippin 'gandalf anxious disappointed think find faramir got left lord's council noonmeal good mood either thought perhaps foreboding bad news'
 suddenly talked stricken dumb frozen listening stones pippin cowered hands pressed ears beregond looking battlement spoke faramir remained stiffened staring starting eyes pippin knew shuddering cry heard heard long ago marish shire grown power hatred piercing heart poisonous despair
 last beregond spoke effort 'they come' said 'take courage look fell things below'
 reluctantly pippin climbed seat looked wall pelennor lay dim beneath fading away scarce guessed line great river wheeling swiftly across like shadows untimely night saw middle airs five birdlike forms horrible carrionfowl yet greater eagles cruel death swooped near venturing almost within bowshot walls circled away
 'black riders' muttered pippin 'black riders air see beregond' cried 'they looking something surely see wheel swoop always point see something moving ground dark little things yes men horses four five ah cannot stand gandalf gandalf save us'
 another long screech rose fell threw back wall panting like hunted animal faint seemingly remote shuddering cry heard winding sound trumpet ending long high note
 'faramir lord faramir call' cried beregond 'brave heart win gate foul hellhawks weapons fear look hold make gate horses running mad look men thrown running foot one still rides back others captain master beasts men ah one foul things stooping help help one go faramir'
 beregond sprang away ran gloom ashamed terror beregond guard thought first captain loved pippin got peered moment caught flash white silver coming north like small star dusky fields moved speed arrow grew came converging swiftly flight four men towards gate seemed pippin pale light spread heavy shadows gave way drew near thought heard like echo walls great voice calling
 'gandalf' cried 'gandalf always turns things darkest go go white rider gandalf gandalf' shouted wildly like onlooker great race urging runner far beyond encouragement
 dark swooping shadows aware newcomer one wheeled towards seemed pippin raised hand shaft white light stabbed upwards nazg�l gave long wailing cry swerved away four others wavered rising swift spirals passed away eastward vanishing lowering cloud pelennor seemed less dark
 pippin watched saw horseman white rider meet halt waiting foot men hurried city soon passed sight outer walls knew entering gate guessing would come tower steward hurried entrance citadel joined many others watched race rescue high walls
 long clamour heard streets leading outer circles much cheering crying names faramir mithrandir presently pippin saw torches followed press people two horsemen riding slowly one white shining longer pale twilight fire spent veiled dark head bowed dismounted grooms took shadowfax horse walked forward sentinel gate gandalf steadily grey cloak flung back fire still smouldering eyes clad green slowly swaying little weary wounded man
 pippin pressed forward passed lamp beneath gatearch saw pale face faramir caught breath face one assailed great fear anguish mastered quiet proud grave stood moment spoke guard pippin gazing saw closely resembled brother boromir � pippin liked first admiring great man's lordly kindly manner yet suddenly faramir heart strangely moved feeling known one air high nobility aragorn times revealed less high perhaps yet also less incalculable remote one kings men born later time touched wisdom sadness elder race knew beregond spoke name love captain men would follow would follow even shadow black wings
 'faramir' cried aloud others 'faramir' faramir catching strange voice among clamour men city turned looked amazed
 'whence come you' said 'a halfling livery tower whence'
 gandalf stepped side spoke 'he came land halflings' said 'he came let us tarry much say weary shall come us indeed must forget new duties easily must attend lord within hour come pippin follow us'
 length came private chamber lord city deep seats set brazier charcoal wine brought pippin hardly noticed stood behind chair denethor felt weariness little eagerly listen said
 faramir taken white bread drunk draught wine sat upon low chair father's left hand removed little upon side sat gandalf chair carven wood seemed first asleep beginning faramir spoke errand upon sent ten days brought tidings ithilien movements enemy allies told fight road men harad great beast overthrown captain reporting master matters often heard small things borderwar seemed useless petty shorn renown
 suddenly faramir looked pippin 'but come strange matters' said 'for first halfling seen walking northern legends southlands'
 gandalf sat gripped arms chair said nothing look stopped exclamation pippin's lips denethor looked faces nodded head though sign read much spoken slowly others sat silent still faramir told tale eyes part gandalf though glance strayed pippin refresh memory others seen
 story unfolded meeting frodo servant events henneth ann�n pippin became aware gandalf's hands trembling clutched carven wood white seemed old looked suddenly thrill fear pippin knew gandalf gandalf troubled even afraid air room close still last faramir spoke parting travellers resolve go cirith ungol voice fell shook head sighed gandalf sprang
 'cirith ungol morgul vale' said 'the time faramir time part would reach accursed valley'
 'i parted morning two days ago' said faramir 'it fifteen leagues thence vale morgulduin went straight south would still five leagues westward accursed tower swiftest could come today maybe come yet indeed see fear darkness due venture began yestereve ithilien shadow last night clear enemy long planned assault us hour already determined ever travellers left keeping'
 gandalf paced floor 'the morning two days ago nigh three days journey far place parted'
 'some twentyfive leagues bird flies' answered faramir 'but could come swiftly yestereve lay cair andros long isle river northward hold defence horses kept hither bank dark drew knew haste needed rode thence three others could also horsed rest company sent south strengthen garrison fords osgiliath hope done ill' looked father
 'ill' cried denethor eyes flashed suddenly 'why ask men command ask judgement deeds bearing lowly presence yet long since turned way counsel see spoken skilfully ever seen eye fixed mithrandir seeking whether said well much long heart keeping
 'my son father old yet dotard see hear wont little half said left unsaid hidden know answer many riddles alas alas boromir'
 'if done displeases father' said faramir quietly 'i wish known counsel burden weighty judgement thrust me'
 'would availed change judgement' said denethor 'you would still done deem know well ever desire appear lordly generous king old gracious gentle may well befit one high race sits power peace desperate hours gentleness may repaid death'
 'so it' said faramir
 'so it' cried denethor 'but death lord faramir death also father people part protect boromir gone'
 'do wish then' said faramir 'that places exchanged'
 'yes wish indeed' said denethor 'for boromir loyal wizard's pupil would remembered father's need would squandered fortune gave would brought mighty gift'
 moment faramir's restraint gave way 'i would ask father remember ithilien one occasion least counsel prevailed long ago lord city gave errand him'
 'stir bitterness cup mixed myself' said denethor 'have tasted many nights upon tongue foreboding worse yet lay dregs indeed find would would thing come me'
 'comfort yourself' said gandalf 'in case would boromir brought dead died well may sleep peace yet deceive would stretched hand thing taking would fallen would kept returned would known son'
 face denethor set hard cold 'you found boromir less apt hand not' said softly 'but father say would brought wise maybe mithrandir yet subtleties wisdom counsels may found neither webs wizards haste fools matter lore wisdom deem '
 'what wisdom' said gandalf
 'enough perceive two follies avoid use thing perilous hour send hands witless halfling land enemy done son mine madness'
 'and lord denethor would done'
 'neither surely argument would set thing hazard beyond fool's hope risking utter ruin enemy recover lost nay kept hidden hidden dark deep used say unless uttermost end need set beyond grasp save victory final befell would trouble us dead'
 'you think wont lord gondor only' said gandalf 'yet men lives time still pity even slaves'
 'and men look help gondor falls' answered denethor 'if thing deep vaults citadel shake dread gloom fearing worst counsels would undisturbed trust endure test know yet'
 'nonetheless trust you' said gandalf 'had done could sent thing hither keeping spared others much anguish hearing speak trust less boromir nay stay wrath trust refused thing even freely given gift strong still matters govern denethor yet received thing would overthrown buried beneath roots mindolluin still would burn mind away darkness grows yet worse things follow soon shall come upon us'
 moment eyes denethor glowed faced gandalf pippin felt strain wills almost seemed glances like blades eye eye flickering fenced pippin trembled fearing dreadful stroke suddenly denethor relaxed grew cold shrugged shoulders
 'if had' said 'such words ifs vain gone shadow time show doom awaits us time long left let fight enemy fashion one keep hope may hope still hardihood die free' turned faramir 'what think garrison osgiliath'
 'it strong' said faramir 'i sent company ithilien strengthen said'
 'not enough deem' said denethor 'it first blow fall need stout captain there'
 'there elsewhere many places' said faramir sighed 'alas brother loved' rose 'may leave father' swayed leaned upon father's chair
 'you weary see' said denethor 'you ridden fast far shadows evil air told'
 'let us speak that' said faramir
 'then not' said denethor 'go rest may tomorrow's need sterner'

 took leave lord city went rest still could outside starless blackness gandalf pippin beside bearing small torch made way lodging speak behind closed doors last pippin took gandalf's hand
 'tell me' said 'is hope frodo mean least mostly frodo'
 gandalf put hand pippin's head 'there never much hope' answered 'just fool's hope told heard cirith ungol���' broke strode window eyes could pierce night east 'cirith ungol' muttered 'why way wonder' turned 'just pippin heart almost failed hearing name yet truth believe news faramir brings hope seems clear enemy opened war last made first move frodo still free many days eye turned way away land yet pippin feel afar haste fear begun sooner would something happened stir him'
 gandalf stood moment thought 'maybe' muttered 'maybe even foolishness helped lad let see five days ago would discover thrown saruman taken stone still could use much purpose without knowing ah wonder aragorn time draws near strong stern underneath pippin bold determined able take counsel dare great risks need may may used stone shown enemy challenging purpose wonder well shall know answer till riders rohan come come late evil days ahead sleep may'
 'but' said pippin
 'but what' said gandalf 'only one _but_ allow tonight'
 'gollum' said pippin 'how earth could going _with_ even following could see faramir like place taking wrong'
 'i cannot answer now' said gandalf 'yet heart guessed frodo gollum would meet end good evil cirith ungol speak tonight treachery treachery fear treachery miserable creature must let us remember traitor may betray good intend sometimes good night '
 next day came morning like brown dusk hearts men lifted return faramir sank low winged shadows seen day yet ever anon high city faint cry would come many heard would stand stricken passing dread less stouthearted quailed wept
 faramir gone 'they give rest' murmured 'the lord drives son hard must duty two one return' ever men looked northward asking 'where riders rohan'
 truth faramir go choosing lord city master council mood day bow others early morning council summoned captains judged threat south force weak make stroke war part unless perchance riders rohan yet come meanwhile must man walls wait
 'yet' said denethor 'we lightly abandon outer defences rammas made great labour enemy must pay dearly crossing river cannot force assail city either north cair andros marshes southwards towards lebennin breadth river needs many boats osgiliath put weight boromir denied passage'
 'that trial' said faramir 'today may make enemy pay ten times loss passage yet rue exchange afford lose host better lose company retreat put far afield perilous wins across force'
 'and cair andros' said prince 'that must held osgiliath defended let us forget danger left rohirrim may come may faramir told us great strength drawing ever black gate one host may issue strike one passage'
 'much must risked war' said denethor 'cair andros manned sent far yield river pelennor unfought � captain still courage lord's will'
 silent length faramir said 'i oppose sire since robbed boromir go stead � command it'
 'i so' said denethor
 'then farewell' said faramir 'but return think better me'
 'that depends manner return' said denethor
 gandalf last spoke faramir ere rode east 'do throw live away rashly bitterness' said 'you needed things war father loves faramir remember ere end farewell'
 lord faramir gone forth taken strength men willing go could spared walls gazed gloom towards ruined city wondered chanced nothing could seen others ever looked north counted leagues th�oden rohan 'will come remember old alliance' said
 'yes come' said gandalf 'even comes late think best red arrow cannot reached two days ago miles long edoras'
 night ere news came man rode haste fords saying host issued minas morgul already drawing nigh osgiliath joined regiments south haradrim cruel tall 'and learned ' said messenger 'that black captain leads fear passed river'
 illboding words third day closed since pippin came minas tirith went rest small hope even faramir could hold fords long

 next day though darkness reached full grew deeper weighed heavier men's hearts great dread ill news came soon passage anduin enemy faramir retreating wall pelennor rallying men causeway forts ten times outnumbered
 'if wins back across pelennor enemies heels' said messenger 'they paid dear crossing less dearly hoped plan well laid seen secret long building floats barges great numbers east osgiliath swarmed across like beetles black captain defeats us stand abide even rumour coming folk quail would slay bidding'
 'then needed here' said gandalf rode glimmer faded soon sight night pippin alone sleepless stood upon wall gazed eastward

 bells day scarcely rung mockery unlightened dark far away saw fires spring across dim spaces walls pelennor stood watchmen cried aloud men city stood arms ever anon red flash slowly heavy air dull rumbles could heard
 'they taken wall' men cried 'they blasting breaches coming'
 'where faramir' cried beregond dismay 'say fallen'
 gandalf brought first tidings handful horsemen came middle morning riding escort line wains filled wounded men could saved wreck causeway forts went denethor lord city sat high chamber hall white tower pippin side dim windows north south east bent dark eyes pierce shadows doom ringed round north looked would pause whiles listen ancient art ears might hear thunder hoofs plains far away
 'is faramir come' asked
 'no' said gandalf 'but still lived left yet resolved stay rearguard lest retreat pelennor become rout may perhaps hold men together long enough doubt pitted foe great one come feared'
 'not � dark lord' cried pippin forgetting place terror
 denethor laughed bitterly 'nay yet master peregrin come save triumph uses others weapons great lords wise master halfling sit tower think watch wait spending even sons still wield brand'
 stood cast open long black cloak behold clad mail beneath girt long sword greathilted sheath black silver 'thus walked thus many years slept' said 'lest age body grow soft timid'
 'yet lord baradd�r fell captains already master outer walls' said gandalf 'king angmar long ago sorcerer ringwraith lord nazg�l spear terror hand sauron shadow despair'
 'then mithrandir foe match you' said denethor 'for long known chief captain hosts dark tower returned say withdrawn overmatched'
 pippin trembled fearing gandalf would stung sudden wrath fear needless 'it might so' gandalf answered softly 'but trial strength yet come words spoken old true hand man shall fall hidden wise doom awaits however may captain despair press forward yet rules rather according wisdom spoken rear driving slaves madness
 'nay came rather guard hurt men yet healed rammas breached far wide soon host morgul enter many points came chiefly say soon battle fields sortie must made ready let mounted men lies brief hope one thing enemy still poorly provided horsemen'
 'and also would coming rohan nick time' said denethor
 'we likely see newcomers first' said gandalf 'fugitives cair andros already reached us isle fallen another army come black gate crossing northeast'
 'some accused mithrandir delighting bear ill news' said denethor 'but longer news known ere nightfall yesterday sortie already given thought let us go down'
 time passed length watchers walls could see retreat outcompanies small bands weary often wounded men came first little order running wildly pursued away eastward distant fires flickered seemed crept across plain houses barns burning many points little rivers red flame came hurrying winding gloom converging towards line broad road led citygate osgiliath
 'the enemy' men murmured 'the dike come pouring breaches carry torches seems folk'
 drew evening hour light dim even farsighted men upon citadel could discern little clearly upon fields save burnings ever multiplied lines fire grew length speed last less mile city ordered mass men came view marching running still holding together
 watchers held breath 'faramir must there' said 'he govern man beast make yet'

 main retreat scarcely two furlongs distant gloom behind small company horsemen galloped left rearguard turned bay facing oncoming lines fire suddenly tumult fierce cries horsemen enemy swept lines fire became flowing torrents file upon file orcs bearing flames wild southron men red banners shouting harsh tongues surging overtaking retreat piercing cry dim sky fell winged shadows nazg�l stooping kill

 ride rohirrim

 dark merry could see nothing lay ground rolled blanket yet though night airless windless hidden trees sighing softly lifted head heard sound like faint drums wooded hills mountainsteps throb would cease suddenly taken point nearer wondered watchmen heard
 could see knew round companies rohirrim could smell horses dark could hear shiftings soft stamping needlecovered ground host bivouacked pinewoods clustered eilenach beacon tall hill standing long ridges dr�adan forest lay beside great road east an�rien
 tired merry could sleep ridden four days end everdeepening gloom slowly weighed heart began wonder eager come given every excuse even lord's command stay behind wondered old king knew disobeyed angry perhaps seemed understanding dernhelm elfhelm marshal commanded _�ored_ riding men ignored merry pretended hear spoke might another bag dernhelm carrying dernhelm comfort never spoke anyone merry felt small unwanted lonely time anxious host peril less day's ride outwalls minas tirith encircled townlands scouts sent ahead returned others hastening back reported road held force host enemy encamped upon three miles west amon d�n strength men already thrusting along road three leagues away orcs roving hills woods along roadside king �omer held council watches night
 merry wanted somebody talk thought pippin increased restlessness poor pippin shut great city stone lonely afraid merry wished tall rider like �omer could blow horn something go galloping rescue sat listening drums beating nearer hand presently heard voices speaking low saw dim halfshrouded lanterns passing trees men nearby began move uncertainly dark
 tall figure loomed stumbled cursing treeroots recognized voice marshal elfhelm
 'i treeroot sir' said 'nor bag bruised hobbit least amends tell afoot'
 'anything keep devil's mirk' answered elfhelm 'but lord sends word must set readiness orders may come sudden move'
 'is enemy coming then' asked merry anxiously 'are drums began think imagining one else seemed take notice them'
 'nay nay' said elfhelm 'the enemy road hills hear woses wild men woods thus talk together afar still haunt dr�adan forest said remnants older time living secretly wild wary beasts go war gondor mark troubled darkness coming orcs fear lest dark years returning seems likely enough let us thankful hunting us use poisoned arrows said woodcrafty beyond compare offered services th�oden even one headmen taken king yonder go lights much heard must busy lord's commands pack master bag' vanished shadows
 merry like talk wild men poisoned darts quite apart great weight dread waiting unbearable longed know going happen got soon walking warily pursuit last lantern disappeared among trees
 presently came open space small tent set king great tree large lantern covered hanging bough cast pale circle light sat th�oden �omer ground sat strange squat shape man gnarled old stone hairs scanty beard straggled lumpy chin like dry moss shortlegged fatarmed thick stumpy clad grass waist merry felt seen somewhere suddenly remembered p�kelmen dunharrow one old images brought life maybe creature descended true line endless years models used forgotten craftsmen long ago
 silence merry crept nearer wild man began speak answer question seemed voice deep guttural yet merry's surprise spoke common speech though halting fashion uncouth words mingled
 'no father horsemen' said 'we fight hunt kill _gorg�n_ woods hate orcfolk hate _gorg�n_ help wild men long ears long eyes know paths wild men live stonehouses tall men come water'
 'but need aid battle' said �omer 'how folk help us'
 'bring news' said wild man 'we look hills climb big mountain look stonecity shut fire burns outside inside wish come must quick _gorg�n_ men faraway' waved short gnarled arm eastward 'sit horseroad many horsemen'
 'how know that' said �omer
 old man's flat face dark eyes showed nothing voice sullen displeasure 'wild men wild free children' answered 'i great headman gh�nburigh�n count many things stars sky leaves trees men dark score scores counted ten times five big fight win many walk round walls stonehouses'
 'alas speaks shrewdly' said th�oden 'and scouts say cast trenches stakes across road cannot sweep away sudden onset'
 'and yet need great haste' said �omer 'mundburg fire'
 'let gh�nburigh�n finish' said wild man 'more one road knows lead road pits _gorg�n_ walk wild men beasts many paths made stonehousefolk stronger carved hills hunters carve beastflesh wild men think ate stone food went dr�adan rimmon great wains go longer road forgotten wild men hill behind hill lies still grass tree behind rimmon d�n back end horsemen's road wild men show road kill _gorg�n_ drive away bad dark bright iron wild men go back sleep wild woods'
 �omer king spoke together tongue length th�oden turned wild man 'we receive offer' said 'for though leave host foes behind matter stonecity falls shall returning saved orchost cut faithful gh�nburigh�n give rich reward shall friendship mark ever'
 'dead men friends living men give gifts' said wild man 'but live darkness leave wild men alone woods hunt like beasts gh�nburigh�n lead trap go father horsemen leads wrong kill him'
 'so it' said th�oden
 'how long take pass enemy come back road' asked �omer 'we must go footpace guide us doubt way narrow'
 'wild men go quick feet' said gh�n 'way wide four horses stonewain valley yonder' waved hand southwards 'but narrow beginning end wild man could walk d�n sunrise noon'
 'then must allow least seven hours leaders' said �omer 'but must reckon rather ten hours things unforeseen may hinder us host strung long ere set order issue hills hour now'
 'who knows' said th�oden 'all night now'
 'it dark night' said gh�n 'when sun comes feel even hidden already climbs eastmountains opening day skyfields'
 'then must set soon may be' said �omer 'even cannot hope come gondor's aid today'

 merry waited hear slipped away get ready summons march last stage battle seem likely many would survive thought pippin flames minas tirith thrust dread
 went well day sight sound enemy waiting waylay wild men put screen wary hunters orc roving spy learn movements hills light dim ever drew nearer beleaguered city riders passed long files like dark shadows men horses company guided wild woodman old gh�n walked beside king start slower hoped taken time riders walking leading horses find paths thickly wooded ridges behind camp hidden stonewain valley late afternoon leaders came wide grey thickets stretching beyond eastward side amon d�n masking great gap line hills nardol d�n ran east west gap forgotten wainroad long ago run back main horseway city an�rien many lives men trees way vanished broken buried leaves uncounted years thickets offered riders last hope cover went open battle beyond lay road plains anduin east southwards slopes bare rocky writhen hills gathered together climbed bastion upon bastion great mass shoulders mindolluin
 leading company halted behind filed trough stonewain valley spread passed campingplaces grey trees king summoned captains council �omer sent scouts spy upon road old gh�n shook head
 'no good send horsemen' said 'wild men already seen seen bad air come soon speak here'
 captains came trees crept warily p�kelshapes like old gh�n merry could hardly tell apart spoke gh�n strange throaty language
 presently gh�n turned king 'wild men say many things ' said 'first wary still many men camp beyond d�n hour's walk yonder' waved arm west towards black beacon 'but none see stonefolk's new walls many busy walls stand longer _gorg�n_ knock earththunder clubs black iron unwary look think friends watch roads' old gh�n made curious gurgling noise seemed laughing
 'good tidings' cried �omer 'even gloom hope gleams enemy's devices oft serve us despite accursed darkness cloak us lusting destroy gondor throw stone stone orcs taken away greatest fear outwall could held long us sweep � win far'
 'once thank gh�nburigh�n woods' said th�oden 'good fortune go tidings guidance'
 'kill _gorg�n_ kill orcfolk words please wild men ' answered gh�n 'drive away bad air darkness bright iron'
 'to things ridden far' said king 'and shall attempt shall achieve tomorrow show'
 gh�nburigh�n squatted touched earth horny brow token farewell got depart suddenly stood looking like startled woodland animal snuffling strange air light came eyes
 'wind changing' cried twinkling seemed fellows vanished glooms never seen rider rohan long far away eastward faint drums throbbed yet heart host came fear wild men unfaithful strange unlovely though might appear
 'we need guidance' said elfhelm 'for riders host ridden mundburg days peace one come road veer south lie us still seven leagues ere reach wall townlands along way much grass either side road stretch errandriders gondor reckoned make greatest speed may ride swiftly without great rumour'
 'then since must look fell deeds need strength' said �omer 'i counsel rest set hence night time going come upon fields tomorrow light lord gives signal'
 king assented captains departed soon elfhelm returned 'the scouts found naught report beyond grey wood lord' said 'save two men two dead men two dead horses'
 'well' said �omer 'what it'
 'this lord errandriders gondor hirgon one maybe least hand still clasped red arrow head hewn also would seem signs fleeing _westward_ fell read found enemy already outwall assailing returned � would two nights ago used fresh horses posts wont could reach city turned back'
 'alas' said th�oden 'then denethor heard news riding despair coming'
 '_need brooks delay yet late better never_' said �omer 'and mayhap time shall old saw proved truer ever since men spoke mouth'
 night either side road host rohan moving silently road passing skirts mindolluin turned southward far away almost straight ahead red glow black sky sides great mountain loomed dark drawing near rammas pelennor day yet come
 king rode midst leading company householdmen elfhelm's _�ored_ came next merry noticed dernhelm left place darkness moving steadily forward last riding rear king's guard came check merry heard voices front speaking softly outriders come back ventured forward almost wall came king
 'there great fires lord' said one 'the city set flame field full foes seem drawn assault well could guess left upon outwall heedless busy destruction'
 'do remember wild man's words lord' said another 'i live upon open wold days peace w�dfara name also air brings messages already wind turning comes breath south seatang faint though morning bring new things reek dawn pass wall'
 'if speak truly w�dfara may live beyond day years blessedness' said th�oden turned men household near spoke clear voice many also riders first _�ored_ heard
 'now hour come riders mark sons eorl foes fire homes far behind yet though fight upon alien field glory reap shall ever oaths ye taken fulfil lord land league friendship'
 men clashed spear upon shield
 '�omer son lead first _�ored_' said th�oden 'and shall go behind king's banner centre elfhelm lead company right pass wall grimbold shall lead towards left let companies behind follow three lead chance strike wherever enemy gathers plans cannot make know yet things stand upon field forth fear darkness'
 leading company rode swiftly could still deep dark whatever change w�dfara might forebode merry riding behind dernhelm clutching left hand tried loosen sword sheath felt bitterly truth old king's words _in battle would meriadoc_ this' thought 'encumber rider hope best stay seat pounded death galloping hoofs'
 league outwalls stood soon reached soon merry wild cries broke clash arms brief orcs busy walls amazed quickly slain driven ruin northgate rammas king halted first _�ored_ drew behind either side dernhelm kept close king though elfhelm's company away right grimbold's men turned aside passed round great gap wall eastward
 merry peered behind dernhelm's back far away maybe ten miles great burning riders lines fire blazed vast crescent nearest point less league distant could make little dark plain yet neither saw hope morning felt wind changed unchanged
 silently host rohan moved forward field gondor pouring slowly steadily like rising tide breaches dike men thought secure mind black captain bent wholly falling city yet tidings came warning designs held flaw
 king led men away somewhat eastward come fires siege outer fields still unchallenged still th�oden gave signal last halted city nearer smell burning air shadow death horses uneasy king sat upon snowmane motionless gazing upon agony minas tirith stricken suddenly anguish dread seemed shrink cowed age merry felt great weight horror doubt settled heart beat slowly time seemed poised uncertainty late late worse never perhaps th�oden would quail bow old head turn slink away hide hills
 suddenly merry felt last beyond doubt change wind face light glimmering far far away south clouds could dimly seen remote grey shapes rolling drifting morning lay beyond
 moment flash lightning sprung earth beneath city searing second stood dazzling far black white topmost tower like glittering needle darkness closed came rolling fields great _boom_
 sound bent shape king sprang suddenly erect tall proud seemed rising stirrups cried loud voice clear ever heard mortal man achieve

 sword rang drawn 'do hinder may'

 merry heard sounds hour strangest seemed dernhelm laughed clear voice like ring steel 'but living man look upon woman �owyn �omund's daughter stand lord kin begone deathless living dark undead smite touch him'
 winged creature screamed ringwraith made answer silent sudden doubt amazement moment conquered merry's fear opened eyes blackness lifted paces sat great beast seemed dark loomed nazg�l lord like shadow despair little left facing stood called dernhelm helm secrecy fallen bright hair released bonds gleamed pale gold upon shoulders eyes grey sea hard fell yet tears cheek sword hand raised shield horror enemy's eyes

 merry stooped lifted hand kiss lo th�oden opened eyes clear spoke quiet voice though laboured
 'farewell master holbytla' said 'my body broken go fathers even mighty company shall ashamed felled black serpent grim morn glad day golden sunset'
 merry could speak wept anew 'forgive lord' said last 'if broke command yet done service weep parting'
 old king smiled 'grieve forgiven great heart denied live blessedness sit peace pipe think never shall sit meduseld promised listen herblore' closed eyes merry bowed beside presently spoke 'where �omer eyes darken would see ere go must king would send word �owyn would leave shall see dearer daughter'
 'lord lord' began merry brokenly 'she is' moment great clamour horns trumpets blowing merry looked round forgotten war world beside many hours seemed since king rode fall though truth little saw danger caught midst great battle would soon joined

 pyre denethor

 dark shadow gate withdrew gandalf still sat motionless pippin rose feet great weight lifted stood listening horns seemed would break heart joy never years could hear horn blown distance without tears starting eyes suddenly errand returned memory ran forward moment gandalf stirred spoke shadowfax ride gate
 'gandalf gandalf ' cried pippin shadowfax halted
 'what here' said gandalf 'is law city wear black silver must stay citadel unless lord gives leave'
 'he has' said pippin 'he sent away frightened something terrible may happen lord mind think afraid kill kill faramir can't something'
 gandalf looked gaping gate already fields heard gathering sound battle clenched hand 'i must go ' said 'the black rider abroad yet bring ruin us time'
 'but faramir' cried pippin 'he dead burn alive someone stop them'
 'burn alive' said gandalf 'what tale quick'
 'denethor gone tombs' said pippin 'and taken faramir says burn wait make pyre burn faramir well sent men fetch wood oil told beregond i'm afraid dare leave post guard anyway' pippin poured tale reaching touching gandalf's knee trembling hands 'can't save faramir'
 'maybe can' said gandalf 'but others die fear well must come since help reach evil sorrow come even heart stronghold enemy power strike us work'
 made mind acted swiftly catching pippin setting turned shadowfax word climbing streets minas tirith clattered noise war rose behind everywhere men rising despair dread seizing weapons crying one another 'rohan come' captains shouting companies mustering many already marching gate
 met prince imrahil called 'whither mithrandir rohirrim fighting fields gondor must gather strength find'
 'you need every man more' said gandalf 'make haste come errand lord denethor wait take command lord's absence'
 passed climbed drew near citadel felt wind blowing faces caught glimmer morning far away light growing southern sky brought little hope knowing evil lay fearing come late
 'darkness passing' said gandalf 'but still lies heavy city'
 gate citadel found guard 'then beregond gone' said pippin hopefully turned away hastened along road closed door stood wide open porter lay slain key taken
 'work enemy' said gandalf 'such deeds loves friend war friend loyalty divided confusion hearts' dismounted bade shadowfax return stable 'for friend' said 'you ridden fields long ago matters delay yet come swiftly call'
 passed door walked steep winding road light growing tall columns carven figures beside way went slowly like grey ghosts
 suddenly silence broken heard cries ringing swords sounds heard hallowed places since building city last came rath d�nen hastened towards house stewards looming twilight great dome
 'stay stay' cried gandalf springing forward stone stair door 'stay madness'
 servants denethor swords torches hands alone porch upon topmost step stood beregond clad black silver guard held door two already fallen sword staining hallows blood others cursed calling outlaw traitor master
 even gandalf pippin ran forward heard within house dead voice denethor crying 'haste haste bidden slay renegade must myself' thereupon door beregond held shut left hand wrenched open behind stood lord city tall fell light like flame eyes held drawn sword
 gandalf sprang steps men fell back covered eyes coming like incoming white light dark place came great anger lifted hand stroke sword denethor flew left grasp fell behind shadows house denethor stepped backward gandalf one amazed
 'what lord' said wizard 'the houses dead places living men fight hallows war enough gate enemy come even rath d�nen'
 'since lord gondor answerable thee' said denethor 'or may command servants'
 'you may' said gandalf 'but others may contest turned madness evil son faramir'
 'he lies within' said denethor 'burning already burning set fire flesh soon shall burned west failed shall go great fire shall ended ash ash smoke blown away wind'
 gandalf seeing madness feared already done evil deed thrust forward beregond pippin behind denethor gave back stood beside table within found faramir still dreaming fever lying upon table wood piled high drenched oil even garments faramir coverlets yet fire set fuel gandalf revealed strength lay hid even light power hidden grey mantle leaped faggots raising sick man lightly sprang bore towards door faramir moaned called father dream
 denethor started one waking trance flame died eyes wept said 'do take son calls me'
 'he calls' said gandalf 'but cannot come yet must seek healing threshold death maybe find whereas part go battle city maybe death awaits know heart'
 'he wake again' said denethor 'battle vain wish live longer go death side side'
 'authority given steward gondor order hour death' answered gandalf 'and heathen kings domination dark power thus slaying pride despair murdering kin ease death' passing door took faramir deadly house laid bier brought set porch denethor followed stood trembling looking longing face son moment silent still watching lord throes wavered
 'come' said gandalf 'we needed much yet do'
 suddenly denethor laughed stood tall proud stepping swiftly back table lifted pillow head lain coming doorway drew aside covering lo hands _palant�r_ held seemed looked globe began glow inner flame lean face lord lit red fire seemed cut hard stone sharp black shadows noble proud terrible eyes glittered
 'pride despair' cried 'didst thou think eyes white tower blind nay seen thou knowest grey fool thy hope ignorance go labour healing go forth fight vanity little space may triumph field day power arises victory city first finger hand yet stretched east moving even wind thy hope cheats thee wafts anduin fleet black sails west failed time depart would slaves'
 'such counsels make enemy's victory certain indeed' said gandalf
 'hope then' laughed denethor 'do know thee mithrandir thy hope rule stead stand behind every throne north south west read thy mind policies know commanded halfling keep silence brought hither spy within chamber yet speech together learned names purpose thy companions left hand thou wouldst use little shield mordor right bring ranger north supplant
 'but say thee gandalf mithrandir thy tool steward house an�rion step dotard chamberlain upstart even claim proved still comes line isildur bow one last ragged house long bereft lordship dignity'
 'what would have' said gandalf 'if could way'
 'i would things days life' answered denethor 'and days longfathers lord city peace leave chair son would master wizard's pupil doom denies _naught_ neither life diminished love halved honour abated'
 'to would seem steward faithfully surrenders charge diminished love honour' said gandalf 'and least shall rob son choice death still doubt'
 words denethor's eyes flamed taking stone arm drew knife strode towards bier beregond sprang forward set faramir
 'so' cried denethor 'thou hadst already stolen half son's love thou stealest hearts knights also rob wholly son last least thou shalt defy rule end'
 'come hither' cried servants 'come recreant' two ran steps swiftly snatched torch hand one sprang back house gandalf could hinder thrust brand amid fuel crackled roared flame
 denethor leaped upon table standing wreathed fire smoke took staff stewardship lay feet broke knee casting pieces blaze bowed laid table clasping _palant�r_ hands upon breast said ever man looked stone unless great strength turn purpose saw two aged hands withering flame
 gandalf grief horror turned face away closed door stood thought silent upon threshold outside heard greedy roaring fire within denethor gave great cry afterwards spoke ever seen mortal men
 'so passes denethor son ecthelion' said gandalf turned beregond lord's servants stood aghast 'and pass also days gondor known good evil ended ill deeds done let enmity lies put away contrived enemy works caught net warring duties weave think servants lord blind obedience treason beregond faramir captain white tower would also burned
 'bear away unhappy place comrades fallen bear faramir steward gondor place sleep peace die doom'
 gandalf beregond taking bier bore away towards houses healing behind walked pippin downcast head servants lord stood gazing stricken men house dead even gandalf came end rath d�nen great noise looking back saw dome house crack smokes issue forth rush rumble stone fell flurry fire still unabated flames danced flickered among ruins terror servants fled followed gandalf
 length came back steward's door beregond looked grief porter 'this deed shall ever rue' said 'but madness haste would listen drew sword me' taking key wrested slain man closed door locked 'this given lord faramir' said
 'the prince dol amroth command absence lord' said gandalf 'but since must take bid keep key guard city set order again'
 last passed high circles city light morning went way towards houses healing fair houses set apart care grievously sick prepared tending men hurt battle dying stood far citadelgate sixth circle nigh southward wall garden greensward trees place city dwelt women permitted remain minas tirith since skilled healing service healers
 even gandalf companions came carrying bier main door houses heard great cry went field gate rising shrill piercing sky passed died away wind terrible cry moment stood still yet passed suddenly hearts lifted hope known since darkness came east seemed light grew clear sun broke clouds
 gandalf's face grave sad bidding beregond pippin take faramir houses healing went walls nearby like figure carven white stood new sun looked beheld sight given befallen �omer rode forefront battle stood beside lay upon field sighed cast cloak went walls beregond pippin found standing thought door houses came
 looked silent last spoke 'my friends' said 'and people city western lands things great sorrow renown come pass shall weep glad beyond hope captain foes destroyed heard echo last despair gone without woe bitter loss might averted madness denethor long reach enemy become alas perceive able enter heart city
 'though stewards deemed secret kept long ago guessed white tower one least seven seeing stones preserved days wisdom denethor presume use challenge sauron knowing limits strength wisdom failed fear peril realm grew looked stone deceived far often guess since boromir departed great subdued dark power saw nonetheless things power permitted see knowledge obtained doubtless often service yet vision great might mordor shown fed despair heart overthrew mind'
 'now understand seemed strange me' said pippin shuddering memories spoke 'the lord went away room faramir lay returned first thought changed old broken'
 'it hour faramir brought tower many us saw strange light topmost chamber' said beregond 'but seen light long rumoured city lord would times wrestle thought enemy'
 'alas guessed rightly' said gandalf 'thus sauron entered minas tirith thus delayed shall still forced remain shall soon charges faramir
 'now must go meet come seen sight upon field grievous heart greater sorrow may yet come pass come pippin beregond return citadel tell chief guard befallen duty fear withdraw guard say may give counsel sent houses healing guard servant captain side awakes � shall ever saved fire go shall return soon'
 turned away went pippin towards lower city even hastened way wind brought grey rain fires sank arose great smoke


 _chapter 8_
 houses healing

 mist merry's eyes tears weariness drew near ruined gate minas tirith gave little heed wreck slaughter lay fire smoke stench air many engines burned cast firepits many slain also lay many carcases great southron monsters halfburned broken stonecast shot eyes valiant archers morthond flying rain ceased time sun gleamed lower city still wrapped smouldering reek
 already men labouring clear way jetsam battle gate came bearing litters gently laid �owyn upon soft pillows king's body covered great cloth gold bore torches flames pale sunlight fluttered wind
 th�oden �owyn came city gondor saw bared heads bowed passed ash fume burned circle went along streets stone merry ascent seemed agelong meaningless journey hateful dream going dim ending memory cannot seize
 slowly lights torches front flickered went walking darkness thought 'this tunnel leading tomb shall stay forever' suddenly dream fell living voice
 'well merry thank goodness found you'
 looked mist eyes cleared little pippin face face narrow lane empty rubbed eyes
 'where king' said 'and �owyn' stumbled sat doorstep began weep
 'they gone citadel' said pippin 'i think must fallen asleep feet taken wrong turning found gandalf sent look poor old merry glad see worn bother talk tell hurt wounded'
 'no' said merry 'well think can't use right arm pippin since stabbed sword burned away like piece wood'
 pippin's face anxious 'well better come quick can' said 'i wish could carry fit walk let walk must forgive many dreadful things happened city merry one poor hobbit coming battle easily overlooked'
 'it's always misfortune overlooked' said merry 'i overlooked � can't speak help pippin going dark arm cold'
 'lean merry lad' said pippin 'come foot foot far'
 'are going bury me' said merry
 'no indeed' said pippin trying sound cheerful though heart wrung fear pity 'no going houses healing'

 turned lane ran tall houses outer wall fourth circle regained main street climbing citadel step step went merry swayed murmured one sleep
 'i'll never get there' thought pippin 'is one help can't leave here' surprise boy came running behind passed recognized bergil beregond's son
 'hullo bergil' called 'where going glad see still alive'
 'i running errands healers' said bergil 'i cannot stay'
 'don't' said pippin 'but tell sick hobbit _perian_ mind come battlefield think walk far mithrandir glad message' bergil ran
 'i'd better wait here' thought pippin let merry sink gently pavement patch sunlight sat beside laying merry's head lap felt body limbs gently took friend's hands right hand felt icy touch
 long gandalf came search stooped merry caressed brow lifted carefully 'he borne honour city' said 'he well repaid trust elrond yielded neither would set far grievous would evils day been' sighed 'and yet another charge hands time battle hangs balance'

 last faramir �owyn meriadoc laid beds houses healing tended well though lore latter days fallen fullness old leechcraft gondor still wise skilled healing wound hurt sickness east sea mortal men subject save old age found cure indeed span lives waned little men among passed tale five score years vigour grown save houses purer blood art knowledge baffled many sick malady would healed called black shadow came nazg�l stricken fell slowly ever deeper dream passed silence deadly cold died seemed tenders sick halfling lady rohan malady lay heavily still whiles morning wore away would speak murmuring dreams watchers listened said hoping perhaps learn something would help understand hurts soon began fall darkness sun turned west grey shadow crept faces faramir burned fever would abate
 gandalf went one full care told watchers could hear day passed great battle outside went shifting hopes strange tidings still gandalf waited watched go forth till last red sunset filled sky light windows fell grey faces sick seemed stood glow faces flushed softly health returning mockery hope
 old wife ioreth eldest women served house looking fair face faramir wept people loved said 'alas die would kings gondor upon time say said old lore _the hands king hands healer_ rightful king could ever known'
 gandalf stood said 'men may long remember words ioreth hope maybe king indeed returned gondor heard strange tidings come city'
 'i busy heed crying shouting' answered 'all hope murdering devils come house trouble sick'
 gandalf went haste already fire sky burning smouldering hills fading ashgrey evening crept fields

 sun went aragorn �omer imrahil drew near city captains knights came gate aragorn said
 'behold sun setting great fire sign end fall many things change tides world city realm rested charge stewards many long years fear enter unbidden doubt debate may arise war fought enter make claim seen whether mordor shall prevail men shall pitch tents upon field await welcome lord city'
 �omer said 'already raised banner kings displayed tokens elendil's house suffer challenged'
 'no' said aragorn 'but deem time unripe mind strife except enemy servants'
 prince imrahil said words lord wise one kinsman lord denethor may counsel matter strongwilled proud old mood strange since son stricken yet would remain like beggar door'
 'not beggar' said aragorn 'say captain rangers unused cities houses stone' commanded banner furled star north kingdom gave keeping sons elrond


 prince imrahil �omer rohan left passed city tumult people mounted citadel came hall tower seeking steward found chair empty dais lay th�oden king mark upon bed state twelve torches stood twelve guards knights rohan gondor hangings bed green white upon king laid great cloth gold breast upon unsheathed sword feet shield light torches shimmered white hair like sun spray fountain face fair young save peace lay beyond reach youth seemed slept
 stood silent time beside king imrahil said 'where steward also mithrandir'
 one guards answered 'the steward gondor houses healing'
 �omer said 'where lady �owyn sister surely lying beside king less honour bestowed her'
 imrahil said 'but lady �owyn yet living bore hither know'
 hope unlookedfor came suddenly �omer's heart bite care fear renewed said turned went swiftly hall prince followed came forth evening fallen many stars sky came gandalf foot one cloaked grey met doors houses healing greeted gandalf said 'we seek steward men say house hurt befallen lady �owyn she'
 gandalf answered 'she lies within dead near death lord faramir wounded evil dart heard steward denethor departed house ashes' filled grief wonder tale told
 imrahil said 'so victory shorn gladness bitter bought gondor rohan one day bereft lords �omer rules rohirrim shall rule city meanwhile shall send lord aragorn'
 cloaked man spoke said 'he come' saw stepped light lantern door aragorn wrapped grey cloak l�rien mail bearing token green stone galadriel 'i come gandalf begs so' said 'but present captain d�nedain arnor lord dol amroth shall rule city faramir awakes counsel gandalf rule us days follow dealings enemy' agreed upon
 gandalf said 'let us stay door time urgent let us enter coming aragorn hope remains sick lie house thus spake ioreth wisewoman gondor _the hands king hands healer shall rightful king known_'

 aragorn entered first others followed door two guards livery citadel one tall scarce height boy saw cried aloud surprise joy
 'strider splendid know guessed black ships shouting _corsairs_ listen it'
 aragorn laughed took hobbit hand 'well met indeed' said 'but time yet travellers' tales'

 imrahil said �omer 'is thus speak kings yet maybe wear crown name'
 aragorn hearing turned said 'verily high tongue old _elessar_ _elfstone_ _envinyatar_ renewer' lifted breast green stone lay 'but strider shall name house ever established high tongue sound ill _telcontar_ heirs body'
 passed house went towards rooms sick tended gandalf told deeds �owyn meriadoc 'for' said 'long stood first spoke much dreaming sank deadly darkness also given see many things far off'
 aragorn went first faramir lady �owyn last merry looked faces sick seen hurts sighed 'here must put forth power skill given me' said 'would elrond eldest race greater power'
 �omer seeing sorrowful weary said 'first must rest surely least eat little'
 aragorn answered 'nay three soon faramir time running speed needed'
 called ioreth said 'you store house herbs healing'
 'yes lord' answered 'but enough reckon need sure know shall find things amiss dreadful days fires burnings lads run errands roads blocked days count since ever carrier came lossarnach market best house sure lordship know'
 'i judge see' said aragorn 'one thing also short time speech _athelas_'
 'i know sure lord' answered 'at least name go ask herbmaster knows old names'
 'it also called _kingsfoil_' said aragorn 'and maybe know name countryfolk call latter days' 'oh that' said ioreth 'well lordship named first could told none sure never heard great virtue indeed often said sisters came upon growing woods "kingsfoil" said " 'tis strange name wonder 'tis called king would plants bright garden" still smells sweet bruised sweet right word wholesome maybe nearer'
 'wholesome verily' said aragorn 'and dame love lord faramir run quick tongue get kingsfoil leaf city'
 'and not' said gandalf 'i ride lossarnach ioreth behind shall take woods sisters shadowfax shall show meaning haste'

 ioreth gone aragorn bade women make water hot took faramir's hand laid hand upon sick man's brow drenched sweat faramir move make sign seemed hardly breathe
 'he nearly spent' said aragorn turning gandalf 'but comes wound see healing smitten dart nazg�l thought would died night hurt given southron arrow would guess drew forth kept'
 'i drew forth' said imrahil 'and staunched wound keep arrow much remember dart southrons use yet believed came shadows else fever sickness understood since wound deep vital read matter'
 'weariness grief father's mood wound black breath' said aragorn 'he man staunch already come close shadow ever rode battle outwalls slowly dark must crept even fought strove hold outpost would could sooner'

 thereupon herbmaster entered 'your lordship asked kingsfoil rustics name said _athelas_ noble tongue know somewhat valinorean  '
 'i so' said aragorn 'and care whether say _as�a aranion_ _kingsfoil_ long some'
 'your pardon lord' said man 'i see loremaster merely captain war alas sir keep thing houses healing gravely hurt sick tended virtue know save perhaps sweeten fouled air drive away passing heaviness unless course give heed rhymes old days women good ioreth still repeat without understanding

 black breath blows
 death's shadow grows
 lights pass
 come athelas come athelas
 life dying
 king's hand lying

 doggrel fear garbled memory old wives meaning leave judgement indeed old folk still use infusion herb headaches'
 'then name king go find old man less lore wisdom keeps house' cried gandalf

 aragorn knelt beside faramir held hand upon brow watched felt great struggle going aragorn's face grew grey weariness ever anon called name faramir time faintly hearing aragorn removed walked afar dark vale calling one lost
 last bergil came running bore six leaves cloth 'it kingsfoil sir' said 'but fresh fear must culled two weeks ago least hope serve sir' looking faramir burst tears
 aragorn smiled 'it serve' said 'the worst stay comforted' taking two leaves laid hands breathed crushed straightway living freshness filled room air awoke tingled sparkling joy cast leaves bowls steaming water brought hearts lightened fragrance came like memory dewy mornings unshadowed sun land fair world spring fleeting memory aragorn stood one refreshed eyes smiled held bowl faramir's dreaming face
 'well would believed it' said ioreth woman stood beside 'the weed better thought reminds roses imloth melui lass king could ask better'
 suddenly faramir stirred opened eyes looked aragorn bent light knowledge love kindled eyes spoke softly 'my lord called come king command'
 'walk shadows awake' said aragorn 'you weary rest take food ready return'
 'i lord' said faramir 'for would lie idle king returned'
 'farewell while' said aragorn 'i must go others need me' left chamber gandalf imrahil beregond son remained behind unable contain joy followed gandalf shut door pippin heard ioreth exclaim
 'king hear say hands healer said' soon word gone house king indeed come among war brought healing news ran city

 aragorn came �owyn said 'here grievous hurt heavy blow arm broken tended due skill mend time strength live shieldarm maimed chief evil comes swordarm seems life although unbroken
 'alas pitted foe beyond strength mind body take weapon enemy must sterner steel shock shall destroy evil doom set path fair maiden fairest lady house queens yet know speak first looked perceived unhappiness seemed saw white flower standing straight proud shapely lily yet knew hard wrought elfwrights steel maybe frost turned sap ice stood bittersweet still fair see stricken soon fall die malady begins far back day �omer'
 'i marvel ask lord' answered 'for hold blameless matter else yet knew �owyn sister touched frost first looked care dread shared days wormtongue king's bewitchment tended king growing fear bring pass'
 'my friend' said gandalf 'you horses deeds arms free fields born body maid spirit courage least match yet doomed wait upon old man loved father watch falling mean dishonoured dotage part seemed ignoble staff leaned

 �omer silent looked sister pondering anew days past life together aragorn said 'i saw also saw �omer griefs amid ill chances world bitterness shame man's heart behold love lady fair brave cannot returned sorrow pity followed ever since left desperate dunharrow rode paths dead fear upon way present fear might befall yet �omer say loves truly loves knows loves shadow thought hope glory great deeds lands far fields rohan
 'i maybe power heal body recall dark valley awake hope forgetfulness despair know despair die unless healing comes cannot bring alas deeds set among queens great renown'
 aragorn stooped looked face indeed white lily cold frost hard graven stone bent kissed brow called softly saying
 '�owyn �omund's daughter awake enemy passed away'
 stir began breathe deeply breast rose fell beneath white linen sheet aragorn bruised two leaves _athelas_ cast steaming water laved brow right arm lying cold nerveless coverlet
 whether aragorn indeed forgotten power westernesse whether words lady �owyn wrought sweet influence herb stole chamber seemed stood keen wind blew window bore scent air wholly fresh clean young breathed living thing came newmade snowy mountains high beneath dome stars shores silver far away washed seas foam
 'awake �owyn lady rohan' said aragorn took right hand felt warm life returning 'awake shadow gone darkness washed clean' laid hand �omer's stepped away 'call her' said passed silently chamber
 '�owyn �owyn' cried �omer amid tears opened eyes said '�omer joy said slain nay dark voices dream long dreaming'
 'not long sister' said �omer 'but think it'
 ' strangely weary' said 'i must rest little tell lord mark alas tell dream know dead foresaw'
 'he dead' said �omer 'but bade say farewell �owyn dearer daughter lies great honour citadel gondor'
 'that grievous' said 'and yet good beyond dared hope dark days seemed house eorl sunk honour less shepherd's cot king's esquire halfling �omer shall make knight riddermark valiant'
 'he lies nearby house go him' said gandalf '�omer shall stay speak yet war woe made whole great gladness see wake health hope valiant lady'
 'to health' said �owyn 'it may least empty saddle fallen rider fill deeds hope know'

 gandalf pippin came merry's room found aragorn standing bed 'poor old merry' cried pippin ran bedside seemed friend looked worse greyness face weight years sorrow lay suddenly fear seized pippin merry would die
 'do afraid' said aragorn 'i came time called back weary grieved taken hurt like lady �owyn daring smite deadly thing evils amended strong gay spirit grief forget darken heart teach wisdom'
 aragorn laid hand merry's head passing hand gently brown curls touched eyelids called name fragrance _athelas_ stole room like scent orchards heather sunshine full bees suddenly merry awoke said
 'i hungry time'
 'past suppertime now' said pippin 'though daresay could bring something let me'
 'they indeed' said gandalf 'and anything else rider rohan may desire found minas tirith name honour'
 'good' said merry 'then would like supper first pipe' face clouded 'no pipe think i'll smoke again'
 'why not' said pippin
 'well' answered merry slowly 'he dead brought back said sorry never chance talking herblore almost last thing ever said ever able smoke without thinking day pippin rode isengard polite'
 'smoke think him' said aragorn 'for gentle heart great king kept oaths rose shadows last fair morning though service brief memory glad honourable end days'
 merry smiled 'well then' said 'if strider provide needed smoke think saruman's best pack became battle sure know'
 'master meriadoc' said aragorn 'if think passed mountains realm gondor fire sword bring herbs careless soldier throws away gear mistaken pack found must send herbmaster house tell know herb desire virtues called _westmansweed_ vulgar _galenas_ noble names tongues learned adding halfforgotten rhymes understand regretfully inform none house leave reflect history tongues must slept bed since rode dunharrow eaten since dark dawn'

 'name terms' said gandalf steadily nearby saw anguish face seemed old wizened man crushed defeated last doubt would accept
 'these terms' said messenger smiled eyed one one 'the rabble gondor deluded allies shall withdraw beyond anduin first taking oaths never assail sauron great arms open secret lands east anduin shall sauron's ever solely west anduin far misty mountains gap rohan shall tributary mordor men shall bear weapons shall leave govern affairs shall help rebuild isengard wantonly destroyed shall sauron's lieutenant shall dwell saruman one worthy trust'

 `yes elfwarrior loose' cried 'i'm coming show way i'll skin you'
 orc haunts nimble wellfed sam stranger hungry weary stairs high steep winding sam's breath began come gasps orc soon passed sight faintly could heard slapping feet went every gave yell echo ran along walls slowly sound died away
 sam plodded felt right road spirits risen good deal thrust ring away tightened belt `well well' said `if take dislike sting may turn better hoped anyway looks shagrat gorbag company done nearly job except little frightened rat believe there's nobody left alive place'
 stopped brought hard hit head stone wall full meaning said struck like blow nobody left alive whose horrible dying shriek `frodo frodo master' cried half sobbing 'if they've killed shall well i'm coming last right top see must'

 went dark save occasional torch flaring turn beside opening led higher levels tower sam tried count steps two hundred lost reckoning moving quietly thought could hear sound voices talking still way one rat remained alive seemed
 felt could pump breath force knees bend stair ended stood still voices loud near sam peered climbed right flat roof third highest tier tower open space twenty yards across low parapet stair covered small domed chamber midst roof low doors facing east west eastward sam could see plain mordor vast dark burning mountain far away fresh turmoil surging deep wells rivers fire blazed fiercely even distance many miles light lit towertop red glare westward view blocked base great turret stood back upper court reared horn high crest encircling hills light gleamed windowslit door ten yards sam stood open dark within shadow voices came
 first sam listen took pace eastward door looked saw fighting fiercest court choked dead orcs severed scattered heads limbs place stank death snarl followed blow cry sent darting back hiding orcvoice rose anger knew harsh brutal cold shagrat speaking captain tower
 `you go say curse snaga little maggot think i'm damaged safe flout mistaken come i'll squeeze eyes like radbug new lads come i'll deal i'll send shelob'
 `they come dead anyway' answered snaga surlily 'i've told twice gorbag's swine got gate first none got lagduf muzgash ran shot saw window tell last'
 'then must go must stay anyway i'm hurt black pits take filthy rebel gorbag' shagrat's voice trailed string foul names curses `i gave better got knifed dung throttled must go i'll eat news must get lugb�rz we'll black pits yes escape skulking here'
 `i'm going stairs again' growled snaga `be captain nar keep hands knife i'll put arrow guts captain long hear goingson i've fought tower stinking morgulrats nice mess two precious captains made things fighting swag'
 'that's enough you' snarled shagrat `i orders gorbag started trying pinch pretty shirt'
 `well put back high mighty sense anyway told dangerous spies still loose listen listen gorbag right tell there's great fighter one bloodyhanded elves one filthy _tarks_*1 he's coming tell heard bell he's got past watchers that's _tark's_ work he's stairs he's i'm going nazg�l wouldn't'
 `so that's it' yelled shagrat 'you'll come bolt leave i'll put red maggotholes belly first'
 turretdoor smaller orc came flying behind came shagrat large orc long arms ran crouching reached ground one arm hung limp seemed bleeding hugged large black bundle red glare sam cowering behind stairdoor caught glimpse evil face passed scored rending claws smeared blood slaver dripped protruding fangs mouth snarled like animal
 far sam could see shagrat hunted snaga round roof ducking eluding smaller orc yelp darted back turret disappeared shagrat halted eastward door sam could see parapet panting left claw clenching unclenching feebly put bundle floor right claw drew long red knife spat going parapet leaned looking outer court far twice shouted answer came
 suddenly shagrat stooped battlement back rooftop sam amazement saw one sprawling bodies moving crawling put claw clutched bundle staggered hand held broadheaded spear short broken haft poised stabbing thrust moment hiss escaped teeth gasp pain hate quick snake shagrat slipped aside twisted round drove knife enemy's throat
 `got gorbag' cried 'not quite dead eh well i'll finish job now' sprang fallen body stamped trampled fury stooping stab slash knife satisfied last threw back head let horrible gurgling yell triumph licked knife put teeth catching bundle came loping towards near door stairs
 sam time think might slipped door hardly without seen could played hideandseek hideous orc long probably best thing could done sprang meet shagrat shout longer holding ring hidden power cowing menace slaves mordor hand sting light smote eyes orc like glitter cruel stars terrible elfcountries dream cold fear kind shagrat could fight keep hold treasure stopped growling baring fangs orcfashion leapt aside sam sprang using heavy bundle shield weapon thrust hard enemy's face sam staggered could recover shagrat darted past stairs
 sam ran cursing go far soon thought frodo returned remembered orc gone back turret another dreadful choice time ponder shagrat got away would soon get help come back sam pursued orc might horrible deed anyway sam might miss shagrat killed turned quickly ran back stairs `wrong expect' sighed `but job go right top first whatever happens afterwards'
 away shagrat went leaping stairs court gate bearing precious burden sam could seen known grief escape would bring might quailed mind set last stage search came cautiously turretdoor stepped inside opened darkness soon staring eyes aware dim light right hand came opening led another stairway dark narrow appeared go winding turret along inside round outer wall torch glimmering somewhere
 softly sam began climb came guttering torch fixed door left faced windowslit looking westward one red eyes frodo seen tunnel's mouth quickly sam passed door hurried second storey dreading moment attacked feel throttling fingers seize throat behind came next window looking east another torch door passage middle turret door open passage dark save glimmer torch red glare outside filtering windowslit stair stopped climbed sam crept passage either side low door closed locked sound
 `a dead end' muttered sam `and climb can't top tower now'
 ran back lower storey tried door would move ran sweat began trickle face felt even minutes precious one one escaped could nothing cared longer shagrat snaga orc ever spawned longed master one sight face one touch hand
 last weary feeling finally defeated sat step level passagefloor bowed head hands quiet horribly quiet torch already burning low arrived sputtered went felt darkness cover like tide softly surprise vain end long journey grief moved thought heart could tell sam began sing
 voice sounded thin quavering cold dark tower voice forlorn weary hobbit listening orc could possibly mistake clear song elvenlord murmured old childish tunes shire snatches mr bilbo's rhymes came mind like fleeting glimpses country home suddenly new strength rose voice rang words came unbidden fit simple tune

 _in western lands beneath sun
 flowers may rise spring
 trees may bud waters run
 merry finches sing
 maybe 'tis cloudless night
 swaying beeches bear
 elvenstars jewels white
 amid branching hair

 though journey's end lie
 darkness buried deep
 beyond towers strong high
 beyond mountains steep
 shadows rides sun
 stars ever dwell
 say day done
 bid stars farewell_

 `beyond towers strong high' began stopped short thought heard faint voice answering could hear nothing yes could hear something voice footsteps approaching door opened quietly passage hinges creaked sam crouched listening door closed dull thud snarling orcvoice rang
 'ho la dunghill rat stop squeaking i'll come deal d'you hear'
 answer
 'all right' growled snaga `but i'll come look see to'
 hinges creaked sam peering corner passagethreshold saw flicker light open doorway dim shape orc coming seemed carrying ladder suddenly answer dawned sam topmost chamber reached trapdoor roof passage snaga thrust ladder upwards steadied clambered sight sam heard bolt drawn back heard hideous voice speaking
 `you lie quiet pay got long live peace guess want fun begin right keep trap shut see there's reminder you' sound like crack whip
 rage blazed sam's heart sudden fury sprang ran went ladder like cat head came middle floor large round chamber red lamp hung roof westward windowslit high dark something lying floor wall window black orcshape straddled raised whip second time blow never fell

 `frodo mr frodo dear' cried sam tears almost blinding `it's sam i've come' half lifted master hugged breast frodo opened eyes
 `am still dreaming' muttered `but dreams horrible'
 `you're dreaming master' said sam `it's real i've come'
 `i hardly believe it' said frodo clutching `there orc whip turns sam dreaming heard singing tried answer you'
 'it indeed mr frodo i'd given hope almost find
 well sam dear sam said frodo la back sam's gentle arms closing eyes like child rest nightfears driven away loved voice hand

 frodo sighed sat `where get here' asked
 'there's time tales till get somewhere else mr frodo' said sam `but top tower saw away tunnel orcs got long ago know day guess'
 `only that' said frodo `it seems weeks must tell get chance something hit fell darkness foul dreams woke found waking worse orcs round think pouring horrible burning drink throat head grew clear aching weary stripped everything two great brutes came questioned questioned thought go mad standing gloating fingering knives i'll never forget claws eyes'
 `you talk mr frodo' said sam 'and want see sooner get going better walk'
 `yes walk' said frodo getting slowly 'i hurt sam feel tired i've pain here' put hand back neck left shoulder stood looked sam clothed flame naked skin scarlet light lamp twice paced across floor
 `that's better' said spirits rising little `i dare move left alone one guards came yelling fighting began two big brutes quarrelled think things lay terrified went deadly quiet worse'
 `yes quarrelled seemingly' said sam must couple hundred dirty creatures place bit tall order sam gamgee might say they've done killing that's lucky long make song till we're what's done can't go walking black land naught skin mr frodo'
 `they've taken everything sam' said frodo `everything understand _everything_' cowered floor bowed head words brought home fullness disaster despair overwhelmed 'the quest failed sam even get can't escape elves escape away away middleearth far away sea even wide enough keep shadow out'
 `no _not_ everything mr frodo failed yet took mr frodo begging pardon i've kept safe round neck terrible burden too' sam fumbled ring chain `but suppose must take back' come sam felt reluctant give ring burden master
 `you've got it' gasped frodo `you've got sam marvel' quickly strangely tone changed `give me' cried standing holding trembling hand `give can't it'
 'all right mr frodo' said sam rather startled 'here is' slowly drew ring passed chain head `but land mordor sir get see fiery mountain find ring dangerous hard bear hard job could share maybe'
 `no no' cried frodo snatching ring chain sam's hands `no thief' panted staring sam eyes wide fear enmity suddenly clasping ring one clenched fist stood aghast mist seemed clear eyes passed hand aching brow hideous vision seemed real half bemused still wound fear sam changed eyes orc leering pawing treasure foul little creature greedy eyes slobbering mouth vision passed sam kneeling face wrung pain stabbed heart tears welled eyes
 'o sam' cried frodo `what said done forgive done horrible power ring wish never never found mind sam must carry burden end can't altered can't come doom'
 'that's right mr frodo' said sam rubbing sleeve across eyes `i understand still help can't i've got get see first want clothes gear food clothes easiest part we're mordor we'd best dress mordorfashion anyway choice it'll orcstuff mr frodo i'm afraid go together we'd best match put round you'

 `take care sam' said frodo `and quick may orcs still alive lurking wait'
 'i've got chance it' said sam stepped trapdoor slipped ladder minute head reappeared threw long knife floor
 `there's something might useful' said 'he's dead one whipped broke neck seems hurry draw ladder mr frodo let till hear call password _elbereth_ i'll call elves say orc would say that'

 frodo sat shivered dreadful fears chasing one another mind got drew grey elvencloak keep mind occupied began walk fro prying peering every corner prison
 long though fear made seem hour least heard sam's voice calling softly _elbereth elbereth_ frodo let light ladder came sam puffing heaving great bundle head let fall thud
 `quick mr frodo' said `i've bit search find anything small enough likes us we'll make must hurry i've met nothing alive i've seen nothing i'm easy think place watched can't explain well feels one foul flying riders blackness can't seen'

 'what sam' said frodo `aren't going match'
 `well mr frodo i've thinking' said sam 'i'd best leave stuff behind can't destroy can't wear orcmail clothes i'll cover up'
 knelt carefully folded elvencloak went surprisingly small roll put pack lay floor standing slung behind back put orchelm head cast another black cloak shoulders `there' said `now match near enough must off'
 'i can't go way run sam' said frodo wry smile 'i hope made inquiries inns along road forgotten food drink'
 `save had' said sam whistled dismay 'bless mr frodo gone made hungry thirsty know drop morsel last passed lips i'd forgotten trying find let think last time looked i'd got enough waybread captain faramir gave us keep legs couple weeks pinch there's drop left bottle there's that's going enough two nohow ores eat drink live foul air poison'

 last started ladder climbed sam took laid passage beside huddled body fallen orc stair dark rooftop glare mountain could still seen though dying sullen red picked two shields complete disguise went
 great stairway plodded high chamber turret behind met seemed almost homely open terror ran along walls might dead tower cirith ungol steeped fear evil still

 'don't say things' said frodo 'it makes worse' stretched dizzy weary spoke last struggle got amazement found sam asleep 'wake sam' said 'come time made another effort'
 sam scrambled feet 'well never' said 'i must dropped long time mr frodo since proper sleep eyes closed own'
 frodo led way northward near could guess among stones boulders lying thick bottom great ravine presently stopped
 'it's good sam' said 'i can't manage mailshirt mean present state even mithrilcoat seemed heavy tired far heavier what's use win fighting'
 'but may do' said sam 'and there's knives stray arrows gollum dead one thing like think naught bit leather stab dark'

 'i guess it'll like' said sam 'where narrower orcs men packed closer see mr frodo'
 'i dare say shall ever get far' said frodo turned away
 soon found impossible make way along crest morgai anywhere along higher levels pathless scored deep ghylls end forced go back ravine climbed seek way along valley rough going dared cross path westward side mile saw huddled hollow cliff's foot orchold guessed near hand wall cluster stone huts set dark mouth cave movement seen hobbits crept cautiously keeping much could thornbrakes grew thickly point along sides old watercourse
 went two three miles orchold hidden sight behind hardly begun breathe freely harsh loud heard orcvoices quickly slunk sight behind brown stunted bush voices drew nearer presently two orcs came view one clad ragged brown armed bow horn small breed blackskinned wide snuffling nostrils evidently tracker kind big fightingorc like shagrat's company bearing token eye also bow back carried short broadheaded spear usual quarrelling different breeds used common speech fashion
 hardly twenty paces hobbits lurked small orc stopped 'nar' snarled 'i'm going home' pointed across valley orchold 'no good wearing nose stones there's trace left say i've lost scent giving way went hills along valley tell you'
 'not much use little snufflers' said big orc 'i reckon eyes better snotty noses'
 'then seen them' snarled 'garn even know looking for'
 'whose blame's that' said soldier 'not mine comes higher first say great elf bright armour sort small dwarfman must pack rebel urukhai maybe lot together'
 'ar' said tracker 'they've lost heads that's bosses going lose skins guess hear true tower raided hundreds lads done prisoner got away that's way fighters go small wonder there's bad news battles'
 'who says there's bad news' shouted soldier
 'ar says isn't'
 'that's cursed rebeltalk i'll stick shut see'
 'all right right' said tracker 'i'll say go thinking what's black sneak got gobbler flapping hands'
 'i know nothing maybe he's good nosing around i'll wager curse sooner slipped us run word came he's wanted alive wanted quick'
 'well hope get put it' growled tracker 'he messed scent back pinching castoff mailshirt found paddling round place could get there'
 'it saved life anyhow' said soldier 'why knew wanted shot neat neat fifty paces right back ran on'
 'garn missed him' said tracker 'first shoot wild run slow send poor trackers i've enough you' loped
 'you come back' shouted soldier 'or i'll report you'
 'who precious shagrat captain more'
 'i'll give name number nazg�l' said soldier lowering voice hiss 'one _them_'s charge tower now'
 halted voice full fear rage 'you cursed peaching sneakthief' yelled 'you can't job can't even stick folk go filthy shriekers may freeze flesh enemy get first they've done number one i've heard hope true'
 big orc spear hand leapt tracker springing behind stone put arrow eye ran fell crash ran across valley disappeared
 hobbits sat silence length sam stirred 'well call neat neat' said 'if nice friendliness would spread mordor half trouble would over'
 'quietly sam' frodo whispered 'there may others evidently narrow escape hunt hotter tracks guessed spirit mordor sam spread every corner orcs always behaved like tales say can't get much hope hate us far altogether time two seen us would dropped quarrel dead'
 another long silence sam broke whisper time 'did hear said _that gobbler_ mr frodo told gollum dead yet i'
 'yes remember wondered knew' said frodo 'well come think better move gone quite dark shall tell know happened quietly'
 'i'll try' said sam 'but think stinker get hot could shout'
 hobbits sat cover thorny bush drear light mordor faded slowly deep starless night sam spoke frodo's ear could find words gollum's treacherous attack horror shelob adventures orcs finished frodo said nothing took sam's hand pressed length stirred
 'well suppose must going again' said 'i wonder long really caught toiling slinking vain' stood 'it's dark cannot use lady's glass keep safe sam nowhere keep except hand shall need hands blind night sting give got orcblade think part strike blow again'
 difficult dangerous moving night pathless land slowly much stumbling two hobbits toiled hour hour northward along eastern edge stony valley grey light crept back western heights long day opened lands beyond went hiding slept little turn turn times waking sam busy thoughts food last frodo roused spoke eating making ready yet another effort asked question troubling
 'begging pardon mr frodo' said 'but notion far still go'
 'no clear notion sam' frodo answered 'in rivendell set shown map mordor made enemy came back remember vaguely remember clearest place north western range northern range send spurs nearly meet must twenty leagues least bridge back tower might good point cross course get shall mountain sixty miles think guess gone twelve leagues north bridge even goes well could hardly reach mountain week afraid sam burden get heavy shall go still slower get nearer'
 sam sighed 'that's feared' said 'well say nothing water we've got eat less mr frodo else move bit quicker rate we're still valley one bite food's ended save elves' waybread'
 'i'll try bit quicker sam' said frodo drawing deep breath 'come let's start another march'
 yet quite dark plodded along night hours passed weary stumbling trudge brief halts first hint grey light skirts canopy shadow hid dark hollow overhanging stone

 'then must take road mr frodo' said sam 'we must take chance luck luck mordor might well give wander try go back food last we've got make dash it'
 'all right sam' said frodo 'lead long got hope left mine gone can't dash sam i'll plod along you'
 'before start plodding need sleep food mr frodo come take get them'
 gave frodo water additional wafer waybread made pillow cloak master's head frodo weary debate matter sam tell drunk last drop water eaten sam's share food well frodo asleep sam bent listened breathing scanned face lined thin yet sleep looked content unafraid 'well goes master' sam muttered 'i'll leave bit trust luck water must we'll get further'
 sam crept flitting stone stone hobbitcare went watercourse followed way climbed north came rocksteps long ago doubt spring come gushing little waterfall seemed dry silent refusing despair sam stooped listened delight caught sound trickling clambering steps found tiny stream dark water came hillside filled little bare pool spilled vanished barren stones

 'that gollum's i'm afraid mr frodo' said 'leastways there's two went away find water spied nosing round turned back reckon safe us sleep together begging pardon can't hold lids much longer'
 'bless sam' said frodo 'lie take proper turn i'd rather gollum orcs rate give us away � unless he's caught himself'
 'but might bit robbery murder own' growled sam 'keep eyes open mr frodo there's bottle full water drink fill go on' sam plunged sleep

 twelve miles halted short way back road bent little northward stretch passed screened sight proved disastrous rested minutes went taken many steps suddenly stillness night heard sound along secretly dreaded noise marching feet still way behind looking back could see twinkle torches coming round bend less mile away moving fast fast frodo escape flight along road ahead
 'i feared sam' said frodo 'we've trusted luck failed us we're trapped' looked wildly frowning wall roadbuilders old cut rock sheer many fathoms heads ran side looked brink dark pit gloom 'we're trapped last' said sank ground beneath wall rock bowed head
 'seems so' said sam 'well wait see' sat beside frodo shadow cliff
 wait long orcs going great pace foremost files bore torches came red flames dark swiftly growing sam bowed head hoping would hide face torches reached set shields knees hide feet
 'if hurry let couple tired soldiers alone pass on' thought

 mount doom

 sam put ragged orccloak master's head covered grey robe l�rien thoughts went fair land elves hoped cloth woven hands might virtue keep hidden beyond hope wilderness fear heard scuffling cries die troops passed isenmouthe seemed confusion mingling many companies various kinds missed yet rate
 sam took sip water pressed frodo drink master recovered little gave whole wafer precious waybread made eat worn even feel much fear stretched slept little uneasy fits sweat grew chill hard stones bit shivered north black gate cirith gorgor flowed whispering along ground thin cold air
 morning grey light came high regions west wind still blew stones behind fences black land air seemed almost dead chill yet stifling sam looked hollow land dreary flat drabhued roads nearby nothing moving sam feared watchful eyes wall isenmouthe furlong away northward southeastward far like dark standing shadow loomed mountain smokes pouring rose upper air trailed away eastward great rolling clouds floated sides spread land miles northeast foothills ashen mountains stood like sombre grey ghosts behind misty northern heights rose like line distant cloud hardly darker lowering sky
 sam tried guess distances decide way ought take looks every step fifty miles' muttered gloomily staring threatening mountain 'and take week takes day mr frodo is' shook head worked things slowly new dark thought grew mind never long hope died staunch heart always taken thought return bitter truth came home last best provision would take goal task done would come end alone houseless foodless midst terrible desert could return
 'so job felt started' thought sam 'to help mr frodo last step die well job must would dearly like see bywater rosie cotton brothers gaffer marigold can't think somehow gandalf would sent mr frodo errand a' hope ever coming back things went wrong went moria wish would done something'
 even hope died sam seemed die turned new strength sam's plain hobbitface grew stern almost grim hardened felt limbs thrill turning creature stone steel neither despair weariness endless barren miles could subdue
 new sense responsibility brought eyes back ground near hand studying next move light grew little saw surprise distance seemed wide featureless flats fact broken tumbled indeed whole surface plains gorgoroth pocked great holes still waste soft mud smitten shower bolts huge slingstones largest holes rimmed ridges broken rock broad fissures ran directions land would possible creep hiding hiding unseen watchful eyes possible least one strong need speed hungry worn far go life failed evil look
 thinking things sam went back master need rouse frodo lying back eyes open staring cloudy sky 'well mr frodo' said sam 'i've look round thinking bit there's nothing roads we'd best getting away there's chance manage it'
 'i manage it' said frodo 'i must'
 started crawling hollow hollow flitting behind cover could find moving always slant towards foothills northern range went easterly roads followed ran hugging skirts mountains away wall black shadow far ahead neither man orc moved along flat grey stretches dark lord almost completed movement forces even fastness realm sought secrecy night fearing winds world turned tearing aside veils troubled tidings bold spies passed fences
 hobbits gone weary miles halted frodo seemed nearly spent sam saw could go much fashion crawling stooping picking doubtful way slowly hurrying stumbling run
 'i'm going back road light lasts mr frodo' said 'trust luck nearly failed us last time quite steady pace miles rest'
 taking far greater risk knew frodo much occupied burden struggle mind debate almost hopeless care climbed causeway trudged along hard cruel road led dark tower luck held rest day met living moving thing night fell vanished darkness mordor land brooded coming great storm captains west passed crossroads set flames deadly fields imlad morgul
 desperate journey went ring went south banners kings rode north hobbits day mile bitter one strength lessened land became evil met enemies day times night cowered drowsed uneasily hiding beside road heard cries noise many feet swift passing cruelly ridden steed far worse perils everapproaching threat beat upon went dreadful menace power waited brooding deep thought sleepless malice behind dark veil throne nearer nearer drew looming blacker like oncoming wall night last end world
 came last dreadful nightfall even captains west drew near end living lands two wanderers came hour blank despair four days passed since escaped orcs time lay behind like everdarkening dream last day frodo spoken walked halfbowed often stumbling eyes longer saw way feet sam guessed among pains bore worst growing weight ring burden body torment mind anxiously sam noted master's left hand would often raised ward blow screen shrinking eyes dreadful eye sought look sometimes right hand would creep breast clutching slowly recovered mastery would withdrawn
 blackness night returned frodo sat head knees arms hanging wearily ground hands lay feebly twitching sam watched till night covered hid one another could longer find words say turned dark thoughts though weary shadow fear still strength left _lembas_ virtue without would long ago lain die satisfy desire times sam's mind filled memories food longing simple bread meats yet waybread elves potency increased travellers relied alone mingle foods fed gave strength endure master sinew limb beyond measure mortal kind new decision must made could follow road longer went eastward great shadow mountain loomed upon right almost due south must turn towards yet still stretched wide region fuming barren ashridden land
 'water water' muttered sam stinted parched mouth tongue seemed thick swollen care little left perhaps half bottle maybe still days go would long ago spent dared follow orcroad long intervals highway cisterns built use troops sent haste waterless regions one sam found water left stale muddied orcs still sufficient desperate case yet day ago hope
 last wearied cares sam drowsed leaving morrow till came could dream waking mingled uneasily saw lights like gloating yes dark creeping shapes heard noises wild beasts dreadful cries tortured things would start find world dark empty blackness stood stared wildly round seem though awake could still see pale lights like eyes soon flickered vanished

 hateful night passed slowly reluctantly daylight followed dim mountain drew near air ever mirky dark tower crept veils shadow sauron wove frodo lying back moving sam stood beside reluctant speak yet knowing word lay must set master's work another effort length stooping caressing frodo's brow spoke ear
 'wake master' said 'time another start'
 roused sudden bell frodo rose quickly stood looked away southwards eyes beheld mountain desert quailed
 'i can't manage sam' said 'it weight carry weight'
 sam knew spoke vain words might harm good pity could keep silent 'then let carry bit master' said 'you know would gladly long strength'
 wild light came frodo's eyes 'stand away touch me' cried 'it mine say off' hand strayed swordhilt quickly voice changed 'no sam' said sadly 'but must understand burden one else bear late sam dear can't help way almost power could give tried take go mad'
 sam nodded 'i understand' said 'but i've thinking mr frodo there's things might without lighten load bit we're going way straight make it' pointed mountain 'it's good taking anything we're sure need'
 frodo looked towards mountain 'no' said 'we need much road end nothing' picking orcshield flung away threw helmet pulling grey cloak undid heavy belt let fall ground sheathed sword shreds black cloak tore scattered
 'there i'll orc more' cried 'and i'll bear weapon fair foul let take will'
 sam likewise put aside orcgear took things pack somehow become dear borne far much toil hardest part cookinggear tears welled eyes thought casting away
 'do remember bit rabbit mr frodo' said 'and place warm bank captain faramir's country day saw oliphaunt'
 'no afraid sam' said frodo 'at least know things happened cannot see taste food feel water sound wind memory tree grass flower image moon star left naked dark sam veil wheel fire begin see even waking eyes else fades'
 sam went kissed hand 'then sooner we're rid sooner rest' said haltingly finding better words say 'talking mend nothing' muttered gathered things chosen cast away willing leave lying open wilderness eyes see 'stinker picked orcshirt seemingly going add sword hands bad enough empty going mess pans' carried gear away one many gaping fissures scored land threw clatter precious pans fell dark like deathknell heart
 came back frodo elvenrope cut short piece serve master girdle bind grey cloak close waist rest carefully coiled put back pack beside kept remnants waybread waterbottle sting still hanging belt hidden away pocket tunic next breast phial galadriel little box gave
 last turned faces mountain set thinking concealment bending weariness failing wills one task going dimness dreary day things even land vigilance could espied save close hand slaves dark lord nazg�l could warned peril crept small indomitable heart guarded realm nazg�l black wings abroad another errand gathered far away shadowing march captains west thither thought dark tower turned
 day seemed sam master found new strength could explained small lightening load carry first marches went faster hoped land rough hostile yet made much progress ever mountain drew nearer day wore soon dim light began fail frodo stooped began stagger renewed effort squandered remaining strength
 last halt sank said 'i'm thirsty sam' speak sam gave mouthful water one mouthful remained went without night mordor closed thoughts came memory water every brook stream fount ever seen green willowshades twinkling sun danced rippled torment behind blindness eyes felt cool mud toes paddled pool bywater jolly cotton tom nibs sister rosie 'but years ago' sighed 'and far away way back one goes past mountain'
 could sleep held debate 'well come we've done better hoped' said sturdily 'began well anyway reckon crossed half distance stopped one day it' paused
 'don't fool sam gamgee' came answer voice 'he go another day like moves can't go much longer giving water food'
 'i go good way though will'
 'where to'
 'to mountain course'
 'but sam gamgee get going able anything himself'
 dismay sam realized got answer clear idea frodo spoken much errand sam knew vaguely ring somehow put fire 'the cracks doom' muttered old name rising mind 'well master knows find don't'
 'there are' came answer 'it's quite useless said fool going hoping toiling could lain gone sleep together days ago dogged die worse might well lie give never get top anyway'
 'i'll get leave everything bones behind' said sam 'and i'll carry mr frodo breaks back heart stop arguing'
 moment sam felt tremor ground beneath heard sensed deep remote rumble thunder imprisoned earth brief red flame flickered clouds died away mountain slept uneasily
 last stage journey orodruin came torment greater sam ever thought could bear pain parched could longer swallow even mouthful food remained dark smokes mountain seemed storm coming away southeast shimmer lightnings black skies worst air full fumes breathing painful difficult dizziness came staggered often fell yet wills yield struggled
 mountain crept ever nearer lifted heavy heads filled sight looming vast huge mass ash slag burned stone sheersided cone raised clouds daylong dusk ended true night came crawled stumbled feet
 gasp frodo cast ground sam sat surprise felt tired lighter head seemed clear debates disturbed mind knew arguments despair would listen set death would break felt longer either desire need sleep rather watchfulness knew hazards perils drawing together point next day would day doom day final effort disaster last gasp
 would come night seemed endless timeless minute minute falling dead adding passing hour bringing change sam began wonder second darkness begun day would ever reappear last groped frodo's hand cold trembling master shivering
 'i ought left blanket behind' muttered sam lying tried comfort frodo arms body sleep took dim light last day quest found side side wind fallen day shifted west came north began rise slowly light unseen sun filtered shadows hobbits lay
 'now last gasp' said sam struggled feet bent frodo rousing gently frodo groaned great effort staggered fell upon knees raised eyes difficulty dark slopes mount doom towering pitifully began crawl forward hands
 sam looked wept heart tears came dry stinging eyes 'i said i'd carry broke back' muttered 'and will'
 'come mr frodo' cried 'i can't carry carry well get come mr frodo dear sam give ride tell go he'll go'
 frodo clung upon back arms loosely neck legs clasped firmly arms sam staggered feet amazement felt burden light feared would barely strength lift master alone beyond expected share dreadful dragging weight accursed ring whether frodo worn long pains wound knife venomous sting sorrow fear homeless wandering gift final strength given sam lifted frodo difficulty carrying hobbitchild pigaback romp lawns hayfields shire took deep breath started
 reached mountain's foot northern side little westward long grey slopes though broken sheer frodo speak sam struggled best could guidance climb high might strength gave broke toiled turning way lessen slope often stumbling forward last crawling like snail heavy burden back could drive limbs gave way stopped laid master gently
 frodo opened eyes drew breath easier breathe reeks coiled drifted 'thank sam' said cracked whisper 'how far go'
 'i know' said sam 'because know we're going'
 looked back looked amazed see far last effort brought mountain standing ominous alone looked taller sam saw less lofty high passes ephel d�ath frodo scaled confused tumbled shoulders great base rose maybe three thousand feet plain reared half high tall central cone like vast oast chimney capped jagged crater already sam half way base plain gorgoroth dim wrapped fume shadow looked would given shout parched throat allowed amid rugged humps shoulders saw plainly path road climbed like rising girdle west wound snakelike mountain went round view reached foot cone upon eastern side
 sam could see course immediately lowest steep slope went stood guessed could struggle little way would strike path gleam hope returned might conquer mountain yet 'why might put apurpose' said 'if i'd say beaten end'
 path put purposes sam know looking sauron's road baradd�r sammath naur chambers fire dark tower's huge western gate came deep abyss vast bridge iron passing plain ran league two smoking chasms reached long sloping causeway led mountain's eastern side thence turning encircling wide girth south north climbed last high upper cone still far reeking summit dark entrance gazed back east straight window eye sauron's shadowmantled fortress often blocked destroyed tumults mountain's furnaces always road repaired cleaned labours countless orcs
 sam drew deep breath path get slope know first must ease aching back lay flat beside frodo neither spoke slowly light grew suddenly sense urgency understand came sam almost called 'now late' braced got frodo also seemed felt call struggled knees
 'i'll crawl sam' gasped
 foot foot like small grey insects crept slope came path found broad paved broken rubble beaten ash frodo clambered moved compulsion turned slowly face east far shadows sauron hung torn gust wind world else moved great disquiet within mantling clouds swirled moment drew aside saw rising black blacker darker vast shades amid stood cruel pinnacles iron crown topmost tower baradd�r one moment stared great window immeasurably high stabbed northward flame red flicker piercing eye shadows furled terrible vision removed eye turned gazing north captains west stood bay thither malice bent power moved strike deadly blow frodo dreadful glimpse fell one stricken mortally hand sought chain neck
 sam knelt faint almost inaudibly heard frodo whispering 'help sam help sam hold hand can't stop it' sam took master's hands laid together palm palm kissed held gently thought came suddenly 'he's spotted us soon sam gamgee end ends'
 lifted frodo drew hands breast letting master's legs dangle bowed head struggled along climbing road easy way take looked first fortune fires poured forth great turmoils sam stood upon cirith ungol flowed mainly southern western slopes road side blocked yet many places crumbled away crossed gaping rents climbing eastward time bent back upon sharp angle went westward fox space bend cut deep crag old weathered stone long ago vomited mountain's furnaces panting load sam turned bend even corner eye glimpse something falling crag like small piece black stone toppled passed
 sudden weight smote crashed forward tearing backs hands still clasped master's knew happened lay heard hated voice
 'wicked masster' hissed 'wicked masster cheats us cheats sm�agol _gollum_ musstn't go way musstn't hurt preciouss give sm�agol yess give us give uss'
 violent heave sam rose drew sword could nothing gollum frodo locked together gollum tearing master trying get chain ring probably thing could roused dying embers frodo's heart attack attempt wrest treasure force fought back sudden fury amazed sam gollum also even things might gone far otherwise gollum remained unchanged whatever dreadful paths lonely hungry waterless trodden driven devouring desire terrible fear left grievous marks lean starved haggard thing bones tightdrawn sallow skin wild light flamed eyes malice longer matched old griping strength frodo flung rose quivering
 'down down' gasped clutching hand breast beneath cover leather shirt clasped ring 'down creeping thing path time end cannot betray slay now'
 suddenly eaves emyn muil sam saw two rivals vision crouching shape scarcely shadow living thing creature wholly ruined defeated yet filled hideous lust rage stood stern untouchable pity figure robed white breast held wheel fire fire spoke commanding voice
 'begone trouble touch ever shall cast fire doom'
 crouching shape backed away terror blinking eyes yet time insatiable desire
 vision passed sam saw frodo standing hand breast breath coming great gasps gollum feet resting knees widesplayed hands upon ground
 'look out' cried sam 'he'll spring' stepped forward brandishing sword 'quick master' gasped 'go go time lose i'll deal go on'
 frodo looked one far away 'yes must go on' said 'farewell sam end last mount doom doom shall fall farewell' turned went walking slowly erect climbing path

 'now' said sam 'at last deal you' leaped forward drawn blade ready battle gollum spring fell flat upon ground whimpered
 'don't kill us' wept 'don't hurt us nassty cruel steel let us live yes live little longer lost lost we're lost precious goes we'll die yes die dust' clawed ashes path long fleshless fingers 'dusst' hissed

 gollum got fours backed away several paces turned sam aimed kick fled away path sam gave heed suddenly remembered master looked path could see fast could trudged road looked back might seen far gollum turn wild light madness glaring eyes come swiftly warily creeping behind slinking shadow among stones
 path climbed soon bent last eastward course passed cutting along face cone came dark door mountain's side door sammath naur far away rising towards south sun piercing smokes haze burned ominous dull bleared disc red mordor lay mountain like dead land silent shadowfolded waiting dreadful stroke

 'master' cried sam
 frodo stirred spoke clear voice indeed voice clearer powerful sam ever heard use rose throb turmoil mount doom ringing roof walls

 'maybe sam' said frodo 'but like things world hopes fail end comes little time wait lost ruin downfall escape'
 'well master could least go dangerous place crack doom that's name come mr frodo let's go path rate'
 'very well sam wish go i'll come' said frodo rose went slowly winding road even passed towards mountain's quaking feet great smoke steam belched sammath naur side cone riven open huge fiery vomit rolled slow thunderous cascade eastern mountainside
 frodo sam could go last strength mind body swiftly ebbing reached low ashen hill piled mountain's foot escape island long endure amid torment orodruin earth gaped deep rifts pits smoke fumes leaped behind mountain convulsed great rents opened side slow rivers fire came long slopes towards soon would engulfed rain hot ash falling

 sam awoke found lying soft bed gently swayed wide beechen boughs young leaves sunlight glimmered green gold air full sweet mingled scent
 remembered smell fragrance ithilien 'bless me' mused 'how long asleep' scent borne back day lit little fire sunny bank moment else waking memory stretched drew deep breath 'why dream i've had' muttered 'i glad wake' sat saw frodo lying beside slept peacefully one hand behind head resting upon coverlet right hand third finger missing
 full memory flooded back sam cried aloud 'it dream we'
 voice spoke softly behind 'in land ithilien keeping king awaits you' gandalf stood robed white beard gleaming like pure snow twinkling leafy sunlight 'well master samwise feel' said
 sam lay back stared open mouth moment bewilderment great joy could answer last gasped 'gandalf thought dead thought dead everything sad going come untrue what's happened world'
 'a great shadow departed' said gandalf laughed sound like music like water parched land listened thought came sam heard laughter pure sound merriment days upon days without count fell upon ears like echo joys ever known burst tears sweet rain pass wind spring sun shine clearer tears ceased laughter welled laughing sprang bed
 'how feel' cried 'well know say feel feel' � waved arms air � 'i feel like spring winter sun leaves like trumpets harps songs ever heard' stopped turned towards master 'but how's mr frodo' said 'isn't shame poor hand hope he's right otherwise he's cruel time'
 'yes right otherwise' said frodo sitting laughing turn fell asleep waiting sam sleepyhead awake early morning must nearly noon'
 'noon' said sam trying calculate 'noon day'

 'the king' said sam 'what king he'
 'the king gondor lord western lands' said gandalf 'and taken back ancient realm ride soon crowning waits you'
 'what shall wear' said sam could see old tattered clothes journeyed lying folded ground beside beds
 'the clothes wore way mordor' said gandalf 'even orcrags bore black land frodo shall preserved silks linens armour heraldry could honourable later find clothes perhaps'
 held hands saw one shone light 'what got there' frodo cried 'can � '

 'then going wrong way' said gandalf 'and see hope journey scorn help offer you'
 'to me' said saruman 'nay pray smile prefer frowns lady trust always hated schemed part doubt brought way pleasure gloating poverty warned pursuit would denied pleasure'
 'saruman' said galadriel 'we errands cares seem us urgent hunting say rather overtaken good fortune last chance'
 'if truly last glad' said saruman 'for shall spared trouble refusing hopes ruined would share any'
 moment eyes kindled 'go' said 'i spend long study matters naught doomed know afford comfort wander think pulled house destroyed mine ship bear back across wide sea' mocked 'it grey ship full ghosts' laughed voice cracked hideous
 'get idiot' shouted beggar sat ground struck staff 'turn fine folk going way take another get i'll give crust supper'
 beggar turned slouched past whimpering 'poor old gr�ma poor old gr�ma always beaten cursed hate wish could leave him'
 'then leave him' said gandalf
 wormtongue shot glance bleared eyes full terror gandalf shuffled quickly past behind saruman wretched pair passed company came hobbits saruman stopped stared looked pity

 'ah master more's pity' said butterbur 'but wonder left alone go armed folk swords helmets shields make think twice would must say put aback bit saw you'
 hobbits suddenly realized people looked amazement surprise return much wonder gear become used warfare riding wellarrayed companies quite forgotten bright mail peeping cloaks helms gondor mark fair devices shields would seem outlandish country gandalf riding tall grey horse clad white great mantle blue silver long sword glamdring side
 gandalf laughed 'well well' said 'if afraid five us met worse enemies travels rate give peace night stay'
 'how long be' said butterbur 'i'll deny glad bit see we're used troubles rangers gone away folk tell think we've rightly understood till us there's worse robbers wolves howling round fences last winter there's dark shapes woods dreadful things makes blood run cold think disturbing understand me'
 'i expect has' said gandalf 'nearly lands disturbed days disturbed cheer barliman edge great troubles glad hear deeper better times coming maybe better remember rangers returned came back king barliman soon turning mind way
 'then greenway opened messengers come north comings goings evil things driven wastelands indeed waste time waste longer people fields wilderness'
 mr butterbur shook head 'if there's decent respectable folk roads harm' said 'but want rabble ruffians want outsiders bree near bree want let alone want whole crowd o' strangers camping settling tearing wild country'

 'ah' said sam 'but says beer always good'
 'he says'
 'of course he's strider chief rangers got head yet'
 went last butterbur's face study wonder eyes broad face grew round mouth opened wide gasped 'strider' exclaimed got back breath 'him crown golden cup well coming to'
 'better times bree rate' said gandalf

 'well four us started together' said merry 'we left rest behind one another seems almost like dream slowly faded'
 'not me' said frodo 'to feels like falling asleep again'


 _chapter 8_
 scouring shire

 nightfall wet tired travellers came last brandywine found way barred either end bridge great spiked gate side river could see new houses built twostoreyed narrow straightsided windows bare dimly lit gloomy unshirelike
 hammered outer gate called first answer surprise someone blew horn lights windows went voice shouted dark
 'who's can't come can't read notice _no admittance sundown sunrise_'
 'of course can't read notice dark' sam shouted back 'and hobbits shire kept wet night like i'll tear notice find it'
 window slammed crowd hobbits lanterns poured house left opened gate came bridge saw travellers seemed frightened
 'come along' said merry recognizing one hobbits 'if know hob hayward ought merry brandybuck like know bucklander like used hay gate'
 'bless master merry sure dressed fighting' said old hob 'why said dead lost old forest accounts i'm pleased see alive all'
 'then stop gaping bars open gate' said merry
 'i'm sorry master merry orders'
 'whose orders'
 'the chief's bag end'
 'chief chief mean mr lotho' said frodo
 'i suppose mr baggins say "the chief" nowadays'
 'do indeed' said frodo 'well glad dropped baggins rate evidently high time family dealt put place'
 hush fell hobbits beyond gate 'it good talking way' said one 'he'll get hear make much noise wake chief's big man'
 'we shall wake way surprise him' said merry 'if mean precious chief hiring ruffians wild we've come back soon' sprang pony seeing notice light lanterns tore threw gate hobbits backed away made move open 'come pippin' said merry 'two enough'
 merry pippin climbed gate hobbits fled another horn sounded bigger house right large heavy figure appeared light doorway
 'what's this' snarled came forward 'gatebreaking clear i'll break filthy little necks' stopped caught gleam swords
 'bill ferny' said merry 'if open gate ten seconds regret shall set steel obey opened gates go never return ruffian highwayrobber'
 bill ferny flinched shuffled gate unlocked 'give key' said merry ruffian flung head darted darkness passed ponies one let fly heels caught ran went yelp night never heard
 'neat work bill' said sam meaning pony
 'so much big man' said merry 'we'll see chief later meantime want lodging night seem pulled bridge inn built dismal place instead put us up'
 'i sorry mr merry' said hob 'but allowed'
 'what allowed'
 taking folk offhand like eating extra food said hob
 'what's matter place' said merry 'has bad year thought fine summer harvest'
 'well year's good enough' said hob 'we grows lot food rightly know becomes "gatherers" "sharers" reckon going round counting measuring taking storage gathering sharing never see stuff again'
 'oh come' said pippin yawning 'this tiresome tonight we've got food bags give us room lie it'll better many places seen'
 hobbits gate still seemed ill ease evidently rule broken gainsaying four masterful travellers armed two uncommonly large stronglooking frodo ordered gates locked sense rate keeping guard ruffians still four companions went hobbit guardhouse made comfortable could bare ugly place mean little grate would allow good fire upper rooms little rows hard beds every wall notice list rules pippin tore beer little food travellers brought shared made fair meal pippin broke rule 4 putting next day's allowance wood fire
 'well smoke tell us happening shire' said
 'there pipeweed now' said hob 'at least chief's men stocks seem gone hear waggonloads went away old road southfarthing sarn ford way would end o' last year left going away quietly small way lotho'
 'now shut hob hayward' cried several others 'you know talk o' sort allowed chief hear we'll trouble'
 'he hear naught sneaks' rejoined hob hotly
 'all right right' said sam "that's quite enough want hear welcome beer smoke lot rules orctalk instead hoped rest see there's work trouble ahead let's sleep forget till morning'
 new 'chief' evidently means getting news good forty miles bridge bag end someone made journey hurry frodo friends soon discovered
 made definite plans vaguely thought going crickhollow together first resting bit seeing things like decided go straight hobbiton next day set along road jogged along steadily wind dropped sky grey land looked rather sad forlorn first november fagend autumn still seemed unusual amount burning going smoke rose many points round great cloud going far away direction woody end
 evening fell drawing near frogmorton village right road twentytwo miles bridge meant stay night _the floating log_ frogmorton good inn came east end village met barrier large board saying road behind stood large band shirriffs staves hands feathers caps looking important rather scared
 'what's this' said frodo feeling inclined laugh
 mr baggins said leader shirriffs twofeather hobbit 'you're arrested gatebreaking tearing rules assaulting gatekeepers trespassing sleeping shirebuildings without leave bribing guards food'
 'and else' said frodo
 'that'll go with' said shirriffleader
 'i add like it' said sam 'calling chief names wishing punch pimply face thinking shirriffs look lot tomfools'
 'there mister chief's orders come along quiet we're going take bywater hand chief's men deals case say want stay lockholes longer need cut say short you'
 discomfiture shirriffs frodo companions roared laughter 'don't absurd' said frodo 'i going please time happen going bag end business insist going well affair'
 'very well mr baggins' said leader pushing barrier aside 'but forget i've arrested you'
 'i won't' said frodo 'never may forgive going today kindly escort _the floating log_ i'll obliged'
 'i can't mr baggins inn's closed there's shirriffhouse far end village i'll take '
 'all right' said frodo 'go we'll follow'
 sam looking shirriffs spotted one knew 'hey come robin smallburrow' called 'i want word you'
 sheepish glance leader looked wrathful dare interfere shirriff smallburrow fell back walked beside sam got pony
 'look cockrobin' said sam 'you're hobbitonbred ought sense coming awaylaying mr frodo what's inn closed'
 'they're closed' said robin 'the chief hold beer leastways started reckon men hold folk moving must go shirriffhouse explain business'
 'you ought ashamed anything nonsense' said sam 'you used like inside inn better outside always popping duty off'
 'and would still sam could hard know went shirriff seven years ago began gave chance walking round country seeing folk hearing news knowing good beer different'
 'but give stop shirriffing stopped respectable job' said sam
 'we're allowed to' said robin
 'if hear _not allowed_ much oftener' said sam 'i'm going get angry'
 'can't say i'd sorry see it' said robin lowering voice 'if got angry together something might done men sam chief's men sends round everywhere us small folk stand rights drag lockholes took old flourdumpling old whitfoot mayor first they've taken lot lately getting worse often beat 'em now'
 'then work far them' said sam angrily 'who sent frogmorton'

 'he eager mr frodo finished him' said sam
 shirriffhouse frogmorton bad bridgehouse one storey narrow windows built ugly pale bricks badly laid inside damp cheerless supper served long bare table scrubbed weeks food deserved better setting travellers glad leave place eighteen miles bywater set ten o'clock morning would started earlier delay plainly annoyed shirriffleader west wind shifted northward turning colder rain gone
 rather comic cavalcade left village though folk came stare 'getup' travellers seem quite sure whether laughing allowed dozen shirriffs told escort 'prisoners' merry made march front frodo friends rode behind merry pippin sam sat ease laughing talking singing shirriffs stumped along trying look stern important frodo however silent looked rather sad thoughtful
 last person passed sturdy old gaffer clipping hedge 'hullo hullo' jeered 'now who's arrested who'
 two shirriffs immediately left party went towards 'leader' said merry 'order fellows back places want deal them'
 two hobbits sharp word leader came back sulkily 'now get on' said merry travellers saw ponies' pace quick enough push shirriffs along fast could go sun came spite chilly wind soon puffing sweating
 threefarthing stone gave done nearly fourteen miles one rest noon three o'clock hungry footsore could stand pace
 'well come along time' said merry 'we going on'
 'goodbye cockrobin' said sam 'i'll wait outside _the green dragon_ forgotten dawdle way'
 'you're breaking arrest that's doing' said leader ruefully 'and can't answerable'
 'we shall break good many things yet ask answer ' said pippin 'good luck you'
 travellers trotted sun began sink towards white downs far away western horizon came bywater wide pool first really painful shock frodo sam's country found cared place world many houses known missing seemed burned pleasant row old hobbitholes bank north side pool deserted little gardens used run bright water's edge rank weeds worse whole line ugly new houses along pool side hobbiton road ran close bank avenue trees stood gone looking dismay road towards bag end saw tall chimney brick distance pouring black smoke evening air
 sam beside 'i'm going right mr frodo' cried 'i'm going see what's want find gaffer'
 'we ought find first we're sam' said merry 'i guess "chief" gang ruffians handy better find someone tell us things round here'
 village bywater houses holes shut one greeted wondered soon discovered reason reached _the green dragon_ last house hobbiton side lifeless broken windows disturbed see half dozen large illfavoured men lounging innwall squinteyed sallowfaced
 'like friend bill ferny's bree' said sam
 'like many saw isengard' muttered merry

 ruffians clubs hands horns belts weapons far could seen travellers rode left wall walked road blocking way
 'where d'you think going' said one largest evillooking crew 'there's road precious shirriffs'
 'coming along nicely' said merry 'a little footsore perhaps promised wait here'
 'garn say' said ruffian mates 'i told sharkey good trusting little fools chaps ought sent'
 'and difference would made pray' said merry 'we used footpads country know deal them'
 'footpads eh' said man 'so that's tone change we'll change little folk getting uppish trust much boss's kind heart sharkey's come he'll sharkey says'

 much pippin thoughts went back field cormallen squinteyed rascal calling ringbearer 'little cockawhoop' cast back cloak flashed sword silver sable gondor gleamed rode forward
 'i messenger king' said 'you speaking king's friend one renowned lands west ruffian fool knees road ask pardon set troll's bane you'
 sword glinted westering sun merry sam drew swords also rode support pippin frodo move ruffians gave back scaring breeland peasants bullying bewildered hobbits work fearless hobbits bright swords grim faces great surprise note voices newcomers heard chilled fear
 'go' said merry 'if trouble village regret it' three hobbits came ruffians turned fled running away hobbiton road blew horns ran
 'well we've come back none soon' said merry

 'yes indeed sooner better' said merry 'and gentle he's responsible bringing ruffians evil done'
 farmer cotton collected escort two dozen sturdy hobbits 'for guess ruffians left bag end' said 'we know' set foot frodo sam merry pippin led way
 one saddest hours lives great chimney rose drew near old village across water rows new mean houses along side road saw new mill frowning dirty ugliness great brick building straddling stream fouled steaming stinking overflow along bywater road every tree felled
 crossed bridge looked hill gasped even sam's vision mirror prepared saw old grange west side knocked place taken rows tarred sheds chestnuts gone banks hedgerows broken great waggons standing disorder field beaten bare grass bagshot row yawning sand gravel quarry bag end beyond could seen clutter large huts
 'they've cut down' cried sam 'they've cut party tree' pointed tree stood bilbo made farewell speech lying lopped dead field last straw sam burst tears
 laugh put end surly hobbit lounging low wall millyard grimyfaced blackhanded 'don't 'ee like sam' sneered 'but always soft thought gone one o' ships used prattle sailing sailing d'you want come back we've work shire now'
 'so see' said sam 'no time washing time wallpropping see master sandyman i've score pay village make longer jeering foot bill big purse'
 ted sandyman spat wall 'garn' said 'you can't touch i'm friend o' boss's he'll touch right mouth'
 'don't waste words fool sam' said frodo 'i hope many hobbits become like would worse trouble damage men done'
 'you dirty insolent sandyman' said merry 'and also much reckoning going hill remove precious boss dealt men'
 ted gaped moment first caught sight escort sign merry marched bridge dashing back mill ran horn blew loudly
 'save breath' laughed merry 'i've better' lifting silver horn winded clear call rang hill holes sheds shabby houses hobbiton hobbits answered came pouring cheers loud cries followed company road bag end
 top lane party halted frodo friends went came last beloved place garden full huts sheds near old westward windows cut light piles refuse everywhere door scarred bellchain dangling loose bell would ring knocking brought answer length pushed door yielded went place stank full filth disorder appear used time
 'where miserable lotho hiding' said merry searched every room found living thing save rats mice 'shall turn others search sheds'
 'this worse mordor' said sam 'much worse way comes home say home remember ruined'
 'yes mordor' said frodo 'just one works saruman work time even thought working saruman tricked like lotho'
 merry looked round dismay disgust 'let's get out' said 'if known mischief caused stuffed pouch saruman's throat'
 'no doubt doubt able welcome home' standing door saruman looking wellfed wellpleased eyes gleamed malice amusement
 sudden light broke frodo 'sharkey' cried
 saruman laughed 'so heard name people used call isengard believe sign affection possibly evidently expect see here'
 'i not' said frodo 'but might guessed little mischief mean way gandalf warned still capable
 'quite capable' said saruman 'and little made laugh hobbitlordlings riding along great people secure pleased little selves thought done well could amble back nice quiet time country saruman's home could wrecked could turned one could touch oh gandalf would look affairs'
 saruman laughed 'not tools done task drops must go dangling dawdling talking riding round twice far needed "well" thought "if they're fools get ahead teach lesson one ill turn deserves another" would sharper lesson given little time men still already done much find hard mend undo lives pleasant think set injuries'
 'well find pleasure in' said frodo 'i pity pleasure memory fear go never return'
 hobbits villages seen saruman come one huts came crowding door bag end heard frodo's command murmured angrily
 'don't let go kill he's villain murderer kill him'
 saruman looked round hostile faces smiled 'kill him' mocked 'kill think enough brave hobbits' drew stared darkly black eyes 'but think lost goods lost power whoever strikes shall accursed blood stains shire shall wither never healed'
 hobbits recoiled frodo said 'do believe lost power save voice still daunt deceive let slain useless meet revenge revenge heal nothing go saruman speediest way'
 'worm worm' saruman called nearby hut came wormtongue crawling almost like dog road worm' said saruman 'these fine fellows lordlings turning us adrift come along'
 saruman turned go wormtongue shuffled even saruman passed close frodo knife flashed hand stabbed swiftly blade turned hidden mailcoat snapped dozen hobbits led sam leaped forward cry flung villain ground sam drew sword
 'no sam' said frodo 'do kill even hurt case wish slain evil mood great noble kind dare raise hands fallen cure beyond us would still spare hope may find it'
 saruman rose feet stared frodo strange look eyes mingled wonder respect hatred 'you grown halfling' said 'yes grown much wise cruel robbed revenge sweetness must go hence bitterness debt mercy hate well go trouble expect wish health long life neither merely foretell'
 walked away hobbits made lane pass knuckles whitened gripped weapons wormtongue hesitated followed master
 'wormtongue' called frodo 'you need follow know evil done rest food stronger go ways'
 wormtongue halted looked back half prepared stay saruman turned 'no evil' cackled 'oh even sneaks night look stars hear someone ask poor lotho hiding know worm tell them'
 wormtongue cowered whimpered 'no no'
 'then will' said saruman 'worm killed chief poor little fellow nice little boss worm stabbed sleep believe buried hope though worm hungry lately worm really nice better leave me'
 look wild hatred came wormtongue's red eyes 'you told made it' hissed
 saruman laughed 'you sharkey says always worm well says follow' kicked wormtongue face grovelled turned made something snapped suddenly wormtongue rose drawing hidden knife snarl like dog sprang saruman's back jerked head back cut throat yell ran lane frodo could recover speak word three hobbitbows twanged wormtongue fell dead
 dismay stood body saruman grey mist gathered rising slowly great height like smoke fire pale shrouded figure loomed hill moment wavered looking west west came cold wind bent away sigh dissolved nothing
 frodo looked body pity horror looked seemed long years death suddenly revealed shrank shrivelled face became rags skin upon hideous skull lifting skirt dirty cloak sprawled beside covered turned away
 'and that's end that' said sam 'a nasty end wish seen good riddance'
 'and last end war hope' said merry
 'i hope so' said frodo sighed 'the last stroke think fall door bag end among hopes fears least never expected that'
 'i call end till we've cleared mess' said sam gloomily 'and take lot time work'

 last three companions turned away never looking back rode slowly homewards spoke word one another came back shire great comfort friends long grey road
 last rode downs took east road merry pippin rode buckland already singing went sam turned bywater came back hill day ending went yellow light fire within evening meal ready expected rose drew set chair put little elanor upon lap
 drew deep breath 'well i'm back' said

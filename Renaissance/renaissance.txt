 vi
 six years run since first martial guise

 upon christian lords gracious eye
 wondrous look wherewith oft surveyed
 men's secret thoughts concealed lie
 cast puissant godfrey assayed
 drive turks sion's bulwarks high
 full zeal faith esteemed light
 worldly honor empire treasure might

 ix
 baldwin next spied another thought
 spirits proud vain ambition move
 tancred saw life's joy set naught
 woebegone pains love
 boemond conquered folk antioch brought
 gentle yoke christian rule prove
 taught laws statutes customs new
 arts crafts obedience religion true

 x
 care busy work plied
 naught else acting thoughts bent
 young rinaldo fierce desires spied
 noble heart rest impatient
 wealth sovereign power naught applied
 wits virtue excellent
 patterns rules skill courage bold
 took guelpho fathers old

 xi
 thus lord discovered seen
 hidden secrets worthy's breast
 hierarchies angels sheen
 gentle gabriel called rest
 'twixt god souls men righteous
 ambassador forever blest
 commands heaven's eternal king
 'twixt skies earth doth bring

 xii
 lord thus spake "godfredo find
 name ask doth rest
 arms ease peace resigned
 frees jerusalem distrest
 peers counsel call baser mind
 let stir chieftain rest
 choose earth shall allow
 fellows late shall subjects now"

 said angel swift prepared
 execute charge imposed aright
 form airy members fair imbared

 fringed gold unwearied nimble swift
 parts winds clouds air
 seas earth doth lift
 thus clad cut spheres circles fair
 pure skies sacred feathers clift
 libanon first foot set
 shook wings rory may dews wet

 xv
 tortosa's confines swiftly sped
 sacred messenger headlong flight
 eastern wave appeared red
 rising sun yet scantly half sight
 godfrey e'en morndevotions said
 custom titan bright
 appeared angel shape divine
 whose glory far obscured phoebus' shine

 xvi
 "godfrey" quoth "behold season fit
 war thou waited hast long
 serves time thou o'erslip
 free jerusalem thrall wrong
 thou thy lords council quickly sit
 comfort feeble confirm strong
 lord hosts general doth make thee
 chieftain shall gladly take thee

 xvii
 "i messenger everlasting jove
 great name thus behests tell
 oh sure hope conquest ought thee move
 zeal love thy bosom dwell"
 said vanished seats
 height clearness rest excel
 fell duke joints dissolved asunder
 blind light strucken dead wonder

 sureties shall doubt overcast
 forslow siege well foresee

 xxix
 said hermit peter rose spake
 sate counsel great lords among
 "at request war undertake
 private cell erst lived closed long
 godfrey wills question make
 cast doubts truth plain strong
 acts trust correspond speech
 yet one thing would gladly teach

 xxx
 "these strifes unless far mistake thing
 discords raised oft disordered sort
 disobedience ill managing
 actions lost want due support
 refer justly spring
 spring sedition strife oppression tort
 mean commanding power sundry given
 thought opinion worth estate uneven

 xxxi
 "where divers lords divided empire hold
 causes gifts justice tried
 offices falsely bought sold
 needs must lordship virtue slide
 friendly parts one body uphold
 create one head rest rule guide
 one regal power sceptre give
 henceforth may king sovereign live"

 lxxxii
 fear ill exceeds evil fear
 present harms still annoy us
 mind prest open every ear
 hear new tidings though way joy us
 secret rumor whispered everywhere
 town christians destroy us
 aged king coming evil knew
 cursed thoughts false heart renew

 lxxxiii
 aged prince ycleped aladine
 ruled care new sovereign state
 tyrant erst fell engine

 "but lest effect cursed
 let us destroy serpent nest
 young old let us people kill
 tender infants mothers' breast
 houses burn holy temples fill
 bodies slain loved best
 tomb hold much price
 let's offer priests sacrifice"

 lxxxviii
 thus thought tyrant traitorous mind
 durst follow decreed
 yet innocents mercy find
 cowardice truth proceed
 noble foes durst craven kind
 exasperate bloody deed
 need grace could got
 thus peace broke loosed knot

 lxxxix
 villain heart cursed rage restrained
 thoughts bent fierce desire
 suburbs first flat earth plained
 burnt buildings devouring fire
 loth wretch frenchman gained
 help ease finding aught entire
 cedron bethsaida watering else
 empoisoned fountains springs wells

 xc

 second book

 argument
 ismeno conjures charms vain
 aladine kill christians ire
 sophronia olindo would slain
 save rest king grants desire
 clorinda hears fact fortunes plain
 pardon gets keeps fire
 argantes aletes' speeches
 despised defies duke mortal war



 thus tyrant bends thoughts arms
 ismeno gan tofore sight appear
 ismen dead bones laid cold graves warms
 makes speak smell taste touch see hear
 ismen terror mighty charms
 makes great dis deepest hell fear
 binds looses souls condemned woe
 sends devils errands fro

 ii
 christian macon adores
 could quite wonted faith forsake
 wicked arts oft implores
 help lord aid pluto black
 deep caves acheron's dark shores
 circles vain spells used make
 advise king extremes come
 achitophel counselled absalom

 iii
 "my liege" says "the camp fast hither moves
 axe laid unto cedar's root
 let us work valiant men behoves
 boldest hearts good fortune helpeth
 princely care kingly wisdom proves
 well labored well foreseen
 perform charge duty
 nought grave conquer shall foe

 iv
 "from surest castle secret cell
 come partaker good ill
 counsel sage magic's sacred spell
 may profit us perform
 sprites impure bliss whilom fell
 shall service bow constrained skill
 must begin enterprise
 highness thus brief advise

 v
 "within christian's church light skies
 hidden alter stands far sight
 image consecrated lies
 christ's dear mother called virgin bright
 hundred lamps aye burn eyes
 slender veil tinsel dight
 every side great plenty doth behold
 offerings brought myrrh frankincense gold

 vi
 "this idol would removed away
 thence princely hand transport
 macon's sacred temple safe lay
 enchant wondrous sort
 image church doth stay
 strength arms shall win noble fort
 shake puissant wall passing might
 spells charms said aright"

 vii
 advised thus king impatient
 flew fury house god
 image took words unreverent
 abused prelates deed forbode
 swift prey away tyrant went
 god's sharp justice naught feared rod
 chapel vile image laid
 enchanter charms witchcraft said

 viii
 phoebus next unclosed wakeful eye
 rose sexton place profane
 missed image used lie
 sough grief fear vain
 king loss gan descry
 sore enraged killed pain
 straight conceived malicious wit
 christian bade great offence commit

 ix
 whether act mortal hand
 else prince heaven's eternal pleasure
 mercy would wretch withstand
 let vile chest hold treasure
 yet conjecture hath fully scanned
 godliness let us action measure
 truth purest faith fitly prove
 rare grace came heaven

 x
 busy search tyrant gan invade
 house hold temple tent
 fault faulty one bewrayed
 hid promised gifts punishment
 idle charms false enchanter said
 maze still wandered miswent
 heaven decreed conceal
 make miscreant feel shame

 xi
 angry king discovered
 guilty hand sacrilege wrought
 ireful courage boiled vengeance hot
 christians faulters thought
 ruth compassion mercy forgot
 staff beat dog long sought
 "let die" quoth "kill great small
 shall offender perish sure withal

 xii
 "to spill wine poison mixed spares
 slay righteous faulty one
 destroy field yieldeth naught tares
 thorns vineyard overgone
 among wretches one cares
 us laws religion
 dear subjects fire weapon take
 burn murder kill traitors sake"

 xiii
 herod thus would bethlem's infants kill
 christians soon direful news receave
 trump death sounds hearing shrill
 weapon faith fortress grave
 courage time device
 fight fly excuse pardon crave
 stood prepared die yet help find
 whence least hope knots heaven unbind

 xiv
 among dwelt parents' joy pleasure
 maid whose fruit ripe overyeared
 beauty esteemed treasure
 field love plough virtue eared
 labor goodness godliness leisure
 house heaven full moon aye cleared
 lovers' eyes withdrawn alone
 virgin beams spotless cynthia shone

 xv
 availed resolution chaste
 whose soberest looks whetstones desire
 love consents beauty's field lie waste
 visage set olindo's heart fire
 subtle love thousand wiles thou hast
 humble suit service hire
 win maiden's hold thing soon done
 nature framed women

 xvi
 sophronia olindo hight youth
 one town one faith taught
 fair full bashfulness truth
 loved much hoped little desired nought
 durst speak suit purchase ruth
 saw marked wist sought
 thus loved thus served long regarded
 unseen unmarked unpitied unrewarded

 xvii
 came message murderment
 wherein guiltless friends hopeless starve
 noble wise fair gent
 cast might harmless lives preserve
 zeal spring whence flowed hardiment
 maiden shame yet loth swerve
 yet courage ta'en sure hold
 boldness shamefaced shame made bold

 xviii
 forth went shop merchandise
 full rich stuff none sale exposed
 veil obscured sunshine eyes
 rose within sweetness closed
 ornament seemly lies
 curious chance careless art composed
 neglects curious prove
 beauty's helped nature heaven love

 xix
 admired went noble maid
 presence king gained
 swelled ire afraid
 fierce wrath fearless grace sustained
 "i come" quoth "but thine anger stayed
 causeless rage 'gainst faultless souls restrained
 come show thee bring thee
 wight whose fact hath made thy heart wroth"

 xx
 molest boldness lightning ray
 sweet beauty streamed face
 struck prince wonder dismay
 changed cheer cleared moody grace
 eyes disposed looks play
 king snared love's strong lace
 wayward beauty doth fancy move
 frown forbids smile engendereth love

 xxi
 amazement wonder delight
 although love moved cruel sense
 "tell on" quoth "unfold chance aright
 thy people's lives grant recompense"
 "behold faulter sight
 hand committed supposed offence
 took image mine fault fact
 mine glory virtuous act"

 xxii
 spotless lamb thus offered blood
 save rest christ's selected fold
 noble lie ever truth good
 blest lips leasing told
 thoughtful awhile remained tyrant wood
 native wrath gan space withhold
 said "that thou discover soon
 aid counsel had'st thou ill"

 xxiii
 "my lofty thoughts" answered "envied
 another's hand work high desire
 thirst glory partner bide
 mine self alone conspire"
 "on thee alone" tyrant replied
 "shall fall vengeance wrath ire"
 "'tis right" quoth "i yield consent
 mine honor mine punishment"

 xxiv
 wretch new enraged
 asked hid image conveyed
 "not hid" quoth "but quite consumed flame
 idol eternal maid
 least preserved
 hands profane eft betrayed
 lord thing thus stolen demand
 see thief scorneth death therefor

 xxv
 "and yet theft sin
 brought unjustly took"
 heard tyrant rage begin
 whet teeth bend frowning look
 pity youth fairness grace could win
 joy comfort hope virgin forsook
 wrath killed remorse vengeance stopped mercy's breath
 love's thrall hate beauty's slave death

 xxvi
 ta'en damsel without remorse
 king condemned guiltless fire
 veil mantle plucked force
 bound tender arms twisted wire
 dumb silver dove corse
 hungry kites plucked rich attire
 deal perplexed sprite
 damask late changed purest white

 xxvii
 news mishap spread far near
 people ran young old gaze
 olindo also ran gan fear
 lady partner case
 found bound stript gear
 vile tormentors ready saw place
 broke throng presence brast
 thus bespake king rage haste

 xxxviii
 "not grief shall bear away
 honor noble feat
 durst could convey
 massy substance idol great
 sleight wardens betray
 strength heave goddess seat
 lord sails wind"
 ah thus loved yet love unkind

 xxix
 added "where shining glass
 lets light amid temple's side
 broken byways inward pass
 window made postern wide
 shall therefore illadvised lass
 usurp glory fact betide
 mine bonds mine flames pure
 glorious death glorious sepulture"

 xxx
 sophronia raised modest looks ground
 lover bent eyesight mild
 "tell fury conceit unsound
 presenteth death sweet child
 sufficient courage found
 bear anger tyrant wild
 hath fond love thy heart overgone
 wouldst thou live let die alone"

 xxxi
 thus spake nymph yet spake wind
 could alter wellsettled thought
 miracle strife wondrous kind
 love virtue contention wrought
 death victor meed assigned
 neglect other's safety sought
 thus king provoked ire
 strife bellows served anger's fire

 xxxii
 thinks thoughts selfguiltiness finds
 scorned power therefore scorned pain
 "nay nay" quoth "let strife doubt
 shall win fit reward obtain"
 sergeants hent young man stout
 bound likewise worthless chain
 back back fast stake ties
 two harmless turtles dight sacrifice

 xxxiii
 pile fagots sticks hay
 bellows raised newlykindled flame
 thus olindo doleful lay
 begun late bootless plaints frame
 "be bonds hopedfor day
 join longdesired dame
 fire alike burn hearts
 ah hard reward lovers' kind desarts

 xxxiv
 "far flames bonds kind lovers prove
 thus fortune casts hapless die
 death hath exchanged shafts love
 cupid thus lets borrowed arrows fly
 hymen say fury doth thee move
 lend thy lamps light tragedy
 yet contents die thee
 thy flames mine death torment

 xxxv
 "yet happy death mine ending blest
 torments easy full sweet delight
 could obtain breast breast
 thy bosom might receive yielded sprite
 thine heaven's pure clothing drest
 clearest skies might take united flight"
 thus complained gently reproved
 sweetly spake thus loved

 xxxvi
 "far plaints dear friend tears laments
 time place estates require
 think thy sins man's old foe presents
 judge quits soul hire
 name suffer pain torments

 thou didst live die feed thine eyes

 lxix
 "our loss thine provokes plaints tears
 lost thee ship mast

 echo sighed groves unseen
 weeping nymphs fled bowers exiled

 funeral cypress holly ever green
 weeping fir thick beech sailing pine

 lxxvi

 barren plantain walnut sound
 myrrh foul sin doth still deplore
 alder owner waterish ground
 sweet juniper whose shadow hurteth sore
 proud cedar oak king forests crowned
 thus fell trees noise deserts roar

 false words kindled fire began
 every vein poisoned heart reach
 swelled scornful heart forth ran
 proud looks audacious speech
 thought blameworthy man
 disgrace would preach
 termed proud vain worth fight
 called foolhardise rashness madness right

 xxiv
 rare excellent
 good princely found
 sharp words malice could invent
 blamed power wicked tongue wound
 youth everywhere rumors went
 reproaches heard sometimes sound
 tongue fault amend
 brought woful end

 xxv
 cursed fiend set tongue large
 still bred fancies idle brain
 heart slanders new overcharge
 soothed still angry vein
 amid camp place broad large
 one fair regiment might easily train
 tilt harmless tournament
 days rest youths gallants spent

 xxvi
 fortune would betide
 amid press gernando gan retire
 vomit venom unespied
 wherewith foul envy heart inspire
 rinaldo heard stood beside
 could bridle wrath ire
 "thou liest" cried loud word
 head tossed flaming sword

 xxvii
 thunder voice lightning seemed brand
 fell look furious cheer
 gernando trembled saw hand
 pale death neither help comfort near
 yet soldiers witness stand
 made proud sign though naught fear
 bravely drew littlehelping blade
 valiant show strong resistance made

 xxviii
 thousand blades burnished steel
 glistered heaps like flames fire sight
 hundreds knew yet quarrel weel

 xxxii

 beheld sad rueful sight
 signs death upon face appear
 dust blood locks loathly dight

 made sudden death great knight
 amazed asked durst much

 xxxiii

 prince murdered quarrel vain
 young rinaldo desperate wrath

 one christ's champions bold killed hath

 xxxiv

 law law inviolate
 none offence could greater uneath
 yet place fault aggravate
 escapes mischief would take breath
 flourish bold spite rule state
 gernando's friends would venge wrong
 although justice first belong

 xxxv

 raise mutinies therefore ensueth
 lastly praised dead still rife
 words thought could vengeance move rut
 tancred argued life
 honest reasons excuse youth
 duke heard sober cheer
 banished hope still increased fear

 xxxvi
 "great prince" quoth tancred "set thine eyes
 rinaldo's worth courage
 much hope conquest lies
 regard princely house race
 correcteth every fault spies
 judgeth alike doth amiss
 faults know greater thought less
 person's self doth transgress"

 xxxvii
 godfredo answered "if high low
 sovereign power alike feel stroke
 tancred ill counsel us trow
 lords know law erst spoke
 vile base empire know
 none slaves peasants bear yoke
 weak sceptre power small
 provisos bring annexed withal

 xxxviii
 "but mine freely given ere 'twas sought
 lessened consent

 give condign reward punishment
 since like subjection brought
 high low obey content"
 heard tancredi wisely stayed words
 weight sayings kings lords

 xxxix

 "'tis best" quoth "to make great ones shrink

 yet dare say godfredo means know
 knowledge hath looks speeches wrought

 xlii
 bitter smile well might see
 rinaldo cast scorn high disdain
 "let fetters plead cause" quoth
 "that base peasants born servile stain
 free born live die free

 otho chosen doth strength assay
 saddle tumbleth dust
 captive town sent away
 tancred begins new fight trust

 ii
 wary king commands

 whether sun moon stars appear
 give time work time comes wrong
 every street new weapons forged
 cunning smiths sweating labor long
 thus careful prince provision made
 argantes came boasting said

 iii
 "how long shall like prisoners chains
 captived lie inclosed within wall
 see workmen taking endless pains

 meanwhile western thieves destroy plains
 towns burnt forts castles fall
 yet none us dares gates outpeep

 iv
 "their time feasting good cheer spend

 king upon aid relied
 "within power sir king" says "united

 "perchance comes heavenly messenger

 yearned courage hot foes find

 "if go forth remain behind

 xxii
 thus spake king soon without abode
 troop went forth shining armor clad
 rest pagan champion rode
 wonted arms ensigns
 goodly plain displayed wide broad
 city camp spread
 place like wherein proud rome beheld
 forward young men manage spear shield

 xxiii
 alone argantes took stand
 defying christ servants true
 stature stomach strength hand
 pride presumption dreadful show
 encelade like phlegrean strand
 huge giant jesse's infant slew
 fierce semblant esteemed light
 knew else feared might

 xxiv
 yet one godfrey singled
 undertake hardy enterprise
 prince tancred saw rout
 fixed wishes cast eyes
 spied gazing round
 though honor prowess lies
 whispered louder meant
 godfrey heard saw content

 xxv
 rest gave place every one descried
 chieftain's incline
 "tancred" quoth "i pray thee calm pride
 abate rage yonder saracine"
 longer would chosen champion bide
 face joy eyes gladness shine
 helm took ready steed bestrode
 guarded trusty friends forth rode

 xxvi
 scantly spurred courser swift
 near plain proud argantes stayed
 unawares eyes chanced lift
 hill beheld warlike maid
 white snow upon alpine clift
 virgin shone silver arms arrayed

 xxvii

 looks would foeman kill
 full thoughts forward fared
 sent looks hill

 last marble rock standeth still
 stone cold without within burnt love's flame
 quite forgot came

 xxviii
 challenger yet saw none appear
 made sign show came
 "how long" cried "shall attend
 dares none come forth dares none fortune trust"
 stood amazed love stopped ear
 thinks cupid think mars lust

 xxix
 youth one late desired
 vainglorious boaster fought
 tancred chosen retired
 slackness awhile admired
 saw elsewhere employed thought
 though chosen proffered
 boldly took fit occasion offered

 xxx

 tancredi started noise heard
 waked sleep dreamed long
 "oh stay" cried "to belongs war"
 cried late otho gone far

 xxxi

 stayed horse waxed red shame
 fight disgraced quite
 thought another played game
 meanwhile saracen hugely smite
 otho's helm requite
 foe quite sevenfold targe bear
 breastplate stuck broke spear

 xxxii

 yet proud foe strong sturdy

 knight lay full low alas
 high disdain thus gan tell
 "yield thee slave thine honor

 xxxiii
 "not so" quoth "pardy guise
 christian knights though fall'n soon yield
 fall excuse better wise

 great circassian bent frowning eyes
 like grim visage minerva's shield
 "then learn" quoth "what force argantes useth
 fool proffered grace refuseth"

 xxxiv
 spurred horse speed haste
 forgetting good knights virtue owe
 otho fury shunned passed
 right side reached noble blow
 wide wound blood outstreamed fast

 avails hurt wounds augment
 foe's fierce courage strength hardiment

 xxxv
 argantes nimbly turned ready steed
 ere foe wist well aware

 force could gainst great might prepare
 weak feeble joints courage dead
 heart amazed paleness showed care
 tender side gainst hard earth cast
 shamed first fall bruised last

 xxxvi
 victor spurred lightfoot steed
 made passage otho's heart
 cried "these fools thus foot tread
 dare contend equal mart"
 tancred anger shook noble head
 grieved unknightly part
 fault slow
 double valor would salve sore

 xxxvii
 forward galloped fast loudly cried
 "villain" quoth "thy conquest thy shame
 praise honor shall fact betide
 gain guerdon shall befall
 among arabian thieves thy face go hide
 far resort men worth fame
 else woods mountains wild night
 savage beasts employ thy savage might"

 xxxviii
 pagan patience never knew used
 trembling ire sandy locks tore
 lips flew sound confused
 lions make deserts thick roar
 clouds together crushed bruised
 pour tempest caspian shore
 speech imperfect stopped broken
 roared thundered spoken

 xxxix

 xli

 xlviii

 fury new force courage new supplies
 armors forged metal frail
 every side thereof huge cantels flies
 land strewed plate mail
 earth warm blood lies

 xlix

 twixt hope fear stood long time amazed

 lxiii
 hence furious combat surveyed

 secret thoughts thus fancy said
 behold thy dear danger slain

 saw lord wounds hurts tormented
 complained called help fainted
 found awaked unquiet sleeping
 heart panting sore eyes red weeping

 lxxi
 "o spotless virgin" honor thus begun
 "that true lore observed firmly hast
 thy foes thou didst bondage
 remember kept thee pure chaste
 liberty wouldest thou run
 lay field princely virtue waste
 lose jewel ladies hold dear
 maidenhood great load bear

 lxxii
 "or deem'st thou praise little prize
 glorious title virgin's name

 amid thine armed foes seek thy shame
 fool woman conquers flies
 refusal kindleth proffers quench flame
 thy lord judge thou sinnest beyond measure
 vainly thus thou waste rich treasure"

 lxxiii
 sly deceiver cupid thus beguiled
 simple damsel filed tongue
 "thou wert born" quoth "in desert wild
 cruel bears savage beasts among
 shouldest scorn fair citherea's child
 hate pleasures youth belong

 lxxiv
 "go go whither sweet desire inviteth

 "besides thanks praises deed

 thy soft hand doth wholesome plaisters speed

 thence thy dearest lord may health succeed
 strength limbs blood cheeks thin
 rare beauties half dead

 lxxvii
 "so shall part adventures bold
 valiant acts henceforth held thine
 dear embracements shall thee straight enfold
 together joined marriage rites divine
 lastly high place honor shalt thou hold

 lxxx
 kept secret clorinda heard
 make complaints secretly lament
 cause sorrow referred
 matter enough discontent
 like bird close imbarred
 tender young ones springing bent

 lxxxi
 alone within chamber's secret part
 sitting one day upon heavy thought
 devising means sleight art
 close departure safest wrought
 assembled unresolved heart
 hundred passions strove ceaseless fought
 last saw high hanging wall
 clorinda's silver arms sighed withal

 lxxxii
 sighing softly said
 "how blessed virgin might
 envy glory maid

 steps trailing garments stayed
 chambers hide valor shining bright
 armed rides breaketh sword spear

 lxxxiii
 "alas heaven members frail

 soul rest quiet slide

 lxxxvi
 "alas impossible things

 heedless porter beguiled therefore

 maiden's beast speed likewise pass
 yet divers ways fear went
 squire late returned alas
 tardy news prince tancredi's tent
 fled likewise saw mistress gone

 cxii
 alicandro wiser rest

 cxiii

 rode haste though half arms miss
 among sandy fields valleys green

 jolly shepherd sung lusty round

 thither went old man found
 whose right hand little flock feed
 sat making baskets three sons among

 vii
 beholding one shining arms appear
 seely man sore dismay'd
 sweet erminia comforted fear

 happy folk heav'n beloved dear

 dreadful arms bear warfare bring

 "but father since land towns towers

 "haply heaven's defence shield right

 "time one hath doating time

 xiii
 "enticed hope future gain
 suffered long soul displease
 youth spent hope vain
 felt native strength last decrease
 gan loss lusty years complain
 wished enjoyed country's peace

 xiv
 thus spake erminia hushed still
 wise discourses heard great attention
 speeches grave idle fancies kill
 troubled soul bred dissension
 much thought reformed
 within woods dwell intention
 till fortune occasion new afford
 turn home desired lord

 xv
 said therefore "o shepherd fortunate
 troubles didst whilom feel prove
 yet livest contented state
 let mishap thy thoughts pity move
 entertain willing mate
 shepherd's life admire love
 within pleasant groves perchance heart
 discomforts may unload part

 xvi
 "if gold wealth esteemed dear

 trickled many silver tear
 two crystal streams fell watery eyes
 part sad misfortunes told
 wept wept shepherd old

 xvii
 speeches kind gan virgin dear
 toward cottage gently home guide
 aged wife made homely cheer
 yet welcomed placed side
 princess donned poor pastoral's gear
 kerchief coarse upon head tied
 yet gestures looks guess
 ill beseemed shepherdess

 xviii
 rude garments could obscure hide
 heavenly beauty angel's face
 princely offspring damnified

 xxxi
 castle meadow plain
 beside bridge's end stayed stood
 entreated speeches vain
 false guide pass beyond flood
 upon bridge appeared warlike swain
 top toe clad armor good
 brandishing broad cutting sword
 thus threatened death many idle word

 xxxii
 "o thou chance brings soil
 fair armida doth sceptre guide
 thou canst fly arms thyself despoil
 let thy hands iron chains tied
 enter rest thee thy weary toil
 within dungeon shalt thou safe abide
 never hope see day
 thy hair age shall turn gray

 xxxiii
 "except thou swear valiant knights aid
 traitors christian crew"
 tancred discourse little stayed

 rambaldo false maid
 forsook country religion true

 xxxiv
 warrior answered blushing red shame
 "cursed apostate ungracious wight

 wander hither thou art dead
 naught help thy courage strength skill
 godfrey send thy cursed head

 xxxvi

 wicked steel seized deep right side

 great loudly rung sounding steel
 yet pierced helmet blow

 prince whose looks disdainful anger show
 meant use puissance every deal
 shaked head crashed teeth ire

 xliv

 swift flight hope life reposed
 fast lord tancredi sped
 equal pace almost closed
 burning lamps extinguished
 shining fort goodly splendor losed

 lxxix
 thus prayed county prayers dear

 aged dragon bloody fight
 dreadful thunders forged new
 storms plagues poor sinners light
 massy trident mayest thou pendant view
 golden pin hung height
 wherewith sometimes smites solid land

 lxxxii
 among blessed weapons stands
 upon diamond shield looks bended
 great might cover lands
 twixt caucasus atlas hills extended
 lord's dear flocks faithful bands
 holy kings cities defended
 sacred angel took target sheen

 lxxxiii

 king clorinda sent brave rout

 godfrey likewise christian bands sent
 armed ranked good array stood still
 champions empty let remain
 twixt either troop large spacious plain

 lxxxiv
 argantes looked tancredi bold
 saw uncouth foe last appear
 raymond rode asked told
 better chance "tancred elsewhere
 yet glory behold
 come prepared bid thee battle
 place fight
 lo scorn thy heathenish might"

 lxxxv
 pagan cast scornful smile said
 "but tancred still bed
 looks late seemed make high heaven afraid
 dread dead fled
 whe'er earth's centre deep sea made
 lurking hole save head"
 "thou liest" says "to say brave knight
 fled thee thee exceeds might"

 lxxxvi
 angry pagan said "i spilt

 maintain thy foolish words brave lie"
 thus parleyed meet equal tilt

 bit lips rage cursed swore
 foe returned swift wind
 half mad arms second match find

 lxxxviii
 like ram butts horned head
 spurred forth horse desperate race
 raymond right hand let slide steed
 passed struck pagan's face
 turned earl nothing dread
 yet stept aside rage gave place
 helm strength gan smite
 hard courtlax could bite

 lxxxix
 saracen employed art force
 grip foe within mighty arms
 avoided nimbly horse
 prentice fierce alarms
 made many winding course
 strength sleight subtle warrior harms
 nimble steed obeyed ready hand
 stept print left sand

 trieth ways wiles thousandfold

 fared county pagan bold
 head breast none ill
 weaker parts wisely gan assail
 entrance searched oft 'twixt mail mail

 xci
 last hit place twain
 arms red blood trickled
 yet untouched remain
 nail broke plume cut crown
 argantes raging spent strength vain
 waste strokes thrusts idle thrown
 yet pressed doubled still blows
 hits neither cares knows

 xcii
 among thousand blows saracine
 last struck one raymond near
 swiftness aquiline
 could dear lord huge danger bear
 lo hand unseen help divine
 saves worldly comforts none appear
 angel targe received stroke
 shield argantes' sword broke

 xciii
 sword broke therein wonder lies
 earthly tempered metal could hold
 target forged skies
 fell blade pieces mould
 proud circassian scant believed eyes
 though naught left hilts gold
 full thoughts amazed awhile stood
 wondering christian's armor good

 xciv
 brittle web rich sword thought
 broke hardness county's shield
 thought raymond discovered naught
 succor heaven safety yield
 saw man gainst fought
 unweaponed still stood field
 noble heart esteemed glory light
 advantage slew knight

 xcv
 "go fetch" would said "another blade"
 heart better thought arose
 christ's glory champion made
 godfrey combat chose
 army's honor shoulder laid
 hazards new list expose
 thus thoughts debated case
 hilts argantes hurled face

 xcvi
 forward spurred mounture fierce withal
 within arms longing foe strain
 upon whose helm heavy blow fall
 bent wellnigh metal brain
 whose courage heroical
 leapt makes pagan's onset vain
 wounds hand outstretched saw
 fiercer eagles' talon lions' paw

 xcvii
 every side rode
 nimble speed spurred
 went came still laid load
 lord argantes' arms weak thin
 huge force arms abode
 wrath ire great desire win
 foe together bent
 heaven fortune furthered intent

 xcviii
 whose courage peril fails
 well armed better hearted scorns power
 like tall ship spent sails
 still resists rage storm shower
 whose mighty ribs fast bound bands nails
 withstand fierce neptune's wrath many hour
 yields bruised keel winds
 whose stern blast ruth grace finds

 xcix
 argantes thy present danger
 satan stirred aid thee thy need
 human shape forged airy mass
 made shade body seem indeed
 well might spirit clorinda pass
 like armor weed
 stature beauty countenance face
 looks speech gesture pace

 c
 spirit seem indeed
 whose show shape
 toward wall rode feigned speed
 stood people dismayed sad
 see knight help great need
 yet law arms help forbad
 turret sat soldier stout
 watch loophole peeped

 ci
 spirit spake called oradine
 noblest archer handled bow
 "o oradine" quoth "who straight line
 can'st shoot hit mark set high low
 yonder knight alas slain fine
 likest great ruth know
 greater shame victorious foe
 spoils triumphant homeward go

 cii
 "now prove thy skill thine arrow's sharp head dip
 yonder thievish frenchman's guilty blood
 promise thee thy sovereign shall slip
 give thee large rewards good"
 thus said spirit man laugh skip
 hope future gain longer stood
 quiver huge shaft hent
 set mighty bow new bent

 ciii
 twanged string flew quarrel long
 subtle air singing pass
 hit knight buckles rich among
 wherewith precious girdle fastened
 bruised pierced hauberk strong
 little blood trickled grass
 light wound angel unseen
 sharp head blunted weapon keen

 civ
 raymond drew forth shaft much behoved
 steel blood streaming came
 bitter words foe reproved
 breaking faith eternal shame
 godfrey whose careful eyes beloved
 never turned saw marked
 viewed wounded county bleed
 sighed feared perchance need

 cv
 words threatening eyes
 stirred captains revenge wrong
 forthwith spurred courser forward hies
 within rests put lances long
 either side squadron brave flies
 boldly made fierce encounter strong
 raised dust overspread begun
 shining arms far shining sun

 cvi
 breaking spears ringing helm shield
 dreadful rumor roared every side
 lay horse another field
 ran masterless dismounted guide
 one lay dead another yield
 sighed sobbed prayed cried
 fierce fight longer still lasted
 fiercer fewer still wasted

 cvii
 argantes nimbly leapt amid throng
 soldier wrung iron mace
 breaking ranks ranges long
 therewith passage made place
 raymond sought thickest press among
 take revenge late received disgrace
 greedy wolf seemed would assuage
 raymond's blood hunger rage

 cviii
 way found easy would
 fierce encounters put oft pain
 met ormanno rogero bold
 balnavile guy gerrards twain
 yet nothing might rage haste withhold
 worthies strove stop vain
 strong lets increased still ire
 like rivers stopped closely smouldered fire

 cix
 slew ormanno wounded guy laid
 rogero low among people slain
 every side new troops man invade
 yet blows waste onsets vain
 argantes thus prizes played
 seemed alone skirmish sustain
 duke brother called thus spake
 "go thy troop fight thy saviour's sake

 cx
 "there enter hottest fight
 thy force left wing strongly bend"
 said brave onset gave knight
 many paynim bold made end
 turks weak seemed sustain might
 could power lives defend
 ensigns rent broke array
 men horse heaps together lay

 cxi
 o'erthrown likewise away right wing ran
 one turned face
 save bold argantes else fled every man
 fear drove thence heaps headlong chase
 stayed alone battle new began
 five hundred men weaponed sword mace
 great resistance never could made
 argantes single blade

 cxii
 strokes swords thrusts many spear
 shock many joust long sustained
 seemed strength enough charge bear
 time strike gained
 armors broke members bruised
 sweat bled yet courage still feigned
 foes upon pressed fast
 weight bore back last

 cxiii
 back storm length turned
 whose headlong fury bore backward still
 like one fled one mourned
 foes greater ill
 threatening eyes like flaming torches burned
 courage thirsted yet blood spill
 every way every mean sought
 stay flying mates naught

 cxiv
 good thus played part
 bands troops ease safe retired
 yet coward dread lacks order fear wants art
 deaf attend commanded desired
 godfrey perceived wise heart
 bold knights victory aspired
 fresh soldiers sent make quick pursuit
 help gather conquest's precious fruit

 cxv
 alas appointed day
 set heaven end mortal war
 western lords time borne away
 prize travelled far
 devils saw sure decay
 false kingdom bloody war
 made heaven earth darkness blind
 stirred tempests storms blustering wind

 cxvi
 heaven's glorious lamp wrapped ugly veil
 shadows dark hid mortal eye
 hell's grim blackness bright skies assail
 every side fiery lightnings fly
 thunders roar streaming rain hail
 pour make sea erst dry
 tempests rend oaks cedars brake
 make trees rocks mountains shake

 cxvii
 rain lightning raging wind
 beat frenchmen's eyes hideous force
 soldiers stayed amazed heart mind
 terror stopped man horse
 surprised evil way find
 whither succor direct course
 wise clorinda soon advantage spied
 spurring forth thus soldiers cried

 cxviii
 "you hardy men arms behold" quoth
 "how heaven justice aid doth fight
 visages tempest free
 hands may wield weapons bright
 fury friendly storm see
 upon foreheads foes doth light
 blinds eyes let us take tide
 come follow good fortune guide"

 cxix
 said foes rode dame
 turned backs wind rain
 upon french furious rage came
 scorned idle blows struck vain
 argantes instant
 chased chased
 naught fearful back christian shows
 tempest blows

 cxx
 cruel hail deadly wounding blade
 upon shoulders smote fled
 blood new spilt thus slaughter made
 water fallen skies dyed red
 among murdered bodies pyrrhus laid
 valiant raiphe heart blood bled
 first subdued strong argantes' might
 second conquered virgin knight

 cxxi
 thus fled french pursued chase
 wicked sprites syrian train
 gainst force gainst fell menace
 hail wind tempest rain
 godfrey alone turned audacious face
 blaming barons fear vain
 camp gate boldly stood keep
 saved men within trenches deep

 cxxii
 twice upon argantes proud flew
 beat backward maugre might
 twice thirsty sword imbrue
 pagan's blood thickest fight
 last folk withdrew
 day's conquest gave virgin bright
 got home retired men
 thus chased lion den

 cxxiii
 yet ceased fury ire
 huge storms wind rain hail
 dark shone lightning fire
 wind water every place assail
 bank safe rampire left entire
 tent could stand beam cordage fail
 wind thunder rain gave dreadful sound
 music deafed trembling ground

 said discords strifes advised
 "great solyman day light hath lost
 christians shall assail sudden war

 xvi

 night half consumed spent
 headlong western hill goes
 distant scant mile godfrey's tent

 deeply sighed naked sword
 coach leaped mire
 ismen called angry lord
 grave words appeased foolish ire
 prince content remounted sword
 toward hill drove aged sire
 hasting forward bank pass
 till far behind christian leaguer

 xxviii
 alight took way foot
 empty chariot vanished sight
 yet still cloud environed
 left hand went height
 sion's hill till approached route
 side west looketh right
 ismen stayed eyesight bent
 upon bushy rocks thither went

 xxix
 hollow cave craggy stone
 wrought hand number years tofore
 long way walked none
 vault hid plants bushes hoar
 wizard stooping thereat gone
 thorns aside scratching brambles bore
 right hand sought passage cleft
 guide gave prince left

 xxx
 "what" quoth soldan "by privy mine
 hidden vault behoves creep
 sword find better way thine
 although foes passage guard keep"
 "let not" quoth "thy princely foot repine
 tread secret path though dark deep
 great king herod used tread
 arms whilom great fame

 xxxi
 "this passage made would suppress
 subjects' pride bondage hold
 could small forteress
 antonia called antony bold
 convey folk unseen less
 even middest temple old
 thence hither privy ways begin
 bring unseen whole armies

 xxxii
 "but saye world lives none
 knows secret darksome place
 come aladine sits throne
 lords princes set grace
 feareth fitteth one
 signs doubt show cheer face
 fitly come hear see keep still
 till time season serve speak fill"

 xxxiii
 said narrow entrance passed knight
 creeps camel needle's eye
 ways black darkest night
 followed rule guie
 strait way first withouten light

 upright walked ease men
 ere passed half secret den

 xxxiv
 privy door ismen unlocked last
 clomb littleused stair
 thereat day feeble beam cast
 dim light nothing clear air
 hollow cave length passed
 goodly hall high broad fair
 crowned gold purple clad
 sate sad king among nobles sad

 xxxv
 turk close hollow cloud imbarred
 unseen prease behold
 heavy speeches king heard
 thus lofty siege pleasure told
 "my lords last day state much impaired
 friends slain killed soldiers bold
 great helps greater hopes us bereft
 aught aid egypt land left

 xxxvi
 "and well see far distant aid
 upon heels danger treadeth still
 advice assembly made
 thinketh speak will"
 whisper soft arose said
 gentle winds groves murmur fill
 bold face high looks merry cheer
 argantes rose rest talk forbear

 xxxvii
 "o worthy sovereign" thus began say
 hardy young man tyrant wise
 "what words fears dismay
 knows need advice
 hand hope conquest lay
 loss true virtue damnifies
 make shield pray us succors give
 without let us wish live

 xxxviii
 "nor say aught misdeem
 egypt's promised succors fail us might
 doubtful great master's words seem
 neither lawful right
 speak words spurs esteem
 waken dull fearful sprite
 make hearts resolved assays
 win honor die praise"

 xxxix
 thus much argantes said said
 case clear spoke
 orcano rose princely stem ybore

 coupled new marriage yoke
 young babes fight made loth

 "my lord" quoth "i reprehend

 though good circassian friend

 xli
 "but beseem graver age
 long experience hath made wise sly

 somewhat misled knight awry
 equal balance ponder gauge

 xlii
 "but may say think unblamed

 xliii
 "for store cattle grain

 proud foes triumphant plain
 naught shedding blood conquest thought

 xliv
 "but appointed day miss

 oh save town ruin us shame
 godfrey still warfare

 xlv
 "and thou argantes wotest

 xlvii
 "the king tripoli well advised

 solyman godfrey's love despised
 either dead deep prison thrown

 xlviii
 thus spake orcanes inkling gave
 doubtful words would said
 sue peace yield slave
 durst openly king persuade
 words soldan gan rave
 gainst wrapt cloud stayed
 ismen thus bespake "how bear
 words lord reproaches hear"

 xlix
 "oh let speak" quoth "with ire scorn
 burn gains thus hid stay"
 said smoky cloud cleft torn
 like veil upon stretched lay
 open heaven forthwith borne
 left prince view lightsome day
 princely look amid press shined
 sudden thus declared mind

 l
 "of speak behold soldan
 neither afraid run away dread
 slanders lies fables
 hand shall prove upon coward's head
 shed sea blood well near
 heaped mountains high christians dead
 camp still maintained fray

 "if coward vile beside
 false faith country dares reply
 speak concord yon men pride
 good leave sir king shall die
 lambs wolves shall one fold abide
 doves serpents one nest shall lie
 one town us christians shall
 peace love unite within one wall"

 lii
 thus spoke broad trenchant sword
 hand held high aloft threatening guise
 dumb stood knights dreadful word
 storm front fire eyes
 turned last sion's aged lord
 calmed visage stern humbler wise
 "behold" quoth "good prince aid bring
 since solyman joined juda's king"

 liii
 king aladine rich throne upstart
 said "oh joy thy face view

 dear embracements long enfold

 liv

 among rose ormusses' valiant knight

 lvi
 surly countenance disdainful grace
 sullen sad sat circassian stout
 like fierce lion grumbling place
 fiery eyes turns rolls
 durst orcanes view soldan's face

 thus lords peers counselling
 turkish monarch sat juda's king

 lvii
 godfrey gave victory rein

 heathen enclosed doth threat

 lviii
 noble squadron known

 lix
 thus said "some one declare

 blush ground amazed stare

 last english prince countenance bold

 lx
 "we elect exploit lot
 secret flight hence withdrew
 following false cupid deny
 enticed forth love beauty's hue

 lxi
 "at last gan approach woful clime

 lxiv

 lxv
 "she sweet words false enticing smiles
 infused love among dainties set
 empoisoned cups souls beguiles

 lxvi
 "she read change felt thought

 lxvii
 "the rest like shape like garments wore

 full sweetly cabins slept

 "alas idle prise expect

 xxiv
 "when camp battle strong shall

 till builded new dreadful tower
 reared high downfallen rams
 workmen therefore despatched hour
 hew trees forest main
 went scant wood appeared sight
 wonders new fearful hearts affright

 xviii
 silly children dare bend eye
 told strange bugbears haunt place
 new monsters bed lie
 fearful thoughts present face
 feared fled yet wist
 pursued fearful chase
 except fear perchance thus fled
 new chimeras sphinxes like monsters bred

 xix
 swift camp turned back dismayed
 words confused uncertain tales told
 heard scorned said
 reports lies fables hold
 chosen crew shining arms arrayed
 duke godfrey thither sent soldiers bold
 guard men faint arms provoke
 cut dreadful trees hardy stroke

 xx
 drawing near wood close ypent
 wicked sprites sylvan pinfolds
 eyes upon shades sooner bent
 frozen dread pierced entrails dear
 yet stalked still went
 bold semblance hiding coward fear
 far wandered forth trembling pace
 till approached nigh enchanted place

 xxi
 grove fearful sound outbreaks
 earthquake hill mountain tore
 wherein southern wind rumbling makes
 like sea waves scraggy shore
 lions grumble hiss scaly snakes
 howl wolves rugged bears roar
 trumpets shrill heard thunders fell
 sounds one sound expressed well

 xxii
 upon faces pale well might note
 thousand signs heartamating fear
 reason gone device wot
 press nigh stay still
 sudden dread breasts smote
 courage weak shield proof could bear
 last fled one bold
 excused flight thus wonders told

 xxiii
 "my lord one us grant
 dares cut one branch yonder spring
 think dwells sprite every plant
 keeps court great dis infernal king
 hath heart hardened adamant
 without trembling dares attempt thing
 sense wanteth hardy
 hear forest thunder roar hiss"

 xxiv
 said alcasto words gave heed
 alcasto leader switzers grim
 man void wit void dreed
 feared loss life loss limb
 savage beasts deserts wild feed
 ugly monster could dishearten
 whirlwind thunder earthquake storm aught
 world strange fearful thought

 xxv
 shook head smiling thus gan say
 "the hardiness wood fell
 proud trees low dust lay
 wherein grisly fiends monsters dwell
 roaring ghost courage dismay
 shriek birds beast's roar dragon's yell
 forest wend
 although deepest hell paths descend"

 xxvi
 thus boasted leave go desired
 forward went joyful cheer
 viewed wood thick shades admired
 heard wondrous noise rumbling shrill
 yet one foot audacious man retired
 scorned peril pressing forward still
 till forest's outmost marge stepped
 flaming fire entrance kept

 xxvii
 fire increased built stately wall
 burning coals quick sparks embers hot
 bright flames wood environed
 tree twist alcasto got
 higher stretched flames seemed bulwarks tall
 castles turrets full fiery shot
 slings engines strong every sort
 mortal wight durst scale strange fort

 xxviii
 oh strange monsters battlement
 loathsome forms stood defend place
 frowning looks upon knight bent
 threatened death shot sword mace
 last fled though slow went
 lions jolly hunters chase
 yet fled man sad fear withdrew
 though fear till never felt knew

 xxix
 fled long time never wist
 far run discoverd
 wonder hand blist
 bitter sorrow heart bit
 amazed ashamed disgraced sad silent trist
 alone would day darkness sit
 durst look man worth fame
 pride late great greater made shame

 xxx
 godfredo called found delays
 causes cabin keep
 length perforce comes naught says
 talks like babble sleep
 shamefacedness godfrey plain bewrays
 flight sighs sadness deep
 whereat amazed "what chance this" quoth
 "these witchcrafts strange nature's wonders

 xxxi
 "but courage champion move
 try hazard dreadful spring
 give leave adventure great prove
 news may report us thing"
 said lords attempt charmed grove
 yet nothing back fear flight bring
 inforced trembling retire
 sight sound monsters fire

 xxxii

 nathless need high attempts led
 labor would shun danger fear

 fearless yet heedful silent well advised
 terrors forest's dreadful sight
 storms earthquakes thunders cries despised
 feared nothing yet motion light
 quickly vanished heart arised
 lo charmed wood
 fiery city high heaven stood

 xxxiv
 knight stepped back took sudden pause
 "what help arms" quoth
 "if fire monster's gaping jaws
 headlong cast boots
 common profit country's cause

 xxxv
 fly pagans say

 fire oh wondrous boldness leapt

 xxxvi
 bolted neither warmth heat
 felt sign fire scorching flame
 yet wist dismayed conceit
 fire came
 first touch vanished monsters great
 stead clouds black night frame
 hideous storms showers hail rain
 yet storms tempests vanished straight

 xxxvii
 amazed afraid champion good
 stood still tempest passed spied
 entered boldly forbidden wood
 forest secrets eyed
 walk sprite phantasm stood
 stopped way passage free denied
 save growing trees thick set
 oft sight passage oft let

 xxxviii
 length fair spacious green spied
 like calmest waters plain like velvet soft
 wherein cypress clad summer's pride
 pyramidwise lift tops aloft
 whose smooth bark upon evenest side
 strange characters found viewed oft
 like priests egypt erst instead
 letters used none could read

 xxxix
 mongst picked words last
 writ syriac tongue well could
 "oh hardy knight woods hast passed
 death palace court doth hold
 oh trouble souls quiet placed
 oh cruel thy heart bold
 pardon ghosts deprived heavenly light
 spirits dead men living fight"

 xl
 found graven tender rind
 mused uncouth writ
 thought heard softly whistling wind
 blasts amid leaves branches knit
 frame sound like speech human kind
 full sorrow grief woe
 whereby gentle thoughts filled
 pity sadness grief compassion fear

 xli
 drew sword last gave tree
 mighty blow made gaping wound
 rift red streams trickling see
 bebled verdant plain around
 hair start yet stroke
 nould give till end found
 adventure plaint moan
 hollow grave heard one groan

 xlii
 "enough enough" voice lamenting said
 "tancred thou hast hurt thou didst drive
 body noble maid
 lived late kept live
 within woful cypress laid
 tender rind thy weapon sharp doth rive
 cruel is't enough thy foes kill
 graves wilt thou torment still

 xliii
 "i clorinda imprisoned

 every pagan lord christian peer
 city's walls last day fell
 bodies new graves wot clear
 confined magic's spell

 murderer thou cut one twist art thou"

 xliv
 sick man sleep doth see
 ugly dragon chimera new
 though suspect half persuaded
 idle dream monster true
 yet still fears quakes strives flee
 fearful wondrous form view
 feared knight yet knew thought
 illusions false witchcraft wrought

 xlv
 cold trembling waxed frozen heart
 strange effects passions torment
 feeble hand weapon start
 wits nigh went
 wounded saw thought pain smart
 lady weep complain mourn lament
 could suffer dear blood see
 hear sighs deep far fetched

 xlvi
 thus fierce heart death scorned oft
 strange shape monster could dismay
 feigned shows tender love made soft
 spirit false vain plaints betray
 whirling wind sword heaved aloft
 forest bare quite away
 o'ercome retired prince came
 sword found repossessed

 xlvii
 yet nould return mind try
 courage forests green
 godfrey's tent proached nigh
 spirits waked thoughts composed
 "my lord" quoth "a witness true
 wonders strange believe scant though seen
 fire shades dreadful sound
 heard true proof found

 xlviii
 "a burning fire deserts charmed
 built like battled wall heaven reared
 whereon darts dreadful weapons armed
 monsters foul misshaped whole bands appeared
 passed unhurt unharmed
 flame threatened blow felt feared
 rain night found straight
 day night sunshine turned rain

 xlix
 "what would tree wood
 hath sense hath life hath speech like human kind
 heard words grove stood
 mournful voice still still bear mind
 flesh purple blood
 every blow streams wounded rind
 else trow
 hath power cut one leaf one branch one bough"
 l
 thus said christian's noble guide
 felt uncouth strife contentious thought
 thought perzon tried
 witchcrafts strange bring charms naught
 deemed elsewhere provide
 timber easier got though sought
 study last abraid
 called hermit old said

 li
 "leave thy hardy thought another's hands
 plants wood dispoilen shall
 fatal ship conquest lands
 sails struck silver anchors fall
 champion broken hath worthless bands
 looseth soil held thrall

 lii
 said visage shone beams divine
 mortal voice's sound

 working brain never idle found
 crab bright titan shine
 scorched scalding beams parched ground
 made unfit toil warlike feat
 soldiers weak labor faint sweat

 liii
 planets mild lamps benign quenched
 cruel stars heaven signorize

 hot impressions earth skies
 growing heat still gathered deeper rout
 noisome warmth lands kingdoms flies
 harmful night hurtful day succeeds

 phoebus rose left golden weed

 sanguine beams forehead spread
 sad presage ill betide

 thus bent gainst earth scorching rays
 burnt flowers burnt clytie dear
 leaves grew wan upon withered sprays

 earth cleft rifts floods streams decays
 barren clouds lightning bright appear
 mankind feared lest climenes' child

 neither marching far tedious way
 weighty arms shoulders hung

 fourteenth book

 argument
 lord godfrey dream doth show
 rinaldo must return last
 asking pardon sue
 two knights find prince sent haste
 peter vision foreknew
 sendeth searchers wizard placed
 deep vault first large declares
 armida's trains shun snares


 fresh soft tender bed
 still mother gentle night flew
 fleeting balm hills dales shed
 honey drops pure precious dew
 verdure green forests spread
 virgin primrose violet blue
 sweetbreathed zephyr spreading wings
 sleep ease repose rest peace quiet brings

 ii
 thoughts troubles broadwaking day
 softly dipped mild oblivion's lake
 whose godhead heaven earth doth sway
 eternal light watch wake
 bent godfrey gracious ray
 bright eye still ope godfrey's sake
 silent dream lord sent
 told pleasure intent

 iii
 far east golden gate beside
 whence phoebus comes crystal port
 ere sun broad doors open wide
 beam springing day uncloseth
 hence comes dreams heaven's sacred guide
 reveals man high degrees
 hence toward godfrey ere left bed
 vision strange golden plumes bespread

 iv
 semblances shapes portraits fair
 never yet dream sleep appear
 forms sea earth air
 signs heaven stars every sphere
 wondrous uncouth strange rare
 vision well presented
 dream placed crystal wide
 beset golden fires top bottom side

 v
 wondereth circles vast
 stars motions course harmony
 knight shining rays fire embraced
 presents unwares eye
 voice far sweetness passed
 human speech thus said approaching nigh
 "what godfrey knowest thou thy hugo
 come embrace thy friend fellow dear"

 vi
 answered "thy glorious shining light
 thine eyes glistering beams doth place
 estranged hath foreknowledge quite
 thy countenance thy favor thy face"
 said three times stretched hands outright
 would friendly arms knight embrace
 thrice spirit fled thrice twined
 naught folded arms air wind

 vii
 lord hugo smiled "not think" quoth
 "i clothed flesh earthly mould
 spirit pure naked soul see
 citizen celestial hold
 place heaven room thee
 prepared among christ's champions bold"
 "ah when" quoth "these mortal bonds unknit
 shall peace ease rest sit"

 viii
 hugo replied "ere many years shall run
 amid saints bliss shalt thou reign
 first great wars must thy hand done
 much blood shed many pagans slain
 holy city assault
 land set free servile yoke
 wherein thou shalt christian empire frame
 thee shall baldwin rule

 ix
 "but increase thy love great desire
 heavenward blessed place behold
 shining lamps globes living fire
 turned guided moved rolled
 angels' singing hear choir
 bend thine eyes yonder earth mould
 mass globe compass see
 land sea spring fountain man beast grass tree

 x
 "how vile small slender price
 reward goodness virtue's gain
 narrow room glory vain upties
 little circle doth pride contain
 earth like isle amid water lies
 sea sometime called sometime main
 yet naught therein responds name great
 lake pond marish strait"

 xi
 thus said one bended
 looks ground half scorn smiled
 saw earth sea flood castle town
 strangely divided strangely compiled
 wondered folly man far drown
 set heart things base vild
 servile empire searcheth dumb fame
 scorns heaven's bliss yet proffereth heaven

 xii
 wherefore answered "since lord yet
 free spirit cage clay
 lest worldly error vain voyage let
 teach heaven best surest way"
 hugo replied "thy happy foot set
 true path passage stray
 exile young rinaldo call
 give thee charge else naught

 xiii
 "for lord hosts king bliss
 hath chosen thee rule faithful band
 thy stratagems appointed
 execute shall win land
 first thine second place
 thou art army's head hand
 champion place supply
 thou doth thy state deny

 xiv
 "the enchanted forest charmed treen
 cutting steel shall earth hew
 thy weak armies feeble
 scale walls reinforced new
 fainting lie dispersed green
 shall take new strength new courage view
 highbuilt towers eastern squadrons
 shall conquered shall fly shall die shall fall"

 xv
 held peace godfrey answered
 "oh presence would recomfort
 man's hidden thoughts perceive know
 say truth love see
 say messengers shall go
 shall speeches errand
 shall entreat else command man
 credit neither well perform can"

 xvi
 "the eternal lord" knight replied
 "that many graces hath thee blest
 among troops thou hast guide
 thou honored feared least
 speak thou lest blemish betide
 thy sacred empire thou make request
 suit thou moved art ruth
 yield forgive home recall youth

 xvii
 "guelpho shall pray thee god shall inspire
 pardon offence fault commit
 hasty wrath rash headstrong ire
 call knight yield thou
 though youth enwrapped fond desire
 far hence love looseness idle sit
 year fear shall return speed

 xviii
 "your hermit peter whose sapient heart
 high heaven secrets opens tells shews
 messengers direct part
 prince shall hear certain news
 learn way manner art
 bring back thy warlike crews
 thy soldiers wandered misgone
 heaven may unite join one

 xix
 "but conclusion shall speeches end
 know blood shall mixed thine
 whence barons bold worthies shall descend
 many great exploits shall bring fine"
 said vanished sleeping friend
 like smoke wind mist titan's shine
 sleep fled likewise troubled thought
 wonder pleasure joy marvel fought

 heaven infused new sudden thought
 pleasing words thus duke addressed
 "good prince mild though unasked kind unbesought
 oh let thy mercy grant request
 pardon fault rage malice wrought
 great offence grant late commit
 suit hasty perchance unfit

 xxii
 since godfrey meek benign kind
 prince rinaldo bold humbly sue
 suitor's self behind
 thy greatest friends state friendship true
 trust shall thy grace mercy find
 acceptable crew
 oh call home trespass amend
 shall blood godfrey's service spend

 xxiii
 "and else dares undertake
 enchanted wood cut one tree
 gainst death danger dares battle make
 bold face fearless heart
 beat walls gates pieces break
 leap o'er rampires high thou shalt see
 restore therefore desirous band
 wish hope strength shield hand

 xxiv
 "to nephew thyself restore
 trusty help strength hand thou needs
 idleness let consume
 recall noble acts deeds
 known worth strength yore
 wher'er thy standard broad cross outspreads
 oh let fame praise spread far wide

 xxv
 thus entreated rest approve
 words friendly murmurs whispered low
 godfrey though suit mind move
 whereon never thought tell
 "how heart" quoth "if love
 request suit bend bow
 let rigor go right justice
 wherein consent agree

 xxvi
 "rinaldo shall return let restrain
 henceforth headstrong wrath hasty ire
 hardy deeds let take pain
 correspond hope desire
 guelpho thou must call home knight
 see speed tents retire

 "that aged wood whence heretofore got
 build scaling engines timber fit
 fearful seat none wot
 ugly fiends damned spirits sit
 cut one twist thereof adventureth
 boldest knight without
 wall battered others doubt
 venture thou show thy courage stout"

 iv
 thus said knight speeches
 proffered service attempt thing
 hard assays courage willing flew
 praise spur words sting
 dear friends embraced crew
 welcome came ring
 guelpho tancred rest
 stood camp greatest chief best

 v
 prince lords iterate
 welcomes oft oft dear embrace
 toward rest lesser worth state
 turned received gentle grace
 merry soldiers bout shout prate
 cries joyful cheerful face
 triumph's chariot bright sun

 vi
 thus marched tent champion good
 sat friends around
 war asked wood
 answered demand list propound
 left ease stood
 hermit fit time speak found
 "my lord" said "your travels wondrous
 far strayed erred wandered far

 vii
 "much bound god brought
 safe false armida's charmed hold
 thee straying sheep bought
 hath reduced fold
 gainst heathen foes men naught
 hath chosen thee place next godfrey bold
 yet mayest thou polluted thus sin
 high service war fight begin

 viii
 "the world flesh infection vile
 pollute thoughts impure thy spirit stain
 po ganges sevenmouthed nile
 wide seas wash thee clean
 purge faults thee defile
 blood hath power thy sins slain
 help therefore invoke bewray
 thy secret faults mourn weep complain pray"

 ix
 said knight first witch unchaste
 idle loves follies vain lamented
 kneeling low heavy looks downcast
 sins confessed repented
 meekly pardon craved first last
 hermit zeal well contented
 said "on yonder hill next morn go pray
 turns forehead gainst morning ray

 x
 "that done march wood whence one brings
 news furies goblins fiends sprites
 giants monsters dreadful things
 thou shalt subdue dark grove unites
 let strange voice mourns sweetly sings
 beauty whose glad smile frail hearts delights
 within thy breast make ruth pity rise
 false looks prayers false despise"

 xi
 thus advised hardy knight
 prepared gladly enterprise
 thoughtful passed day sad night
 ere silver morn began rise
 arms took coat dight
 color strange cut warlike guise
 way sole silent forth went
 alone left friends left tent

 xii
 time gainst breaking day
 rebellious night yet strove still repined
 east appeared morning gray
 yet lamps jove's high palace shined
 mount olivet took way
 saw round eyes twined
 night's shadows hence thence morning's shine
 bright dark earthly divine

 xiii
 thus thought many bright
 splendent lamps shine heaven's temple high
 day hath golden sun moon night
 fixed wandering stars azure sky
 framed creator's might
 still live shine ne'er shall die
 till moment last day's brand
 burn burn sea air land

 xiv
 thus mused top went
 kneeled reverence fear
 eyes upon heaven's eastern face bent
 thoughts heavens uplifted
 "the sins errors repent
 mine unbridled youth father dear
 remember let thy mercy fall
 purge faults mine offences all"

 xv
 thus prayed purple wings upflew
 golden weed morning's lusty queen
 begilding radiant beams threw
 helm harness mountain green
 upon breast forehead gently blew
 air balm nardus breathed unseen
 o'er head let clearest skies
 cloud pure precious clew flies

 xvi
 heavenly dew garments spread
 compared clothes pale ashes seem
 sprinkled paleness fled
 thence purest white bright rays outstream
 cheered flowers late withered
 sweet comfort morning beam
 returned youth serpent old
 adorns new native gold

 xvii
 lovely whiteness changed weed
 prince perceived well long admired
 toward forest marched speed
 resolved adventures great required
 thither came whence shrinking back dread
 strange desert's sight first retired
 fearful loathsome made
 forest sweet pleasant shade

 xviii
 forward passed mid grove
 heard sound strange sweet pleasing
 rolled crystal brook gentle roar
 sighed winds leaves pass
 nightingale wrongs deplore
 sung swan singing died alas
 lute harp cittern human voice heard
 sounds one sound right well declared

 xix
 dreadful thunderclap last heard
 aged trees plants wellnigh rent
 yet heard nymphs sirens afterward
 birds winds waters sing sweet consent
 whereat amazed stayed well prepared
 defence heedful slow forth went
 way passage aught withstood
 except quiet still transparent flood

 xx
 green banks fair stream inbound
 flowers odors sweetly smiled smelled
 reaching stretched arms around
 large desert bosom held
 grove one channel passage found
 wood forest dwelled
 trees clad streams streams green trees aye made
 exchanged moisture shade

 xxi
 knight way sought flood pass
 sought wondrous bridge appeared
 bridge gold huge weighty mass
 arches great rich metal reared
 golden way entered
 fell bridge swelled stream weared
 work away sign left stood
 river calm became flood

 xxii
 turned amazed see troubled
 like sudden brooks increased molten snow
 billows fierce tossed fro
 whirlpools sucked bosoms low
 went search wonders mo
 thick trees high broad grow
 forest huge desert wide
 sought wonders still spied

 xxiii
 whereso stepped seemed joyful ground
 renewed verdure flowery weed
 fountain wellspring found
 bud roses lilies spread
 aged wood o'er round
 flourished blossoms new new leaves new seed
 boughs branches treen
 bark softened renewed green

 xxiv
 manna leaf pearled lie
 honey stilled tender rind
 heard wondrous harmony
 songs sweet complaints lovers kind
 human voices sung triple high
 respond birds streams wind
 yet unseen nymphs singers
 unseen lutes harps viols bear

 xxv
 looked listened yet thoughts denied
 think true heard see
 myrtle ample plain spied
 thither beaten path went
 myrtle spread mighty branches wide
 higher pine palm cypress tree
 far plants seen
 forest's lady desert's queen

 xxvi
 upon trees eyes rinaldo bent
 marvel great strange began
 aged oak beside cleft rent
 fertile hollow womb forth ran
 clad rare weeds strange habiliment
 nymph age able go man
 hundred plants beside even sight
 childed hundred nymphs great dight

 xxvii
 stages play see
 dryads painted wild satyrs love
 whose arms halfnaked locks untrussed
 buskins laced legs
 silken robes tucked short knee
 seemed sylvan daughters grove

 xxviii
 wantonly cast ring

 rinaldo round environing

 tree compassed eke gan sing
 woods streams admired excellence
 "welcome dear lord welcome sweet grove
 welcome lady's hope welcome love

 xxix
 "thou com'st cure princess faint sick
 love love thee faint sick distressed
 late black late dreadful forest thick
 fit dwelling sad folk grief oppressed
 see thy coming branches quick
 revived new blosoms dressed"
 song went
 first sweet sound myrtle rent

 xxx
 antique times admired silenus old
 oft appeared set lazy ass
 would wonder behold

 xxxi
 sad smiling look cast
 twenty passions strange bewrays
 "and art thou come" quoth "returned last

 com'st thou comfort sorrows past
 ease widow nights careful days
 comest thou work grief harm

 xxxii
 "com'st thou friend foe frame
 golden bridge entertain foe
 opened flowers fountains came
 welcome joy brings woe
 put thy helm rejoice flame
 thy bright eyes whence first fires grow
 kiss embrace venture
 love keeps gate fort eath enter"

 xxxiii
 thus woos rolls rueful eyes
 piteous look changeth oft cheer
 hundred sighs false heart upflies
 sobs mourns great ruth hear
 hardest breast sweet pity mollifies
 stony heart resists woman's tear
 yet knight wise wary unkind
 drew forth sword careless twined

 xxxiv
 toward tree marched thither start
 stepped embraced plant cried
 "ah never spiteful part
 cut tree forest's joy pride
 put thy sword else pierce therewith heart
 thy forsaken despised armide
 breast heart unkind
 fair tree thy sword shall passage find"

 xxxv
 lift brand cared though oft prayed
 form shape change
 monsters huge men dreams laid
 oft idle fancies roam range
 body swelled face obscure made
 vanished garments face vestures strange
 giantess high stands
 like briareus armed hundred hands

 xxxvi
 fifty swords fifty targets bright
 threatened death roared cried fought
 nymph armor likewise dight
 cyclops great became feared naught
 myrtle smote might
 groaned like living souls death nigh brought
 sky seemed pluto's court air seemed hell
 therein monsters roar spirits yell

 xxxvii
 lightened heavens earth

 blustered tempests strong whirlwinds blow
 bitter storm drove hailstones look
 yet arm grew neither weak slow
 fury heed care took
 till low earth wounded tree bended

 xxxviii

 wood returned wonted state
 withcrafts free quite void spirits ill
 horror full horror innate
 proved aught withstood
 cut trees charms late
 finding naught stop smiled said
 "o shadows vain fools shades afraid"

 xxxix

 death fear care save lives
 forsaken walls pagans chase
 yet neither force fear wisdom drives
 constant knight argantes place

 lxiv
 "'these arms ormondo took noble fight
 godfrey proud spoiled asia's lands

 lxv

 lxxi
 "cheer thy looks" answered indian king
 "and sweet beauty's sake appease thy woe

 ciii

 saw whereas another champion laid
 dead land soiled blood mire
 "this christian knight" vafrino said
 marking well arms rich attire
 loosed helm saw visage plain
 cried "alas lies tancredi slain"

 civ
 woful virgin tarried gave heed
 fierce looks proud saracine
 till high cry full sad fear dread
 pierced heart sorrow grief pine
 tancred's name thither ran speed
 like one half mad drunk much wine
 saw face pale bloodless dead

 springs tears looseth forth cries
 "hither bring'st thou ah fortune blind
 dead lived comfort lies

 tancred thee see thee yet thine eyes
 looked upon thy love handmaid kind

 "i never thought mine eyes dear

 cvii
 "though gone though dead love thee still behold
 death wounds kills love yet thou live
 sweet soul still breast follies bold
 ah pardon love's desires stealths forgive
 grant pale mouth kisses cold
 since death doth love reward deprive
 thy spoils sad death afford
 let mouth pale cold bloodless kiss

 cviii
 "o gentle mouth speeches kind sweet
 thou didst relieve grief woe pain
 ere weak soul frail body fleet
 ah comfort one dear kiss twain
 perchance alive happed meet

 feeble life betwixt lips fly
 oh let kiss thee first let die

 cix
 "receive yielding spirit thine

 said sighed tore tresses fine
 eyes two streams poured face
 man revived showers divine
 awaked opened lips space
 lips open fast shut eyes

 dame perceived tancred breathed sighed
 calmed grief somedeal eased fears
 "unclose thine eyes" says "my lord knight
 see last services plaints tears
 see dies see thy woful plight

 cxi
 tancred looked closed eyes

 plucked armor vein

 cxii
 weariness loss blood spied
 greatest pains anguish proceed
 naught veil amid deserts wide

 love could bands though strange provide
 pity wept joy see deed

 cxiii
 veil short thin deep
 cruel hurts fasten roll blind
 salve simple yet keep

 said drove deadly sleep
 eyes lifted turned twined

 "you shall know all" says "your surgeon

 cxv
 vafrine devised might bear
 master home ere night obscured land
 lo troop soldiers appear
 descried tancredi's band
 argant met
 went combat hand hand
 bade stay behind obeyed

 cxvi
 besides many followed enquest
 alone found rightest way
 upon friendly arms men addressed
 seat whereon sat leaned lay
 quoth tancred "shall strong circassian rest
 broad field wolves crows prey
 ah defraud champion brave

 cxvii
 "with dead bones longer war

 death alonely doth remain"
 pagan dead lifted high
 tancred bore plain
 close virgin chaste vafrine ride

 "not home" quoth tancred "to wonted tent

 performed shall vow pilgrimage"

 cxix
 thus city tancredi borne

 cxxvi
 said young rinaldo's angry eyes

 duke vafrine talk applies
 "the greatest news lord yet behind

 cxxvii
 point point gan expose
 false compact made wrought

 ormondo's vaunt praise thank sought

 silence made awhile godfrey thus
 "raymondo say counsel givest thou us"

 cxxviii
 "not purposed late next morn" quoth
 "let us scale round besiege tower

 camp well rested refreshed see
 provided well gainst last storm shower
 pitched field fight

 cxxix
 "but lest endangered hurt slain

 else rule guide squadrons brave
 traitors shall noted plain

 cxxx
 "as hath ever" thus duke begun
 "thy counsel shows thy wisdom thy love

 strength manhood assay
 try open field open day

 cxxxi
 "the fame great conquests sustain
 bide looks threats able
 army subdued slain
 empire settled firm stable
 tower shall yield resist vain
 fear anchor despair cable"
 thus concludes rolling west
 fast set stars called rest

 pagan host arrives cruel fight

 sun called world idle sleep
 day ten hours gone past
 bold troop tower keep
 espied sudden mist overcast
 earth mirksome clouds darkness deep
 saw egyptian camp last

 iv
 till morning next refused fight
 haste heat bridled brake
 yet sudden fray skirmish light
 new foes would vain trial make
 "after many wars" says "good right
 one day's rest least take"
 thus vain foes cherish would
 hope strength hold

 v
 see aurora's gentle beam appear
 soldiers armed prest ready lay
 skies never half fair clear
 breaking blessed day
 merry morning smiled seemed wear
 upon silver crown sun's golden ray
 without cloud heaven redoubled light

 pagans would backs invade

 night's azure mantle oft doth run
 fall sliding star shining flame
 bosom burning sun

 godfredo's noble head encompassed round

 spoil folk shall gain praise thank
 feared "look day"
 says "vile fear bold hearts never sank
 dareth one hundred fight
 cry shade put flight"

 xxv
 bold "go hardy knight" says
 "his prey lion's paws go tear"
 thoughts shape lays
 makes therein image true appear
 sad country entreats prays
 house loving wife children dear
 "suppose" quoth "thy country doth beseech
 pray thee thus suppose speech

 xxvi
 "defend laws uphold temples brave
 blood washing streets withhold
 ravishing virgins keep save
 thine ancestors' dead bones ashes cold
 thee thy fathers dear parents grave
 show uncovered heads white hoary old
 thee thy wifeher breasts tears o'erspread
 thy sons cradles shows thy marriage bed"

 xxvii
 rest "you honor's sake
 asia makes champions might
 upon thieves weak feeble must take
 sharp revenge yet deserved right"
 thus many words several tongues spake
 sundry nations sharp fight
 encouraged dukes done
 speeches hosts together run

 xxviii
 great strange wondrous sight
 front front noble armies met
 every troop troop knight
 stood prest move fight praise get
 loose wind waved ensigns light
 trembled plumes crests set
 arms impresses colors gold stone
 sunbeams smiled flamed sparkled shone

 xxix
 dry topped oaks seemed two forests thick
 host spears pikes abound
 bent bows rests lances stick
 hands shook swords slings held cobbles round
 steed run ready prest quick
 commander's spur hand sound
 chafes stamps careers turns
 foams snorts neighs fire smoke breathes

 xxx
 horror fair fight seemed fair
 pleasure flew amid sad dread fear
 trumpets shrill thundered air
 music mild sweet every ear
 faithful camp though less yet seemed rare
 strange noise warlike shrill clear
 notes sweet pagan trumpets jar
 sung armors shined glistered far

 xxxi
 christian trumpets give deadly call
 pagans answer fight accept
 godly frenchmen knees fall
 pray kissed earth leapt
 fight land vanished
 combat close host stepped
 wings skirmish hot begun
 battles forth footmen run

 xxxii
 first christian train
 gave onset first first renown
 gildippes thou wert thee slain
 king orms hircano tumbled
 man's breastbone thou clov'st rent twain
 heaven honor would thee bless crown
 pierced fell falling hard withal

 lance thus broke hardy dame forth drew
 strong hand fine trenchant blade
 gainst persians fierce bold flew
 troop wide streets lanes made
 even girdlingstead divided new
 pieces twain zopire earth laid
 alarco's head swept clean

 xxxiv
 blow felled artaxerxes thrust
 argeus slain first lay trance
 ismael's left hand cut fell dust
 wrist sword fell chance
 hand let go bridle lust
 blow upon courser's ears glance
 felt reins large stroke
 half mad ranks disordered troubled broke

 xxxv

 slew knights courser fierce made die
 names countries people slain
 tells wounds deaths explain

 xli
 fierce king encounter durst one
 one durst combat equal field
 gildippes undertook task alone
 doubt could make shrink danger yield
 thermodont never amazone
 managed steeled axe carried shield
 seemed bold strong light
 forth run meet dreadful knight

 xlii

 diadem helmet flame

 proud lofty top crest came

 thievish wolves night o'ershades land

 closed folds secret creep

 xlv
 proached nigh godfredo's side
 bloody pagan placed near
 colors gold white spied
 saw signs forged
 "see see traitor false" captain cried
 "that like frenchman would show appear
 behold near mates crept"
 said upon villain forth leapt

 lxvi
 deadly wounded false knight
 strikes wards striveth gone
 medusa's head sight
 stood like man new turned marble stone
 lances broke unsheathed weapons bright
 quivers emptied alone
 parts many traitors cleft
 dead men dead bodies left

 lxvii
 godfrey pagan blood bespread
 entered fight past
 bold persian fought combated
 close ranks opened cleft brast
 knight troops squadrons fled
 afric dust southern blast
 duke recalled array placed
 stayed fled assailed chased

 lxviii
 champions strong fought battle stout
 troy never saw like xanthus old
 conflict sharp meanwhile foot

 broke arms fight would soon done
 place place tisiphernes rove

 thus fought long yet neither shrink yield
 equal balance hung hope fear
 full broken lances lay field
 full arms cloven shattered

 cut men's throats bellies tear
 bodies upright grovelling lay

 li
 beside lord slain lay noble steed
 friend friend lay killed like lovers true
 foe foe live dead

 hoarse unperfect sound eachwhere spread
 whence neither silence plain outcries flew
 fury roars ire threats woe complains
 one weeps another cries sighs pains

 lii
 arms late fair glorious seem
 soiled slubbered sad sullen grow
 steel brightness lost gold beam
 colors pride beauty's show
 plumes feathers crests stream
 strowed wide upon earth

 liii
 moors arabians ethiops black
 left wing held utmost marge

 rinaldo came whose fury haste ire

 upon feeble foes fell oft thick
 move three tongues fierce serpent shows
 rolls one hath swift speedy quick
 thinks pagan arabian trows
 wields three swords one hilt stick
 readiness eyes blinded hath
 dread wonder bred fear gave faith

 lvi

 lvii

 bold breasts deep wounds hurts bear
 fled away troubled chase
 ranks disordered much fear
 rinaldo followed place place
 till quite discomfit dispersed
 done stays knights recalls
 scorns strike foe flies falls

 lviii
 like wind stopped wood hill
 grows strong fierce tears boughs trees twain
 mild blasts temperate gentle still
 blows ample field spacious plain
 rocks seawaves murmur shrill
 silent pass amid open main
 rinaldo none force withstood
 assuaged fury calmed angry mood

 lix
 scorned upon fearful backs fled
 wreak ire spend force vain
 gainst footmen strong troops led
 whose side moors open left plain
 africans succored
 battle run away slain
 upon flank force courage stout
 men arms assailed bands foot

 lx
 brake pikes brake close array
 entered battle felled around
 wind tempest impetuous sway
 ears ripened corn strikes flat ground
 blood arms bodies dead hardened clay
 plastered earth grass green found

 lxi
 rinaldo came forlorn armide
 sate golden chariot mounted high
 noble guard every side
 lords lovers much chivalry
 knew man first arms spied
 love hate wrath sweet desire strove eye
 changed somedeal look countenance bold
 changed frost fire heat cold

 lxii
 prince passed chariot dear
 like one thoughts elsewhere bestow
 yet suffered knights lovers near
 rival scape withouten blow
 one drew sword another couched spear
 arrow sharp set bow
 disdain ire new sharped kindled hath
 love appeased love assuaged wrath

 lxiii
 love bridled fury revived new
 fire dead though buried displeasure
 three times angry hand bow updrew
 thrice let slack string leisure
 wrath prevailed last reed outflew
 love finds mean hatred knows measure
 outflew shaft shaft charm
 wish sent heaven grant harm

 lxiv
 bids reed return way went
 pierce heart unkind could prove
 force love though lost vainly spent
 strength hath happy kind mutual love
 gentle thought straight repent
 wrath fury kindness bosom strove

 lxv

 hauberk hard knight hit
 hard woman's shaft woman's shot
 instead piercing broke split
 turned away burnt fury hot
 thought scorned power fit
 shot oft oft shafts entrance found
 shot love gave wound wound

 lxvi
 "and unpierceable" quoth
 "that neither force foe needs regard
 limbs perchance armed hardness
 makes heart cruel hard
 shot flies eye hand see
 hurts rigor doth person guard
 armed disarmed foe mistress kind
 despised alike like hate like scorn find

 lxvii
 "but new form left device art

 great prowess might valiant heart

 said saw field

 lxviii

 waxed sharp hot cruel though renewed late
 soldan clomb tower's height

 furious fierce gates unbar

 fury called every side
 rest run aladine forth hies
 cowards fear wise care

 lxxvii
 dreadful turk sudden blows cast
 first met gave time plain
 pray murdering made haste
 dead fell ere one could see slain
 mouth mouth eye eye forth passed
 fear terror faithful train
 syrian folk used dangerous fight
 broken scattered nigh put flight

 lxxviii
 less terror disorder less
 gascoigns kept array kept ground
 though loss peril oppress
 unwares assailed unready found
 ravening tooth talon hard guess
 beast eager hawk doth slay wound
 many sheep fowls weak feeble small
 sharp sword killed knights soldiers tall

 lxxix

 syrian people ran away outright
 fight near place tancred lay
 house full noise great affright
 rose looked forth see fray
 though every limb weak faint void might
 saw country lie men o'erthrown
 beaten back killed felled

 lxxxiv

 yet fainted though faint every limb
 reinforced member cleft rent

 xciv

 strange wits strange ears let dilate
 ages love sweet accord
 virtue prowess worth may imitate
 kind servant true love hears

 xcv
 noble lady thither boldly flew
 first soldan fought defied
 two mighty blows gave turk untrue
 one cleft shield pierced side
 prince damsel habit knew
 "see see mankind strumpet see" cried
 "this shameless whore thee fit weapons

 xcvi
 said full disdain rage despite
 strong fierce deadly stroke gave
 pierced armor pierced bosom white
 worthy blows blows love
 dying hand let go bridle quite

 xcix
 high elm dear vine hath twined

 c
 fell mourning mourning dame
 life death made forever
 would spoke one word could frame
 deep sobs speech sweet sighs language
 gazed other's eyes
 lawful join hands embrace kiss
 thus sharp death knot life untied
 together fainted together died

 ci

 told eachwhere chance fate fall
 rinaldo heard case one fled
 fierce turk brought news
 disdain goodwill woe wrath champion led
 take revenge shame grief vengeance call
 went adrastus blade

 cii
 giant cried "by sundry signs note
 wish search thou thou art
 marked worthy's shield helm coat

 sweet saint thy head devote

 ciii
 thus defied front
 throat struck yet blow
 helmet neither bruised cleft tore
 saddle made bend bow
 rinaldo hit flank sore
 neither art herb could help
 fell giant strong one blow power
 puissance falls thundered tower

 cv
 sick frantic men oft dream
 unquiet sleep slumber short
 think run speedy course seem
 move legs feet hasty sort
 yet feel limbs far slower stream
 vain thoughts bears sport
 oft would speak would cry would call shout
 yet neither sound voice word send

 cvi
 run fight angry soldan would
 enforce strength might ire
 yet felt courage old
 wonted force rage hot desire
 eyes sparkled wrath fury bold
 grew dim feeble fear quenched fire
 heart hundred passions fought
 yet none fear base retire thought

 cvii
 unresolved stood victor knight
 arrived seemed quickness haste speed
 boldness greatness goodliness might
 princes born human seed
 turk small resists death fight
 made forget state race dreed
 fled strokes fetched groan sigh
 bold motions last proud stately high

 cviii
 soldan battles past
 antheuslike oft fell oft rose
 evermore fierce fell fell last
 lie forever prince slain
 fortune seld stable firm fast
 longer durst resist christian train
 ranged row godfrey's knights
 serves runs rides fights

 cix
 pagan troops king's squadron fled
 east strength pride flower
 late called immortal discomfited
 lost title proud lost power
 royal standard fled
 thus emireno said speeches sour
 "art thou bear gave
 king's great banner standard brave

 cx
 "this ensign rimedon gave thee
 witness thy fear flight
 coward dost thou thy lord captain see
 battle strong runn'st thyself fight
 seek'st thou safety come return
 way death path virtue right
 let fight would escape
 way honor way safety is"

 cxi
 man returned swelled scorn shame
 duke speeches grave exhorts rest
 threats strikes sometime till back came
 rage gainst force despair gainst death addressed
 thus broken armies gan frame
 battle hope dwelt breast
 tisiphernes bold revived
 fought seemed win lost

 cxii
 wonders day wrought noble tisipherne
 hardy normans overthrew
 flemings fled champion stern
 gernier rogero gerard bold slew
 glorious deeds praise fame etern
 life's short date prolonged enlarged drew
 set sweet life nought
 greatest peril danger sought

 cxiii
 spied rinaldo although field
 azure purple sanguine shows
 though silver bird amid shield
 armed gules yet champion knows
 says "here greatest peril heavens yield
 strength courage fortune blows
 fair armida revenge may see
 help macon arms vow thee"

 cxiv
 thus prayed vows vain
 mahound deaf slept heavens
 lion strikes train
 native wrath quicken move
 awaked fury disdain
 sharped courage whetstone love
 saved behind mighty targe
 forward spurred steed gave charge

 cxv
 christian saw hardy warrior come
 leaped forth undertake fight
 people round gave place room
 wondered fierce cruel sight
 praised strength skill courage
 desperate blows struck either knight
 saw forgot ire strife
 wounds hurts forgot death life

 cxvi
 one struck strike wound
 arms surer strength
 tisipheme blood streamed around
 shield deft helm rent tore
 dame saw blood besmear ground
 armor broke limbs weak wounds deep sore
 guard dead fled overthrown
 thought field lay waste hedge lay

 cxvii
 environed brave troop late
 stood chariot alone
 feared bondage life hate
 hope conquest revenge gone
 half mad half amazed sate
 leaped fled friends' fone
 swift horse mounts forth rides
 alone save disdain love guides

 cxviii
 days old queen cleopatra
 alone fled fight cruel fray
 augustus great happy foe
 leaving lord loss sure decay
 lord love let honor go
 followed flying sails lost day
 tisipherne fair fearful dame
 would follow foe forbids

 cxix
 pagan's joy comfort fled
 seemed sun set day night
 gainst brave prince combated
 turned forehead struck knight
 thunders forged typhoius' bed
 brontes' hammer falls swift right
 furious stroke fell rinaldo's crest
 made bend head breast

 cxx
 champion stirrups high upstart
 cleft hauberk hard tender side
 sheathed weapon pagan's heart
 castle man's life soul bide
 cruel sword breast hinder part
 double wound unclosed opened wide
 two large doors made life breath
 passed cured hot love frozen death

 cxxi
 done rinaldo stayed looked around
 harm foes help friends
 pagans saw squadron sound
 standard falls ensign earth descends
 fury quiet calm found
 wrath rage rancor ends
 called mind far help aid
 armida fled alone amazed afraid

 cxxii
 well saw fled sight
 prince pity courtesy care
 promised friend knight
 erst left island bare
 way fled ran rode aright
 palfrey's feet signs grass outware
 found ugly shade
 fit place death naught could life persuade

 cxxiii
 well pleased shadows brown
 yet displeased luck life love
 steed lighted laid
 bow shafts arms helpless prove
 "there lie shame" says "disgraced o'erthrown
 blunt weapons blunt arms move
 weak revenge harms harm foe
 shafts blunt ah love would thine

 cxxiv
 alas among many could one
 one draw blood one wound rend skin
 breasts marble stone
 dare pierce woman's bosom thin
 see see naked heart alone
 employ force fort eath win
 love shoot mighty bow
 weak shot dripile falls snow

 cxxv
 "i pardon fear weakness past
 strong mine arrows cruel sharp gainst
 ah wretch thy chance fortune cast
 placed thy good comfort
 since hope vain help waste
 since hurts ease hurts wounds must cure wounds thee
 thine arrow's stroke cure stroke love
 death thy heart must salve surgeon prove

 cxxvi
 "and happy dead slain
 bear strange plague hell
 love stay behind come thou disdain
 wronged soul forever dwell
 else turn world
 vex knight dreams visions fell
 tell twixt life death strove
 last wish revengelast word love"

 cxxvii
 word half mad half dead seems
 arrow poignant strong sharp took
 dear knight found extremes
 fit die pass stygian brook
 prest quench beauty's beams
 death sat eyes death look
 back stepped stayed arm
 stretched forth service last last harm

 cxxviii
 turns ere knows lord spies
 whose coming unwished unthought unknown
 shrieks twines away sdainful eyes
 sweet face falls dead swoon
 falls flower half cut bending lies
 held lest tumble
 tender side arm placed
 hand girdle loosed gown unlaced

 cxxix
 fair face fair bosom bedews
 tears tears remorse ruth sorrow
 pale rose color lost renews
 fresh drops fallen silver morrow
 revives cheeks empurpled shows
 moist tears tears borrow
 thrice looked eyes thrice closed
 say "let die ere look thee"

 cxxx
 strong arm weak feeble hand
 would thrust away loosed untwined
 oft strove vain break band
 hold got yet resigned
 fast bound dear knots fand
 dear though feigned scorn strove repined
 last speaks weeps complains cries
 yet durst would see eyes

 cxxxi
 "cruel thy departure return
 cruel say chance thee hither guideth
 would'st thou prevent death whose heart forlorn
 thee thee death's strokes hour divideth
 com'st thou save life alas scorn
 torment armida poor abideth
 thy crafts sleights well descry
 little cannot die

 cxxxii
 "thy triumph great well arrayed
 unless chains thou lead captive dame
 dame ta'en force betrayed
 thy greatest glory greatest fame
 time thee love life prayed
 let death end love life shame
 yet let thy false hand bereave breath
 thy gift hateful death

 cxxxiii
 "cruel hundred ways find
 rid thy malice thy hate
 weapons sharp poisons kind
 fire strangling fail estate
 yet ways enough know stop wind
 thousand entries hath house fate
 ah leave flatteries leave weak hope move
 cease cease hope dead dead love"

 cxxxiv
 thus mourned watery eyes
 disdain love dropped rolled tears
 pure fountains ran two streams likewise
 wherein chaste pity mild ruth appears
 thus sweet words queen pacifies
 "madam appease grief wrath fears
 crowned scorned life save
 foe nay friend knight slave

 cxxxv
 "but trust speech oath word
 yet mine eyes zeal truth behold
 throne whereof thy sire lord
 restore thee crown thee gold
 high heaven would much grace afford
 thy heart cloud veil unfold
 paganism east dame
 equalize thy fortune state fame"

 cxxxvi
 thus plaineth thus prays desire
 endears sighs fly tears fall
 warmth titan's fire
 snowdrifts consume tops mountains tall
 melts wrath love remains entire
 "behold" says "your handmaid thrall
 life crown wealth use pleasure"
 thus death life became loss proved tensure

 cxxxvii
 captain egyptian host
 saw royal standard laid ground
 saw rimedon ensign's prop post
 godfrey's noble hand killed one wound
 folk discomfit slain lost
 coward last battle found
 rode sought sought vain
 famous hand might slain

 cxxxviii
 lord godfrey boldly flew
 nobler foe wished could spy
 desperate courage showed tokens true
 where'er joined stayed passed
 cried duke near drew
 "behold thy strong hand come die
 yet trust overthrow thee fall
 castle's ruins shall break thy wall"

 cxxxix
 said forth spurred high advance
 swords aloft struck hit
 left arm wounded knight france
 shield pierced vantbrace cleft split
 pagan backward fell half trance
 left ear foe hugely smit
 sought rise godfredo's sword
 pierced died army's lord

 cxl
 great host emiren dead
 fled small remnant alive remained
 godfrey espied turned steed
 great altamore foot blood stained
 half sword half helm upon head
 gainst hundred fought yet one gained
 "cease cease strife" cried "and thou brave knight
 yield godfrey yield thee might"

 cxli
 till proud haughty heart
 act humbleness never bend
 great name heard north part
 wide world renowned aethiop's end
 answered "i yield thee thou worthy art
 thy prisoner fortune thy friend
 altamoro great thy conquest bold
 glory shall rich rich gold

 cxlii
 "my loving queen wife lady kind
 shall ransom jewels gold treasure"
 "god shield" quoth godfrey "that noble mind
 praise virtue profit measure
 thou hast persia inde
 enjoy still therein take pleasure
 set rent life price blood
 fight sell war gold good"

 cxliii
 said gave knights keep
 fled course bent
 rampiers fled trenches deep
 yet could death's cruel stroke prevent
 camp blood doth steep
 blood rivers streamed tent tent
 soiled defiled defaced prey
 shields helmets armors plumes feathers gay

 cxliv
 thus conquered godfrey yet sun
 dived silver waves golden wain
 daylight served fortress
 victorious host turn
 bloody coat put run
 high temple noble train
 hung arms bows
 knees prayed performed vows

 canto 1

 argument
 angelica pressing danger frights
 flies disorder greenwood shade
 rinaldo's horse escapes following fights
 ferrau spaniard forest glade
 second oath haughty paynim plights
 keeps better first made
 king sacripant regains longlost treasure
 good rinaldo mars promised pleasure



 loves ladies knights arms sing
 courtesies many daring feat
 ancient days story bring
 moors afric passed hostile fleet
 ravaged france agramant king
 flushed youthful rage furious heat
 king charles' roman emperor's head
 vowed due vengeance troyano dead

 ii
 strain roland tell
 things unattempted yet prose rhyme
 strange madness rank fury fell
 man esteemed wise former time
 like cruel pass well
 nigh brought feeble wit fain would climb
 hourly wastes sense concede skill
 strength daring promise fulfil

 iii
 good seed hercules give ear deign
 thou age's grace splendour art
 hippolitus smile upon pain
 tenders humble heart
 though hope quit score vain
 pen pages may pay debt part
 jealous eye offering scan
 scorn gifts give thee

 iv
 amid worthiest shalt thou hear
 fitting praise prepare grace
 record good rogero valiant peer
 ancient root thine illustrious race

 postponing lend thy leisure rhyme

 v
 roland long lady catay
 angelica loved brand
 raised countless trophies damsel gay
 india median tartarian land
 westward measured back way
 nigh pyrenees many band
 germany france king charlemagne
 camped faithful host upon plain

 vi
 make king agramant penance smite
 cheek rash marsilius rue hour
 trained lance sword fight
 led africa swell power
 pushed fell despite
 realm france spain's martial flower
 'twas thus orlando came charles tented
 evil hour soon deed repented

 vii
 seized dame peerless charms
 often human judgment wanders wide
 long warfare kept harms
 western climes eastern shores guide
 land 'mid friends kindred arms
 without contest severed side
 fearing mischief kindled eyes
 prudent emperor reft prize

 viii
 bold orlando cousin free
 rinaldo late contended maid
 enamored beauty rare since
 alike glowing breast either swayed
 charles little liked rivalry
 drew omen thence feebler aid
 abate cause quarrel seized fair
 placed bavarian namus' care

 ix
 vowing warrior content
 conflict fatal day
 good hand gainful succour lent
 slew paynims martial fray
 counter hopes battle went
 thinned squadrons fled disarray
 namus christian captains taken
 pavilion rout forsaken

 x
 lodged charles gentle bonnibel
 ordained valiant victor's meed
 event sprung sell
 combat turned time need
 presaging wisely fortune would rebel
 fatal day christian creed
 entering thick wood discovered near
 close path horseless cavalier

 xi
 shield upon arm knightly wise
 belted mailed helmet head
 knight lightly forest hies
 halfclothed churl win cloth red
 cruel snake swiftly flies
 timid shepherdess startled tread
 poor angelica bridle turns
 approaching knight foot discerns

 xii
 paladin good aymon's seed
 mount albano command
 late baiardo lost gallant steed
 escaped strange adventure hand
 soon seen maid rode speed
 warrior knew yet distant scanned
 angelic features gentle air
 long held fast cupid's snare

 xiii
 affrighted damsel turns palfrey round
 shakes floating bridle wind
 panic seeks choose ground
 open grove prefers thicket blind
 reckless pale trembling astound
 leaves horse devious way find
 forest bore dame
 till sylvan river's bank came

 xiv
 stood fierce ferrau grisly plight
 begrimed dust bathed sweat blood
 lately withdrawn fight
 rest drink refreshing flood
 tarried despite
 since bending bank hasty mood
 dropped helmet crystal tide
 vainly regain treasure tried

 xv
 thither speed drives evermore
 wild panic utters fearful cries
 voice upleaping shore
 saracen lovely visage spies
 pale cheek troubled sore
 arriving quickly warrior's eyes
 though many days news shown
 beautiful angelica known

 xvi
 courteous haply gifted breast
 warm either cousins two
 bold brows steel dressed
 succour sought lent drew
 faulchion rinaldo pressed
 saw little fear champion true
 known sight
 proved arms foeman's might

 xvii
 thus foot warriors vie
 cruel strife blade blade oppose
 marvel plate brittle mail fly
 anvils stood deafening blows
 behoves palfrey swift ply
 feet knights combat close
 vexed utmost speed goading spurs
 waste wood frighted damsel stirs

 xviii
 two struggled long throw
 strife vainly still
 since neither valiant warrior
 opposite force knightly skill
 first parley spanish foe
 good master albano's hill
 one within whose raging breast pent
 reckless fire struggled vent

 xix
 "thou think'st" said "to injure alone
 know thou wilt thyself much molest
 fight yon rising sun
 raging heat kindled thy breast
 thy gain guerdon
 though yield life stoop crest
 shall never thy glorious meed
 flies vainly battle bleed

 xx
 "then much better since stake's
 thou loving like should'st mount stay
 wait battle's end lovely dame
 fly yet way
 lady taken repeat claim
 naked faulchion peerless prey
 else long toil see gain
 simple loss unrequited pain"

 xxi
 peer's proposal pleased paynim well
 hot contention foregone
 fair truce replaced discord fell
 mutual wrongs forgot mischief done
 departure seated sell
 foot spaniard left aymon's son
 mount courser's crupper prayed
 united chased royal maid

 xxii
 oh goodly truth cavaliers old
 rivals different faith bred
 yet weary warriors' wounds cold 
 still smarting strokes fell dread
 yet together ride waste wold
 unsuspecting devious dingle thread
 four spurs infest foaming sides
 courser brings way divides

 xxiii
 warlike pair fault
 knew might palfrey goad
 since without distinction survey
 recent print hoofs either road
 commit chase fortune way
 paynim pricked rinaldo strode
 fierce ferrau bewildered wood
 found late stood

 xxiv
 beside water stoop'd drink
 dropt knightly helmet  cost
 sunk stream since could think
 retrieve late hopes crossed
 treasure fell descends brink
 swift stream seeks morion lost
 casque lies bedded sands
 'twill ask light endeavour hands

 xxv
 bough severs neighbouring tree
 shreds shapes branch pole
 sounds stream anxiously
 fathoms rakes ransacks shelf hole
 angered sore heart restless
 lingered troubled waters roll
 breasthigh mid river rose upright
 apparition angry knight

 xxvi
 armed points except head
 better hand helmet bore
 casque river's bed
 ferrau sought vainly toiling long sore
 upon spanish knight frowned said
 "thou traitor thy word thou perjured moor
 grieve goodly helmet resign
 due long since justly mine

 xxvii
 "remember pagan thine arm laid low
 brother angelica knight
  thy word plighted throw
 arms helmet bright
 fortune compel thee forego
 prize thy despite
 grieve rather grieve thou
 art found perjured traitor thy vow

 xxviii
 "but thou seek'st helmet thy task
 win wear thy renown
 noble prize good orlando's casque
 rinaldo's yet fairer crown
 almontes' mambrino's iron masque
 make one force arms thine
 good helm fitly bestowed
 thy promise long owed"

 xxix
 bristled paynim's every hair view
 grim shade uprising tide
 vanished fresh healthful hue
 lips halfformed accents died
 next hearing argalia slew
 warrior hight stream beside
 thus unknightly breach promise blame
 burned flushed rage shame

 xxx
 time falsehood excuse
 knowing well true phantom's lore
 stood speechless remorse words infuse
 lanfusa's life warrior swore
 never fight foray would use
 helmet good orlando bore
 aspramont bold almontes paid
 life forfeit christian blade

 xxxi
 new vow discharged faithfully
 vain promise whilom plight
 stream departing heavily
 many days sore vexed grieved sprite
 still intent seek orlando
 roved wheresoe'er hoped find knight
 different lot befel rinaldo
 chanced another pathway pursue

 xxxii
 far warrior fared ere spied
 bounding across path gallant steed
 "stay bayardo mine" rinaldo cried
 "too cruel care loss thee breed"
 horse returned side
 deaf prayer flew better speed
 furious chase rinaldo hies
 follow angelica flies

 xxxiii
 dreary woods dark damsel fled
 rude unharboured heath savage height
 every leaf spray rustled bred
 oak elm beech new affright
 foaming palfrey sped
 strange crooked paths furious flight
 shadow seen valley blind
 mountain feared rinaldo behind

 xxxiv
 young roe fawn fallow deer
 mid shelter native glade
 seen hungry pard tiger tear
 bosom bleeding dam dismayed
 bounds forest green ceaseless fear
 destroying beast shade shade
 sapling touched amid pangs
 believes monster's fangs

 xxxv
 one day night half following day
 damsel wanders wide whither knows
 enters deep wood whose branches play
 moved lightly freshening breeze blows
 two clear murmuring rivers stray
 upon banks fresher herbage grows
 twin streams passage slowly clear
 make music stones please ear

 xxxvi
 weening removed way wends
 thousand miles loathed rinaldo's beat
 rest maid intends
 wearied long flight summer's heat
 saddle 'mid spring flowers descends
 takes bridle courser fleet
 loose along river lets pass
 roving banks search lusty grass

 xxxvii
 behold hand thicket surveys
 gay flowering thorn vermeil rose
 tuft reflected stream strays
 beside overshadowing oaks enclose
 hollow within safe vulgar gaze
 seemed place constructed repose
 bows interwoven light
 pierced tangled screen far less sight

 xxxviii
 within soft moss herbage form bed
 delay rest traveller woo
 'twas limbs weary damsel spread
 eyeballs bathed slumber's balmy dew
 little time eased drooping head
 ere weened courser's tramp knew
 softly rises river near
 armed capapie beholds cavalier

 xxxix
 friend foe nothing comprehends
 hope fear doubting bosom tear
 adventure's issue mute attends
 even sigh disturbs air
 cavalier upon bank descends
 sits motionless lost care
 visage propt upon arm sight
 changed senseless stone appeared knight

 xl
 pensive hour drooping head
 rested mute ere began moan
 piteous tale sorrow said
 lamenting soft sweet tone
 tiger's breast pity bred
 mournful wailings rent stone
 sighed wept like rivers flowed
 tears bosom like aetna glowed

 xli
 "thought makes burn freeze hate
 gnaws heart rankles root
 what's left me" said "arrived late
 one favoured bears away fruit
 bare words looks scarce cheered hopeless state
 prime spoils reward another's suit
 since fruit blossom hangs
 longer pine hopeless pangs

 xlii
 "the virgin image rose
 sheltered garden native stock
 solitude safe repose
 blooms unapproached sheperd flock
 earth teems freshening water flows
 breeze dewy dawn sweets unlock
 wistful youth bosom dresses
 enamored damsel braids tresses

 xliii
 "but wanton hands sooner displace
 maternal stem grown
 withered whatsoever grace
 found man heaven bloom beauty gone
 damsel hold higher place
 light life flower
 suffering spoiler's hand crop prize
 forfeits worth every other's eyes

 xliv
 "and cheap except wight
 large boon bestow
 ah false cruel fortune foul despite
 others triumph drown'd woe
 treasure slight
 life forego
 let die 'twere happiness
 longer life must cease love"

 xlv
 ask made sorrowing
 pour'd stream many tears
 answer fair circassia's king
 sacripant oppressed amorous cares
 love source troubles spring
 sole occasion pains fears
 lover's service paid
 well remembered royal maid

 xlvi
 sake orient's farthest reign
 roved thither sun descends rest
 told india pain
 orlando followed west
 learned france charlemagne
 secluded champion rest
 fit guerdon mewed knight
 protect lilies best fight

 xlvii
 warrior field viewed
 short time king charlemagne's disgrace
 vainly angelica pursued
 damsel's footsteps found trace
 weeping monarch rued
 bewailed doleful case
 hence words lamentations run
 might pity stop passing sun

 xlviii
 sacripant laments plight
 makes tepid fountain eyes
 deem needful recite
 pours forth yet plaints piteous cries
 propitious fortune lady bright
 hear youth lament wise
 thus moment compassed without
 chance long ages brought

 xlix
 deep attention warrior weeps
 marks fashion grief tears
 words whose passion never sleeps
 first confession hears
 plaint heart measure keeps
 cold column builder rears
 like haughty maid holds
 world deems none worthy love

 l
 harm amid woods keep
 damsel weened might guidance need
 poor drowning caitiff chindeep
 implores help obstinate indeed
 let occasion sleep
 find escort stand stead
 king long experience knew
 lovers kind true

 li
 maid intends
 heal mischief charms wrought
 past ills furnish glad amends
 full bliss pining lover sought
 keep king play ends
 help device fiction bought
 purpose taxed daring
 reassume wont haughty bearing

 lii
 apparition bright unforeseen
 stood like venus diana fair
 solemn pageant issuing scene
 shadowy wood murky lair
 "peace you" cried youthful queen
 "and god preserve honour care
 suffer blindly entertain
 opinion fame false vain"

 liii
 wonderment mother eyes
 excessive bliss son mourned
 dead lamented still tears sighs
 since thinned files without boy returned
  rapture king's surprise
 ecstasy joy discerned
 lofty presence cheeks heavenly hue
 lovely form broke upon view

 liv
 full fond eager passion pressed
 towards lady divinity
 clasped warrior breast
 catay haply less free
 maid thoughts addressed
 towards native land empery
 feels hope revived bosom beat
 shortly repossess sumptuous seat

 lv
 chances damsel said
 since eastward sent sericane
 seek martial monarch's aid
 swayed sceptre fair domain
 told oft orlando's friendly blade
 saved dishonour death pain
 preserved virgin flower
 pure blossomed natal hour

 lvi
 haply tale true yet seem
 likely one sober sense possessed
 sacripant waked worser dream
 without cavil acquiesced
 since love sees without one guiding gleam
 spies broad day likes best
 one sign afflicted man's disease
 give ready faith things please

 lvii
 "if good anglante's lord prize forbore
 seized fair occasion might
 loss fortune never
 enjoy fair prize invite
 imitate lord little lore
 think not" said apart circassa's knight
 "to quit proffered good shame
 afterthought blame

 lviii
 "no pluck fresh morning rose
 tarry may overblown
 woman experience shows
 deed sweet welcome done
 whatsoever scorn damsel shows
 though awhile may weep make moan
 unchecked anger false true
 sharp repulse bold design pursue"

 lix
 said soft assault prepares
 loud noise within greenwood shade
 beside rang astounded ears
 sore monarch stayed
 donned helm arms wears
 aye wont rove steel belted blade
 replaced bridle courser fleet
 grappled lance sprang seat

 lx
 bold semblance valiant knight
 behold warrior threads forest hoar
 stranger's mantle snowy white
 white alike waving plume wore
 balked bliss full fell despite
 monarch ill interruption bore
 spurred horse meet mid space
 hate fury glowing face

 lxi
 defies fight approaching nigh
 weens make stoop haughty crest
 knight whose worth rate high
 warlike prowess puts present test
 cuts short haughty threats angry cry
 spurs lays levelled lance rest
 tempest wheels circassia's valiant peer
 foeman's head aims spear

 lxii
 brindled bulls tawny lions spring
 forest warfare deadly
 two knights stranger king
 spears alike opposing bucklers thrill
 solid ground encountering
 trembles fruitful vale naked hill
 well mail dressed
 bodies proof saved breast

 lxiii
 swerved chargers destined course
 met like rams butted head head
 warlike saracen's illfated horse
 well valued alive dropt short dead
 stranger's fell senseless perforce
 roused rowel grassy bed
 paynim king extended straight
 lay battered lord weight

 lxiv
 upright upon steed knight unknown
 encounter horse rider threw
 deeming enough conflict done
 cares worthless warfare renew
 endlong readiest path gone
 measures pricking frith forest
 mile little less furious heat
 ere foiled saracen regains feet

 lxv
 bewildered astonished clown
 held plough thunder storm o'erpast
 deafening bolt beat
 nigh deathstricken cattle wakes aghast
 sees distant pine without crown
 saw clad leafy honours last
 rose paynim knight troubled face
 maid spectatress cruel case

 lxvi
 sighs groans yet mischief sore
 endured wounded arm foot bled
 mere shame never
 dyed cheek deep red
 rued fall grieved
 dame lift courser dead
 speechless remained ween
 prisoned tongue voice set free

 lxvii
 "grieve not" said "sir monarch thy fall
 let blame upon thy courser
 welcome forage stall
 rest joust jeopardy
 well thy foe loser may call
 shall glory gain
 first quit ground aught
 angelica fighting fields taught"

 lxviii
 seeks saracen cheer
 behold messenger pouch horn
 panting hackney  man horse appear
 long journey weary forlorn
 questions sacripant approaching near
 seen warrior pass borne
 shield crest white search
 wide forest pricked weary groom

 lxix
 king sacripant made answer "as see
 threw went way
 tell warrior's name may
 informed whose valour foiled fray"
 groom  "that ask
 shall relate without delay
 know combat prostrate laid
 tried valour gentle maid

 lxx
 "bold maid fairer yet bold
 redoubted virgin's name veil
 'twas bradamant marred praise old
 prowess ever sword mail"
 said spurred story told
 left little gladdened tale
 recks says shame
 flushed visage kindles flame

 lxxi
 woeful warrior long thought
 upon cruel case still vain
 found woman defeat wrought
 thinking increased monarch's pain
 climbed horse spake aught
 silently uplifted plain
 upon croup bestowed damsel sweet
 reserved gladder use safer seat

 lxxii
 two miles rode hear
 sweeping woods spread sound
 loud crash trample far near
 forest seemed tremble around
 shortly see steed appear
 housings wrought gold richly bound
 clears bush stream furious force
 whatsoever else impedes course

 lxxiii
 "unless misty air" damsel cries
 "and boughs deceive sight yon noble steed
 sure bayardo us flies
 parts wood impetuous speed
  yes 'tis bayardo's self recognize
 well courser understands need
 two riders ill foundered jade would bear
 hither speeds horse end care"

 lxxiv
 bold circassian lighted applied
 hand seize flowing rein
 swiftly turning heels replied
 like lightning wheeled upon plain
 woe king leaps aside
 smite would lash vain
 bone sinew shock
 good heels split metal rock

 lxxv
 maid goes submissively
 gentle blandishment humble mood
 dog greets lord frolic glee
 short season past viewed
 good bayardo memory
 albracca hands prepared food
 time damsel loved rinaldo bold
 rinaldo ungrateful stern cold

 lxxvi
 left hand takes bit
 pats sides chest
 good steed marvellous wit
 lamblike obeyed damsel caressed
 meantime king sees moment fit
 leapt knees courser pressed
 palfrey eased half weight
 lady left croup gained seat

 lxxvii
 hazard directs sight
 sounding arms man foot espies
 glows sudden anger despite
 son aymon eyes
 life esteems youthful knight
 like crane falcon flies
 time lady sighed passion slighted
 'tis rinaldo loves ill requited

 lxxviii
 effect two different fountains wrought
 whose wonderous waters different moods inspire
 spring arden rare virtue fraught
 fills heart amorous desire
 taste fountain untaught
 love change ice former fire
 rinaldo drank first vainly sighs
 angelica last hates flies

 lxxix
 mixed secret bane waters glide
 amorous care convert sudden hate
 maid sooner rinaldo spied
 laughing eyes deep darkness sate
 sad mien trembling voice cried
 sacripant prayed wait
 near approach detested knight
 wood pursue flight

 lxxx
 saracen anger hot
 "is knightly worship sunk low
 thou should'st hold valour cheap
 sufficient make yonder champion flee
 already albracca's fights forgot
 dread night singly stood thee
 night though naked thy shield
 king agrican field"

 lxxxi
 answers knows fear
 'tis rinaldo nigh
 afar furious cavalier
 threats bold saracen angry cry
 soon known steed damsel dear
 whose charms flame kindled meet eye
 ensued haughty pair
 another canto shall declare


 canto 2

 argument
 hermit parts means hollow sprite
 two redoubted rivals' dangerous play
 rinaldo goes love hope invite
 dispatched charles another way
 bradamont seeking devoted knight
 good rogero nigh becomes prey
 pinabel drops damsel brave
 dungeon living grave



 injurious love still mar accord
 desires thy favourite feat
 please thee perfidious lord
 two hearts different measure beat
 thou wilt let take certain ford
 dragging stream deep fleet
 abandon love desires
 hates respect love inspires

 ii
 thou rinaldo show'st damsel fair
 seems hideous gentle dame
 lady's pride care
 paid back deepest hate amorous flame
 pines victim despair
 scorned turn reward
 changed damsel sort abhorred
 would choose death hated lord

 iii
 pagan cries "forego thy theft
 false felon pilfer'd steed
 wont let reft
 seeks dearly pays deed
  shall take thee yon lovely weft
 leave thee prize foul misdeed
 horse maid whose worth outstrips belief
 ill methinks relinquished thief"

 iv
 "thou liest" haughty saracen retorts
 proud burning fierce flame
 "a thief thyself fame truth reports
 let good deeds decide dubious claim
 steed damsel fair assorts
 best proved valiant deeds though dame
 nothing precious thee
 search wide world throughout may well agree"

 v
 two fierce dogs somtimes stand gaze
 hate springs strife inspire
 grind teeth foe surveys
 sidelong glance eyes red fire
 either falls bites hoarsely bays
 stiff bristles stand end ire
 reproach menace sword
 pass sacripant clermont's angry lord

 vi
 thus kindling wrath knights engage
 one foot horse
 small gain inexperienced page
 would better rein charger course
 baiardo's sense wage
 war master put force
 voice hand manage stir
 rebellious rein goading spur

 vii
 king would urge takes rest
 curbs runs giddy rings
 drops head beneath spreading chest
 plays spine runs anend flings
 furious saracen distressed
 sees 'tis time tame beast springs
 one hand pummel ground
 clear restless courser bound

 viii
 soon sacripant welltimed leap
 fury bayardo freed
 may believe battle sleep
 champions matched heart deed
 sounding blades changeful measure keep
 hammerstrokes vulcan less speed
 descend dim cavern heats
 jove's red thunders anvil beats

 ix
 sometimes lunge feign thrust parry
 deep masters desperate game play
 rise upon furious stroke carry
 swords aloft stoop stand bay
 close exhausted tarry
 hide show give way
 one knight inch ground granted
 foeman's foot upon inch planted

 x
 lo rinaldo impatient grown
 strikes full sacripant lifted blade
 puts forth buckler made bone
 well strong stubborn steel inlaid
 though passing thick fusberta cleaves groan
 greenwood covert close sunny glade
 paynim's arm rings senseless blow
 steel bone like ice shivers go

 xi
 fair damsel saw timid eye
 ruin follow faulchion's sway
 like criminal whose doom nigh
 changed fair countenance sore dismay
 deemed little time left fly
 would rinaldo's prey
 rinaldo loathed much
 doats scornful damsel miserably

 xii
 turned horse gloomy chase
 drove rough path tangled ally
 oftentimes bent back bloodless face
 saw rinaldo thicket sally
 flying long urged frantic race
 met hermit valley
 devotion aspect expressed
 long beard descended breast

 xiii
 wasted much fasts age
 ass mounted slow sure
 visage warranted never sage
 conscience precise passing pure
 though arteries time stilled rage
 blood spake feeble demure
 sight delighted damsel
 inly stirred charity

 xiv
 lady prayed kindly friar
 would straight conduct near
 land france might flee
 never loathed rinaldo hear
 hermit skilled sorcery
 ceased soothe gentle damsel's fear
 promise deliverance shook
 pocket drew forth secret book

 xv
 opened quick mighty marvel wrought
 leaf finished sage
 spirit bidding brought
 waits command likeness page
 magic writ constrained taught
 hastes warriors face face engage
 cool shade  cool disport 
 steps stops battle short

 xvi
 "in courtesy" cried "let either show
 foe's death either avail
 guerdon conquest bestow
 battle shall prevail
 roland though struck blow
 snapt fight single link mail
 paristown conveys damsel gay
 engaged bitter fray

 xvii
 "within easy mile saw peer
 pricking paris lady bright
 riding merry mood laugh jeer
 mocking fierce fruitless fight
 sure better yet near
 follow peer damsel flight
 paris place prize
 lady never shall meet eyes"

 xviii
 might seen angry cavaliers
 change demon's tale rage shame
 curse wanting eyes ears
 let rival cheat dame
 towards horse good rinaldo steers
 breathing forth piteous sighs seem flame
 joins orlando  ere part 
 swears fury heart

 xix
 passing prompt bayardo stood
 leaps back leaves swift wind
 without farewell rival wood
 much less invites seat behind
 goaded charger heat blood
 forces whate'er eager course confined
 ditch river tangled thorn marble block
 swims river clears rock

 xx
 let sir sound strangely ear
 rinaldo took steed thus readily
 long vainly followed far near
 endued reasoning faculty
 vice lured following peer
 fled cherished lord
 might guide whither went gentle dame
 heard nursed flame

 xxi
 angelica random dread
 pavilion winged rapid flight
 bayardo marked damsel fled
 saddle lightened mount alban's knight
 foot equal combat sped
 matched baron meaner might
 chased maid woods floods strands
 hopes place warrior's hands

 xxii
 desire bring maid
 gallopped still rampant play
 would let master mount afraid
 might make take another way
 luring rinaldo shade
 twice brought unexpected prey
 twice foiled endeavour bold
 ferrau sacripant lately told

 xxiii
 good bayardo believed tiding
 fair damsel produced accord
 devil's cunning tale confiding
 renewed wonted service lord
 behold rinaldo fury riding
 pushing still courser parisward
 though fly fast champion's wishes go
 faster wind seemed slow

 xxiv
 night rinaldo rests steed pain
 meet anglante's lord burned sore
 lent credit tidings vain
 false courier wizard hoar
 day next flowing rein
 rode till royal city rose
 eyes charlemagne taken post
 sad remnant broken host

 xxv
 fears afric king's pursuit
 sap siege upon vassals calls
 gather fresh victual recruit
 cleanse ditches repair walls
 may best annoy foes suit
 safety without delay forestalls
 plans embassy england thence
 gather fresher forces defence

 xxvi
 bent try fate
 arms tented field though lately shamed
 send rinaldo neighbouring state
 britain england named
 ill liked paladin cross strait
 people land blamed
 king charles sudden day
 would grant valiant envoy delay

 xxvii
 rinaldo never executed thing
 less willingly prevented quest
 fair visage following
 whose charms heart ravished breast
 yet obediance christian king
 prepared royal hest
 calais good envoy wends speed
 day embarks steed

 xxviii
 scorn cautious pilot's skill
 impatience regain home
 launched doubtful sea boded ill
 rolled heavy billows white foam
 wind enraged opposed
 stirred waves 'mid gathering gloom
 loud storm tempest's fury grew
 topmasthigh flashing waters flew

 xxix
 watchful mariners wary sort
 haul mainsail attempt wear
 would put back panic port
 whence ill hour loosed little care
  "not so" exclaims wind stops short
 "so poor penance pay dare"
 fain would veer fiercer roar
 pelts back reeling prow blusters

 xxx
 starboard larboard bears fitful gale
 never thought ire assuages
 strained vessel drives humble sail
 billows tempest rages
 still pursue varying tale
 must leave awhile paladin wages
 weary warfare wind flood
 follow fair virgin blood

 xxxi
 speak famed damsel whose spear
 o'erthrown king sacripant earth flung
 worthy sister valiant peer
 beatrix good duke aymon sprung
 daring deeds puissance less dear
 charlemagne france since proved among
 first prowess tried many test
 equal good rinaldo's shone confessed

 xxxii

 rogero valiant father's name
 mother child agolant

 disdained child love plant
 though cruel fortune ill wishes meeting
 granted pair single greeting

 xxxiii

 named owed birth
 roved safe company
 thousands trusting single worth
 made king circassy
 salute visage old mother earth
 traversed wood wood past mountain
 stopt length beside lovely fountain

 xxxiv
 delicious mead fountainrill
 ancient trees o'ershaded glides away
 whose ear pleasing murmurs fill
 invites drink banks stay
 left side cultivated hill

 first damsel thither turns eyes
 youthful cavalier seated spies

 xxxv
 cavalier underneath shade
 seems lost melancholy dream
 bank gaudy flowers displayed
 reposing overhangs crystal stream
 horse beneath spreading beech laid
 bough shield helmet gleam
 moist eyes sad downcast air
 speak broken victim despair

 xxxvi
 urged passion lodged every breast
 restless curiosity know
 others' cares gentle maid addressed
 knight sought occasion woe
 secret grief confessed
 gentle speech courteous show

 xxxvii
 "fair sir band horse foot" said
 "i brought charlemagne thither pressed
 ambush marsilius spread
 descending pyrenean crest

 xxxviii
 "the robber whether man shade

 "but like one bleeding side

 left good squadrons masterless ride
 along cliffs passes least forlorn
 took way love served guide
 appeared ruthless thief born

 xli
 "six days rode morn setting sun
 horrid cliff bottom dark drear
 giddy precipice path none

 caverned mountains rude cliffs appear
 middle rose rugged block

 xlii
 "from far shone like flame seemed dight

 xliii
 "each polished turret shines ray
 defies mouldering rust rain
 robber scours country night day

 pursued curses threats vain
 fruitless every hope foil art
 felon keeps love oh say heart

 xliv
 "alas left eye

 like shefox hears offspring cry
 standing beneath ravening eagle's nest
 since wings rise fly
 runs round rugged rock hopeless quest

 xlv
 "while lingered rocks aspire
 saw dwarf guide two goodly strain
 whose coming added hope desire
 alas desire hope alike vain
 barons bold fearful ire

 trust god make treason clear
 show accused foul intent
 polinesso greedy severe
 proud held false fraudulent
 none assembled deemed
 marvel knight fraud schemed

 lxxxviii
 false polinesso mien distressed
 pallid cheek heart thickly beat
 third trumpet laid lance rest
 well rinaldo spurred knight meet
 levelled evil foeman's breast
 eager finish single heat
 counter wish event
 since warrior half weapon went

 lxxxix
 breast impaled upon spear
 six yards beyond horse bore
 speed alighted mount albano's peer
 ere rose unlaced helm wore
 mercy prayed humble cheer
 unfit strive joust warfare
 king court faltering breath
 confessed fraud brought death

 xc

 pangs death failing accents drown
 prince ended saw daughter's woes
 redeemed death scorn virtue shown
 delight rapture overflows
 lost kingly crown
 saw first upon head replaced
 good rinaldo singly graced

 xci
 uplifted casque displaid

 thanks god lifted hands paid
 deigned succour provide
 cavalier bared blade
 unknown upon geneura's side

 good intent justly due
 stranger long earnest prayer

 canto 6

 argument
 ariodantes worthy meed
 loved bride fief albany
 meantime rogero flying steed
 arrives false alcina's empery
 myrtletree every deed
 human myrtle hears treachery
 thence would go first withdrew
 one strife engage new



 wretched evil man lives trust
 secret sin safe possession
 since nought else air dust
 crime buried makes confession
 oftentimes guilt compels unjust
 though sometime unarraigned worldly session
 accuser bewray
 god willed deeds hidden day

 ii
 unhappy polinesso hopes nursed
 wholly secret treason conceal
 taking dalinda versed
 could fact reveal
 adding thus second first
 offence hurried dread appeal
 haply stunned least deferred
 selfdestruction blindly spurred

 iii
 forfeited estate life love
 friends honour
 cavalier unknown said
 long king court entreated sore
 length covering helmet remove
 showed visage often seen
 cherished face ariodantes true
 late lamented weeping scotland

 iv
 ariodantes tearful eye
 brother geneura wept dead
 king people nobility
 light goodness valour shed
 pilgrim therefore might appear lie
 missing warrior said
 yet true headland
 seen plunge foaming sea

 v
 oft befalls despairing wight
 grisly death desires till appear
 loathes sought nearer sight
 painful seems cruel pass drear
 thus sea engulphed wretched knight
 repentant deed touched fear
 matchless spirit hand
 beat back billows returned land

 vi
 despising folly bred
 fond desire death impell
 thence soaked dripping wet way tread
 halted hermit's humble cell
 housed within holy father's shed
 secretly awhile designed dwell
 till ears rumour voiced
 geneura sorrowed rejoiced

 vii
 first heard excess woe
 miserable damsel wellnigh died
 abroad doleful tidings go
 'twas talked island far wide
 far proof deceitful show
 cruel grief thought spied
 next fair geneura heard
 lurcanio sire charge preferred

 viii
 brother felt less enmity
 love lately bore maid
 foul full cruelty
 esteemed deed although essayed
 hearing jeopardy
 none appeared lend damsel aid
 puissant lurcanio's might
 dreaded encounter knight

 ix
 well youthful champion knew
 believed wary discreet
 related untrue
 never would risqued rash feat
  greater part fight eschew
 fearing wrongful cause knight meet 
 ariodantes long doubts weighed
 meet brother geneura's aid

 x
 "alas said cannot bear see
 thus cause royal damsel die
 death bitter dread would
 death descry
 still lady divinity
  light comfort eye
 right wrong cannot choose shield
 safety perish field

 xi
 "i know choose wrong
 cause shall die would move
 alas death well know
 lovely dame's destruction prove
 death one comfort go
 polinesso bears love
 manifestly displayed
 hitherto moves aid

 xii
 "and wronged maid shall view
 encounter death defence
 brother flames discord blew
 shall pay debt vengeance due
 well ween make lurcanio rue
 informed event cruelty
 thought venge brand
 slain hand"

 xiii
 concluded thought
 made new provision arms steed shield
 black vest buckler bought
 green yellow striped sable field
 hazard found squire brought
 stranger country concealed
 already told unhappy knight
 brother came prepared fight

 xv
 yielding natural inclination
 suit court beside
 mostly rinaldo's instigation
 assigned youth damsel bride
 albany's duchy sequestration
 late polinesso's duel died
 could forfeited happier hour
 since monarch made daughter's dower

 xvi
 rinaldo dalinda mercy
 fault's due punishment went free
 satiate world shun
 damsel vowed god flee
 hence denmark's land live nun
 straight native scotland sailed sea
 time rogero pursue
 courser posts welkin

 xvii
 although rogero constant mind
 cheek wonted hues depart
 ween faster leaf i' wind
 fluttered within breast stripling's heart
 europe's region left behind
 swift course issuing part
 passed mighty space southern sound
 great alcides fixed sailor's bound

 xviii
 hippogryph huge fowl strange sight
 bears warrior rapid wing
 would distanced airy flight
 thunder bearing bird aether's king
 living creature soars height
 mighty swiftness equalling
 scarce believe bolt lightning flies
 darts swiftly parted skies

 xix
 huge bird pinions long plied
 straight line without one stoop bend
 tired air sweeping wheel wide
 began upon island descend
 like fair region whither long unspied
 wayward mood long offend
 whilom vain strange secret sluice
 passed sea virgin arethuse

 xx
 delightful place wherever hurled
 whole air rogero found
 ranged universal world
 would seen lovelier round
 wheeling wide courser furled
 spreading wings lighted ground
 'mid cultivated plain delicious hill
 moist meadow shady bank crystal rill

 xxi
 small thickets scented laurel gay
 cedar orange full fruit flower
 myrtle palm interwoven spray
 pleached mixed modes lovely form bower
 breaking shade scorching ray
 make cool shelter noontide hour
 nightingales among branches wing
 flight safely amorous descants sing

 xxii
 amid red roses white lilies
 soft breezes freshen fly
 secure cony haunts timid hare
 stag branching forehead broad high
 fearless hunter's dart snare
 feed ease ruminating lie
 swarming wilds tuft steep
 dun deer nimble goat disporting leap

 xxiii
 hyppogryph island hung
 approached nigh landscape fair
 rider saddle sprung
 might leap little danger dare
 rogero lit grass flowers among
 held lest remount air
 myrtle nigh rolling brine
 made fast baytree pine

 xxiv

 drops shield helmet front
 uplifts either hand gauntlet free
 turning beach mount
 catches gales blow hill sea
 joyous murmur lightly stir
 lofty top beech feathery fir

 xxv
 bathe burning lips strains
 dabbles crystal wave chase
 scorching heat rages veins
 caught heavy corslet's burning case
 marvel burden pains
 ramble square marketplace
 three thousand miles without repose went
 still speed ponderous armour pent

 xxvi
 meanwhile courser myrtle's side
 left stabled cool retreat
 started something wood descried
 scared know heat
 made myrtle shake tied
 brought shower leaves feet
 made myrtle shake foliage fall
 struggling could loose withal

 xxvii
 stick feed chimney rent
 scanty pith ill fills narrow sheath
 vapour little channel pent
 struggles tormented fire beneath
 till prisoned fury find vent
 heard hiss bubble sing seethe
 offended myrtle inly pined
 groaned murmured last unclosed rind

 xxviii
 hence clear intelligible speech
 thus issued melancholy sound
 "if thy cheer gentle presence teach
 thou courteous art good reign unbound
 release monster beseech
 griefs inflict sufficient wound
 need compassed ills
 new pain plague without"

 xxix
 first sound rogero turns see
 whence came voice unused surprise

 canto 10

 argument
 another love assails bireno's breast
 leaves one night olympia shore
 logistilla's holy realm addressed
 rogero goes heeds alcina
 flying courser repossest
 hippogryph airy voyage bore
 whence good rinaldo's levy sees
 next angelica beholds frees



 loves fidelity
 yet proved constant hearts true
 lovers felicity
 sorrow faithful found famous crew
 olympia would give first degree
 rather second due
 well may say tale told
 truer love present times old

 ii
 many proofs clear
 made apparent zealand lord
 woman's faith certain could appear
 man though open heart explored
 fair truth spirits endear
 mutual love deserve reward
 bireno nay
 say kind olympia love

 iii
 nevermore deceive
 another woman
 made europe wide asia grieve
 fairer yet one fair
 rather quit light leave
 sweet taste touch hear see
 life fame beside aught
 precious truth styled thought

 iv
 bireno loved loved
 bireno love repay
 faith like still truth unmoved
 veered shifting sail another way
 ingrate service  cruel proved
 fair love faith say
 lips comprest eyebrows bent
 shall listen tale wonderment

 v
 shall heard impiety
 passing goodness meed
 woman take warning perfidy
 let none make lover's word creed
 mindless god things hear see
 lover eager desires speed
 heaps promises vows aye prompt swear
 afterwards winds disperse air

 vi
 promises empty vows dispersed
 air winds dissipated go
 lovers greedy thirst
 appeased fevered palates glow
 example offer versed
 prayers tears credit slow
 cheaply dear ladies mine wisdom bought
 wit other's cost taught

 vii
 first flower youth beware
 whose visage soft smooth sight
 past soon bred fancies
 like straw fire every appetite
 keen hunter follows hare
 heat cold shore mountainheight
 'tis taken esteems prize
 hurries flies

 viii
 practise striplings
 time treat austerity
 love revere homage
 pay service faithfully
 vaunt sooner victory
 mistresses shall servants grieve
 mourn see fickle love owed
 diverted elsewhere bestowed

 ix
 wrong opine
 cease love without
 lover like uncultivated vine
 would prop wind
 first pray decline
 fly volatile inconstant rout
 make choice riper fruits among
 yet gather long hung

 x
 daughter found said
 proud king ruled friesland state
 bireno's brother wed
 far rumour tells relate
 truth longing bireno bred
 sight food passing delicate
 talk palate deemed would
 other's sake foolish courtesy

 xi
 gentle damsel past fourteen
 beautiful fresh like rose
 first opening bud seen
 vernal sun expands grows
 say bireno loved youthful queen
 little less blaze lit tinder glows
 ripened corn wherever envious hand
 foe amid grain cast brand

 xii
 bireno's bosom fed
 marrow burned weeping sore
 fate unhappy father dead
 saw bathed ceaseless tears deplore
 cold water cauldron shed
 shops short bubbling wave boiled
 raging rife olympia blew
 within breast extinguished new

 xiii
 feels bireno mere satiety
 loathes ill endures sight
 hope long deferred die
 fickle appetite
 yet till day prefixed satisfy
 fond desire feigns wary knight
 olympia less love adore
 seems pleasure explore

 xiv
 much caress
 cannot caress none
 see evil deed rather guess
 pity goodness done
 since raise comfort distress
 fortune's wheel beats changeful run
 never blamed glory oftener paid
  much young  harmless maid

 xv
 almighty god fallible vain
 human judgment dimmed clouds obscure
 bireno's actions impious profane
 others reputed pure
 already stooping oars train
 loosed vessel port secure
 duke companions steer

 left astern descried
 since shun friesland larboard hawl
 keep course nigh scottish shore
 overtaken squall

 soon harboured hight
 olympia landed board spread
 contented faithless knight
 supt unsuspecting cause dread
 thence bireno tent pight
 pleasant place repaired went bed
 others train returned abroad
 rested ship moored

 xviii
 fear late sea sorrow weighed
 long upon dame broke rest
 finding safe greenwood shade
 removed noise tranquil breast
 knowing lover beside laid
 thoughts cares molest
 olympia lap slumber profound
 sheltered bear dormouse sleeps sound

 xix
 lover false hatching treason lies
 stole bed silence knew
 slept clothes bundle ties
 raiment body threw
 issuing forth pavilion hies
 newborn wings towards crew
 roused unmoor without cry
 commands loosen thence put sea

 xx
 behind land left pine
 olympia yet slept woods among
 till gilded wheels frosty rhine
 aurora upon earth beneath flung
 old woe beside tumbling brine
 lamenting halcyons mournful descant sung
 'twixt sleep waking made strain
 reach loved bireno vain

 xxi
 one found dame arm withdrew
 tried yet one found spread
 arms sought anew
 either leg yet better sped
 fear banished sleep oped eyes view
 nothing widowed bed
 would keep couch fury sprung
 headlong forth pavilion flung

 xxii
 seaward ran visage tearing sore
 presaging certain plight
 beat bosom tresses tore
 looked moon shining might
 discover thing beside shore
 save shore thing sight
 calls bireno caverns round
 pitying grief bireno's name rebound

 xxiii
 far shore rose rock
 scooped breaker's beating frequently
 cliff hollowed underneath show
 arch overhung foaming sea
 olympia mind vigour bestow
 sprang frowning crest impetuously
 distance stretched favouring gale
 thence saw cruel lord's departing sail

 xxiv
 saw seemed see ill eyes
 things air yet dim hazy view
 falls alltrembling ground lies
 face snow cold white hue
 found strength rise
 guiding voice towards bark flew
 calling might unhappy dame
 calls often cruel consort's name

 xxv
 unavailing feeble note
 wept clapt hands agony
 "without freight" cried "thy ship float
  cruel dost thou fly swiftly 
 receive well  small hinderance thy boat
 bears spirit would body be"
 raiment waving hand
 signed frigate return land

 xxvi
 loud wind sweeping ocean bears
 faithless stripling's sail across deep
 bears well shriek moan prayers
 sad olympia sorrowing steep
 thrice cruel dame prepares
 high rock amid waves leap
 water lifts length sight
 returns passed night

 xxvii
 stretched bed upon face lay
 bathing tears "last night thee
 together two found shelter" say
 "alas two together
 rising false bireno cursed day
 born remains
 done  alone betrayed 
 console afford aid

 xxviii
 "nor man see see work shows
 man inhabits isle
 see ship refuge woes
 embarking hence may hope fly
 shall starve one close
 eyes give sepulture
 save wolf perchance roves wood tomb
 give alas voracious womb

 xxix
 "i live terror appear see

 reproach therefore deal thee punishment
 well story dost thou know

 xxxiii
 "oh may escape wild corsair
 taken sold slave
 rather may lion wolf bear
 tiger beast fiercer rave
 claws rushes rend tear
 drag bleeding body cave"
 saying golden hair offends
 lock lock scattered tresses rends

 xxxiv
 shore's extremest verge anew
 tossing head hair dishevelled run
 seemed like maid beside
 ten fiends possessed instead one
 like frantic hecuba view
 murdered polydore infant son
 fixed stone gazed upon sea
 less real stone seemed stone

 xxxv
 let grieve till return show
 child wish weary way
 rogero noon's intensest glow
 takes shore burning sunbeams play
 upon hill thence rebound
 boils white sand heated ray
 little wanting journey dire
 arms wears fire

 xxxvi
 warrior thirst labour sore
 still toiling heavy sand
 pursued path along sunny shore
 irksome displeasing company
 beneath shadow turret hoar
 rose beside beach amid sea
 found three ladies alcina's court
 distinguished dress port

 xxxvii
 reclined alexandrian carpets rare
 ladies joyed cool great delight
 various wines vessels
 every sort comfit nicely dight
 fast sporting ripple
 lay waiting needs pinnace light
 breeze fill sail anew
 breath upon waters blew

 xxxviii
 beheld along shifting sand
 rogero wend upon way intent
 saw thirst figured lips scanned
 troubled visage sweat besprent
 began pray `on hand

 cool grateful shade

 xxxix
 hold stirrup one approaching near
 would aid alight bore
 cup chrystal cavalier
 foaming wine raised thirst

 xli
 loud could raise voice said
 "thou art gentle art thou knight
 hast arms horse conveyed
 never could thine better right
 thy theft well guess appaid
 death may worthily requite
 foul thief churl haughty ingrate may thee
 burned gibbeted cut quarters see"

 xlii
 beside injurious cries
 proud damsel warrior throws
 though taunts rogero nought replies
 weens small fame contest flows
 sisters frigate hies
 waits aboard tender goes
 plying fast oars pursues knight
 along sandy beach still kept sight

 xliii
 threat curse ever cried
 whose tongue collected still fresh cause blame
 meanwhile lovelier fairy's side
 passage lay across straight came
 ancient ferryman espied
 put shore punctual aim
 forewarned well prepared seer
 waited coming cavalier

 xliv
 ferryman put forth child meet
 bear better shore rejoicing
 appeared benign discreet
 heart face warranty
 giving god thanks rogero took seat
 aboard bark passed quiet sea
 discoursing ancient pilot fraught
 wisdom long experience taught

 xlv
 praised rogero much fled

 lover's final guerdon evermore
 next logistilla sped
 duly witness holy lore

 xlvi
 "her shall struck wonderment revere"
 said "when first shall behold fay
 better contemplate lofty cheer

 love differs fear
 hope bosom prey
 desire demands aught beside
 blessing seen satisfied

 xlvii
 "you shall nobler studies professed
 tutored bath costly fare
 song dance perfumes fashioned best
 thoughts may tower high hawks air

 speaking yet distant shore
 safe bank approached pilot hoar

 xlviii
 beholds forthissuing strand
 fleet ships towards steer
 came wronged alcina band
 many vassals gathered far near
 risk ruin land
 repossess thing held dear
 love light cause incites dame aggrieved
 less bitter injury received

 xlix
 choler never felt
 upon bosom fed
 hence made followers ply oar
 till white foam either bank shed
 deafening noise din o'er sea shore
 echo every repeated spread
 "now  rogero bare magic shield
 strife slain basely yield"

 l
 thus logistilla's pilot beside
 saying seized pouch wherein dight
 buckler covering torn aside
 exposed open view shining light
 enchanted splendor flashing far wide
 sore offends adversaries' sight
 vessels drop amazed blind
 tumbling prow poop behind

 li
 one stood sentry citadel
 descried navy invading dame
 backwards rang castle larumbell
 whence speedy succours came
 artillery rained like storm whose fury fell
 would rogero scathe shame
 aid brought strife
 saved warrior's liberty life

 lii
 four ladies arrived upon strand
 thither logistilla sped haste
 leagued valiant anrondica stand

 sofrosina

 conspicuous flames forth issues fort
 matchless host files towards port

 liii
 beneath castle safe wind swell
 many ships stout squadron lay
 harbour sound bell 
 word fit action night day
 thus land sea battle fell
 furious waged part either fay
 whence alcina's realm turned upside
 usurped sister's crown

 liv
 oh many battles success
 different hoped
 failed dame repossess
 thought lover flying shore
 ships even numberless
 ample ocean scarce navy bore
 vessels flames prey
 one bark escaped wretched fay

 lv
 alcina flies sad troop around
 routed taken burnt sunk remains
 lost rogero sorrow profound
 wakes breast pains
 bitter tears ever drowned
 child's loss night day complains
 bent end woes many sigh
 often laments cannot die

 lvi
 fairy dies overhead

 haply like gorgeous queen nile
 mortal slumber would closed eye
 fairies cannot pleasure die

 lvii
 return eternal fame due
 leaving alcina trouble sore
 speak valorous rogero
 disembarked upon safer shore
 turned back upon waters blue
 giving god thanks pious lore
 dry ground landed made repair
 towards lofty castle planted

 lviii
 stronger bright show
 never yet mortal sight
 viewed stones ramparts glow
 rich carbuncle diamond bright
 like gems discourse
 would nature read aright
 must thither speed none elsewhere ween
 except perhaps heaven seen

 lix

 lx

 marvellous gems skill

 lxi

 next damsel giant bears
 beneath arm bride rogero true
 beholds orlando shore repairs
 fell orc many damsels slew
 olympia frees spoils beast life
 afterwards oberto takes wife



 although feeble rein mid career
 oft suffice stop courageous horse
 'tis seldom reason's bit serve steer
 desire turn furious course
 pleasure reach like headstrong bear
 honeyed meal 'tis ill force

 hurried fruitless speed
 recalled ring thought
 foiled astounded cursed little heed
 vanished lady sought
 ungrateful discourteous deed
 accusing stood wherewith repaid
 unfitting recompense generous aid

 viii
 "ungrateful damsel pay
 render service done" said
 "why rather would steal ring away
 welcome gift

 shield courser shall
 conceal beauteous cheer
 cruel though answering know hear"

 ix
 saying like one blind bootless care
 feeling way fount strayed
 often embraced empty air
 hoping embraced maid
 meanwhile far removed flying fair
 halted till cave conveyed
 formed mountain harbour rude
 spacious need supplied food

 x
 'twas aged herdsman one tended
 numerous troop mares made
 seeking pasture valley wended
 green grass fed freshening run
 stalls either side cave defended
 charge oppressive noontide sun
 angelica within livelong day
 unseen prying eyes prolonged stay

 xi
 evening refreshed rest
 food deemed course might renew
 certain rustic weeds body dressed

 pursued way towards spacious vale

 waging fierce fight close straightened place

 field lay horse already dead
 rogero paused strife attended
 straight wishes leant towards knight
 would fain see conqueror fight

 xviii

 behold cruel strife stood nigh
 lo twohanded stroke giant made

 canto 12

 argument
 orlando full rage pursues knight
 bears force ladylove away
 comes old atlantes sleight
 raised dome rogero stay
 rogero comes getting sight
 lost love county strives fray
 fierce ferrau slaughter fell
 amid paynim host finds isabel



 ceres idaean dame haste
 returning lonely valley
 enceladus aetnaean mountain placed
 boltsmitten flanks doomed bear
 girl found pathless waste
 late quitted rent hair
 marked cheeks eyes breast livid signs
 end lament tore two pines

 ii
 lit vulcan's fire double brand
 gave virtue never spent
 afterwards one either hand
 drawn two dragons chariot went
 searching forest hill level land
 field valley running stream water pent
 land sea searched shell
 earth descended hell

 iii
 roland eleusis' deity
 sovereign power possessed less
 angelica land sea
 ransacked wood field pool rill

 thence castiles old new
 passing libya spain
 bold orlando plan view
 hears thinks hears voice complain
 forward spurs sees mighty steed
 warrior trot mead

 v
 arms captive damsel bears
 sore grieving across pommel laid
 weeps struggles semblance wears
 cruel woe ever calls aid
 upon anglantes' prince appears
 surveys youthful maid
 night day ceaseless pain
 inside france searched vain

 vi
 say sight
 seems angelica loves dear
 ladylove goddess' flight
 beholds borne afflicted cheer
 impelled fury foul angry spite
 calls back horrid voice cavalier
 calls back cavalier threats vain
 brigliadoro drives flowing rein

 vii
 felon stops replies
 great gain intent glorious prey
 swiftness greenwood hies
 wind would overtake way
 one pursues flies
 lament resounds thicket gray
 issue spacious mead
 appears lofty mansion rare rich

 viii
 various marbles wrought subtle care
 proud palace fast hold
 bears upon arm damsel fair
 sore pricking enters gate gold
 brigliador far behind pair
 backed orlando angry knight bold
 entering around orlando turns eyes
 yet neither cavalier damsel spies

 ix
 suddenly dismounts thundering fares
 inmost palace seeking still foe
 restless rage repairs
 till seen bower galleried row
 purpose ascends stairs
 first vainly searched room
 spends less labour task intent
 beneath vainly spent

 x
 beds seen adorned silk gold
 partition aught spied wall
 floor beneath throughout hold
 hid curtains carpets
 returns orlando bold
 yet glad eyes bower hall
 appearance royal maid
 foul thief conveyed

 xi
 fruitless pain
 moves oppressed thought trouble sore
 gradasso brandimart spain
 ferrau finds sacripant
 ever toiling like vain
 building beneath explore
 wander curse one accord
 malice castle's viewless lord

 xii
 pursuit offender speed
 upon charge robbery lay
 one knight complains stolen steed
 one purloined lady gay
 accuses deed
 thus within enchanted cage stay
 depart palace pent
 many weeks months together spent

 xiii
 roland round strange dome paced
 four times six still vainly seeking said
 within last "i might waste
 time trouble still vain delayed
 haply robber chased
 far away gate conveyed"
 thinking house issued
 mead girt dome

 xiv
 roland wanders round sylvan hall
 still holding close visage ground
 see recent print trace withal
 right left upon turf found
 neighbouring window hears call
 looks thinks hears voice's sound
 thinks sees visage
 estranged wont

 xv
 thinks hears angelica
 "help help" entreating cries weeping sore
 "more life soul alas thee
 protection honour implore
 shall roland's presence
 ravished foul robber oh
 miserable fate leave
 let hand death receive"

 xvi
 words repeated yet
 made roland chamber far near
 return passion utmost pain
 tempered high hope sometimes peer
 stopt search heard voice complain
 seemed angelica's
 restless warrior stand sounds
 calls help knows whence

 xvii
 returning rogero left said
 gloomy path upon steed
 following giant dame fled
 wood issued mead
 say arrived roland dread
 arrived rightly read
 giant golden portal passed
 rogero close behind followed fast

 xviii
 soon foot lifted o'er
 threshold court gallery spies
 sees giant lady
 vainly glances eyes
 returns labour sore
 yet longing satisfies
 imagine felon thief
 hid dame space brief

 xix
 four times five wound
 bower gallery fair
 yet returned nothing found
 searched even space beneath stair
 length hope woodlands round
 might sallied voice
 roland recalled less recall
 made well return within hall

 xx
 one voice one shape anglantes' peer
 seemed angelica beseeching aid
 seemed rogero dordogne's lady dear
 truant made
 gradasso near
 spake palace strayed
 vision seen apart
 seemed singly heart

 xxi
 new unwonted spell
 renowned atlantes composed
 toil pleasing pain might dwell
 long rogero walls enclosed
 pass away influence fell
  influence early death exposed
 though vain magic tower steel vain
 alcina's art atlantes plots

 xxii
 others stood high
 valour france greatest fame
 hands rogero might die
 brought old atlantes' magic came
 enchanted mansion lie
 food wanting knight dame
 supplied dome throughout well
 inmates plenty dwell

 xxiii
 angelica return
 ring wondrous repossessed
 mouth concealed maid view
 preserved spell finger pressed
 mountaincavern guided
 whatever needed viands mare vest
 conceived project pursue
 way fair indian realm anew

 xxiv
 king sacripant roland willingly
 damsel would taken guide
 propitious wishes
 averse inclined either side
 since eastern journey
 town city scattered far wide
 needed company ill found
 trusty guides round

 xxv
 sought fruitless care
 lit either warrior's trace
 city farm
 forest place
 fortune length caged roland
 ferrau sacripant directs chase
 rogero gradasso fierce
 noosed strange witcheries atlantes hoar

 xxvi
 enters hidden enchanter's eyes
 ring concealed examines
 roland sacripant espies
 intent seek vainly hall
 image cheating descries
 atlantes old damsel doubts withal
 two take long revolves
 doubtful thought well resolves

 xxvii
 knows best accord
 count orlando circassia's knight
 powers would rogero ward
 passage perilous better might
 make peer guide lord
 knew champion could slight
 would depress altered cheer
 france send back cavalier

 xxviii
 sacripant pleasure could depose
 though uplifted sky
 hence alone escort chose
 feigned trust fidelity
 ring mouth withdraws shows
 face unveiled circassian's eye
 thought alone fierce ferrau
 roland came upon maid saw

 xxix
 ferrau roland came upon maid
 one champion equally
 within palace without strayed
 quest deity
 longer enchantment stayed
 ran alike towards dame
 placed ring upon hand anew
 old atlantes' every scheme o'erthrew

 xxx
 helm head corselet breast
 knights sing tied
 night day since rest
 entered never doffed laid aside
 wear easy vest
 wont burden abide
 well armed except iron masque
 ferrau wore would wear casque

 xxxi
 till erst wrested peer
 orlando brother troyane
 sworn spanish cavalier
 time argalia's helm vain
 sought brook yet though count near
 stretched forth hand prize gain
 neither pair
 could recognise knight

 xxxii
 upon enchanted dome lay spell
 one another concealed
 doffed night day corselet's shell
 sword even put aside shield
 saddled bridle hanging sell
 steeds feeding ready field
 within chamber near palace door
 straw barley heaped plenteous store

 xxxiii
 might mean old atlantes lies
 stop knights mounting repair
 good steeds chase bright black eyes
 fair vermillion cheeks golden hair
 sweet damsel flies
 goads better speed panting mare
 ill pleased three assembled discern
 though haply taken turn

 xxxiv
 magic palace
 ticed far supposed
 warriors wicked fallacy
 malign enchanter exposed
 ring misery
 rescued 'twixt lips enclosed
 hence sight vanished thought
 left wondering like men distraught

 xxxv
 although first scheme entertained
 roland sacripant released
 guide thither father reigned
 king galaphron ruled i' farthest east
 aid suddenly disdained
 instant project ceased
 deemed without debt count king
 place either knight sufficed ring

 xxxvi
 haste forest
 scorned still gaze stupid face
 like questing hound loses sight hare
 fox late pursued trace
 close thicket ditch narrow lair
 escaping keen pursuer's chase
 meantime ways wanton indian queen
 observes wonder laughs unseen

 xxxvii
 mid wood maid lose
 single pathway left right
 believed damsel could choose
 follow vanished sight
 ferrau halts roland fast pursues
 sacripant less plies rowels bright
 angelica retrains steed
 follows three warriors less speed

 xxxviii
 pricking thus came way
 forest lost wood o'ergrown
 begun herbage survey
 print recent footsteps
 fierce ferrau might borne away
 ever proudest crown
 evil countenance two
 turned shouted "whence you"

 xxxix
 "turn back take another road save
 truth covet slain
 chase woo lady dear
 let think bear company"
  "what could say sir cavalier"
 orlando cried sacripant "if
 known two basest whores pull
 reel spindlestaff matted wool"

 xl
 turning ferrau "but thine head
 thou brutish sot behold bare
 thy late words ill wisely said
 thou should'st perceive fare"
 ferrau "for breeds dread
 should'st thou take sovereign care
 said unhelmed prove true
 single you"

 xli
 "oh" circassia's king cried roland dread
 "thy morion man let entreat
 till driven folly head
 never like madness meet"
  "who would fool" monarch said
 "but indeed deem suit discreet
 lend thine shall less fit
 haply thee school lack wit"

 xlii
  "fools you" fierce ferrau replied
 "as wear helm delight
 would without casques pride
 already reft despite
 know thus much vow tied
 wear helm thus promise quite
 roaming without till fine casque win
 worn orlando charles's paladin"

 xliii
  "then" smiling spaniard said count
 "with naked head thou thinkest repeat
 roland aspramont
 agolant's bold son shouldst thou meet
 warrior thou seekest front front
 warrant thou wouldst quake head feet
 wouldst forego casque give
 knight thine arms let thee live"

 xliv
  "so oft roland hip
 oft" exclaimed boaster "heretofore
 easy task strip
 arms beside helm wore
 still let occasion slip
  sometimes think things unwished
 wish hope
 compass easily present scope"

 xlv
 good orlando could forbear
 cried "foul miscreant liar marched
 say caitiff country
 boast obtained victory
 paladin o'er dare
 vaunt distant deemed see
 take helm might
 take arms despite

 xlvi
 "nor o'er smallest vantage wou'd"
 ended temples disarrayed
 beech hung helmet good
 nigh quickly bared trenchant blade
 ferrau stands close attitude
 courage chanced dismayed
 covered lifted shield naked sword
 might best shelter head afford

 xlvii
 'twas thus warriors two faulchions bare
 turning ready steeds began wheel
 armour thinnest
 meeting plates joined probed steel steel
 world another pair
 fitted matched fierce appeal
 equal daring equal might
 safe alike wound either knight

 xlviii
 fair sir already presume
 fierce ferrau charmed understood
 save child enclosed within womb
 full mother takes early food
 hence ever till squalid tomb
 covered manly face wore harness good
 wont doubtful part guard
 seven good plates metal tempered hard

 xlix
 alike charmed life orlando bore
 safe every except single part
 unfenced beneath feet evermore
 guarded care art
 rest diamond dug mountain hoar
 hard unless report truth depart
 armed battle either champion went
 less necessity ornament

 l
 waxing fierce fell combat rages
 fear horror full twain
 fierce ferrau dreadful battle wages
 stroke thrust never dealt vain
 mighty blow roland disengages
 loosens breaks shatters plate chain
 angelica alone secure view
 regards fearful sight marks two

 li
 king circassy
 deemed angelica far
 ferrau orlando desperately
 closing fight seen horse gore
 along way deemed
 disappeared battle sore
 witnessed 'twixt struggling foes none
 beside daughter king galaphron

 lii
 damsel sometime descried
 dread direful combat standing nigh
 appearing either side
 equal peril warriors vie
 fond novelty helm untied
 designs take desirous espy
 would perceived wrong
 without thought keep plunder long

 liii
 give orlando bent
 first would upon warrior play
 helmet took intent
 bosom hid marked fray
 next thence without word either went
 scene strife far away
 ere either two marked feat
 blinded angry heat

 liv
 ferrau first chanced loss see
 roland disengaged cried
 "how like unwary men fools
 treated late us ride
 meed worthiest strife might
 stolen victor shall abide"
 roland draws back looks upward ire
 missing noble casque fire

 lv
 opinion ferrau agreed
 knight
 born away prize hence turned steed
 spur admonished brigliador
 ferrau field beheld speed
 followed roland moor
 arrived tracks upon herbage green
 circassian maid seen

 lvi
 towards vale upon left count
 went pursuing circassian's tread
 spaniard kept path nigh mount
 fair angelica fled
 angelica reached fount
 pleasant site shaded overhead
 whose inviting shades traveller hasted
 ever left chrystal wave untasted

 lvii
 angelica sylvan spring beside
 reposes unsuspicious surprise
 thinking sacred ring hide
 fears evil accident rise
 arrival fountain's side
 branch helmet ties
 seeks fittest sapling need
 fastened trunk mare may feed

 lviii
 spanish cavalier stream beside
 arrived pursued traces
 angelica sooner espied
 evanished clean spurred mare
 helm dropt lay wide
 recovered flying fair
 soon sweet angelica saw
 towards full rapture sprang ferrau

 lix
 disappeared say forms avaunt
 sleep's departure toiling long sore
 seeks damsel 'twixt plant plant
 wretched eyes behold
 blaspheming mahound termagant
 cursing every master lore
 ferrau returned towards sylvan fount
 lay earth helmet count

 lx
 soon recognised read
 letters upon margin written fair
 orlando helmet said
 champion took
 paynim armed neck head
 would grief prize forbear
 grief loss conveyed sight
 disappear phantoms night

 lxi
 goodly casque arrayed
 deemed nought wanting full content
 discovery royal maid
 like flash lightning came went
 searches every greenwood shade
 hope finding spent
 vain pursuit longer tarries
 spanish camp returns near paris

 lxii
 tempering grief glowed within breast
 sore disappointment thought
 orlando's morion blest
 sworn good anglante's count taught
 false saracen prize possest
 long time spanish knight vainly sought
 roland took helmet head
 till two bridges laid dead

 lxiii
 angelica thus viewless alone
 speeds journey troubled front
 grieved helmet haste foregone
 departure grassy fount
 "choosing least done"
 said "i took helmet count
 first desert well bestow
 worthy recompense owe

 lxiv
 "with good intentions god knows wrought
 though ill different end produce
 took helmet thought
 bring deadly battle truce
 foul spaniard sought
 gain intent conduce"
 lamenting took task
 robbed orlando casque

 lxv
 appeared meetest way
 moody illcontent eastward pressed
 ofttimes concealed sometimes face day
 seemed opportune pleased best
 much country seen forest gray
 reached sorely wounded mid breast
 two dead companions ground
 royal maid bleeding stripling found

 lxvi
 angelica
 shall speak first many things say
 shall circassian moor
 give long space rhyme thence called away
 good anglante's prince wills
 others tell display
 labours troubles sustained
 pursuing great good never gained

 lxvii
 first city whither brought
 go concealed good care
 new helmet donned took thought
 headpiece designed bear
 safe fairy spell nought
 imports hard soft temper
 orlando covered thus pursues quest
 day night rain sun arrest

 lxviii
 hour ocean's bed
 dan phoebus drew dripping steeds high
 low still scattering yellow flowers red
 aurora stained heavens various dye
 stars cast veils head
 departing revels sky
 passing day fair paris near
 orlando made mighty worth appear

 lxix
 two squadrons encountered one old
 saracen manilardo clept obeyed
 king noritia whilom fierce bold

 lxxix

 without encountering aught might appear
 worthy note wended many day
 finally twain cavalier
 prisoner led encountered way
 shall told tale dear
 calls beaten path away
  aymon's daughter  left
 languid lost pains love

 xlv
 beauteous lady desires vain
 rogero return delay
 lies marseilles whence paynim train
 harasses nigh returning day
 time robbing aye hill plain
 scower fruitful languedoc provence gay
 true duty executes aright
 sage leader valiant knight

 xlvi
 time long past lying place
 hoped rogero would appear
 beholding space
 many evil chances lived fear
 one day mid others woeful case
 lady wept alone drew near
 dame healing ring made sound
 bosom rankling alcina's wound

 xlvii
 saw without love returned
 time elapsed mission incomplete
 sore trembling faint pale heart yearned
 scarce strength stand upon feet
 enchantress kind discerned
 fear advanced smiles maid meet
 console glad visage wore
 messenger joyful tidings bore

 xlviii
 "fear thy rogero well
 safe cried ever worships thee
 wonted thy foe wizard fell
 yet deprives liberty
 behoves thee climb sell
 would'st thou posses follow

 whither thee rogero shall freed"

 told dames cavaliers cheats
 thither make resort like deceits

 seeing sage think see squire

 whatever several wight's desire
 since scope wishes never tend
 hence searching every tire
 labour sore frustrate end
 cannot desire hope deceive
 without missing good palace leave

 li
 "as soon thou pursued dame art near
 place built magic seat
 resembling thy rogero cheer
 every look atlantes thee shall meet
 make ill art appear
 suffering stronger arm defeat
 thou may'st aid peril feigned
 thus among others detained

 lii
 "to end thou may'st escape ambush
 many many thus betrayed
 fallen though rogero seem beware
 lend faith demand thine aid
 sage presents forbear
 take worthless life lifted blade
 think slay rogero blow
 works thee still cruel woe

 liii
 "hard seem slay full well know
 wight rogero descry
 truth lying show
 trust sight magic blears eye
 fix ere forest go
 change traitorous foe nigh
 never shall rogero wive
 weakly wizard leave alive"

 valorous maid intent slay
 false enchanter plan decides
 snatches arms follows way

 glorious realms houses renown

 less fame deserve female gown
 piety sovereign prudence graced
 noble hearts incomparably chaste

 lviii

 long tale would hold see

 lxvi
 "thy race shall else excel
 rare fortune women thrives

 thou may'st take note well
 merlin said thy descendents' lives
 haply story might narrate

 closely pressed labouring sore breath

 quickly lost faith nourished late
 quickly every fair design forbore
 weens melissa bears rogero hate
 new injury unheard
 unheard hate wrong foe

 e'er shall agnize view aright

 belief that's warranted sight
 even without eyes heart alone

 without word exchanged warlike two

 lxv

 many footmen girt sir pinnabel
 ready despoil cavalier
 warlike joust void sell
 one another spurred bold career
 knights huge lances rested well

 neighboring wood bade followers bear

 puissant warriors shocked mid career
 rogero wrought magic lore
 fiends little stroke fear

 whose rare virtues whilere said

 lxviii
 already said enchanted light

 shield's discovery every wight
 blinded earth half lifeless lies
 wherefore well mantled veil knight
 keeps unless passing need surprise
 impassive shield well believed
 since damage shock received

 lxix

 lxxii
 'twas exactly eighth month ended

 faithless maganzese wended

 death good fortune rather say
 pinnabel bore courser brave

 lxxiii
 courser cavalier

 "this man" damsel said " 'tis clear

 lxxiv

 sir pinnabel every hope foregone
 screaming loud ever making head

 lxxv
 pale dismayed spurs caitiff plied
 whose last hope escape flight found
 ready sword dordona's pride

 hunting close ever fast beside
 loud uproar woods resound
 nothing castle kenned

 lxxvi
 three fortress came
 issued forth upon way
 brought illaccustomed dame
 made wayfarers ill use obey
 rather prolong blame
 life would choose perish fray
 kindling visage burns heart woe
 assail one man many go

 lxxvii
 cruel courtezan made

 reminds warriors arrayed
 oath pact avenge fight
 "if lance alone thy foes laid
 earth band knight"
 guido savage said "and lie

 lxxviii
 aquilant gryphon twain
 singly single foe would run
 rather would taken rather slain

 exclaimed woman "why vain

 brought champion's arms take

 lxxix
 "you offered prisoncell

 'tis law's observance compel
 lying tongue oath evade"
 "  behold arms behold new sell

 "behold well damsel's vest

 lxxx

 red shame encounter gone
 foremost appeared 'mid three knights pride
 burgundy's good marquis either son
 guido borne heavier steed

 lxxxi

 sir sansonet rogero came fight
 wellcovered shield heretofore
 atlantes used pyrenean height

 human sufferance dazed astonished sight
 rogero last resource

 lxxxii
 although three times alone child fain
 certes sore bested display
 twice wanton fairy's reign

 lxxxiii
 save three times preserved shield

 said came afield
 boldly three enemies

 lxxxiv
 rogero shocked valiant gryphon

 lxxxv

 lxxxvi

 unconscious issue fight
 rogero turned horse wheel

 none descried fury oppose

 lxxxvii
 knights together footmen
 women castle hied
 less coursers panting fall

 wondered first next perceived pall

 lxxxviii

 lxxxix

 sore troubled rode away

 xc
 away rogero posted dame
 date crimsoned visage raise
 since every one seemed might blame
 right victory worthy little praise
 "by amends shame
 blushing warrior said stain eraze
 'twill bruited deeds sleight
 magic done might"

 xci
 thinking thus journeyed way
 rogero stumbled upon sought
 middle track lay
 well within ground profoundly wrought
 whither thirsty herd noon day
 repaired paunches green forage fraught
 rogero said " 'tis must provide
 shame thee shield abide

 xcii
 "thee keep shall

 child ending selfcolloquy
 dismounting takes large heavy stone
 shield ties bodily
 bottom well gone
 "lie buried ever eyes

 xciv
 strange adventure rest
 wide world mouth mouth blown
 knights number undertook quest
 neighbouring parts distant unknown
 remained forest possessed
 spring wherein virtuous shield thrown
 told action would say
 well land lay

 xcv
 upon rogero's parting thence fell
 four good champions evil law
 made castle's lord sir pinnabel
 discomfited like men straw
  shield withdrawn  removed well
 light quelled sight minds saw
 like dead men earth lain
 risen full wonderment

 xcvi

 horrid light quelled debate
 discoursing adventure say

 pinnabel dead warriors hear

 xcvii
 bradamant close pass staid
 faithless pinnabel sorely prest
 many times buried half blade
 within bleeding flanks heaving breast
 crimes forfeit paid
 infected country's curse pest
 conscious forest turned away
 good steed thief made prey

 xcviii
 would return left knight
 never could make road anew

 wandered wellnigh ample country
 yet could never fortune's spite
 find way join rogero true

 "no better messenger could devise"

 "nor one hippalca mine sage

 xxx
 hippalca attendant damsel hight

 xxxi

 xxxiii

 xxxv
 "ah would were" maid replied
 "for haply would make thee change thy thought
 better knight thee horse doth ride
 vainly would match earth sought"
  "who tramples thus other's fame"  cried

 xxxix

 ere thither another path astray
 zerbino came deceitful crone
 saw bleeding body lay

 cheerful content fully blest

 lxxix
 "but since abandon thee prize

 lxxx

 smote clenched fist force nought meet
  smote horse's head fearful blow
 skull smashed like glass courser fleet

 dudon orlando behind embraced
 foot furious peer would throw
 astolpho others seize arms waste

 compassing roland upon every side
 warriors thus orlando flung parforce
 farrier throws struggling ox horse

 lv

 shakes plunges

 astolpho bade hence prisoner bear
 would heal said warrior's brain
 shouldered sturdy dudon load

 lvi
 seven times astolpho makes wash knight
 seven times plunged beneath brine goes
 cleanse away scurf blight
 stupid limbs visage grows

 stop mouth wherewith puffs blows
 save nostrils would astolpho leave

 lvii
 valiant astolpho prepared vase

 mystic cup withal oh wondrous case
 unsettled mind ancient seat regained
 glorious reasonings yet clear
 lucid waxed wisdom whilere

 lviii
 one seems troubled sleep see
 abominable shapes horrid crew

 seems strange unlawful thing
 yet marvels slumber free
 recovered senses play true
 good orlando made sound

 lix
 aldabelle's brother monodantes' son

 turned restless eyes

 marvelling naked cast
 wherefore tethered neck heels fast

 lx

 lxii
 meanwhile bardino told brandimart
 monodantes good sire dead

 lxiii

 lxiv
 upon following day provence steer

 let good england's knight honour wear
 every vantage astolpho still
 guided orlando's

 lxv
 order taken attack town
 huge biserta side
 first assault walls
 orlando palm divide
 lament shall leave unshown
 since short time lay tale aside
 meanwhile fierce overthrow
 moors received france pleased know

 lxvi
 well nigh abandoned royal lord
 worst peril arles
 gone many paynim horde
 sage sobrino king spain
 deemed land unsafe aboard
 barks sought refuge numerous train
 barons cavaliers served moor
 moved example put shore

 lxvii
 yet royal agramant fight maintains
 longer make stand
 turns combat directly strains
 arles far remote upon strand
 rabican pursues flowing reins
 aymon's daughter drives heel hand
 would slay often crost
 martial maid rogero lost

 lxviii
 marphisa desire stirred
 thoughts tardy vengeance placed
 dead sire fiercely spurred
 made hot courser feel rider's haste
 neither martial maid amid herd
 flying moors well monarch chased
 o'ertake swift retreat
 first arles aboard fleet

 lxix
 two fair generous pards crag
 together dart stretch across plain
 perceive vigorous goat stag
 nimble quarry pursued vain
 ashamed chase lag
 return repentant high disdain
 sigh return damsels two
 paynim king safety view

 lxx
 yet therefore halt fury go
 amid crowd flies possest dread
 feeling every blow
 many never uprear head
 evil pass brought broken foe
 safety even fled
 since agramant sure retreat gain
 bade shut citygate faced plain

 lxxi
 bade rhone break bridges
 unhappy people ever held cheap
  weighed tyrant's want wears crown 
 worthless herd goats silly sheep
 sea river drown
 blood thirsty fallows steep
 franks prisoners made many slew
 ransom battle

 lxxii
 great multitude either train
 christened paynim killed last fight
 though unequal parts slain
 far saracens killed flight
 hands redoubted damsels twain
 signs even day remain sight
 hard arles sleeps lazy rhone
 plain rising sepulchres strown

 lxxiii
 meanwhile heavy ships deepest draught
 king agramant made put forth sea
 leaving barks port  lightest craft 
 would aboard navy flee
 stays two days stragglers waft
 winds wild contrary
 third day sail give command
 trust make return africk's land

 lxxiv
 royal marsilius fatal hour
 fearing costs fall upon spain
 clouds big tempest lower
 end burst upon fields grain
 makes valentia town tower
 begins fortify mickle pain
 war prepares ends

 lxxv
 king agramant sails africk bent
 barks illarmed almost empty go
 empty men full discontent
 threefourths perished foe
 cruel weak proud shent
 king still happens like woe
 hate privily fear
 fury presence mute appear

 lxxvi
 yet sometimes two three lips unclose
  knot friends relies 
 pent choler rage expose
 yet agramant beneath illusion lies
 love pity overflows
 befalls still espies
 false faces hears voices applaud
 nought adulation lies fraud

 lxxvii
 biserta's port host land
 sage king africa's intent

 lxxix
 yet tidings conveyed

 would believed said
 hundred barks sprung one small bough
 hence africa king weighed
 fearing encounter hostile prow
 watchmen tops spy

 lxxx
 `twas ships england's peer supplied
 dudon manned good armed crew
 see moorish fleet eventide
 strange armament forthwith pursue
 assailed unawares far wide
 among barks grapplingirons threw
 linked chains opponents clung
 known moors foemen tongue

 lxxxi
 bearing impelled winds blow
 propitious danish chief's intent
 weighty ships shocked paynim foe
 many vessels bottom went
 taxing wits hands work woe
 fire sword stones christians shent
 ships wide ruin pour
 like tempest never vext sea

 lxxxii
 bold dudon's men unwonted might
 daring imparted high
 since hour come paynims requite
 one ill deed far nigh
 moors pestilently gall smite
 agramant finds shelter sky
 thick clouds whistling arrows strike
 around gleam hook hatchet sword pike

 lxxxiii
 king hears huge heavy stones descend
 charged machine thundering engine sent
 falling poop prow broadside rend
 opening ravening seas mighty vent
 furious fires offend
 fires quickly kindled slowly spent
 wretched crews would fain danger shun
 ever direr peril run

 lxxxiv
 one headlong plunged pursued fire sword
 perished mid waters one wrought
 faster arms feet passage oared
 barque already overfraught
 repulsed wretch fain would board
 whose hand importunately sought
 clamber grasped side lopt arm

 lxxxv

 since swimming profited caitiff nought
 perceived strength courage drain
 hungry fires refuge sought
 fear drowning hurries back
 grasps burning plank dread
 dying either death sped

 lxxxvi
 vainly sea resorts spear

 stone arrow following rear
 permit craven make little way
 haply yet delights ear
 'twere well wisely done end lay
 rather harp upon theme long

 bark remained raged wide among foes
 might also deem africk's people mourned
 agramant mid diverse deaths woes

 vi
 'twas night gleam anywhere descried
 first fleets furious strife blended
 lit sulphur pitch tar side

 destructive wildfire scattered wide
 fed upon ship shallop ill defended

 vii
 hence agramant dark deceived

 branzardo slew brand

 xxxvi
 agramant left without guide

 xxxvii
 "what victory lord" sobrino cries
 "could better thy death christian cheer
 whence might hope joy quiet wise
 fair africa annoyance clear

 xxxviii
 "thy subjects thy death deprived

 therefore aye throughout warfare drear

 bit iron curb found
 could adamantine rein
 make wrath keep order due bound
 within lawful limits contain
 one constant heart bound
 linked love solid bolt chain
 see violence foul deceit
 mortal damage dishonour meet

 ii

 ill savage action led astray
 may deserve excuse breast

 achilles beneath borrowed crest
 saw patroclus crimsoning way
 murderer's slaughter ill content
 till mangled corse dragged shent

 iii
 unconquered duke alphonso anger
 inflamed thy host day weighty stone
 wounded thy forehead grievous blow
 believed rest gone
  inflamed fury foe
 rampart fosse wall defence none
 one within works lay dead
 wight left woeful news spread

 iv
 seeing thy fall caused thine mighty pain
 fury moved hadst thou lord
 maintained thy footing haply might thy train
 less licence plied murderous sword
 enough thee thy bastia regain
 fewer hours replaced beneath thy ward
 cordova's fierce granada's band
 took days erewhile wrest thy hand

 v
 haply heaven's vengeance ordered befel

 fury grasped anglantes' knight
 wreaked agramant first despite

 viii
 scaped bleeding helm loosened form head
 half shield swordless mail

 dull envious falcon's nail

 ruffled plumage loss tail
 orlando came smote
 helmed head confined bust

 ix
 loosed helm neck without band

 heavy trunk libya's mighty lord

 vessels well nigh drained
 olivier lies stretched retrieved
 retrieve crippled foot save sprained
 almost crushed long plain
 stout courser jammed limb lain

 xvii
 orlando helped woe begone
 weeping olivier brought low
 could released limb alone
 released endures pain woe
 helpless warrior cannot stand upon
 shift withal wounded foot
 benumbed crippled leg
 without assistance cannot move

 xviii
 victory brought orlando small delight
 heavily hardly weighed
 slaughtered brandimart piteous sight
 sure oliviero's life made
 sobrino yet survived little light
 wounded monarch amid much shade
 almost spend ebbing life remained
 fast crimson blood drained

 xix

 roland olivier much requires
 leech's care anguish allay
 worthy place desires
 much wherein sir brandimart lay
 steers lofty mountain fires

 clxviii

 upbraiding skies stars cavalier

 speechless stood awhile friends view

 canto 44

 argument
 rinaldo sister child hath plight
 marseilles warrior gone
 crimsoned wide field fight
 therein arrives king otho's valiant son
 paris thence squadron bright
 mighty grace wonderous honour done
 child departs resolved leo's slaughter
 duke aymon betrothed daughter



 poor abode mid paltry walls bare
 amid discomforts calamities
 often friendship heart united
 better roof lordly guise
 royal court beset snare
 mid envious wealth ease luxuries
 charity spent every side
 friendship unless counterfeit spied

 ii
 hence ensues peace pact
 princes peers shortlived wear
 today king pope emperor leagued seen
 marrow deadly foemen
 outward mien
 heart spirit sovereigns bear
 since wholly careless right wrong
 profit look faithless throng

 iii
 though little prone friendship sort
 loveth dwell
 talk earnest sport
 speak except cozening tale tell
 yet together poor resort
 prisoned fortune false fell
 friendship speedily discern
 though years past yet learn

 iv
 retreat ancient eremite
 could bind inmates faster noose
 true love firmly unite
 could domes courtiers use
 enduring knot tight
 nothing short death tie could loose
 benignant hermit found crew
 whiter heart swans outward hue

 honour good rogero paid
 prudent sire kindness spied
 opening made pass assayed
 "and nothing else remains" hermit cried
 "nor trust counsel gainsaid

 shine wherever bright sun may glow
 years ages run
 course yet endure fairer show
 orbits burn heavenly fires

 warmth praises worth inspired
 love unseen leo fired

 xiii

 first hath spoken son
 rinaldo absent charles's court
 winged haste deems thither run
 joy kinsman high report
 high regard bears heir
 nought resolve till thither repair

 xiv

 imperial practice knowing nought
 promised beauteous sister bride

 could choose pleasure clermont's chief

 scarce mindful crew coming stay

 xxxvii

 xlviii
 cruel thoughts afflicted maid torment
 rogero's mind enjoys repose

 lxv
 "thou hast cause amid thy griefs fear

 followers far wide every bourn
 afterwards person went vain

 "if ingenuous mien" cried
 leo "is soul's nobility
 corresponding fair outside
 inward goodness courtesy
 help comfort sir one provide
 best living knights see
 save ye help comfort quickly lend
 little distant latter end

 xxiv
 "the best knights die
 e'er donned sword buckler fair
 gentle warriors gone
 throughout world yet living
 simply courteous deed none

 come sir love heaven try

 xxv
 suddenly came leo's mind
 knight parlayed
 throughout land sought find
 seeking person came
 obeying would persuade
 pious work spurred behind dame
 thither led tedious way
 nigh reduced death stripling lay

 xxvi
 found rogero fasting food
 three long days broken pain
 knight could upon feet stood
 fall albeit unpushed ground
 helm head faulchion good
 begirt lay reclined plate chain
 pillow buckler made
 white unicorn seen pourtraid

 xxvii
 thinking injury done
 lady love  ingrate untrue
  simple grief alone
 o'erwhelmed height fury grew
 bit hands lips pouring
 cheeks tears unceasing ran
 passion wrapt troubled sprite
 leo melissa heard knight

 xxviii
 therefore interrupts lament
 checks sighs checks trickling tears
 young leo halts hear speech intent
 lights courser towards steers
 knows sorrows torment
 love cause yet nought appears
 person grief hath bred
 rogero remains unsaid

 xxix
 approaching nearer yet nearer
 fronts weeping warrior face face
 greets brother's love stooping low
 neck encircles fast embrace
 lamenting child know
 liked sudden presence place
 fears annoy trouble hand
 lest wish death withstand

 xxx
 sweetest words young leo plied
 warmest love could show
 "let irk thee" child cried
 "to tell cause whence thy sorrows flow
 desperate evils man betide
 deliverance woe
 cause known bereft
 hope ever life left

 xxxi
 "much grieve thou wouldst hide thyself
 known thy faithful friend true
 bound thee
 knot never undo
 even beginning
 thy deadly foeman reason due
 hope succour thee pelf
 friends following life

 xxxii
 "nor shun thy sorrow explain
 beseech thee leave try
 wealth avail free thee thy pain
 art cunning open force flattery
 assistance employed vain
 last relief remains thee die
 content awhile deed shun
 till thou canst shall first done"

 xxxiii
 said forceful prayer appealed
 gently benignly soothed moan
 good rogero could choose yield
 whose heart iron stone
 deemed unless lips unsealed
 foul discourteous deed done
 fain would replied made assay
 yet twice thrice ere words could find way

 xxxiv
 "my lord known
 shalt thou know" made last reply
 "i wot thou like content wilt
 haply content die
 know hated thee
 rogero repaid hate
 'tis many days since intent
 putting thee death court went

 xxxv
 "because would see promised bride
 borne thee duke aymon's love
 favour engaged upon thy side
 man purposes god
 disposes thy great courtesy well tried
 sore need fixt resolve move
 renounced hate bore
 purposed thine evermore

 xxxvi
 "what time rogero unknown
 thou madest suit would obtain thee
 lady bradamant one
 demand heart soul
 whether thy wish rather mine
 sought content thou hast made see
 thine lady peace possess
 far mine prize thy happiness

 xxxvii
 "content thee deprived well
 worthless life deprive
 better without soul could dwell
 without bradamant remain alive
 never veins lifeblood swell
 canst thou legitimately wive
 vows erewhile us said
 two husbands wed"

 xxxviii
 filled gentle leo amaze
 stranger rogero knows
 lips brow unmoved stedfast gaze
 rooted feet like statue shows
 like statue man votaries raise
 churches acquittance vows
 deems courtesy high strain
 never done done

 xxxix

 goodwill bore whilere
 abates augments kindness
 less grieves grecian cavalier
 good rogero rogero's woe
 well appear
 deservedly emperor's son  although
 things outdone 
 defeated race courtesy

 xl
 says "that day host overthrown
 rogero thy wond'rous valour though
 thee despite known
 thou rogero know
 thy virtue would made thine
 made knowing foe
 hatred bosom would chased
 present love straight replaced

 xli
 "that rogero hated ere knew
 thou rogero deny
 think would pursue
 hatred bore thee
 thee thy darksome dungeon drew
 descried truth descry
 treatment shouldst thou thou
 shalt thine advantage

 xlii
 "and willingly done
 obliged thee
 much gladly
 reason
 deemed ungrateful amid ingrate men
 since thou foregoest thine every good
 thee restore thy gift
 glady received restore

 xliii
 "the damsel thee due
 though deserts hold dear
 fair prize happier mortal drew
 think vital thread shear
 would thy death free woo
 hallowed bands wedlock clear
 wherein lady hath thee tied
 might possess lawful bride

 xliv
 "not bradamant would forego
 whatsoe'er world possess
 rather forfeit life ever know
 grief knight oppress
 thy distrust great cause woe
 since thou couldst dispose less
 thyself thou  rather apply
 succour  wouldst sorrow die"

 xlv
 words spake intent
 tedious verses recite
 refuting evermore argument
 might used answer knight
 said last "i yield content
 live ever requite
 obligation owed
 thee twice hast life bestowed"

 xlvi
 melissa generous wine goodly cheer

 comforted mourning cavalier

 meanwhile sound steeds frontino's ear

 xlvii

 introduction



 many years since first entertained vague idea
 translating _orlando furioso_ circumstances little
 importance reader led recently undertake
 earnest work laid afterwards resumed
 instance distinguished friend odd coincidence
 indebted also suggestion another eminent person
 idea present translation _orlando innamorato_
 observe intended auxiliary
 first greater undertaking though need scarcely say
 story boiardo necessary prologue poem
 ariosto

 intention translated first mentioned work
 exactly upon model adopted tressan version
 french romances scheme afterwards executed much better
 success late excellent friend mr george ellis
 english work description consideration
 subject however induced imitate
 general plan illustrating compendious prose translation
 extracts without seeking add poignancy might
 give false idea tone original recollected
 stood different predicament either
 authors compare work one
 likely familiar readers 'specimens early
 english romances' originals composed spirit
 gravity hardly confused gay style
 translator therefore nobody misled vein
 pleasantry runs mr ellis's work sure
 exclusively ascribed author _rifacimento_

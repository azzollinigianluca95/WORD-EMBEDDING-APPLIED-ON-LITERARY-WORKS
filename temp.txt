 arms man sing forc'd fate
 haughty juno's unrelenting hate
 expell'd exil'd left trojan shore
 long labors sea land bore
 doubtful war
 latian realm built destin'd town
 banish'd gods restor'd rites divine
 settled sure succession line
 whence race alban fathers come
 long glories majestic rome

 muse causes crimes relate
 goddess provok'd whence hate
 offense queen heav'n began
 persecute brave man
 involv'd anxious life endless cares
 expos'd wants hurried wars
 heav'nly minds high resentment show
 exercise spite human woe

 tiber's mouth far away
 ancient town seated sea
 tyrian colony people made
 stout war studious trade
 carthage name belov'd juno
 argos samian shore
 stood chariot heav'n kind
 seat awful empire design'd
 yet heard ancient rumor fly
 long cited people sky
 times come see trojan race
 carthage ruin tow'rs deface
 thus confin'd yoke sov'reign sway
 necks nations lay
 ponder'd fear'd fate
 could forget war wag'd late
 conqu'ring greece trojan state
 besides long causes working mind
 secret seeds envy lay behind
 deep graven heart doom remain'd
 partial paris form disdain'd
 grace bestow'd ravish'd ganymed
 electra's glories injur'd bed
 cause alone combin'd
 kindle vengeance haughty mind
 far distant latian coast
 drove remnants trojan host
 sev'n long years th' unhappy wand'ring train
 toss'd storms scatter'd thro' main
 time toil requir'd roman name
 length labor vast frame

 scarce trojan fleet sails oars
 left behind fair sicilian shores
 ent'ring cheerful shouts wat'ry reign
 plowing frothy furrows main
 lab'ring still endless discontent
 queen heav'n thus fury vent

 "then vanquish'd must yield" said
 "and must trojans reign italy
 fate jove adds force
 pow'r divert happy course
 could angry pallas revengeful spleen
 grecian navy burn drown men
 fault one offending foe
 bolts jove presum'd throw
 whirlwinds beneath toss'd ship
 bare expos'd bosom deep
 eagle gripes trembling game
 wretch yet hissing father's flame
 strongly seiz'd burning wound
 transfix'd naked rock bound
 walk awful state
 majesty heav'n sister wife jove
 length years fruitless force employ
 thin remains ruin'd troy
 nations juno's pow'r pray
 off'rings slighted altars lay"

 thus rag'd goddess fury fraught
 restless regions storms sought
 spacious cave living stone
 tyrant aeolus airy throne
 pow'r imperial curbs struggling winds
 sounding tempests dark prisons binds
 way th' impatient captives tend
 pressing release mountains rend
 high hall th' undaunted monarch stands
 shakes scepter rage commands
 unresisted sway
 would sweep world way
 earth air seas thro' empty space would roll
 heav'n would fly driving soul
 fear father gods
 confin'd fury dark abodes
 lock'd 'em safe within oppress'd mountain loads
 impos'd king arbitrary sway
 loose fetters force allay
 suppliant queen pray'rs address'd
 thus tenor suit express'd

 "o aeolus thee king heav'n
 pow'r tempests winds giv'n
 thy force alone fury restrain
 smooth waves swell troubled main
 race wand'ring slaves abhorr'd
 prosp'rous passage cut tuscan sea
 fruitful italy course steer
 vanquish'd gods design new temples
 raise thy winds night involve skies
 sink disperse fatal enemies
 twice sev'n charming daughters main
 around person wait bear train
 succeed wish second design
 fairest deiopeia shall thine
 make thee father happy line"

 god "'t queen
 work duty binds fulfil
 airy kingdoms wide command
 presents bounteous hand
 sov'reign's grace guest
 sit gods celestial feast
 raise tempests pleasure subdue
 dispose empire hold you"

 said hurl'd mountain side
 quiv'ring spear god applied
 raging winds rush thro' hollow wound
 dance aloft air skim along ground
 settling sea surges sweep
 raise liquid mountains disclose deep
 south east west mix'd confusion roar
 roll foaming billows shore
 cables crack sailors' fearful cries
 ascend sable night involves skies
 heav'n ravish'd eyes
 loud peals thunder poles ensue
 flashing fires transient light renew
 face things frightful image bears
 present death various forms appears
 struck unusual fright trojan chief
 lifted hands eyes invokes relief
 "thrice four times happy those" cried
 "that ilian walls parents died
 tydides bravest grecian train
 could strong arm slain
 lie noble hector plain
 great sarpedon bloody fields
 simois rolls bodies shields
 heroes whose dismember'd hands yet bear
 dart aloft clench pointed spear"

 thus pious prince fate bewails
 fierce boreas drove flying sails
 rent sheets raging billows rise
 mount tossing vessels skies
 shiv'ring oars sustain blow
 galley gives side turns prow
 astern descending steep
 thro' gaping waves behold boiling deep
 three ships hurried southern blast
 secret shelves fury cast
 hidden rocks th' ausonian sailors knew
 call'd altars rose view
 show'd spacious backs flood
 three fierce eurus angry mood
 dash'd shallows moving sand
 mid ocean left moor'd aland
 orontes' bark bore lycian crew
 horrid sight ev'n hero's view
 stem stern waves overborne
 trembling pilot rudder torn
 headlong hurl'd thrice round ship toss'd
 bulg'd deep lost
 waves seen
 arms pictures precious goods floating men
 stoutest vessel storm gave way
 suck'd thro' loosen'd planks rushing sea
 ilioneus chief alethes old
 achates faithful abas young bold
 endur'd less ships gaping seams
 admit deluge briny streams

 meantime imperial neptune heard sound
 raging billows breaking ground
 displeas'd fearing wat'ry reign
 rear'd awful head main
 serene majesty roll'd eyes
 around space earth seas skies
 saw trojan fleet dispers'd distress'd
 stormy winds wintry heav'n oppress'd
 full well god sister's envy knew
 aims arts pursue
 summon'd eurus western blast
 first angry glance cast
 thus rebuk'd "audacious winds whence
 bold attempt rebel insolence
 ravage seas land
 unauthoriz'd supreme command
 raise mountains troubled main
 first 't fit billows restrain
 shall taught obedience reign
 hence lord royal mandate bear
 realms ocean fields air
 mine fatal lot
 liquid empire fell trident sea
 pow'r hollow caverns confin'd
 let reign jailer wind
 hoarse commands breathing subjects call
 boast bluster empty hall"
 spoke spoke smooth'd sea
 dispell'd darkness restor'd day
 cymothoe triton seagreen train
 beauteous nymphs daughters main
 clear rocks vessels hands
 god ready trident stands
 opes deep spreads moving sands
 heaves shoals where'er guides
 finny coursers triumph rides
 waves unruffle sea subsides
 tumults rise th' ignoble crowd
 mad motions tongues loud
 stones brands rattling volleys fly
 rustic arms fury supply
 grave pious man appear
 hush noise lend list'ning ear
 soothes sober words angry mood
 quenches innate desire blood
 father flood appears
 o'er seas sov'reign trident rears
 fury falls skims liquid plains
 high chariot loosen'd reins
 majestic moves along awful peace maintains
 weary trojans ply shatter'd oars
 nearest land make libyan shores

 within long recess lies bay
 island shades rolling sea
 forms port secure ships ride
 broke jutting land either side
 double streams briny waters glide
 betwixt two rows rocks sylvan scene
 appears groves ever green
 grot form'd beneath mossy seats
 rest nereids exclude heats
 thro' crannies living walls
 crystal streams descend murm'ring falls
 haulsers need bind vessels
 bearded anchors storms fear
 sev'n ships within happy harbor meet
 thin remainders scatter'd fleet
 trojans worn toils spent woes
 leap welcome land seek wish'd repose

 first good achates repeated strokes
 clashing flints hidden fire provokes
 short flame succeeds bed wither'd leaves
 dying sparkles fall receives
 caught life fiery fumes rise
 fed stronger food invade skies
 trojans dropping wet stand around
 cheerful blaze lie along ground
 dry corn infected brine
 grind marbles prepare dine
 aeneas climbs mountain's airy brow
 takes prospect seas
 capys thence antheus could spy
 see streamers caicus fly
 vessels view plain
 three beamy stags command lordly train
 branching heads ignoble throng
 attend stately steps slowly graze along
 stood secure fed
 took quiver trusty bow
 achates us'd bear leaders first
 laid along vulgar pierc'd
 ceas'd arrows till shady plain
 sev'n mighty bodies blood distain
 sev'n ships made equal share
 port return'd triumphant war
 jars gen'rous wine acestes' gift
 trinacrian shores navy left
 set abroach feast prepar'd
 equal portions ven'son shar'd
 thus dealt round pious chief
 cheerful words allay'd common grief
 "endure conquer jove soon dispose
 future good past present woes
 rocks scylla tried
 th' inhuman cyclops den defied
 greater ills hereafter bear
 resume courage dismiss care
 hour come pleasure relate
 sorrows past benefits fate
 thro' various hazards events move
 latium realms foredoom'd jove
 call'd seat promise skies
 trojan kingdoms may rise
 endure hardships present state
 live reserve better fate"

 words spoke spoke heart
 outward smiles conceal'd inward smart
 jolly crew unmindful past
 quarry share plenteous dinner haste
 strip skin portion spoil
 limbs yet trembling caldrons boil
 fire reeking entrails broil
 stretch'd grassy turf ease dine
 restore strength meat cheer souls
 wine
 hunger thus appeas'd care attends
 doubtful fortune absent friends
 alternate hopes fears minds possess
 whether deem 'em dead distress
 rest aeneas mourns fate
 brave orontes th' uncertain state
 gyas lycus amycus
 day sorrows ended thus

 aloft almighty jove surveys
 earth air shores navigable seas
 length libyan realms fix'd eyes
 pond'ring thus human miseries
 venus saw lowly look
 free tears heav'nly sire bespoke

 "o king gods men whose awful hand
 disperses thunder seas land
 disposing absolute command
 could pious son thy pow'r incense
 alas vanish'd troy's offense
 hope italy lost
 various seas various tempests toss'd
 shut ev'ry shore barr'd ev'ry coast
 promis'd progeny divine
 romans rising trojan line
 times hold world awe
 land ocean give law
 doom revers'd eas'd care
 troy ruin'd cruel war
 fates fates could oppose
 fortune still pursues former blow
 hope worse still succeed
 end labors decreed
 antenor midst grecian hosts
 could pass secure pierce th' illyrian coasts
 rolling steep timavus raves
 thro' nine channels disembogues waves
 length founded padua's happy seat
 gave trojans secure retreat
 fix'd arms renew'd name
 quiet rules crown'd fame
 descended sacred line
 entitled heav'n rites divine
 banish'd earth wrath one
 remov'd latium promis'd throne
 scepters due rewards
 thus jove plighted faith regards"

 father th' immortal race
 smiling serene indulgent face
 drives clouds clears skies
 first gave holy kiss thus replies

 "daughter dismiss thy fears thy desire
 fates thine fix'd stand entire
 thou shalt behold thy wish'd lavinian walls
 ripe heav'n fate aeneas calls
 shalt thou bear sublime
 councils revers'd firm decree
 lest new fears disturb thy happy state
 know search'd mystic rolls fate
 thy son th' appointed season far
 italy shall wage successful war
 shall tame fierce nations bloody field
 sov'reign laws impose cities build
 till ev'ry foe subdued sun
 thrice thro' signs annual race shall run
 time prefix'd ascanius
 call'd iulus shall begin reign
 thirty rolling years crown shall wear
 lavinium shall seat transfer
 hard labor alba longa build
 throne succession shall fill'd
 three hundred circuits shall seen
 ilia fair priestess queen
 full mars time kindly throes
 shall birth two goodly boys disclose
 royal babes tawny wolf shall drain
 romulus grandsire's throne shall gain
 martial tow'rs founder shall become
 people romans call city rome
 bounds empire assign
 term years immortal line
 ev'n haughty juno endless broils
 earth seas heav'n jove turmoils
 length aton'd friendly pow'r shall join
 cherish advance trojan line
 subject world shall rome's dominion
 prostrate shall adore nation gown
 age ripening revolving fate
 troy shall overturn grecian state
 sweet revenge conqu'ring sons shall call
 crush people conspir'd fall
 caesar julian stock shall rise
 whose empire ocean whose fame skies
 alone shall bound fraught eastern spoils
 heav'n reward human toils
 securely shall repay rites divine
 incense shall ascend sacred shrine
 dire debate impious war shall cease
 stern age soften'd peace
 banish'd faith shall return
 vestal fires hallow'd temples burn
 remus quirinus shall sustain
 righteous laws fraud force restrain
 janus fane shall wait
 keep dreadful issues gate
 bolts iron bars within remains
 imprison'd fury bound brazen chains
 high trophy rais'd useless arms
 sits threats world vain alarms"

 said sent cyllenius command
 free ports ope punic land
 trojan guests lest ignorant fate
 queen might force town state
 steep heav'n cyllenius flies
 cleaves wings yielding skies
 soon libyan shore descends god
 performs message displays rod
 surly murmurs people cease
 fates requir'd give peace
 queen suspends rigid laws
 trojans pities protects cause

 meantime shades night aeneas lies
 care seiz'd soul sleep forsook eyes
 sun restor'd cheerful day
 rose coast country survey
 anxious eager discover
 look'd wild uncultivated shore
 whether humankind beasts alone
 possess'd newfound region unknown
 beneath ledge rocks fleet hides
 tall trees surround mountain's shady sides
 bending brow safe retreat provides
 arm'd two pointed darts leaves friends
 true achates steps attends
 lo deep recesses wood
 eyes goddess mother stood
 huntress habit mien
 dress maid air confess'd queen
 bare knees knots garments bind
 loose hair wanton'd wind
 hand sustain'd bow quiver hung behind
 seem'd virgin spartan blood
 array harpalyce bestrode
 thracian courser outstripp'd rapid flood
 "ho strangers lately seen" said
 "one sisters like array'd
 cross'd lawn forest stray'd
 painted quiver back bore
 varied spots lynx's hide wore
 full cry pursued tusky boar"

 thus venus thus son replied
 "none sisters heard seen
 virgin name bear
 style mortal fair
 voice mien celestial birth betray
 seem sister day
 one least chaste diana's train
 let humble suppliant sue vain
 tell stranger long tempests toss'd
 earth tread commands coast
 name shall wretched mortals call
 offer'd victims altars fall"
 "i dare not" replied "assume name
 goddess celestial honors claim
 tyrian virgins bows quivers bear
 purple buskins o'er ankles wear
 know gentle youth libyan lands
 people rude peace rough war
 rising city far see
 carthage tyrian colony
 phoenician dido rules growing state
 fled tyre shun brother's hate
 great wrongs story full fate
 sum short sichaeus known
 wealth brother punic throne
 possess'd fair dido's bed either heart
 wounded equal dart
 father gave yet spotless maid
 pygmalion tyrian scepter sway'd
 one condemn'd divine human laws
 strife ensued cursed gold cause
 monarch blinded desire wealth
 steel invades brother's life stealth
 sacred altar made bleed
 long conceal'd cruel deed
 tale new pretense daily coin'd
 soothe sister delude mind
 length dead night ghost appears
 unhappy lord specter stares
 erected eyes bloody bosom bares
 cruel altars fate tells
 dire secret house reveals
 warns widow household gods
 seek refuge remote abodes
 last support long way
 shows hidden treasure lay
 admonish'd thus seiz'd mortal fright
 queen provides companions flight
 meet combine leave state
 hate tyrant fear hate
 seize fleet ready rigg'd find
 pygmalion's treasure left behind
 vessels heavy laden put sea
 prosp'rous winds woman leads way
 know stress weather driv'n
 fatal course dispos'd heav'n
 last landed far eyes
 may view turrets new carthage rise
 bought space ground byrsa call'd
 bull's hide first inclos'd wall'd
 whence country claims birth
 seek strangers libyan earth"

 sorrow streaming eyes
 deeply sighing thus son replies
 "could patience hear relate
 nymph tedious annals fate
 thro' train woes run
 day would sooner tale done
 ancient troy force expell'd came
 chance heard trojan name
 various seas various tempests toss'd
 length landed libyan coast
 good aeneas call'd name
 fortune favor'd unknown fame
 household gods companions woes
 pious care rescued foes
 fruitful italy course bent
 king heav'n descent
 twice ten sail cross'd phrygian sea
 fate mother goddess led way
 scarce sev'n thin remainders fleet
 storms preserv'd within harbor meet
 distress'd exile unknown
 debarr'd europe asia thrown
 libyan desarts wander thus alone"

 tender parent could longer bear
 interposing sought soothe care
 "whoe'er unbelov'd heav'n
 since friendly shore ships driv'n
 courage gods permit rest
 queen expose request
 take earnest success
 scatter'd fleet join'd upon shore
 winds chang'd friends danger free
 renounce skill augury
 twelve swans behold beauteous order move
 stoop closing pinions
 late bird jove driv'n along
 thro' clouds pursued scatt'ring throng
 united goodly team
 skim ground seek quiet stream
 joy returning clap wings
 ride circuit skies rings
 otherwise ships ev'ry friend
 already hold port swift sails descend
 advice needful pursue
 path town view"

 thus said turn'd made appear
 neck refulgent dishevel'd hair
 flowing shoulders reach'd ground
 widely spread ambrosial scents around
 length train descends sweeping gown
 graceful walk queen love known
 prince pursued parting deity
 words like "ah whither fly
 unkind cruel deceive son
 borrow'd shapes embrace shun
 never bless sight thus unknown
 still speak accents own"
 goddess complaints made
 took path commands obey'd
 march obscure venus kindly shrouds
 mists persons involves clouds
 thus unseen passage none might stay
 force tell causes way
 part perform'd goddess flies sublime
 visit paphos native clime
 garlands ever green ever fair
 vows offer'd solemn pray'r
 hundred altars temple smoke
 thousand bleeding hearts pow'r invoke

 climb next ascent looking
 nearer distance view town
 prince wonder sees stately tow'rs
 late huts shepherds' homely bow'rs
 gates streets hears ev'ry part
 noise busy concourse mart
 toiling tyrians call
 ply labor extend wall
 build citadel brawny throng
 dig push unwieldly stones along
 dwellings choose spot ground
 first design'd ditches surround
 laws ordain attend choice
 holy senates elect voice
 design mole others
 lay deep foundations theater
 marble quarries mighty columns hew
 ornaments scenes future view
 toil busy pains
 exercise bees flow'ry plains
 winter past summer scarce begun
 invites forth labor sun
 lead youth abroad condense
 liquid store cells dispense
 gate stand ready receive
 golden burthen friends relieve
 united force combine drive
 lazy drones laborious hive
 envy stung view other's deeds
 fragrant work diligence proceeds
 "thrice happy whose walls already rise"
 aeneas said view'd lifted eyes
 lofty tow'rs entiring gate
 conceal'd clouds prodigious relate
 mix'd unmark'd among busy throng
 borne tide pass'd unseen along

 full center town stood
 thick set trees venerable wood
 tyrians landing near holy ground
 digging prosp'rous omen found
 earth courser's head drew
 growth future fortune foreshew
 fated sign foundress juno gave
 soil fruitful people brave
 sidonian dido solemn state
 juno's temple build consecrate
 enrich'd gifts golden shrine
 goddess made place divine
 brazen steps marble threshold rose
 brazen plates cedar beams inclose
 rafters brazen cov'rings crown'd
 lofty doors brazen hinges sound
 first aeneas place beheld
 reviv'd courage fear expell'd
 expecting queen rais'd
 wond'ring eyes round temple gaz'd
 admir'd fortune rising town
 striving artists arts' renown
 saw order painted wall
 whatever unhappy troy befall
 wars fame around world blown
 life ev'ry leader known
 agamemnon priam spies
 fierce achilles kings defies
 stopp'd weeping said "o friend ev'n
 monuments trojan woes appear
 known disasters fill ev'n foreign lands
 see old unhappy priam stands
 ev'n mute walls relate warrior's fame
 trojan griefs tyrians' pity claim"
 said tears ready passage find
 devouring saw well design'd
 empty picture fed mind
 saw fainting grecians yield
 trembling trojans quit field
 pursued fierce achilles thro' plain
 high chariot driving o'er slain
 tents rhesus next grief renew
 white sails betray'd nightly view
 wakeful diomede whose cruel sword
 sentries slew spar'd slumb'ring lord
 took fiery steeds ere yet food
 troy taste drink xanthian flood
 elsewhere saw troilus defied
 achilles unequal combat tried
 boy disarm'd loosen'd reins
 horses hurried o'er plains
 hung neck hair dragg'd around
 hostile spear yet sticking wound
 tracks blood inscrib'd dusty ground
 meantime trojan dames oppress'd woe
 pallas' fane long procession go
 hopes reconcile heav'nly foe
 weep beat breasts rend hair
 rich embroider'd vests presents bear
 stern goddess stands unmov'd pray'r
 thrice round trojan walls achilles drew
 corpse hector fight slew
 priam sues sums gold
 lifeless body son sold
 sad object well express'd
 drew sighs groans griev'd hero's breast
 see figure lifeless friend
 old sire helpless hand extend
 saw amidst grecian train
 mix'd bloody battle plain
 swarthy memnon arms knew
 pompous ensigns indian crew
 penthisilea haughty grace
 leads wars amazonian race
 right hands pointed dart wield
 left ward sustains lunar shield
 athwart breast golden belt throws
 amidst press alone provokes thousand foes
 dares maiden arms manly force oppose

 thus trojan prince employs eyes
 fix'd walls wonder surprise
 beauteous dido num'rous train
 pomp guards ascends sacred fane
 eurotas' banks cynthus' height
 diana seems charms sight
 dance graceful goddess leads
 choir nymphs overtops heads
 known quiver lofty mien
 walks majestic looks queen
 latona sees shine rest
 feeds secret joy silent breast
 dido becoming state
 amidst crowd walks serenely great
 labor future sway speeds
 passing gracious glance proceeds
 mounts throne high plac'd shrine
 crowds around swarming people join
 takes petitions dispenses laws
 hears determines ev'ry private cause
 tasks equal portions divides
 unequal lots decides
 another way chance aeneas bends
 eyes unexpected sees friends
 antheus sergestus grave cloanthus strong
 backs mighty trojan throng
 late tempest billows toss'd
 widely scatter'd another coast
 prince unseen surpris'd wonder stands
 longs joyful haste join hands
 doubtful wish'd event stays
 hollow cloud friends surveys
 impatient till told present state
 left ships fate
 came request
 sent commission'd rest
 sue leave land sickly men
 gain admission gracious queen
 ent'ring cries fill'd holy fane
 thus lowly voice ilioneus began

 "o queen indulg'd favor gods
 found empire new abodes
 build town statutes restrain
 wild inhabitants beneath thy reign
 wretched trojans toss'd ev'ry shore
 sea sea thy clemency implore
 forbid fires shipping deface
 receive th' unhappy fugitives grace
 spare remnant pious race
 come design wasteful prey
 drive country force swains away
 strength desire
 vanquish'd dare thoughts aspire
 land hesperia nam'd old
 soil fruitful men bold
 th' oenotrians held common fame
 call'd italia leader's name
 sweet region voyage bent
 winds ev'ry warring element
 disturb'd course far sight land
 cast torn vessels moving sand
 sea came south mighty roar
 dispers'd dash'd rest upon rocky shore
 see escap'd storm fear
 unless interpose shipwreck
 men monsters inhuman race
 laws barb'rous customs place
 shut desart shore drowning men
 drive us cruel seas
 hard fortune compassion draws
 hospitable rights human laws
 gods revenge cause
 aeneas prince juster lord
 nobler warrior never drew sword
 observant right religious word
 yet lives draws vital air
 friends safety shall despair
 great queen offices repent
 equal perhaps augment
 want cities sicilian coasts
 king acestes trojan lineage boasts
 permit ships shelter shores
 refitted woods planks oars
 prince safe may renew
 destin'd course italy pursue
 best men fates ordain
 thou art swallow'd libyan main
 young iulus
 dismiss navy friendly shore
 good acestes may return
 friends common losses mourn"
 thus spoke ilioneus trojan crew
 cries clamors request renew

 modest queen downcast eyes
 ponder'd speech briefly thus replies
 "trojans dismiss fears cruel fate
 doubts attending unsettled state
 force guard coast foreign foes
 heard story woes
 name fortune native place
 fame valor phrygian race
 tyrians devoid sense
 remote phoebus' influence
 whether latian shores course bent
 driv'n tempests first intent
 seek good acestes' government
 men shall receiv'd fleet repair'd
 sail ships convoy guard
 would stay join friendly pow'rs
 raise defend tyrian tow'rs
 wealth city
 would heav'n storm felt would bring
 carthaginian coasts wand'ring king
 people shall command explore
 ports creeks ev'ry winding shore
 towns wilds shady woods quest
 renown'd desir'd guest"

 rais'd mind trojan hero stood
 long'd break ambient cloud
 achates found thus urg'd way
 "from whence goddessborn long delay
 desire welcome sure
 fleet safety friends secure
 one wants saw vain
 oppose storm swallow'd main
 orontes fate forfeit paid
 rest agrees mother said"
 scarce spoken cloud gave way
 mists flew upward dissolv'd day

 trojan chief appear'd open sight
 august visage serenely bright
 mother goddess hands divine
 form'd curling locks made temples shine
 giv'n rolling eyes sparkling grace
 breath'd youthful vigor face
 like polish'd ivory beauteous behold
 parian marble enchas'd gold
 thus radiant circling cloud broke
 thus manly modesty spoke

 "he seek tempests toss'd
 sav'd shipwreck libyan coast
 presenting gracious queen throne
 prince owes life alone
 fair majesty refuge redress
 fate pursues wants oppress
 pious offices employ
 save relics abandon'd troy
 receive shipwreck'd friendly shore
 hospitable rites relieve poor
 associate town wand'ring train
 strangers palace entertain
 thanks wretched fugitives return
 scatter'd thro' world exile mourn
 gods gods goodness inclin'd
 acts mercy touch heav'nly mind
 gods gen'rous heart
 conscious worth requite desert
 age happy earth
 parents mortal gave birth
 rolling rivers seas shall run
 round space heav'n radiant sun
 trees mountain tops shades supply
 honor name praise shall never die
 whate'er abode fortune assign'd
 image shall present mind"
 thus said turn'd pious haste
 joyful expecting friends embrac'd
 right hand ilioneus grac'd
 serestus left breast
 cloanthus noble gyas press'd
 turns descended rest

 tyrian queen stood fix'd upon face
 pleas'd motions ravish'd grace
 admir'd fortunes admir'd man
 recollected stood thus began
 "what fate goddessborn angry pow'rs

 said palace led guest
 offer'd incense proclaim'd feast
 yet less careful absent friends
 twice ten fat oxen ships sends
 besides hundred boars hundred lambs
 bleating cries attend milky dams
 jars gen'rous wine spacious bowls
 gives cheer sailors' drooping souls
 purple hangings clothe palace walls
 sumptuous feasts made splendid halls

 eliza's veins gentle poison shed
 much fear'd tyrians doubletongued
 knew town juno's care belong'd
 thoughts night golden slumbers broke
 thus alarm'd winged love spoke
 "my son strength whose mighty pow'r alone

 sweet resemblance takes delight

 goddess young ascanius flies

 "scarce said mountain's brow
 saw giant shepherd stalk
 following flock leading shore
 monstrous bulk deform'd depriv'd sight
 staff trunk pine guide steps aright
 pond'rous whistle neck descends
 woolly care pensive lord attends
 solace hard fortune sends
 soon reach'd shore touch'd waves
 bor'd eye gutt'ring blood laves
 gnash'd teeth groan'd thro' seas strides
 scarce topmost billows touch'd sides

 "seiz'd sudden fear run sea

 th' ionian deep durst farther wade
 roar'd aloud dreadful cry
 shakes earth air seas billows fly
 bellowing noise distant italy
 neigh'ring aetna trembling around
 winding caverns echo sound
 brother cyclops hear yelling roar
 rushing mountains crowd shore
 saw stern distorted looks far

 book iv

 anxious cares already seiz'd queen
 fed within veins flame unseen
 hero's valor acts birth inspire
 soul love fan secret fire
 words looks imprinted heart
 improve passion increase smart
 purple morn chas'd away
 dewy shadows restor'd day
 sister first early care sought
 thus mournful accents eas'd thought

 "my dearest anna new dreams affright
 lab'ring soul visions night
 disturb quiet distract breast
 strange ideas trojan guest
 worth actions majestic air
 man descended gods declare
 fear ever argues degenerate kind
 birth well asserted mind
 suffer'd fate betray'd
 brave attempts falling troy made
 looks gracefully spoke
 resolv'd yoke
 hapless marriage never curst
 second love fatal first
 one error might yield
 since sichaeus untimely slain
 man able subvert
 fix'd foundations stubborn heart
 confess frailty shame
 somewhat find within
 like sparkles former flame
 first let yawning earth passage rend
 let thro' dark abyss descend
 first let avenging jove flames high
 drive body nether sky
 condemn'd ghosts endless night lie
 break plighted faith gave
 vows shall ever
 lov'd earth worship grave"

 said tears ran gushing eyes
 stopp'd speech sister thus replies
 "o dearer vital air breathe
 grief blooming years bequeath
 condemn'd waste woes lonely life
 without joys mother wife
 think tears pompous train woe
 known valued ghosts
 grant sorrows yet green
 well became woman queen
 vows tyrian princes neglect
 scorn hyarbas love reject
 libyan lords mighty name
 fight pleasing flame
 little spot land heav'n bestows
 ev'ry side hemm'd warlike foes
 gaetulian cities spread around
 fierce numidians frontiers bound
 lies barren waste thirsty land
 syrtes raise moving sand
 barcaean troops besiege narrow shore
 sea pygmalion threatens
 propitious heav'n gracious juno lead
 wand'ring navy needful aid
 empire spread city rise
 union allies
 implore favor pow'rs
 leave conduct rest love
 continue still hospitable way
 still invent occasions stay
 till storms winter winds shall cease threat
 planks oars repair shatter'd fleet"

 words friend sister came
 ease resolv'd scruples fame
 added fury kindled flame
 inspir'd hope project pursue
 ev'ry altar sacrifice renew
 chosen ewe two years old pay
 ceres bacchus god day
 preferring juno's pow'r juno ties
 nuptial knot makes marriage joys
 beauteous queen altar stands
 holds golden goblet hands
 milkwhite heifer flow'rs adorns
 pours ruddy wine betwixt horns
 priests pray'r gods invoke
 feeds altars sabaean smoke
 hourly care sacrifice renews
 anxiously panting entrails views
 priestly rites alas pious art
 vows avail cure bleeding heart
 gentle fire feeds within veins
 soft god secure silence reigns

 sick desire seeking loves
 street street raving dido roves
 watchful shepherd blind
 wounds random shaft careless hind
 distracted pain flies woods
 bounds o'er lawn seeks silent floods
 fruitless care still fatal dart
 sticks side rankles heart
 leads trojan chief along
 lofty walls amidst busy throng
 displays tyrian wealth rising town
 love without labor makes
 pomp shows tempt wand'ring guest
 falt'ring tongue forbids speak rest
 day declines feasts renew night
 still face feeds famish'd sight
 longs hear prince relate
 adventures trojan fate
 tells o'er o'er still vain
 still begs hear
 hearer speaker's mouth depends
 thus tragic story never ends

 part phoebe's paler light
 withdraws falling stars sleep invite
 last remains ev'ry guest gone
 sits bed press'd sighs alone
 absent absent hero sees hears
 bosom young ascanius bears
 seeks father's image child
 love likeness might beguil'd

 meantime rising tow'rs stand
 labors exercise youthful band
 use arts toils arms know
 mole left unfinish'd foe
 mounds works walls neglected lie
 short promis'd heighth seem'd threat sky

 imperial juno
 saw dido fetter'd chains love
 hot venom veins inflam'd
 sense shame reclaim'd
 soothing words venus begun
 "high praises endless honors
 mighty trophies worthy son
 two gods silly woman undone
 ignorant suspect
 rising city hands erect
 shall celestial discord never cease
 't better ended lasting peace
 stand possess'd soul desir'd
 poor dido consuming love fir'd
 trojan tyrian let us join
 dido shall aeneas mine
 one common kingdom one united line
 eliza shall dardan lord obey
 lofty carthage dow'r convey"
 venus hidden fraud descried
 would scepter world misguide
 libyan shores thus artfully replied
 "who fool would wars juno choose
 alliance gifts refuse
 fortune joint desires comply
 doubt jove destiny
 lest forbid absolute command
 mix people one common land
 trojan tyrian line
 lasting leagues sure succession join
 partner bed throne
 may move mind wishes own"

 "mine" said imperial juno "be care
 time urges perfect affair
 attend counsel secret share
 next sun rising light displays
 gilds world purple rays
 queen aeneas tyrian court
 shall shady woods sylvan game resort
 huntsmen pitch toils around
 cheerful horns side side resound
 pitchy cloud shall cover plain
 hail thunder tempestuous rain
 fearful train shall take speedy flight
 dispers'd involv'd gloomy night
 one cave grateful shelter shall afford
 fair princess trojan lord
 bridal bed prepare
 bless nuptials
 shall loves crown'd due delights
 hymen shall present rites"
 queen love consents closely smiles
 vain project discover'd wiles

 rosy morn risen main
 horns hounds awake princely train
 issue early thro' city gate
 wakeful huntsmen ready wait
 nets toils darts beside force
 spartan dogs swift massylian horse
 tyrian peers officers state
 slow queen antechambers wait
 lofty courser court
 majestic rider seems know
 proud purple trappings paws ground
 champs golden bit spreads foam around
 queen length appears either hand
 brawny guards martial order stand
 flow'r'd simar golden fringe wore
 back golden quiver bore
 flowing hair golden caul restrains
 golden clasp tyrian robe sustains
 young ascanius sprightly grace
 leads trojan youth view chase
 far rest beauty shines
 great aeneas troop joins
 like fair apollo leaves frost
 wint'ry xanthus lycian coast
 native delos resorts
 ordains dances renews sports
 painted scythians mix'd cretan bands
 joyful altars join hands
 cynthus walking sees
 merry madness sacred show
 green wreaths bays length hair inclose
 golden fillet binds awful brows
 quiver sounds less prince seen
 manly presence lofty mien

 reach'd hills storm'd seat
 salvage beasts dens last retreat
 cry pursues mountain goats bound
 rock rock keep craggy ground
 quite otherwise stags trembling train
 herds unsingled scour dusty plain
 long chase open view maintain
 glad ascanius courser guides
 spurs thro' vale outrides
 horse's flanks sides forc'd feel
 clanking lash goring steel
 impatiently views feeble prey
 wishing nobler beast cross way
 rather would tusky boar attend
 see tawny lion downward bend

 meantime gath'ring clouds obscure skies
 pole pole forky lightning flies
 rattling thunders roll juno pours
 wintry deluge sounding show'rs
 company dispers'd converts ride
 seek homely cots mountain's hollow side
 rapid rains descending hills
 rolling torrents raise creeping rills
 queen prince love fortune guides
 one common cavern bosom hides
 first trembling earth signal gave
 flashing fires enlighten cave
 hell juno
 howling nymphs conscious love
 illomen'd hour time arose
 debate death succeeding woes

 queen sense honor could move
 longer made secret love
 call'd marriage specious name
 veil crime sanctify shame

 loud report thro' libyan cities goes
 fame great ill small beginnings grows
 swift first ev'ry moment brings
 new vigor flights new pinions wings
 soon grows pigmy gigantic size
 feet earth forehead skies
 inrag'd gods revengeful earth
 produc'd last titanian birth
 swift walk swift winged haste
 monstrous phantom horrible vast
 many plumes raise lofty flight
 many piercing eyes inlarge sight
 millions opening mouths fame belong
 ev'ry mouth furnish'd tongue
 round list'ning ears flying plague hung
 fills peaceful universe cries
 slumbers ever close wakeful eyes
 day lofty tow'rs head shews
 spreads thro' trembling crowds disastrous news
 court informers haunts royal spies
 things done relates done feigns mingles truth lies

 talk business chief delight
 tell prodigies cause affright
 fills people's ears dido's name
 lost honor sense shame
 admits throne nuptial bed
 wand'ring guest country fled
 whole days passes delights
 wastes luxury long winter nights
 forgetful fame royal trust
 dissolv'd ease abandon'd lust

 goddess widely spreads loud report
 flies length king hyarba's court
 first possess'd unwelcome news
 men gods accuse
 prince ravish'd garamantis born
 hundred temples spoils adorn
 ammon's honor celestial sire
 hundred altars fed wakeful fire
 thro' vast dominions priests ordain'd
 whose watchful care holy rites maintain'd
 gates columns garlands crown'd
 blood victim beasts enrich'd ground

 heard fugitive could move
 tyrian princess disdain'd love
 breast fury burn'd eyes fire
 mad despair impatient desire
 sacred altars pouring wine
 thus pray'rs implor'd sire divine
 "great jove propitious moorish race
 feast painted beds off'rings grace
 thy temples adore thy pow'r divine
 blood victims sparkling wine
 seest thou fear vain
 thy boasted thunder thy thoughtless reign
 thy broad hands forky lightnings lance
 thine bolts blind work chance
 wand'ring woman builds within state
 little town bought easy rate
 pays homage grants allow
 narrow space libyan lands plow
 yet scorning passion blindly led
 admits banish'd trojan bed
 paris train
 conquer'd cowards must afric reign
 looks garb confess
 locks oil perfum'd lydian dress
 takes spoil enjoys princely dame
 rejected adore empty name"

 vows haughty terms thus preferr'd
 held altar's horns mighty thund'rer heard
 cast eyes carthage found
 lustful pair lawless pleasure drown'd
 lost loves insensible shame
 forgetful better fame
 calls cyllenius god attends
 menacing command sends
 "go mount western winds cleave sky
 swift descent carthage fly
 find trojan chief wastes days
 slothful riot inglorious ease
 minds future city giv'n fate
 message mouth relate
 'not fair venus hop'd twice
 thy life pray'rs promis'd son
 hero destin'd command
 martial race rule latian land
 ancient line teucer draw

 glory cannot move mind mean
 future praise fading pleasure wean
 yet defraud son fame
 grudge romans immortal name
 vain designs hopes
 long ling'ring hostile shore
 regardless redeem honor lost
 race gain th' ausonian coast
 bid speed tyrian court forsake
 command slumb'ring warrior wake"

 hermes obeys golden pinions binds
 flying feet mounts western winds
 whether o'er seas earth flies
 rapid force bear skies
 first grasps within awful hand
 mark sov'reign pow'r magic wand
 draws ghosts hollow graves
 drives stygian waves
 seals sleep wakeful sight
 eyes tho' clos'd death restores light
 thus arm'd god begins airy race
 drives racking clouds along liquid space
 sees tops atlas flies
 whose brawny back supports starry skies
 atlas whose head piny forests crown'd
 beaten winds foggy vapors bound
 snows hide shoulders beneath chin
 founts rolling streams race begin
 beard ice large breast depends
 pois'd upon wings god descends
 rested thus tow'ring height
 plung'd downward precipitated flight
 lights seas skims along flood
 waterfowl seek fishy food
 less yet less distant prospect show
 turns dance aloft dive
 like steerage wings plies
 near surface water flies
 till pass'd seas cross'd sands
 clos'd wings stoop'd libyan lands
 shepherds hous'd homely sheds
 tow'rs within clouds advance heads
 arriving found trojan prince
 new ramparts raising town's defense
 purple scarf gold embroider'd o'er
 queen dido's gift waist wore
 sword glitt'ring gems diversified
 ornament use hung idly side

 thus winged words god began
 resuming shape "degenerate man
 thou woman's property mak'st thou
 foreign walls tyrian tow'rs rear
 forgetful thy allpow'rful jove
 sways world heav'n
 sent severe command
 means thy ling'ring libyan land
 glory cannot move mind mean
 future praise flitting pleasure wean
 regard fortunes thy rising heir
 promis'd crown let young ascanius wear
 th' ausonian scepter state
 rome's imperial name ow'd fate"
 spoke god speaking took flight
 involv'd clouds vanish'd sight

 pious prince seiz'd sudden fear
 mute tongue upright stood hair
 revolving mind stern command
 longs fly loathes charming land
 say begin
 course alas remains steer
 th' offended lover pow'rful queen
 way turns anxious mind
 expedients tries none find
 fix'd deed doubtful means
 long thought advice leans
 three chiefs calls commands repair
 fleet ship men silent care
 plausible pretense bids find
 color secret design'd
 meantime softest hours would choose
 lovesick lady heard news
 move tender mind slow degrees
 suffer sov'reign pow'r decrees
 jove inspire say
 hear pleasure haste obey

 soon queen perceives thin disguise
 arts blind jealous woman's eyes
 first find secret fraud
 fatal news blaz'd abroad
 love first motions lover hears
 quick presage ev'n safety fears
 impious fame wanting report
 ships repair'd trojans' thick resort
 purpose forsake tyrian court
 frantic fear impatient wound
 impotent mind roves city round
 less wild bacchanalian dames appear
 afar nightly god hear
 howl hills shake wreathy spear
 length finds dear perfidious man
 prevents form'd excuse thus began
 "base ungrateful could hope fly
 undiscover'd scape lover's eye
 could kindness compassion move
 plighted vows dearer bands love
 death despairing queen
 worth preventing tho' well foreseen
 ev'n wintry winds command stay
 dare tempests defy sea
 false suppose bound
 lands unknown foreign coasts sound
 troy restor'd priam's happy reign
 durst tempt troy raging main
 see fly foe shun
 holy vows late begun
 right hand since nothing
 challenge faith gave
 beg tears truly shed
 new pleasures nuptial bed
 ever dido kind
 pleasing eyes touch'd mind
 pray'rs pray'rs may yet place
 pity fortunes falling race
 provok'd tyrant's hate
 incens'd libyan tyrian state
 alone suffer fame
 bereft honor expos'd shame
 trust ungrateful guest
 name remains rest
 left whither fly
 must attend pygmalion's cruelty
 till hyarba shall triumph lead
 queen proudly scorn'd proffer'd bed
 deferr'd least hasty flight
 left behind pledge delight
 babe bless mother's mournful sight
 young aeneas supply place
 whose features might express father's face
 complain live bereft
 husband wholly left"

 paus'd queen unmov'd holds eyes
 jove's command suffer'd love rise
 tho' heaving heart thus length replies
 "fair queen never enough repeat
 boundless favors debt
 mind forget eliza's name
 vital breath inspires mortal frame
 let speak defense
 never hop'd secret flight hence
 much less pretended lawful claim
 sacred nuptials husband's name
 indulgent heav'n would leave free
 submit life fate's decree
 choice would lead trojan shore
 relics review dust adore
 priam's ruin'd palace restore
 delphian oracle commands
 fate invites latian lands
 promis'd place steer
 vows terminated
 tyrian stranger born
 walls tow'rs libyan town adorn
 may like foreign race
 like seek shelter foreign place
 often night obscures skies
 humid shades twinkling stars arise
 anchises' angry ghost dreams appears
 chides delay fills soul fears
 young ascanius justly may complain
 defrauded destin'd reign
 ev'n herald gods appear'd
 waking saw message heard
 jove came commission'd heav'nly bright
 radiant beams manifest sight
 sender sent attest
 walls enter'd words express'd
 fair queen oppose gods command
 forc'd fate leave happy land"

 thus spoke already began
 sparkling eyes view guilty man
 head foot survey'd person o'er
 longer outrageous threats forebore
 "false thou art false forsworn
 sprung noble blood goddessborn
 hewn harden'd entrails rock
 rough hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck
 fawn worse fear
 look lent list'ning ear
 sigh'd sobb'd shed one kindly tear
 symptoms base ungrateful mind
 foul worse 'tis hard find
 man's injustice complain
 gods jove behold vain
 triumphant treason yet thunder flies
 juno views wrongs equal eyes
 faithless earth faithless skies
 justice fled truth
 sav'd shipwrack'd exile shore
 needful food hungry trojans fed
 took traitor throne bed
 fool 't little repeat
 rest stor'd rigg'd ruin'd fleet
 rave rave god's command pleads
 makes heav'n accessary deeds
 lycian lots delian god
 hermes employ'd jove's abode
 warn hence peaceful state
 heav'nly pow'rs touch'd human fate
 go thy flight longer detain
 go seek thy promis'd kingdom thro' main
 yet heav'ns hear pious vow
 faithless waves half false thou
 secret sands shall sepulchers afford
 thy proud vessels perjur'd lord
 shalt thou call injur'd dido's name
 dido shall come black sulph'ry flame
 death dissolv'd mortal frame
 shall smile see traitor vainly weep
 angry ghost arising deep
 shall haunt thee waking disturb thy sleep
 least shade thy punishment shall know
 fame shall spread pleasing news below"

 abruptly stops turns away
 loathing eyes shuns sight day
 amaz'd stood revolving mind
 speech frame excuse find
 fearful maids fainting mistress led
 softly laid ivory bed

 good aeneas tho' much desir'd
 give pity grief requir'd
 tho' much mourn'd labor'd love
 resolv'd length obeys jove
 reviews forces early care
 unmoor vessels sea prepare
 fleet soon afloat pride
 wellcalk'd galleys harbor ride
 oaks oars fell'd stood
 green arms despoil'd growing wood
 studious flight beach cover'd o'er
 trojan bands blacken shore
 ev'ry side seen descending
 thick swarms soldiers loaden town
 thus battalia march embodied ants
 fearful winter future wants
 t' invade corn cells convey
 plunder'd forage yellow prey
 sable troops along narrow tracks
 scarce bear weighty burthen backs
 set shoulders pond'rous grain
 guard spoil lash lagging train
 ply sev'ral tasks equal toil sustain

 pangs tender breast dido tore
 tow'r saw cover'd shore
 heard shouts sailors afar
 mix'd murmurs wat'ry war
 allpow'rful love changes canst thou cause
 human hearts subjected thy laws
 haughty soul tyrant bends
 pray'rs mean submissions descends
 female arts aids left untried
 counsels unexplor'd died
 "look anna look trojans crowd sea
 spread canvas anchors weigh
 shouting crew ships garlands bind
 invoke sea gods invite wind
 could thought threat'ning blow near
 tender soul forewarn'd bear
 last request deny
 yon perfidious man int'rest try

 fav'rite alone find
 dark recesses inmost mind

 nuptials disclaims urge
 let pursue promis'd latian shore
 short delay ask
 pause grief interval woe
 till soft soul temper'd sustain
 accustom'd sorrows inur'd pain
 pity grant one request
 death shall glut hatred breast"
 mournful message pious anna bears
 seconds sister's tears
 arts still employ'd vain
 comes refus'd
 harden'd heart pray'rs threat'nings move
 fate god stopp'd ears love

 winds airy quarrel try
 justling ev'ry quarter sky
 way mountain oak bend
 boughs shatter branches rend
 leaves falling mast spread ground
 hollow valleys echo sound
 unmov'd royal plant fury mocks
 shaken clings closely rocks
 far shoots tow'ring head high
 deep earth fix'd foundations lie
 less storm trojan hero bears
 thick messages loud complaints hears
 bandied words still beating ears
 sighs groans tears proclaim inward pains
 firm purpose heart remains

 wretched queen pursued cruel fate
 begins length light heav'n hate
 loathes live dire portents sees
 hasten death soul decrees
 strange relate shrine
 pours sacrifice purple wine
 purple wine turn'd putrid blood
 white offer'd milk converts mud
 dire presage alone reveal'd
 ev'n sister conceal'd
 marble temple stood within grove
 sacred death murther'd love
 honor'd chapel hung around
 snowy fleeces garlands crown'd
 oft visited lonely dome
 strange voices issued husband's tomb
 thought heard summon away
 invite grave chide stay
 hourly 't heard boding note
 solitary screech owl strains throat
 chimney's top turret's height
 songs obscene disturbs silence night
 besides old prophecies augment fears
 stern aeneas dreams appears
 disdainful day seems alone
 wander sleep thro' ways unknown
 guideless dark desart plain
 seek subjects seek vain
 like pentheus distracted fear
 saw two suns double thebes appear
 mad orestes mother's ghost
 full face infernal torches toss'd
 shook snaky locks shuns sight
 flies o'er stage surpris'd mortal fright
 furies guard door intercept flight

 sinking underneath load grief
 death alone seeks last relief
 time means resolv'd within breast
 mournful sister thus address'd
 dissembling hope cloudy front clears
 false vigor eyes appears
 "rejoice" said "instructed
 lover shall gain lose love
 nigh rising atlas next falling sun
 long tracts ethiopian climates run
 massylian priestess found
 honor'd age magic arts renown'd
 th' hesperian temple trusted care
 't supplied wakeful dragon's fare
 poppy seeds honey taught steep
 reclaim'd rage sooth'd sleep
 watch'd golden fruit charms unbind
 chains love fix mind
 stops torrents leaves channel dry
 repels stars backward bears sky
 yawning earth rebellows call
 pale ghosts ascend mountain ashes fall
 witness ye gods thou better part
 loth try impious art
 within secret court silent care
 erect lofty pile expos'd air
 hang topmost part trojan vest
 spoils arms presents faithless guest
 next bridal bed plac'd
 ruin arms embrac'd
 relics wretch doom'd fire
 priestess charms require"

 thus far said farther speech forbears
 mortal paleness face appears
 yet mistrustless anna could find
 secret fun'ral rites design'd
 thought dire rage possess'd mind
 unknowing train conceal'd well
 fear'd worse sichaeus fell
 therefore obeys fatal pile rear
 within secret court expos'd air
 cloven holms pines heap'd high
 garlands hollow spaces lie
 sad cypress vervain yew compose wreath
 ev'ry baleful green denoting death
 queen determin'd fatal deed
 spoils sword left order spread
 man's image nuptial bed

 sacred altars plac'd around
 priestess enters hair unbound
 thrice invokes pow'rs ground
 night erebus chaos proclaims
 threefold hecate hundred names
 three dianas next sprinkles round
 feign'd avernian drops hallow'd ground
 culls hoary simples found phoebe's light
 brazen sickles reap'd noon night
 mixes baleful juices bowl
 cuts forehead newborn foal
 robbing mother's love destin'd queen
 observes assisting rites obscene
 leaven'd cake devoted hands
 holds next highest altar stands
 one tender foot shod bare
 girt gather'd gown loose hair
 thus dress'd summon'd dying breath
 heav'ns planets conscious death
 ev'ry pow'r rules
 minds revenges injur'd love

 "'t dead night weary bodies close
 eyes balmy sleep soft repose
 winds longer whisper thro' woods
 murm'ring tides disturb gentle floods
 stars silent order mov'd around
 peace downy wings brooding ground
 flocks herds partycolor'd fowl
 haunt woods swim weedy pool
 stretch'd quiet earth securely lay
 forgetting past labors day
 else nature's common gift partake
 unhappy dido alone awake
 sleep ease furious queen find
 sleep fled eyes quiet fled mind
 despair rage love divide heart
 despair rage love greater part

 thus said within secret mind
 "what shall succor find
 become suppliant hyarba's pride
 take turn court denied
 shall ungrateful trojan go
 forsake empire attend foe
 refug'd train reliev'd
 't true sure receiv'd
 gratitude trojan souls place

 drew reluctant native shore

 rather steel thy guilty breast invade
 take fortune thou thyself hast made
 pity sister first seduc'd mind
 seconded well design'd
 dearbought pleasures never known
 continued free still
 avoiding love found despair
 shar'd salvage beasts common air
 like lonely life might led
 mourn'd living disturb'd dead"
 thoughts brooded anxious breast
 board trojan found easy rest
 resolv'd sail sleep pass'd night
 order'd things early flight

 winged god appears
 former youthful mien shape wears
 new alarm invades ears
 "sleep'st thou goddessborn canst thou drown
 thy needful cares near hostile town
 beset foes hear'st western gales
 invite thy passage inspire thy sails
 harbors heart furious hate
 thou shalt find dire effects late
 fix'd revenge obstinate die
 haste swiftly hence thou hast pow'r fly
 sea ships soon cover'd o'er
 blazing firebrands kindle shore
 prevent rage night obscures skies
 sail purple morn arise
 knows hazards thy delay may bring
 woman's various changeful thing"
 thus hermes dream took flight
 aloft air unseen mix'd night

 twice warn'd celestial messenger
 pious prince arose hasty fear
 rous'd drowsy train without delay
 "haste banks crooked anchors weigh
 spread flying sails stand sea
 god commands stood sight
 urg'd us speedy flight
 sacred pow'r pow'r soe'er thou art
 thy blest orders resign heart
 lead thou way protect thy trojan bands
 prosper design thy commands"
 said drawing forth flaming sword
 thund'ring arm divides manytwisted cord
 emulating zeal inspires train
 run snatch rush main
 headlong haste leave desert shores
 brush liquid seas lab'ring oars

 aurora left saffron bed
 beams early light heav'ns o'erspread
 tow'r queen wakeful eyes
 saw day point upward rosy skies
 look'd seaward sea void
 scarce ken sailing ships descried
 stung despite furious despair
 struck trembling breast tore hair
 "and shall th' ungrateful traitor go" said
 "my land forsaken love betray'd
 shall arm rush ev'ry street

 said within anxious mind weighs
 means cutting short odious days
 sichaeus' nurse briefly said
 left country dead
 "go barce call sister let care
 solemn rites sacrifice prepare
 sheep th' atoning off'rings bring
 sprinkling body crystal spring
 living drops let come thou
 sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow
 thus pay vows stygian jove
 end cares disastrous love

 burns passions shall expire"

 nurse moves onward officious care
 speed aged limbs bear
 furious dido dark thoughts involv'd
 shook mighty mischief resolv'd
 livid spots distinguish'd face
 red rolling eyes discompos'd pace
 ghastly gaz'd pain drew breath
 nature shiver'd approaching death

 swiftly fatal place pass'd
 mounts fun'ral pile furious haste
 unsheathes sword trojan left behind
 dire enterprise design'd
 view'd garments loosely spread

 casting back eyes dire amaze

 fate dido fire divin'd
 knew stormy souls womankind
 secret springs eager passions move
 capable death injur'd love
 dire auguries hence trojans draw
 till neither fires shining shores saw

 said among spoils draws
 pond'rous shaggy mane golden paws

 nisus envy sees gift grieves
 "if rewards vanquish'd men due"

 acestes fir'd disdain see
 palm usurp'd without victory
 reproach'd entellus thus sate beside

 entellus thus "my soul still

 great aeneas acestes join

 "what fury seiz'd friend gods" said
 "to propitious averse thee

 gauntlet fight thus ended shore
 faithful friends unhappy dares bore

 reasons friend's experience join'd
 encourag'd much disturb'd mind

 't dead night slumb'ring eyes
 father's shade descended skies
 thus spoke "o vital breath
 lov'd liv'd dear ev'n death
 son various toils troubles toss'd
 king heav'n employs careful ghost
 commands god sav'd fire
 flaming fleet heard desire
 wholesome counsel friend receive
 coward train woman leave
 chosen youth nobly dare
 transport tempt dangers war
 stern italians courage try
 rough manners minds high
 first pluto's palace shall go

 impious ghosts soul remains

 breathes living air soft elysian plains
 chaste sibylla shall steps convey

 shall know realms gods assign

 said mix'd shades took airy flight
 "whither fast" filial duty cried
 "and ah wish'd embrace denied"

 said rose holy zeal inspires

 anchises last honor'd god
 priest added annual gifts bestow'd
 groves planted round blest abode
 nine days pass feasts temples crown'd
 fumes incense fanes abound
 south arose gentle breeze
 curl'd smoothness glassy seas
 rising winds ruffling gale afford
 call merry mariners aboard

 loud laments along shores resound
 parting friends close embraces bound
 trembling women degenerate train
 shunn'd frightful dangers main
 ev'n desire sail take share
 rough passage promis'd war
 good aeneas cheers recommends
 new master's care fearful friends
 eryx's altars three fat calves lays
 lamb newfallen stormy seas
 slips haulsers anchors weighs
 high deck godlike hero stands
 olive crown'd charger hands
 cast reeking entrails brine
 pour'd sacrifice purple wine
 fresh gales arise equal strokes vie
 brush buxom seas o'er billows fly

 meantime mother goddess full fears
 neptune thus address'd tender tears
 "the pride jove's imperious queen rage
 malice suff'rings assuage
 compel pray'rs since neither fate
 time pity remove hate
 ev'n jove thwarted haughty wife
 still vanquish'd yet still renews strife
 't little consume town
 aw'd world wore th' imperial crown
 prosecutes ghost troy pains

 let causes hatred tell

 thus mighty ruler main
 "what may venus hope neptune's reign
 kingdom claims birth late defense
 indanger'd fleet may claim confidence
 less land sea deeds declare
 much lov'd aeneas care
 thee xanthus thee simois attest
 trojan troops proud achilles press'd

 ev'n secur'd sought joy
 vow'd destruction ungrateful troy

 thus arm'd hopes anxious mind
 finny team saturnian neptune join'd

 loosen'd reins permits laws
 high waves azure car guides
 axles thunder sea subsides
 smooth ocean rolls silent tides
 tempests fly father's face
 trains inferior gods triumph grace
 monster whales master play

 smiling hope sweet vicissitude

 calls raise masts sheets display

 steeds night travel'd half sky
 drowsy rowers benches lie
 soft god sleep easy flight
 descends draws behind trail light
 thou palinurus art destin'd prey
 thee alone takes fatal way
 dire dreams thee iron sleep bears
 lighting thy prow form phorbas wears
 thus traitor god began tale
 "the winds friend inspire pleasing gale
 ships without thy care securely sail
 steal hour sweet repose
 take rudder thy room supply"
 yawning pilot half asleep
 "me dost thou bid trust treach'rous deep
 harlot smiles dissembling face
 faith commit trojan race
 shall believe siren south
 oft betray'd know monster main"
 said fasten'd hands rudder keep
 fix'd heav'n eyes repel invading sleep
 god wroth temples threw
 branch lethe dipp'd drunk stygian dew
 pilot vanquish'd pow'r divine
 soon clos'd swimming eyes lay supine
 scarce limbs extended length
 god insulting superior strength
 fell heavy plung'd sea
 stern rudder tore away
 headlong fell struggling main
 cried helping hands cried vain
 victor daemon mounts obscure air
 ship sails without pilot's care
 neptune's faith floating fleet relies
 man forsook god supplies
 o'er dang'rous deep secure navy flies
 glides sirens' cliffs shelfy coast
 long infamous ships sailors lost
 white bones th' impetuous ocean roars
 rocks rebellow sounding shores
 watchful hero felt knocks found
 tossing vessel sail'd shoaly ground
 sure pilot's loss takes
 helm steers aloof shuns shelf
 inly griev'd groaning breast
 deplor'd death thus pain express'd
 "for faith repos'd seas flatt'ring sky
 thy naked corpse doom'd shores unknown lie"

 "son anchises offspring gods"

 trojan chief forward pace repress'd
 revolving anxious thoughts within breast
 saw friends whelm'd beneath waves
 fun'ral honors claim'd ask'd quiet graves

 scarce said prophetess began
 "what hopes delude thee miserable man
 think'st thou thus unintomb'd cross floods

 admir'd destin'd off'ring queen
 venerable gift rarely seen
 fury thus appeas'd puts land

 trojan hero hardly knew
 obscure shades doubtful view
 doubtful sees thro' dusky night
 thinks sees moon's uncertain light
 tears first approach'd sullen shade
 love inspir'd thus said
 "unhappy queen common breath

 refulgent arms flash'd thro' shady plain
 fled wellknown face wonted fear
 thund'ring sword pointed spear
 drove headlong ships glean'd routed rear
 rais'd feeble cry trembling notes
 weak voice deceiv'd gasping throats

 priam's son deiphobus found
 whose face limbs one continued wound
 dishonest lopp'd arms youth appears
 spoil'd nose shorten'd ears
 scarcely knew striving disown
 blotted form blushing known
 therefore first began "o teucer's race
 durst thy faultless figure thus deface
 heart could wish hand inflict dire disgrace
 'twas fam'd last fatal night

 ghost replied "your piety paid

 know deluding joys pass'd
 night heav'n decreed last
 fatal horse descending

 feign'd nocturnal orgies left bed

 waving high torch signal made
 rous'd grecians ambuscade
 watching overworn cares oppress'd
 unhappy laid rest
 heavy sleep weary limbs possess'd
 meantime worthy wife arms mislaid
 beneath head sword convey'd
 door unlatch'd repeated calls
 invites former lord within walls
 thus crime confidence plac'd
 new treasons would redeem past

 thus talk flying hours pass
 sun finish'd half race
 perhaps words tears spent
 little time stay heav'n lent
 thus sibyl chides long delay
 "night rushes headlong drives day
 't different paths way divides
 right pluto's golden palace guides
 left unhappy region tends
 depth tartarus descends
 seat night profound punish'd fiends"
 thus deiphobus "o sacred maid
 forbear chide obey'd
 lo secret shadows retire
 pay penance till years expire
 proceed auspicious prince glory crown'd
 born better fates found"
 said said steps turn'd
 secret shadows silence mourn'd

 hero looking left espied

 adamantine columns threats sky
 vain force man heav'n's vain
 crush pillars pile sustain
 sublime tow'r steel rear'd
 dire tisiphone keeps ward
 girt sanguine gown night day
 observant souls pass downward way
 hence heard groans ghosts pains
 sounding lashes dragging chains
 trojan stood astonish'd cries
 ask'd guide whence yells arise
 crimes tortures
 loud laments rent liquid air

 thus replied "the chaste holy race
 forbidden polluted place
 hecate gave rule woods
 led trembling thro' dire abodes
 taught tortures th' avenging gods
 realms unrelenting fate
 awful rhadamanthus rules state
 hears judges committed crime
 enquires manner place time
 conscious wretch must acts reveal

 thus said sinks beneath ground

 wand'ring thro' woods wilds devious ways
 arts trojan match delays
 feign'd rites bacchus cried aloud
 buxom god virgin vow'd
 "evoe bacchus" thus began song
 "evoe" answer'd female throng
 "o virgin worthy thee alone" cried
 "o worthy thee alone" crew replied
 "for thee feeds hair leads thy dance
 thy winding ivy wreathes lance"
 like fury seiz'd rest progress known
 seek mountains forsake town
 clad skins beasts jav'lin bear
 give wanton winds flowing hair
 shrieks shoutings rend suff'ring air
 queen inspir'd rage divine
 shook high head flaming pine
 roll'd haggard eyes around throng
 sung turnus' name nuptial song
 "io ye latian dames
 hold unhappy queen amata dear
 here" said "who dare maintain
 right think name mother vain
 unbind fillets loose flowing hair
 orgies nocturnal rites prepare"

 amata's breast fury thus invades
 fires rage amid sylvan shades
 found venom spread far
 royal house embroil'd civil war
 rais'd dusky wings cleaves skies
 seeks palace young turnus lies
 town fame reports built old
 danae pregnant almighty gold
 fled father's rage train
 following argives thro' stormy main
 driv'n southern blasts fated reign
 't ardua ardea's name bears
 fair city consum'd years
 lofty palace turnus lay
 betwixt confines night day
 secure sleep fury laid aside
 looks limbs new methods tried
 foulness th' infernal form hide
 propp'd staff takes trembling mien
 face furrow'd front obscene
 deepdinted wrinkles cheek draws
 sunk eyes toothless jaws
 hoary hair holy fillets bound
 temples olive wreath crown'd
 old chalybe kept sacred fane
 juno seem'd thus began
 appearing dream rouse careless man
 "shall turnus endless toil sustain
 fighting fields conquer towns vain
 win trojan head wear prize
 usurp thy crown enjoy thy victories

 king transfers foreign heirs sought
 go deluded man seek
 new toils new dangers dusty plain
 repel tuscan foes city seize
 protect latians luxurious ease
 dream allpow'rful juno sends bear
 mighty mandates words hear
 haste arm ardeans issue plain
 fate friend assault trojan train
 thoughtless chiefs painted ships lie
 tiber's mouth fire sword destroy
 latian king unless shall submit
 old promise new forget
 let arms pow'r turnus prove
 learn fear disdains love
 heav'n's command" youthful prince
 scorn replied made bold defense
 "you tell mother knew
 phrygian fleet landed shore
 neither fear provoke war
 fate juno's peculiar care
 time made dote vainly tell
 arms imagin'd lonely cell
 go temple gods care
 permit men thought peace war"

 haughty words alecto's rage provoke
 frighted turnus trembled spoke
 eyes grow stiffen'd sulphur burn
 hideous looks hellish form return
 curling snakes hissings fill place
 open furies face
 darting fire malignant eyes
 cast backward strove rise
 ling'ring sought frame new replies
 high head rears two twisted snakes
 chains rattles whip shakes
 churning bloody foam thus loudly speaks
 "behold time made dote tell
 arms imagin'd lonely cell
 behold fates' infernal minister
 war death destruction hand bear"

 thus said smold'ring torch impress'd
 full force plung'd breast
 aghast wak'd starting bed
 cold sweat clammy drops limbs o'erspread
 "arms arms" cries "my sword shield prepare"
 breathes defiance blood mortal war
 crackling flames caldron fries
 bubbling waters bottom rise
 brims force fiery way
 black vapors climb aloft cloud day

 peace polluted thus chosen band
 first commissions latian land
 threat'ning embassy rais'd rest
 meet arms th' intruding trojan guest
 force foes lavinian shore
 italy's indanger'd peace restore

 turnus urges thus enterprise
 stygian fury trojans flies
 new frauds invents takes steepy stand
 overlooks vale wide command
 fair ascanius youthful train
 horns hounds hunting match ordain
 pitch toils around shady plain
 fury fires pack snuff vent
 feed hungry nostrils scent
 'twas wellgrown stag whose antlers rise
 high o'er front beams invade skies
 light cause th' infernal maid prepares
 country churls mischief hate wars

 stately beast two tyrrhidae bred
 snatch'd dams tame youngling fed
 father tyrrheus fodder bring
 tyrrheus chief ranger latian king
 sister silvia cherish'd care
 little wanton wreaths prepare
 hang budding horns ribbons tied
 tender neck comb'd silken hide
 bathed body patient command
 time grew growing us'd hand
 waited master's board food
 sought salvage kindred wood

 household beast us'd woodland grounds
 view'd first young hero's hounds
 stream swam seek retreat
 cool waters quench heat
 ascanius young eager game
 soon bent bow uncertain aim
 dire fiend fatal arrow guides
 pierc'd bowels thro' panting sides
 bleeding creature issues floods
 possess'd fear seeks known abodes
 old familiar hearth household gods

 implores pity pain bemoans
 young silvia beats breast cries aloud
 succor clownish neighborhood
 churls assemble fiend lay
 close woody covert urg'd way
 one brand yet burning flame

 mountains tremble th' infernal sound
 sacred lake trivia afar
 veline fountains sulphureous nar

 young mothers wildly stare fear possess'd
 strain helpless infants breast

 clowns boist'rous rude ungovern'd crew
 furious haste loud summons flew
 pow'rs troy issuing plain
 fresh recruits youthful chief sustain
 raw unexperienc'd train
 firm body embattled men
 first fortune favor'd neither side
 fight clubs burning brands tried
 parties reinforc'd fields
 bright flaming swords brazen shields
 shining harvest either host displays
 shoots sun equal rays
 thus blackbrow'd gust begins rise
 white foam first curl'd ocean fries
 roars main billows mount skies
 till fury storm full blown
 muddy bottom o'er clouds thrown
 first almon falls old tyrrheus' eldest care
 pierc'd arrow distant war
 fix'd throat flying weapon stood
 stopp'd breath drank vital blood
 huge heaps slain around body rise
 among rest rich galesus lies
 good old man peace preach'd vain
 amidst madness th' unruly train
 five herds five bleating flocks pastures fill'd
 lands hundred yoke oxen till'd

 thus equal scales fortune stood
 fury bath'd other's blood
 fix'd fight exulting flies
 bears fulfill'd promise skies
 juno thus speaks "behold done
 blood already drawn war begun
 discord complete cease
 dire debate command peace
 since latian trojan brood
 tasted vengeance sweets blood
 speak pow'r shall add office
 neighb'ing nations th' ausonian shore
 shall hear dreadful rumor afar
 arm'd invasion embrace war"
 juno thus "the grateful work done
 seeds discord sow'd war begun
 frauds fears fury possess'd state
 fix'd causes lasting hate
 bloody hymen shall th' alliance join
 betwixt trojan ausonian line
 thou speed night hell repair
 gods angry jove bear

 leave remains me" saturnia said
 sullen fiend sounding wings display'd
 unwilling left light sought nether shade

 midst italy well known fame
 lies lake amsanctus name
 lofty mounts either side
 thick forests forbidden entrance hide
 full center sacred wood
 arm arises stygian flood
 breaking beneath bellowing sound
 whirls black waves rattling stones around
 pluto pants breath cell
 opens wide grinning jaws hell
 infernal lake fury flies
 hides hated head frees lab'ring skies

 saturnian juno double care
 attends fatal process war
 clowns return'd battle bear slain
 implore gods king complain
 corps almon rest shown
 shrieks clamors murmurs fill frighted town
 ambitious turnus press appears
 aggravating crimes augments fears
 proclaims private injuries aloud
 solemn promise made disavow'd
 foreign son sought mix'd mungril brood
 whose mothers frantic fear
 woods wilds flags bacchus bear
 lead dances dishevel'd hair
 increase clamor war demand
 amata's interest land

 omens ill success
 fates averse rout arms resort

 like rock unmov'd rock braves
 raging tempest rising waves
 propp'd stands solid sides
 wash seaweeds sounding tides
 stood pious prince unmov'd long
 sustain'd madness noisy throng
 found juno's pow'r prevail'd

 calls gods witness offense
 disclaims war asserts innocence
 "hurried fate" cries "and borne

 book viii

 turnus assembled pow'rs
 standard planted laurentum's tow'rs
 sprightly trumpet afar
 giv'n signal approaching war
 rous'd neighing steeds scour fields
 fierce riders clatter'd shields
 trembling rage latian youth prepare
 join th' allies headlong rush war
 fierce ufens messapus led crowd
 bold mezentius blasphem'd aloud
 thro' country took wasteful course
 fields forage gather force
 venulus diomede send
 beg aid ausonia defend
 declare common danger inform
 grecian leader growing storm
 aeneas landed latian coast
 banish'd gods baffled host
 yet aspir'd conquest state
 claim'd title gods fate
 num'rous nations quarrel came
 spread formidable name
 design'd mischief might arise
 fortune favor'd first enterprise
 left weigh whose equal fears
 common interest involv'd

 turnus th' allies thus urge war
 trojan floating flood care
 beholds tempest foes prepare
 way turns anxious mind
 thinks rejects counsels design'd
 explores vain ev'ry part
 gives rest distracted heart
 sun day moon night
 strike polish'd brass trembling light
 glitt'ring species divide
 cast dubious beams side side
 walls pavement play
 ceiling flash glaring day

 't night weary nature lull'd asleep
 birds air fishes deep
 beasts mortal men trojan chief
 laid tiber's banks oppress'd grief
 found silent slumber late relief
 thro' shadows poplar wood
 arose father roman flood
 azure robe o'er body spread
 wreath shady reeds adorn'd head
 thus manifest sight god appear'd
 pleasing words sorrow cheer'd
 "undoubted offspring ethereal race
 long expected promis'd place
 thro' foes hast borne thy banish'd gods
 restor'd hearths old abodes
 thy happy home clime fate
 ordains thee restore trojan state
 fear war shall end lasting peace
 rage haughty juno cease
 nightly vision may seem
 th' effect fancy idle dream
 sow beneath oak shall lie along
 white white thirty young
 thirty rolling years run race
 thy son ascanius empty space
 shall build royal town lasting fame
 omen shall receive name
 time shall approve truth remains
 sure success crown thy pains
 patience next attend banish'd band
 driv'n evander th' arcadian land
 planted plac'd high walls
 town founder pallanteum calls
 deriv'd pallas greatgrandsire's name
 fierce latians old possession claim
 war infesting new colony
 make thy friends aid rely
 thy free passage submit streams
 wake son venus thy pleasing dreams
 setting stars lost day
 juno's pow'r thy devotion pay
 sacrifice wrathful queen appease
 pride length shall fall fury cease
 thou return'st victorious war
 perform thy vows grateful care
 god whose yellow water flows
 around fields fattens goes
 tiber name among rolling floods
 renown'd earth esteem'd among gods
 certain seat times come
 waves shall wash walls mighty rome"

 said plung'd yet spoke
 dream aeneas sleep forsook
 rose looking beheld skies
 purple blushing day arise
 water hollow palm took
 tiber's flood thus pow'rs bespoke
 "laurentian nymphs streams fed
 father tiber thy sacred bed
 receive aeneas danger keep
 whatever fount whatever holy deep
 conceals thy wat'ry stores where'er rise
 bubbling salute skies
 thou king horned floods whose plenteous urn
 suffices fatness fruitful corn
 thy kind compassion woes
 shalt share morning song ev'ning vows
 present thy people's aid
 firm gracious promise thou hast made"
 thus said two galleys stores
 care chooses mans fits oars
 shore fatal swine found
 wondrous tell lay along ground
 wellfed offspring udders hung
 white white thirty young
 aeneas takes mother brood
 juno's altar bestow'd

 foll'wing night succeeding day
 propitious tiber smooth'd wat'ry way
 roll'd river back pois'd stood
 gentle swelling peaceful flood
 trojans mount ships put shore
 borne waves scarcely dip oar
 shouts land give omen course
 pitch'd vessels glide easy force
 woods waters wonder gleam
 shields painted ships stem stream
 one summer's night one whole day pass
 betwixt greenwood shades cut liquid glass
 fiery sun finish'd half race
 look'd back doubted middle space
 far beheld rising tow'rs
 tops sheds shepherds' lowly bow'rs
 thin stood homely clay
 rise marble roman sway
 cots evander's kingdom mean poor
 trojan saw turn'd ships shore
 't solemn day th' arcadian states
 king prince without city gates
 paid off'rings sacred grove
 hercules warrior son jove
 thick clouds rolling smoke involve skies
 fat entrails altar fries

 saw ships stemm'd flood
 glitter'd thro' covert wood
 rose fear left th' unfinish'd feast
 till dauntless pallas reassur'd rest
 pay rites without delay
 jav'lin seiz'd singly took way
 gain'd rising ground call'd far
 "resolve strangers whence
 bus'ness bring peace war"
 high stern aeneas stand
 held branch olive hand
 thus spoke "the phrygians' arms see
 expell'd troy provok'd italy
 latian foes war unjustly made
 first affianc'd last betray'd
 message bear 'the trojans chief
 bring holy peace beg king's relief'
 struck great name fire
 youth replies "whatever require
 fame exacts upon shores descend
 welcome guest wish friend"
 said downward hasting strand
 embrac'd stranger prince join'd hand

 conducted grove aeneas broke
 silence first thus king bespoke
 "best greeks fate's command
 bear peaceful branches hand
 undaunted approach tho' know
 birth grecian land foe
 atreus tho' ancient lineage came
 brother kings kindred claim
 yet selfconscious worth high renown
 virtue thro' neighb'ring nations blown
 fathers' mingled blood apollo's voice
 led hither less need choice
 founder dardanus fame sung
 greeks acknowledge electra sprung
 electra loins atlas came
 atlas whose head sustains starry frame
 sire mercury long
 cold cyllene's top fair maia bore
 maia fair fame rely
 atlas' daughter sustains sky
 thus one common source streams divide
 trojan th' arcadian side
 rais'd hopes sent news
 ask'd leave faith implore
 come without pledge ambassador
 rutulians arms pursue
 trojan race equal foes
 host expell'd farther force stay
 victor troops universal sway
 stretch pow'r athwart land
 either sea side side command
 receive offer'd faith give us thine
 gen'rous experienc'd line
 want hearts bodies war
 council cautious fields dare"

 said spoke piercing eyes
 evander view'd man vast surprise
 pleas'd action ravish'd face
 answer'd briefly royal grace
 "o valiant leader trojan line
 features thy father shine
 recall anchises see
 motions mien friend thee
 long tho' 't fresh within mind
 priam sister's court design'd
 welcome visit friendly stay
 thro' th' arcadian kingdom took way
 past boy callow began
 shade chin call first man
 saw shining train vast delight
 priam's goodly person pleas'd sight
 great anchises far rest
 awful wonder fir'd youthful breast
 long'd join friendship's holy bands
 mutual hearts plight mutual hands
 first accosted sued sought
 loving force pheneus brought
 gave length constrain'd go
 lycian quiver gnossian bow
 vest embroider'd glorious behold
 two rich bridles bits gold
 son's coursers obedience hold
 league ask offer right
 tomorrow's sun reveals light
 swift supplies shall sent away
 celebrate us solemn day
 whose holy rites admit long delay
 honor annual feast take seat
 friendly welcome homely treat"
 thus said bowls remov'd fear
 youths replac'd soon restor'd cheer
 sods turf set soldiers round
 maple throne rais'd higher ground
 receiv'd trojan chief o'er bed
 lion's shaggy hide ornament spread
 loaves serv'd canisters wine
 bowls priest renew'd rites divine
 broil'd entrails food beef's continued chine

 rage hunger repress'd
 thus spoke evander royal guest
 "these rites altars feast king

 pleasing talk beguil'd tedious way
 stranger cast around curious eyes
 new objects viewing still new surprise
 greedy joy enquires various things
 acts monuments ancient kings
 thus founder roman tow'rs
 "these woods first seat sylvan pow'rs
 nymphs fauns salvage men took
 birth trunks trees stubborn oak
 laws knew manners care
 lab'ring oxen shining share
 arts gain gain'd spare
 exercise chase running flood
 supplied thirst trees supplied food
 saturn came fled pow'r jove
 robb'd realms banish'd
 men dispers'd hills towns brought
 laws ordain'd civil customs taught
 latium call'd land safe lay
 unduteous son usurping sway
 mild empire peace plenty came
 hence golden times deriv'd name
 degenerate discolor'd age
 succeeded avarice rage
 th' ausonians bold sicanians came
 saturn's empire often chang'd name
 kings gigantic tybris rest
 arbitrary sway land oppress'd
 tiber's flood albula
 till tyrant's fate name bore
 last arriv'd driv'n native home
 fortune's pow'r fate's resistless doom
 long toss'd seas sought happy land
 warn'd mother nymph call'd heav'n's command"

 thus walking spoke shew'd gate
 since call'd carmental roman state
 stood altar sacred name
 old carmenta prophetic dame
 son foretold th' aenean race
 sublime fame rome's imperial place
 shews forest times
 fierce romulus perpetrated crimes
 sacred refuge made shrine
 pan rock rites divine
 tells argus' death murder'd guest
 whose grave tomb innocence attest
 thence steep tarpeian rock leads
 roof'd gold thatch'd homely reeds
 reverent fear superstition reigns
 among rude ev'n possess'd swains
 god knew god could tell
 amidst sacred horror dwell
 th' arcadians thought jove said saw
 mighty thund'rer majestic awe
 took shield dealt bolts around
 scatter'd tempests teeming ground
 saw two heaps ruins stood
 two stately towns either side flood
 saturnia's janicula's remains
 either place founder's name retains
 discoursing thus together resort
 poor evander kept country court
 view'd ground rome's litigious hall
 oxen low'd lawyers bawl
 stooping thro' narrow gate press'd
 thus king bespoke trojan guest
 "mean palace door
 receiv'd alcides conqueror
 dare poor accept homely food
 feasted emulate god"
 underneath lowly roof led
 weary prince laid bed
 stuffing leaves hides bears o'erspread
 night shed silver dews around
 sable wings embrac'd ground
 love's fair goddess anxious son
 new tumults rising new wars begun
 couch'd husband golden bed
 alluring words invokes aid
 pleasing speech mind may move
 inspires accent charms love
 "while cruel fate conspir'd grecian pow'rs
 level ground trojan tow'rs
 ask'd aid th' unhappy restore
 succor thy skill implore
 urg'd labors lord vain
 sinking empire longer sustain
 tho'much ow'd priam's house
 dangers aeneas deplore
 jove's command fate's decree
 race doom'd reign italy
 humble suit beg thy needful art
 still propitious pow'r rules heart
 mother kneels suppliant son
 thetis aurora thou wert
 forge impenetrable shields grace
 fated arms less illustrious race
 behold haughty nations combin'd
 relics phrygian kind
 fire sword people destroy
 conquer venus twice conqu'ring troy"
 said straight arms snowy hue
 unresolving husband threw
 soft embraces soon infuse desire
 bones marrow sudden warmth inspire
 godhead feels wonted fire
 half swift rattling thunder flies
 forky lightnings flash along skies
 goddess proud successful wiles
 conscious form secret smiles

 thus pow'r obnoxious charms
 panting half dissolving arms
 "why seek reasons cause
 beauties love distrust
 long since requir'd helpful hand
 th' artificer art might command
 labor arms troy jove fate
 confin'd empire short date
 desire new wars wage
 skill promise pains engage
 whatever melting metals conspire
 breathing bellows forming fire
 freely anxious fears remove
 think task difficult love"
 trembling spoke eager charms
 snatch'd willing goddess arms
 till lap infus'd lay possess'd
 full desire sunk pleasing rest
 night middle race rode
 first slumber refresh'd god
 time early housewives leave bed
 living embers hearth spread
 supply lamp call maids rise
 yawning mouths halfopen'd eyes
 ply distaff winking light
 daily labor add night
 thus frugally earn children's bread
 uncorrupted keep nuptial bed
 less concern'd later hour
 rose downy couch forging pow'r

 sacred vulcan's name isle lay
 betwixt sicilia's coasts lipare
 rais'd high smoking rocks deep
 hollow caves fires aetna glow
 cyclops heavy hammers deal
 loud strokes hissings tormented steel
 heard around boiling waters roar
 smoky flames thro' fuming tunnels soar
 hether father fire night
 thro' brown air precipitates flight
 eternal anvils found
 brethren beating blows go round
 load pointless thunder lies
 hands ripen skies
 darts angry jove daily cast
 consum'd mortals prodigious waste
 three rays writhen rain fire three
 winged southern winds cloudy store
 many parts dreadful mixture frame
 fears added avenging flame
 inferior ministers mars repair
 broken axletrees blunted war
 send forth furbish'd arms
 wake lazy war trumpets' loud alarms
 rest refresh scaly snakes fold
 shield pallas renew gold
 full crest gorgon's head place
 eyes roll death distorted face

 "my sons" said vulcan "set tasks aside
 strength masterskill must tried
 arms hero forge arms require
 force speed forming fire"
 said set former work aside
 new toils eager haste divide
 flood molten silver brass gold
 deadly steel large furnace roll'd
 artful hands shield prepare

 sev'n orbs within spacious round close
 one stirs fire one bellows blows
 hissing steel smithy drown'd
 grot beaten anvils groans around
 turns arms advance equal time
 turns hands descend hammers chime
 turn glowing mass crooked tongs

 labors thus ply th' aeolian forge
 cheerful morn salutes evander's eyes

 two menial dogs master press'd
 thus clad guarded thus seeks kingly guest
 mindful promis'd aid mends pace

 young pallas father's steps attend
 true achates waited friend
 join hands secret seat choose
 th' arcadian first former talk renews
 "undaunted prince never believe

 book ix

 affairs distant places pass'd
 various iris juno sends haste
 find bold turnus anxious thought
 secret shade great grandsire sought
 retir'd alone found daring man
 op'd rosy lips thus began
 "what none gods could grant thy vows
 turnus auspicious day bestows
 aeneas gone seek th' arcadian prince
 left trojan camp without defense
 short succors employs pains
 parts remote raise tuscan swains
 snatch hour favors thy designs
 unite thy forces attack lines"
 said equal wings pois'd weight
 form'd radiant rainbow flight

 daunian hero lifts hands eyes
 thus invokes goddess flies
 "iris grace heav'n pow'r divine
 sent thee thro' dusky clouds shine
 see divide immortal day appears
 glitt'ring planets dancing spheres
 joy happy omens obey
 follow war god leads way"
 thus said brook stood
 scoop'd water crystal flood
 hands drops heav'n throws
 loads pow'rs offer'd vows

 march bold confed'rates thro' plain
 well hors'd well clad rich shining train
 messapus leads van rear
 sons tyrrheus bright arms appear
 main battle flaming crest
 mighty turnus tow'rs rest
 silent move majestically slow
 like ebbing nile ganges flow
 trojans view dusty cloud far
 dark menace distant war
 caicus rampire saw rise
 black'ning fields thick'ning thro' skies
 fellows thus aloud calls
 "what rolling clouds friends approach walls
 arm arm man works prepare spears
 pointed darts latian host appears"

 thus warn'd shut gates shouts ascend
 bulwarks secure foes attend
 wise gen'ral foreseeing care
 charg'd tempt doubtful war
 tho' provok'd open fields advance
 close within lines attend chance
 unwilling yet keep strict command
 sourly wait arms hostile band
 fiery turnus flew rest
 piebald steed thracian strain press'd
 helm massy gold crimson crest
 twenty horse second designs
 unexpected foe fac'd lines
 "is there" said "in arms bravely dare
 leader's honor danger share"
 spurring brandish'd dart threw
 sign war applauding shouts ensue

 amaz'd find dastard race run
 behind rampires battle shun
 rides around camp rolling eyes
 stops ev'ry post ev'ry passage tries
 roams nightly wolf fold
 wet descending show'rs stiff cold
 howls hunger grins pain
 gnashing teeth exercis'd vain
 impotent anger finds way
 distended paws grasp prey
 mothers listen bleating lambs
 securely swig dug beneath dams
 thus ranges eager turnus o'er plain
 sharp desire furious disdain
 surveys passage piercing sight
 force foes equal field fight
 thus gazes round length spies
 fenc'd strong redoubts navy lies
 close underneath walls washing tide
 secures approach weaker side
 takes wish'd occasion fills hand
 ready fires shakes flaming brand
 urg'd presence ev'ry soul warm'd
 ev'ry hand kindled firs arm'd
 fir'd pines scatt'ring sparkles fly
 fat vapors mix'd flames involve sky
 pow'r muses could avert flame
 threaten'd fleet trojan name
 tell fact thro' length time obscure
 hard faith yet shall fame endure

 't said chief prepar'd flight
 fell'd timber mount ida's height
 grandam goddess approach'd son
 mother's majesty begun
 "grant me" said "the sole request bring
 since conquer'd heav'n own'd king
 ida's brows ages past stood
 firs maples fill'd shady wood
 summit rose sacred grove
 worship'd religious love
 woods holy grove long delight
 gave trojan prince speed flight
 fill'd fear behalf come
 let neither winds o'erset waves intomb
 floating forests sacred pine
 let safety mine"
 thus replied awful son rolls
 radiant stars heav'n earth controls
 "how dare mother endless date demand
 vessels molded mortal hand
 fate shall bold aeneas ride
 safety certain th' uncertain tide
 yet grant wafted o'er
 chief landed latian shore
 whatever ships escape raging storms
 command shall change fading forms
 nymphs divine plow wat'ry way
 like dotis daughters sea"
 seal sacred vow styx swore
 lake liquid pitch dreary shore
 phlegethon's innavigable flood
 black regions brother god
 said shook skies imperial nod

 length number'd hours come
 prefix'd fate's irrevocable doom
 great mother gods free
 save ships finish jove's decree
 first quarter morn sprung
 light sign'd heav'ns shot along
 cloud fring'd round golden fires
 timbrels heard berecynthian choirs
 last voice mortal sounds
 hosts arms oppos'd equal horror wounds
 "o trojan race needless aid forbear
 know ships peculiar care
 greater ease bold rutulian may
 hissing brands attempt burn sea
 singe sacred pines charge
 loos'd crooked anchors launch large
 exalted nymph forsake sand
 swim seas cybele's command"
 sooner goddess ceas'd speak
 lo th' obedient ships haulsers break
 strange tell like dolphins main
 plunge prows dive spring
 many beauteous maids billows sweep
 rode tall vessels deep

 foes surpris'd wonder stood aghast
 messapus curb'd fiery courser's haste
 old tiber roar'd raising head
 call'd back waters oozy bed
 turnus alone undaunted bore shock
 words trembling troops bespoke
 "these monsters trojans' fate meant
 jove black presages sent
 takes cowards' last relief away
 fly cannot constrain'd stay
 must yield unfought base inglorious prey
 liquid half globe lost
 heav'n shuts seas secure coast
 small spot ground
 myriads martial men surround
 fates fear vain oracles
 't giv'n venus cross seas
 land secure upon latian plains
 promis'd hour pass'd mine remains
 't fate turnus destroy
 sword fire faithless race troy
 shall affronts alone inflame
 grecian brothers grecian name
 cause one fatal strife
 final ruin ravish'd wife
 't enough punish'd crime
 fell fall second time
 one would thought paid enough
 curse costly sex durst offend
 securely trust feeble wall
 slight partition thin interval
 betwixt fate troy tho' built
 hands divine yet perish'd guilt
 lend friends valiant hands
 force lines dastard bands
 less thousand ships end war
 vulcan needs fated arms prepare
 let tuscans th' arcadians join
 shall frustrate design
 let fear treasons night
 robb'd palladium pretended flight
 onset shall made open light
 wooden engine shall town betray
 fires shall around fires day
 grecian babes camp appear
 hector's arms detain'd tenth tardy year
 since sun rolling west
 give silent night needful rest
 refresh bodies arms prepare
 morn shall end small remains war"

 post honor messapus falls

 pitch fires distances around
 close trojans scanty ground
 twice seven rutulian captains ready stand
 twice seven hundred horse chiefs command

 nisus thus "or gods inspire

 wakeful fuming flagon ply

 euryalus stood list'ning spoke
 love praise noble envy struck
 ardent friend expos'd mind
 "all alone leaving behind

 thinkist thou share glory yield

 father taught childhood arms

 nisus thus "alas thy tender years

 may gods view friendly strife
 restore thy lov'd embrace life
 condemn'd pay vows sure trust
 thy request cruel unjust
 chance many chances
 doubtful hazards deeds war
 one reach head let fall
 spare thy life would perish
 thy bloomy youth deserves longer date
 live thou mourn thy love's unhappy fate
 bear mangled body foe
 buy back fun'ral rites bestow
 hard fortune shall dues deny
 thou canst least empty tomb supply
 let widow's tears renew
 let mother's curse name pursue
 thy pious parent love thee
 forsook coasts friendly sicily
 age committing seas wind
 ev'ry weary matron stay'd behind"
 euryalus "you plead vain

 nodding watch office takes
 guard reliev'd gen'rous couple went

 creatures else forgot daily care

 except trojan peers wakeful sate

 ceas'd old alethes took word
 "our country gods trust place

 tears joy father broke
 longing arms turns took
 panted paus'd thus spoke
 "ye brave young men equal gifts

 "and whose welfare father lies"
 ascanius adds "by great deities

 thou whose years mine allied
 fate vow'd affection shall divide
 thee heroic youth wholly mine
 take full possession soul thine
 one faith one fame one fate shall attend
 life's companion bosom friend
 peace shall committed thy care

 thus young euryalus replied
 "whatever fortune good bad betide
 shall age youth

 goodness let gain
 ungranted rewards vain
 priam's royal race mother came

 neither troy sicily could hold

 hope alone fortify breast

 said mov'd assistants melt tears

 thus ascanius wonderstruck see

 "so great beginnings green age

 said weeping spoke word
 broad belt drew shining sword

 thus arm'd went noble trojans wait

 ascanius manly far beyond years
 messages committed care
 winds lost flitting air

 trenches first pass'd took way

 fate prescience cannot remov'd
 sleeping slaves slew spies
 remus rich retinue lies
 armorbearer first next kills
 charioteer intrench'd betwixt wheels
 lov'd horses last invades lord
 full neck drives fatal sword
 gasping head flies purple flood
 flows trunk welters blood
 spurning heels dispers'd around
 bed besprinkles bedews ground
 lamus bold lamyrus strong
 slew serranus fair young
 dice wine youth retir'd rest
 puff'd fumy god breast
 ev'n dreamt drink lucky play
 lucky lasted till day
 famish'd lion thus hunger bold
 o'erleaps fences nightly fold
 tears peaceful flocks silent awe
 trembling lie pant beneath paw

 less rage euryalus employs
 wrathful sword fewer foes destroys
 th' ignoble crowd fury flew
 fadus hebesus rhoetus slew
 oppress'd heavy sleep former fell
 rhoetus wakeful observing
 behind spacious jar slink'd fear
 fatal iron found reach'd
 rose pierc'd naked side
 reeking thence return'd crimson dyed
 wound pours stream wine blood
 purple soul comes floating flood

 messapus quarter'd arrive
 fires fainting alive
 warriorhorses tied order fed
 nisus observ'd discipline said
 "our eager thirst blood may betray
 see scatter'd streaks dawning day
 foe nocturnal thefts friend
 let glutted execution end
 lane thro' slaughter'd bodies made"
 bold euryalus tho' loth obey'd
 arms arras plate find
 precious load leave behind
 yet fond gaudy spoils boy would stay
 make rich caparison prey
 steed conquer'd rhamnes lay
 eyes less longingly behold
 girdlebelt nails burnish'd gold
 present caedicus rich bestow'd
 remulus friendship first vow'd
 absent join'd hospitable ties
 dying heir bequeath'd prize
 till conqu'ring ardean troops oppress'd
 fell glorious gift possess'd
 glitt'ring spoils made victor's gain
 body suits suits vain
 messapus' helm finds among rest
 laces wears waving crest
 proud conquest prouder prey
 leave camp take ready way

 far pass'd spied
 three hundred horse volscens guide
 queen legion king turnus sent
 swift horse slower foot prevent
 advancing sought leader's tent
 saw pair thro' doubtful shade
 shining helm euryalus betray'd
 moon full reflection play'd
 "'t naught" cried volscens crowd
 "these men go there" rais'd voice aloud
 "stand stand thus arms whither bent
 whence errand sent"
 silent scud away haste flight
 neighb'ring woods trust night
 speedy horse passages belay
 spur smoking steeds cross way
 watch entrance winding wood
 black forest thick beech stood
 horrid fern intricate thorn
 paths human feet tracks beasts worn
 darkness shades heavy prey
 fear misled younger way
 nisus hit turns happier haste
 thoughtless friend forest pass'd
 alban plains alba's name call'd
 king latinus oxen stall'd
 till turning length stood ground
 miss'd friend cast eyes around
 "ah wretch" cried "where left behind
 th' unhappy youth shall hope find
 way take" ventures back
 treads mazes former track
 winds wood list'ning hears noise
 tramping coursers riders' voice
 sound approach'd suddenly view'd
 foes inclosing friend pursued
 forelaid taken strove vain
 shelter friendly shades gain
 next attempt arms employ
 fruitless force free captive boy
 desperate rush lose life
 odds oppress'd unequal strife

 resolv'd length pointed spear shook
 casting moon mournful look
 "guardian groves goddess night
 fair queen" said "direct dart aright
 e'er pious father sake
 grateful off'rings thy altars make
 increas'd sylvan toils
 hung thy holy roofs savage spoils
 give scatter these" ear
 pois'd aim'd launch'd trembling spear
 deadly weapon hissing grove
 impetuous back sulmo drove
 pierc'd thin armor drank vital blood
 body left broken wood
 staggers round eyeballs roll death
 short sobs gasps away breath
 stand amaz'd second jav'lin flies
 equal strength quivers thro' skies
 thro' thy temples tagus forc'd way
 brainpan warmly buried lay
 fierce volscens foams rage gazing round
 descried gave fatal wound
 knew fix revenge "but thou" cries
 "shalt pay both" pris'ner flies
 drawn sword struck deep despair
 cruel sight lover could bear
 covert rush'd open view
 sent voice flew
 "me me" cried "turn swords alone
 fact confess'd fault
 neither could durst guiltless youth
 ye moon stars bear witness truth
 crime friendship offend
 much love unhappy friend"
 late speaks sword fury guides
 driv'n full force pierc'd tender sides
 fell beauteous youth yawning wound
 gush'd purple stream stain'd ground
 snowy neck reclines upon breast
 like fair flow'r keen share oppress'd
 like white poppy sinking plain
 whose heavy head overcharg'd rain
 despair rage vengeance justly vow'd
 drove nisus headlong hostile crowd
 volscens seeks alone bends
 borne back bor'd surrounding friends
 onward press'd kept still sight
 whirl'd aloft sword might
 th' unerring steel descended spoke
 piered wide mouth thro' weazon broke
 dying slew stagg'ring plain
 swimming eyes sought lover slain
 quiet bleeding bosom fell
 content death reveng'd well

 happy friends verse give
 immortal life fame shall ever live
 fix'd capitol's foundation lies
 spread where'er roman eagle flies

 conqu'ring party first divide prey
 slain leader camp convey
 wonder went troops fill'd
 see numbers kill'd
 serranus rhamnes rest found
 vast crowds dying dead surround
 yet reeking blood o'erflows ground
 knew helmet messapus lost
 mourn'd purchase dear cost
 rose ruddy morn tithon's bed
 dawn day skies o'erspread
 long sun daily course withheld
 added colors world reveal'd
 early turnus wak'ning light
 clad armor calls troops fight
 martial men fierce harangue fir'd
 ardor souls inspir'd
 done give new terror foes
 heads nisus friend shows
 rais'd high pointed spears ghastly sight
 loud peals shouts ensue barbarous delight

 meantime trojans run danger calls
 line trenches man walls
 front extended left stood
 safe right surrounded flood
 casting tow'rs frightful view
 saw faces well knew
 tho' disguis'd death smear'd o'er
 filth obscene dropping putrid gore
 soon hasty fame thro' sad city bears
 mournful message mother's ears
 icy cold benumbs limbs shakes
 cheeks blood hand web forsakes
 runs rampires round amidst war
 fears flying darts rends hair
 fills loud laments liquid air
 "thus lov'd euryalus appears
 thus looks prop declining years
 was't face famish'd eyes fed
 ah unlike living dead
 could'st thou leave cruel thus alone
 one kind kiss departing son
 look last adieu went
 illboding hour slaughter sent
 cold ground pressing foreign clay
 latian dogs fowls lies prey
 near close dying eyes
 wash wounds weep obsequies
 call corpse crying friends
 spread mantle made ends
 dear body wove care
 daily pains nightly labor spare
 shall find corpse earth sustains
 trunk dismember'd cold remains
 alas left needful ease
 expos'd life winds winter seas
 pity touch rutulian hearts
 empty quivers darts
 fail thou jove conclude woe
 send thunderstruck shades below"
 shrieks clamors pierce trojans' ears
 unman courage augment fears
 young ascanius could sight sustain
 old ilioneus tears restrain
 actor idaeus jointly sent
 bear madding mother tent

 trumpets terribly far
 rattling clangor rouse sleepy war
 soldiers' shouts succeed brazen sounds
 heav'n pole pole noise rebounds
 volscians bear shields upon head
 rushing forward form moving shed
 fill ditch pull bulwarks
 raise ladders others scale town
 void spaces walls appear
 thin defense pour forces
 poles missive weapons afar
 trojans keep aloof rising war
 taught ten years' siege defensive fight
 roll ribs rocks unresisted weight
 break penthouse pond'rous blow
 yet patient volscians undergo
 could bear th' unequal combat long
 trojans find thickest throng
 ruin falls shatter'd shields give way
 crush'd heads become easy prey
 shrink fear abated rage
 longer dare blind fight engage
 contented gall
 darts slings distant bow

 elsewhere mezentius terrible view
 blazing pine within trenches threw
 brave messapus neptune's warlike son
 broke palisades trenches
 loud ladders calls scale town

 calliope begin ye sacred nine

 sing slaughter manly turnus made
 souls sent stygian shade

 wary trojans obviate design
 weighty stones o'erwhelm troops
 shoot thro' loopholes sharp jav'lins throw
 turnus chief toss'd thund'ring hand

 stuck fiery plague winds high
 planks season'd timber dry
 contagion caught posts spread along
 scorch'd distance drove scatter'd throng
 trojans fled fire pursued amain
 still gath'ring fast upon trembling train
 till crowding corners wall
 defense defenders fall
 mighty flaw makes heav'n resound
 dead dying trojans strew ground
 tow'r follow'd fallen crew
 whelm'd o'er heads buried slew
 stuck upon darts sent
 equal ruin underwent

 young lycus helenor scape
 sav'd know steepy leap
 helenor elder two birth

 lydian king licymnia bare

 privilege none freemen share
 slight arms sword silver shield
 marks honor charg'd empty field
 light fell light youth arose
 rising found amidst foes
 flight left hopes force way
 embolden'd despair stood bay
 like stag troop surrounds
 eager huntsmen invading hounds
 resolv'd death dissipates fears
 bounds aloft pointed spears

 dying body thickest foes
 lycus swifter feet far
 runs doubles winds turns amidst war
 springs walls leaves foes behind
 snatches beam first find
 looks leaps aloft stretch
 hopes helping hand kind friend reach
 turnus follow'd hard hunted prey
 spear almost reach'd way
 short reins scarce span behind
 "fool" said chief "tho' fleeter wind

 said downward feet drew
 trembling dastard tug falls
 vast ruins come along rent smoking walls
 thus silver swan tim'rous hare
 jove's bird comes sousing upper air
 crooked talons truss fearful prey
 sight soars wings way
 seizes grim wolf tender lamb
 vain lamented bleating dam

 rushing onward barb'rous cry
 troops turnus combat fly
 ditch fagots fill'd daring foe

 heated lead half melted flew
 pierc'd hollow temples brain
 youth came tumbling spurn'd plain

 young ascanius day
 wont woods shoot savage prey
 first bent martial strife twanging bow
 exercis'd human foe
 bereft numanus life
 turnus' younger sister took wife
 proud realm royal bride
 vaunting troops lengthen'd stride
 insulting terms trojans defied

 "twiceconquer'd cowards shame shown

 foul reproach ascanius could hear
 patience vow'd revenge forbear
 full stretch hands drew
 almost join'd horns tough yew
 first throne jove stood
 thus lifted hands invok'd god
 "my first attempt great jupiter succeed
 annual off'ring thy grove shall bleed
 snowwhite steer thy altar led

 jove bow'd heav'ns lent gracious ear

 feather'd death hisses thro' skies
 steel thro' temples forc'd way

 "go vain boaster true valor scorn

 "suffice thee thy father's worthy son

 twice breaks twice broken foes pursues
 swarm fresh troops supplied

 juno sustain'd arms
 dares new strength suffice th' exhausted store
 jove sour commands sent iris
 force th' invader frighted town

 labor spent longer wield
 heavy fanchion sustain shield
 o'erwhelm'd darts afar fling
 weapons round hollow temples ring
 golden helm gives way stony blows
 batter'd flat beaten brows
 crest rash'd away ample shield
 falsified round jav'lins fill'd

 foe faint trojans overwhelm
 mnestheus lays hard load upon helm
 sick sweat succeeds drops ev'ry pore
 driving dust cheeks pasted o'er
 shorter shorter ev'ry gasp takes
 vain efforts hurtless blows makes
 plung'd flood made waters fly
 yellow god welcome burthen bore
 wip'd sweat wash'd away gore
 gently wafts farther coast
 sends safe cheer anxious host

 gates heav'n unfold jove summons
 gods council common hall
 sublimely seated surveys far
 fields camp fortune war
 th' inferior world first last
 sov'reign senate degrees plac'd

 thus th' almighty sire began "ye gods
 natives denizens blest abodes
 whence murmurs change mind
 backward fate first design'd
 protracted war commands
 pronounc'd peace gave latian lands
 fear hope either part divides
 heav'ns arms powers diff'rent sides
 lawful time war length come
 need haste anticipate doom
 carthage shall contend world rome

 like flood come pouring plains

 thus jupiter unfolds charge
 lovely venus thus replies large
 "o pow'r immense eternal energy

 endless outrage shall still sustain

 since haughty juno give leave

 reach th' italian shores
 second pergamus doom'd fall

 deep indignation swell'd saturnia's heart
 "and must own" said "my secret smart

 thus juno murmurs rise mix'd applause

 thus replied th' imperial god
 shakes heav'n's axles awful nod

 spread ev'ry sail pursue wat'ry track
 haste course navy
 ida's height descending sea
 till turnus anchor fix'd stood
 presum'd violate holy wood
 loos'd shore fled fires profane
 unwillingly broke master's chain
 since sought thro' tuscan main
 mighty mother chang'd forms
 gave us life immortal seas
 young ascanius camp distress'd
 insulting foes hardly press'd
 th' arcadian horsemen etrurian host
 advance order latian coast
 cut way daunian chief designs
 troops reach trojan lines
 thou rosy morn restores light
 first arm thy soldiers th' ensuing fight
 thyself fated sword vulcan wield
 bear aloft th' impenetrable shield
 tomorrow's sun unless skill vain
 shall see huge heaps foes battle slain"
 parting spoke immortal force
 push'd vessel wat'ry course
 well knew way impell'd behind
 ship flew forward outstripp'd wind
 rest make unknowing cause
 chief admires speed happy omens draws

 thus pray'd fix'd heav'n eyes
 "hear thou great mother deities
 turrets crown'd ida's holy hill
 fierce tigers rein'd curb'd obey thy
 firm thy omens lead us fight
 let thy phrygians conquer thy right"

 said renewing day
 chas'd shadows night away
 charg'd soldiers preventing care
 flags follow arms prepare
 warn'd th' ensuing fight bade 'em hope war
 lofty poop view'd
 camp incompass'd th' inclosing foe
 blazing shield imbrac'd held high
 camp receive sign loud shouts reply
 hope arms courage tow'rs throw
 darts double force drive foe
 thus signal giv'n cranes arise
 stormy south blacken skies

 king turnus wonder'd fight renew'd
 till looking back trojan fleet view'd
 seas swelling canvas cover'd o'er
 swift ships descending shore
 latians saw far dazzled eyes
 radiant crest seem'd flames rise
 dart diffusive fires around field
 keen glitt'ring golden shield
 thus threat'ning comets night rise
 shoot sanguine streams sadden skies
 sirius flashing forth sinister lights
 pale humankind plagues dry famine fright

 yet turnus undaunted mind bent
 man shores hinder descent
 thus awakes courage friends
 "what long wish'd kind fortune sends
 ardent arms meet th' invading foe
 find find advantage
 day need dare
 swords make masters war
 sires sons houses lands
 dearest wifes within hands
 mindful race whence came
 emulate arms fathers' fame
 take time stagg'ring yet stand
 feet unfirm prepossess strand
 fortune befriends bold" said
 balanc'd leave lead

 meantime trojan sends troops ashore
 boats expos'd bridges
 lab'ring oars bear along strand
 tide languishes leap aland
 tarchon observes coast careful eyes
 ford finds water fries
 billows unequal murmurs roar
 smoothly slide along swell shore
 course steer'd thus gave command
 "here ply oars hazard land
 force vessel keel may wound
 hated soil furrow hostile ground
 let securely land ask
 sink ships shatter shore"

 fiery speech inflames fearful friends
 tug ev'ry oar ev'ry stretcher bends
 run ships aground vessels knock
 thus forc'd ashore tremble shock
 tarchon's alone lost stranded stood
 stuck bank beaten flood

 great theron fell omen fight

 fam'd father wont war go
 great alcides toil'd

 prince call'd achates supply
 spears knew way victory
 "those fatal weapons inur'd blood
 grecian bodies ilium stood

 said seiz'd mighty spear threw
 wing'd fate thro' maeon's buckler flew
 pierc'd brazen plates reach'd heart

 alcanor saw reach'd reach'd vain
 helping hand brother sustain
 second spear kept former course

 right arm pierc'd holding bereft

 numitor dead brother drew
 th' illomen'd spear trojan threw
 preventing fate directs lance awry
 glancing mark'd achates' thigh

 pride youth sabine clausus came

 spear flew hissing thro' middle space
 pierc'd throat directed face

 another part th' arcadian horse
 ill success ingage latin force
 th' impetuous torrent rushing
 huge craggy stones rooted trees thrown
 left coursers unus'd fight
 foot scatter'd shameful flight
 pallas disdain grief view'd
 foes pursuing friends pursued
 us'd threat'nings mix'd pray'rs last resource
 move minds fire force
 "which way companions whether would run

 said strode eager haste along
 bore amidst thickest throng
 lagus first met fate foe
 heav'd stone mighty weight throw
 stooping spear descended chine
 bone distinguished either loin
 stuck fast deeply buried lay
 scarce victor forc'd steel away
 hisbon came mov'd slow
 wish'd revenge prince prevents blow

 lewd anchemolus laid dust
 stain'd stepdam's bed impious lust
 daucian twins slain
 laris thymbrus latian plain
 wondrous like feature shape size

 grateful mistake soon sword decides
 nice distinction fate divides
 thymbrus' head lopp'd laris' hand

 trembling fingers yet fauchion strain
 threaten still th' intended stroke vain

 renew charge th' arcadians came
 sight acts sense honest shame
 grief anger mix'd minds inflame
 casual blow rhoeteus slain
 chanc'd pallas threw cross plain
 flying spear ilus sent
 rhoeteus happen'd death unmeant
 teuthras tyres fled
 lance athwart body laid dead
 roll'd chariot mortal wound
 intercepted fate spurn'd ground
 summer welcome winds arise
 watchful shepherd forest flies
 fires midmost plants contagion spreads
 catching flames infect neighb'ring heads
 around forest flies furious blast
 leafy nation sinks last
 vulcan rides triumph o'er waste
 pastor pleas'd dire victory

 pallas' troops scatter'd strength unite
 pouring foes prince delight

 halesus came fierce desire blood
 first collected arms stood
 advancing plied spear well
 ladon demodocus pheres fell
 around head toss'd glitt'ring brand
 strymonius hew'd better hand
 held guard throat hurl'd stone
 thoas' ample front pierc'd bone

 blood mingled brains together fly
 deep skill'd future fates halesus' sire
 youth lonely groves retire
 father's mortal race run
 dire destiny laid hold upon son
 haul'd war find beneath
 th' evandrian spear memorable death
 pallas th' encounter seeks ere throws
 tuscan tiber thus address'd vows
 "o sacred stream direct flying dart
 give pass proud halesus' heart
 arms spoils thy holy oak shall bear"
 pleas'd bribe god receiv'd pray'r
 shield protects friend distress'd
 dart came driving pierc'd breast

 lausus small portion war
 permits panic fear reign far
 caus'd death renown'd knight

 fierce abas first slew abas stay
 trojan hopes hindrance day
 phrygian troops escap'd greeks vain
 mix'd allies load plain
 rude shock war armies came

 angry weapons dispute field
 pallas urges lausus

 congress field great jove withstands
 doom'd fall fall greater hands

 meantime juturna warns daunian chief
 lausus' danger urging swift relief
 driv'n chariot divides crowd
 making friends thus calls aloud
 "let none presume needless aid join
 retire clear field fight mine
 right hand pallas due

 forbidden space men retir'd
 pallas awe stern words admir'd
 survey'd o'er o'er wond'ring sight
 struck haughty mien tow'ring height
 king "your empty vaunts forbear
 success hope fate cannot fear
 alive dead shall deserve name
 jove impartial same"
 said void advanc'd pace
 pale horror sate arcadian face
 turnus chariot leaping light
 address'd foot single fight
 lion spies far
 bull seems meditate war
 bending neck spurning back sand
 runs roaring downward hilly stand
 imagine eager turnus slow
 rush high unequal foe

 young pallas saw chief advance
 within due distance flying lance
 prepares charge first resolv'd try
 fortune would want force supply
 thus heav'n hercules address'd
 "alcides earth evander's guest
 son adjures holy rites
 hospitable board genial nights
 assist great attempt gain prize
 let proud turnus view dying eyes
 ravish'd spoils" 't heard vain request
 alcides mourn'd stifled sighs within breast
 jove soothe sorrow thus began
 "short bounds life set mortal man
 't virtue's work alone stretch narrow span
 many sons gods bloody fight
 around walls troy lost light
 sarpedon fell beneath foe
 mighty sire could ward blow
 ev'n turnus shortly shall resign breath
 stands already verge death"
 said god permits fatal fight
 latian fields averts sight

 full force spear young pallas threw
 thrown shining fauchion drew
 steel graz'd along shoulder joint
 mark'd slightly glancing point
 fierce turnus first nearer distance drew
 pois'd pointed spear threw
 winged weapon whizz'd along
 "see now" said "whose arm better strung"
 spear kept fatal course unstay'd
 plates ir'n o'er shield laid
 thro' folded brass tough bull hides pass'd
 corslet pierc'd reach'd heart last
 vain youth tugs broken wood
 soul comes issuing vital blood
 falls arms upon body sound
 bloody teeth bites ground

 turnus bestrode corpse "arcadians hear"
 said "my message master bear
 sire deserv'd son send
 costs dear phrygians' friend
 lifeless body tell bestow
 unask'd rest wand'ring ghost below"
 said trampled force
 left foot spurn'd wretched corse
 snatch'd shining belt gold inlaid
 belt eurytion's artful hands made
 fifty fatal brides express'd sight
 compass one mournful night
 depriv'd bridegrooms returning light

 ill hour insulting turnus tore
 golden spoils worse wore
 mortals blind fate never know
 bear high fortune endure low
 time shall come turnus vain
 shall wish untouch'd trophies slain
 shall wish fatal belt far away
 curse dire remembrance day

 sad arcadians th' unhappy field
 bear back breathless body shield
 grace grief war restor'd
 praises thy sire deplor'd
 one day first sent thee fighting field
 beheld whole heaps foes battle kill'd
 one day beheld thee dead borne upon thy shield
 dismal news uncertain fame
 sad spectators hero came
 friends upon brink ruin stand
 unless reliev'd victorious hand
 whirls sword around without delay
 hews thro' adverse foes ample way
 find fierce turnus conquest proud
 evander pallas friendship ow'd
 large deserts present eyes
 plighted hand hospitable ties

 four sons sulmo four ufens bred
 took fight living victims led
 please ghost pallas expire
 sacrifice fun'ral fire
 magus next threw stoop'd
 flying spear shunn'd promis'd blow
 creeping clasp'd hero's knees pray'd
 "by young iulus thy father's shade
 spare life send back see
 longing sire tender progeny
 lofty house wealth untold
 silver ingots bars gold
 sums besides see day
 ransom one poor life shall pay
 survive troy less prevail
 single soul's light turn scale"
 said hero sternly thus replied
 "thy bars ingots sums beside
 leave thy children's lot thy turnus broke
 rules war one relentless stroke
 pallas fell deems deems alone
 father's shadow living son"
 thus said kind remorse bereft
 seiz'd helm dragg'd left
 right hand neck wreath'd
 hilts shining fauchion sheath'd

 apollo's priest emonides near
 holy fillets front appear
 glitt'ring arms shone amidst crowd
 much god purple proud
 fierce trojan follow'd thro' field
 holy coward fell forc'd yield
 prince stood o'er priest one blow

 vulcanian caeculus renews fight
 umbro born upon mountains' height
 champion cheers troops t' encounter

 anxur's shield drove blow

 anxur boasted much magic charms

 life secur'd vain length years
 tarquitus field triumph trod
 nymph mother sire god
 exulting bright arms braves prince
 protended lance makes defense
 bears back feeble foe pressing
 arrests better hand drags
 stands o'er prostrate wretch lay
 vain tales inventing prepar'd pray
 mows head trunk moment stood
 sunk roll'd along sand blood
 vengeful victor thus upbraids slain
 "lie proud man unpitied plain
 lie inglorious without tomb
 far thy mother thy native home
 exposed savage beasts birds prey

 lycas antaeus next ran
 two chiefs turnus led van
 fled fear chas'd along
 camers yellowlock'd numa strong
 great arms fair young
 camers son volscens lately slain
 wealth surpassing latian train
 amycla fix'd silent easy reign
 aegaeon heav'n strove
 stood opposite arms mighty jove
 mov'd hundred hands provok'd war
 defied forky lightning afar
 fifty mouths flaming breath expires
 flash flash returns fires fires
 right hand many swords wields
 takes thunder many shields
 strength like trojan hero stood
 soon fields falling corps strow'd
 fauchion found taste blood
 fury scarce conceiv'd flew
 niphaeus four coursers drew
 see fiery chief advance
 pushing chests pointed lance
 wheel'd swift motion mad fear
 threw master headlong chair
 stare start stop course
 bear bounding chariot shore

 lucagus liger scour plains
 two white steeds liger holds reins
 lucagus lofty seat maintains
 bold brethren former wav'd air
 flaming sword aeneas couch'd spear
 unus'd threats unus'd fear
 liger thus "thy confidence vain
 scape hence trojan plain
 steeds diomede bestrode
 chariot achilles rode
 venus' veil near neptune's shield
 thy fatal hour come field"
 thus liger vainly vaunts trojan peer
 return'd answer flying spear
 lucagus lash horses bends
 prone wheels left foot protends
 prepar'd fight fatal dart arrives
 thro' borders buckler drives
 pass'd thro' pierc'd groin deadly wound
 cast chariot roll'd ground
 thus chief upbraids scornful spite
 "blame slowness steeds flight
 vain shadows force swift retreat
 forsake empty seat"
 said seiz'd loosen'd rein
 liger lay already plain
 shock stretching hands
 recreant thus wretched life demands
 "now thyself mortal man
 thy breath began
 form'd thee thus divine beg thee spare
 forfeit life hear thy suppliant's pray'r"
 thus much spoke would said
 stern hero turn'd aside head
 cut short "i hear another man
 talk'd thus fight began
 take turn brother
 attend brother stygian flood"
 thro' breast fatal sword sent
 soul issued gaping vent

 storms skies torrents tear ground
 thus rag'd prince scatter'd deaths around
 length ascanius trojan train
 broke camp long besieg'd vain

 meantime king gods mortal man
 held conference queen thus began
 "my sister goddess wellpleasing wife
 still think venus' aid supports strife
 sustains trojans alone
 inborn valor force fortune
 fierce fight courage undecay'd
 judge warriors want immortal aid"
 goddess charming eyes
 soft tone submissively replies
 "why sov'reign lord whose frown fear
 cannot unconcern'd anger bear
 urge thus grief still
 mistress
 almighty pow'r pleasing wife
 might gain grace length'ning turnus' life
 securely snatch fatal fight
 give aged father's sight
 let perish since hold good
 glut trojans pious blood
 yet lineage derives name
 fourth degree god pilumnus came
 yet devoutly pays rites divine
 offers daily incense shrine"

 shortly thus sov'reign god replied
 "since pow'r goodness confide
 little space lengthen'd span
 beg reprieve expiring man
 grant leave take turnus hence
 instant fate far dispense
 secret meaning lies beneath
 save shortliv'd youth destin'd death
 farther thought entertain
 change fates feed hopes vain"
 goddess thus weeping eyes
 "and request tongue denies
 heart grant short reprieve
 length certain life turnus give
 speedy death attends guiltless youth
 presaging soul divines truth
 wish might err thro' causeless fears
 pow'r prolong years"

 thus said involv'd clouds flies
 drives storm thro' skies
 swift descends alighting plain
 fierce foes dubious fight maintain
 air condens'd specter soon made
 aeneas seem'd shade
 adorn'd dardan arms phantom bore
 head aloft plumy crest wore
 hand appear'd shining sword wield
 sustain'd imitated shield
 manly mien stalk'd along ground
 wanted voice belied vaunting sound
 thus haunting ghosts appear waking sight
 dreadful visions dreams night
 specter seems daunian chief dare
 flourishes empty sword air
 advancing turnus hurl'd spear
 phantom wheel'd seem'd fly fear
 deluded turnus thought trojan fled
 vain hopes haughty fancy fed
 "whether coward" thus calls aloud
 found spoke wind chas'd cloud
 "why thus forsake bride receive
 fated land sought long sea"
 said brandishing blade
 eager pace pursued flying shade
 chance ship fasten'd shore
 old clusium king osinius bore
 plank ready laid safe ascent
 shelter trembling shadow bent
 skipp't skulk'd hatches went
 exulting turnus regardless haste
 ascends plank galley pass'd
 scarce reach'd prow saturnia's hand
 haulsers cuts shoots ship land
 wind poop vessel plows sea
 measures back speed former way
 meantime aeneas seeks absent foe
 sends slaughter'd troops shades

 guileful phantom forsook shroud
 flew sublime vanish'd cloud
 late young turnus delusion found
 far sea still making ground
 thankless life redeem'd shame
 sense honor stung forfeit fame
 fearful besides fight pass'd
 hands haggard eyes heav'n cast
 "o jove" cried "for offense
 deserv'd bear endless infamy
 whence forc'd whether borne
 reproach shall return
 shall ever behold latian plain
 see laurentum's lofty tow'rs
 say deserting chief
 war mine fly relief
 led slaughter slaughter leave
 ev'n hence dying groans receive
 overmatch'd fight heaps lie
 scatter'd o'er fields ignobly fly
 gape wide earth draw alive
 ye pitying winds wretch relieve
 sands shelves splitting vessel drive
 set shipwrack'd desart shore
 rutulian eyes may see
 unknown friends foes conscious fame
 lest follow flight proclaim"

 thus turnus rav'd various fates revolv'd
 choice doubtful death resolv'd
 sword sea took place
 revenge purge disgrace
 sometimes thought swim stormy main
 stretch arms distant shore gain
 thrice sword assay'd thrice flood
 juno mov'd pity withstood
 thrice repress'd rage strong gales supplied
 push'd vessel o'er swelling tide
 length lands native shores
 father's longing arms restores

 meantime jove's impulse mezentius arm'd
 succeeding turnus ardor warm'd
 fainting friends reproach'd shameful flight
 repell'd victors renew'd fight
 king tuscan troops conspire
 hate fierce desire
 wish'd revenge alone
 hands employ'd darts thrown
 like solid rock seas inclos'd
 raging winds roaring waves oppos'd

 evas mimas troy slew

 frets froths erects bristled hide

 keep languish'd war alive

 coritus came acron fight
 left spouse betroth'd unconsummate night
 mezentius sees thro' squadrons ride
 proud purple favors bride
 hungry lion beholds
 gamesome goat frisks folds
 beamy stag grazes plain
 runs roars shakes rising mane
 grins opens wide greedy jaws
 prey lies panting underneath paws

 unchew'd morsels churns gore
 proud mezentius rushes foes
 first unhappy acron overthrows
 stretch'd length spurns swarthy ground

 orodes falls equal fight oppress'd
 mezentius fix'd foot upon breast

 "lo champion rebels lies"
 fields around io paean ring
 peals shouts applaud conqu'ring king
 vanquish'd dying breath
 thus faintly spoke prophesied death
 "nor thou proud man unpunish'd shalt remain
 like death attends thee fatal plain"
 sourly smiling thus king replied
 "for belongs let jove provide
 die thou first whatever chance ensue"
 said wound weapon drew
 hov'ring mist came swimming o'er sight
 seal'd eyes everlasting night

 caedicus alcathous slain

 orses strong greater strength must yield
 parthenius rapo kill'd

 thus equal deaths dealt equal chance

 victors vanquish'd various field
 wholly overcome wholly yield
 gods heav'n survey fatal strife
 mourn miseries human life

 concern'd venus juno
 amidst crowd infernal ate shakes

 proud mezentius disdain
 brandish'd spear rush'd plain
 tow'ring midmost rank stood
 like tall orion stalking o'er flood
 brawny breast cuts waves
 shoulders scarce topmost billow laves
 like mountain ash whose roots spread
 deep fix'd earth clouds hides head

 trojan prince beheld afar
 dauntless undertook doubtful war
 collected strength like rock
 pois'd base mezentius stood shock
 stood measuring first careful eyes
 space spear could reach aloud cries
 "my strong right hand sword assist stroke
 gods mezentius invoke

 triumphant lausus shall worn"
 said utmost force threw
 massy spear hissing flew
 reach'd celestial shield stopp'd course
 glancing thence yet unbroken force
 took new bent obliquely betwixt

 anthores argos travel'd far

 solid brass linen trebly roll'd
 three bull hides round buckler fold
 pass'd resistless course
 transpierc'd thigh spent dying force
 gaping wound gush'd crimson flood
 trojan glad sight hostile blood
 faunchion drew closer fight address'd
 new force fainting foe oppress'd

 father's peril lausus view'd grief

 heroic youth 't must

 posterity scarce believe 't true
 pain'd wound useless fight

 incumber'd slow dragg'd spear along

 pious youth resolv'd death
 lifted sword springs forth face foe

 shouts applause ran ringing thro' field

 aeneas thus o'erwhelmed ev'ry side

 thus lausus loud friendly threat'ning cried
 "why wilt thou rush certain death rage
 rash attempts beyond thy tender age
 betray'd pious love" thus forborne
 youth desists insulting scorn
 provokes ling'ring prince whose patience tir'd
 gave place breast fury fir'd
 fates prepar'd sharpen'd shears
 lifted high flaming sword appears
 full descending frightful sway
 thro' shield corslet forc'd th' impetuous way
 buried deep fair bosom lay
 purple streams thro' thin armor strove
 drench'd th' imbroider'd coat mother wove
 life length forsook heaving heart
 loth sweet mansion depart

 blood paleness o'erspread
 pious prince beheld young lausus dead
 griev'd wept sight image brought
 filial love sadly pleasing thought
 stretch'd hand hold said
 "poor hapless youth praises paid

 ''t great aeneas hand fell'"
 distant friends beckons near

 o'er broad shield still gush'd yawning wound
 drew bloody trail along ground

 scarce recover'd sight thus replies
 "why insulting words waste breath
 souls undaunted secure death
 't dishonor brave die
 came hope victory
 ask life fought design
 us'd fortune use thou thine
 dying son contracted band
 gift hateful murd'rer's hand
 favor let sue
 pity conquer'd foes due
 refuse let body
 last retreat humankind grave
 well know th' insulting people's hate
 protect vengeance fate
 refuge poor remains provide

 said sword throat applied
 crimson stream distain'd arms around
 disdainful soul came rushing thro' wound




 book xi

 scarce rosy morning rais'd head
 waves left wat'ry bed
 pious chief double cares attend
 unburied soldiers friend
 yet first heav'n perform'd victor's vows
 bar'd ancient oak boughs
 rising ground trunk plac'd
 spoils dead foe grac'd
 coat arms proud mezentius worn
 naked snag triumph borne
 hung high glitter'd afar
 trophy sacred god war
 arms fix'd leafless wood
 appear'd plumy crest besmear'd blood
 brazen buckler left seen
 truncheons shiver'd lances hung
 right placed corslet bor'd
 neck tied unavailing sword

 crowd chiefs inclose godlike man
 thus conspicuous midst began
 "our toils friends crown'd sure success
 greater part perform'd achieve less
 follow cheerful trembling town
 press entrance presume
 fear fierce mezentius lies
 first fruits war sacrifice
 turnus shall fall extended plain
 omen already slain
 prepar'd arms pursue happy chance
 none unwarn'd may plead ignorance
 heav'n's appointed hour may find
 warlike ensigns waving wind
 meantime rites fun'ral pomps prepare
 due dead companions war
 last respect living bestow
 shield shadows contempt
 conquer'd earth fought
 us blood bought
 first corpse unhappy friend
 sad city evander send
 inglorious age's bloom
 hurried hence severe doom"

 thus weeping spoke took way
 new death lamented pallas lay
 acoetes watch'd corpse whose youth deserv'd
 father's trust son serv'd
 equal faith less auspicious care
 th' attendants slain sorrow share
 troop trojans mix'd appear
 mourning matrons dishevel'd hair
 soon prince appears raise cry
 beat breasts echoes rend sky
 rear drooping forehead ground
 aeneas view'd grisly wound
 pallas manly bosom bore
 fair flesh distain'd purple gore
 first melting tears pious man
 deplor'd sad sight thus began
 "unhappy youth fortune gave rest
 full wishes refus'd best
 came brought thee along bless
 longing eyes share success
 grudg'd thy safe return triumphs due
 prosp'rous valor public view
 thus promis'd thy father lent
 thy needless succor sad consent
 embrac'd parting th' etrurian land
 sent possess large command
 warn'd experience told
 foes warlike disciplin'd bold
 perhaps hopes thy return
 rich odors loaded altars burn
 vain officious pomp prepare
 send back portion war
 bloody breathless body owe
 farther debt pow'rs
 wretched father ere race run
 shall view fun'ral honors son
 triumphs latian war
 fruits plighted faith boasted care
 yet unhappy sire thou shalt see
 son whose death disgrac'd ancestry
 thou shalt blush old man however griev'd
 thy pallas dishonest wound receiv'd
 died death make thee wish late
 thou hadst liv'd see shameful fate
 champion th' ausonian coast
 friend hast thou ascanius lost"

 thus mourn'd gave word around
 raise breathless body ground
 chose thousand horse flow'r
 warlike troops wait funeral
 bear back share evander's grief
 wellbecoming weak relief
 oaken twigs twist easy bier
 shoulders sad burden rear
 body rural hearse borne
 strew'd leaves funeral greens bier adorn
 pale lies looks lovely flow'r
 new cropp'd virgin hands dress bow'r
 unfaded yet yet unfed
 mother earth green stern shall owe
 two fair vests wondrous work cost
 purple woven gold emboss'd
 ornament trojan hero brought
 hands sidonian dido wrought
 one vest array'd corpse one spread
 o'er clos'd eyes wrapp'd around head
 yellow hair flame fall
 catching fire might burn golden caul
 besides spoils foes battle slain
 descended latian plain
 arms trappings horses hearse led
 long array th' achievements dead
 pinion'd hands behind appear
 th' unhappy captives marching rear
 appointed off'rings victor's name
 sprinkle blood fun'ral flame
 inferior trophies chiefs borne
 gauntlets helms loaded hands adorn
 fair inscriptions fix'd titles read
 latian leaders conquer'd dead

 acoetes pupil's corpse attends
 feeble steps supported friends
 pausing ev'ry pace sorrow drown'd
 betwixt arms sinks upon ground
 grov'ling lies deep despair
 beats breast rends hoary hair
 champion's chariot next seen roll
 besmear'd hostile blood honorably foul
 close pomp aethon steed state
 led fun'rals lord wait
 stripp'd trappings sullen pace
 walks big tears run rolling face
 lance pallas crimson crest
 borne behind victor seiz'd rest
 march begins trumpets hoarsely sound
 pikes lances trail along ground
 thus trojan arcadian horse
 pallantean tow'rs direct course
 long procession rank'd pious chief
 stopp'd rear gave vent grief
 "the public care" said "which war attends
 diverts present woes least suspends
 peace manes great pallas dwell
 hail holy relics last farewell"
 said inly thro' mourn'd
 restrained tears camp return'd

 suppliants laurentum sent demand
 truce olive branches hand
 obtest clemency plain
 beg leave draw bodies slain
 plead none common rites deny
 conquer'd foes fair battle die
 cause hate ended death
 could war bodies void breath
 king hop'd would hear king's request
 whose son call'd guest

 suit denied
 hero grants farther thus replied
 "o latian princes severe fate
 causeless quarrels involv'd state
 arm'd unoffending man
 sought friendship ere war began
 beg truce would gladly give
 slain live
 came hither heav'n's command
 sent fate share latian land
 wage wars unjust king denied
 proffer'd friendship promis'd bride
 left turnus turnus try
 cause arms conquer die
 right dispute slain
 fell without fault quarrel maintain
 equal arms let us alone contend
 let vanquish fates befriend
 way tell possess
 royal virgin restore peace
 bear message back ample leave
 slain friends may fun'ral rites receive"

 thus said th' embassadors amaz'd
 stood mute gaz'd
 drances chief harbor'd breast
 long hate turnus foe profess'd
 broke silence first godlike man
 graceful action bowing thus began
 "auspicious prince arms mighty name
 yet whose actions far transcend fame
 would justice force express
 thought equal words less
 answer shall thankfully relate
 favors granted latian state
 wish'd success labor shall attend
 think peace concluded king friend
 let turnus leave realm command
 seek alliance land
 build city fates assign
 shall proud great work join"

 thus drances words well persuade
 rest impower'd soon truce made
 twelve days term allow'd
 latians trojans longer foes
 mix'd woods fun'ral piles prepare
 fell timber forget war
 loud axes thro' groaning groves resound
 oak mountain ash poplar spread ground
 first fall high trunks receive
 loaden wains wedges cleave

 fatal news fame blown
 thro' short circuit th' arcadian town
 pallas slain fame
 triumphs distended pinions bore
 rushing gate people stand
 fun'ral flambeau hand
 wildly stare distracted amaze
 fields lighten'd fiery blaze
 cast sullen splendor friends
 marching troop dead prince attends
 parties meet raise doleful cry
 matrons walls shrieks reply
 mix'd mourning rends vaulted sky
 town fill'd tumult tears
 till loud clamors reach evander's ears
 forgetful state runs along
 disorder'd pace cleaves throng
 falls corpse groaning lies
 silent grief speaks eyes
 short sighs sobs succeed till sorrow breaks
 passage weeps speaks

 "o pallas thou hast fail'd thy plighted word
 fight caution tempt sword
 warn'd thee vain well knew
 perils youthful ardor would pursue
 boiling blood would carry thee far
 young thou wert dangers raw war
 curst essay arms disastrous doom
 prelude bloody fields fights come
 hard elements unauspicious war
 vain vows heav'n unavailing care
 thrice happy thou dear partner bed
 whose holy soul stroke fortune fled
 praescious ills leaving behind
 drink dregs life fate assign'd
 beyond goal nature gone
 pallas late set reach'd soon
 league th' ausonian state
 amidst weapons found fate
 deserv'd return'd
 breathless victor son mourn'd
 yet trojan friend upbraid
 grudge th' alliance gladly made
 't fault pallas fell young
 crime liv'd long
 yet since gods destin'd die
 least led way victory
 first friends fatal shore
 sent whole herds slaughter'd foes
 death great glorious deplore
 add new honors thy grave
 content trojan hero gave
 funeral pomp thy phrygian friends design'd
 tuscan chiefs army join'd
 great spoils trophies gain'd thee bear
 let thy achievements thy share
 even thou turnus hadst trophy stood
 whose mighty trunk better grac'd wood
 pallas arriv'd equal length
 years match thy bulk equal strength
 unhappy man dost thou detain
 troops view tears thou shedd'st vain
 go friends message lord relate
 tell bear bitter fate
 pallas' death live ling'ring
 't behold vengeance son
 stay turnus whose devoted head
 owing living dead
 son expect hand
 't give demand
 joy would gladly go
 greet pallas news below"

 morn dispell'd shades night
 restoring toils restor'd light
 trojan king tuscan chief command
 raise piles along winding strand
 friends convey dead fun'ral fires
 black smold'ring smoke green wood expires
 light heav'n chok'd new day retires
 thrice around kindled piles go
 ancient custom ordain'd
 thrice horse foot fires led
 thrice loud laments hail dead
 tears trickling breasts bedew ground
 drums trumpets mix mournful sound
 amid blaze pious brethren throw
 spoils battle taken foe
 helms bits emboss'd swords shining steel
 one casts target one chariot wheel
 fellows arms restore
 fauchions luckless fight bore
 bucklers pierc'd darts bestow'd vain
 shiver'd lances gather'd plain
 whole herds offer'd bulls fire
 bristled boars woolly sheep expire
 around piles careful troop attends
 watch wasting flames weep burning friends
 ling'ring along shore till dewy night
 new decks face heav'n starry light

 conquer'd latians like pious care
 piles without number dead prepare
 part places fell laid
 part neighb'ring fields convey'd
 corps kings captains renown
 borne state buried town
 rest unhonor'd without name
 cast common heap feed flame
 trojans latians vie like desires
 make field battle shine fires
 promiscuous blaze heav'n aspires

 morning thrice renew'd light
 thrice dispell'd shadows night
 round wasted fires remain
 perform last sad office slain
 rake yet warm ashes
 bones unburn'd earth bestow
 relics country rites grace
 raise mount turf mark place

 palace king appears
 scene solemn pomp tears
 maids matrons widows mix common moans
 orphans sires sires lament sons
 universal sorrow share
 curse cause unhappy war
 broken league bride unjustly sought
 crown usurp'd blood bought
 crimes load name
 turnus alone exclaim
 "let lords o'er th' ausonian land
 engage trojan hero hand hand
 gain lot serve
 't sway seeks deserve"
 drances aggravates adds spite
 "his foe expects dares fight"
 turnus wants party support
 cause credit latian court
 former acts secure present fame
 queen shades mighty name

 thus factious minds fury burn
 legates th' aetolian prince return
 sad news bring cost
 care employ'd embassy lost
 diomedes refus'd aid war
 unmov'd presents deaf pray'r
 new alliance must elsewhere sought
 peace troy hard conditions bought

 latinus sunk sorrow finds late
 foreign son pointed fate
 till aeneas shall lavinia wed
 wrath heav'n hov'ring o'er head
 gods saw espous'd juster side
 late titles field tried
 witness fresh laments fun'ral tears undried
 thus full anxious thought summons
 latian senate council hall
 princes come commanded head
 crowd paths palace lead
 supreme pow'r reverenc'd years

 majestically sad sits state
 bids envoys success relate

 venulus began murmuring sound
 hush'd sacred silence reign'd around
 "we have" said "perform'd high command

 thus venulus concluded report
 jarring murmur fill'd factious court
 torrent rolls rapid force
 dashes o'er stones stop course
 flood constrain'd within scanty space
 roars horrible along th' uneasy race
 white foam gath'ring eddies floats around
 rocky shores rebellow sound

 "i wish ye latins debate

 "such truths king" said "your words contain

 turnus arms fight back breast

 turnus stood mute glad surprise

 attended trojan ghost
 young ornithus bestrode hunter steed
 swift chase apulian breed
 afar spied arms unknown
 o'er broad back ox's hide thrown

 cov'ring cheeks grinn'd around head
 clench'd within hand iron prong
 tower'd rest conspicuous throng
 soon singled flying train
 slew ease thus insults slain
 "vain hunter didst thou think thro' woods chase
 savage herd vile trembling race
 cease thy vaunts victory

 confessing great camilla save thy shame"
 butes orsilochus slew

 gath'ring length deluded foe

 groans roars sues vain grace
 brains mingled blood besmear face

 astonish'd aunus arrives chance
 see fall farther dares advance
 fixing horrid maid eye
 stares shakes finds vain fly
 yet like true ligurian born cheat
 least fortune favor'd deceit
 cries aloud "what courage shown
 trust courser's strength
 forego vantage horse alight
 equal terms begin fight

 said glows anger disdain
 dismounts speed dare plain
 leaves horse large among train

 "vain fool coward" cries lofty maid
 "caught train thou thyself hast laid

 thus said spurs amid foes

 lucky moment sly traitor chose

 "acca 't past swims sight

 bear last words turnus fly speed
 bid timely charge succeed

 said sliding sunk upon plain
 dying open'd hand forsakes rein
 short short pants slow degrees
 mind passage body frees
 drops sword nods plumy crest
 drooping head declining breast
 last sigh struggling soul expires
 murm'ring disdain stygian sounds retires

 shout struck golden stars ensued
 despair rage languish'd fight renew'd
 trojan troops tuscans line

 cynthia's maid high seated afar
 surveys field fortune war
 unmov'd till prostrate plain
 welt'ring blood sees camilla slain
 round corpse friends foes fighting train
 bottom breast drew
 mournful sigh sad words ensue
 "too dear fine ah much lamented maid
 warring trojans thou hast paid
 aught avail'd unhappy strife
 diana's sacred arms save thy life
 yet unreveng'd thy goddess leave
 vot'ry's death vain sorrow grieve
 branded wretch name abhorr'd
 ages shall thy praise record
 th' inglorious coward soon shall press plain
 thus vows thy queen thus fates ordain"

 high o'er field stood hilly mound
 sacred place spread oaks around
 marble tomb dercennus lay
 king latium bore sway
 beauteous opis thither bent flight
 mark traitor aruns height
 refulgent arms soon espied
 swoln success loudly thus cried
 "thy backward steps vain boaster late
 turn like man length meet thy fate
 charg'd message camilla go

 honor undeserv'd cynthia's bow"

 said quiver chose speed
 winged shaft predestin'd deed
 stubborn yew strength applied
 till far distant horns approach'd either side
 bowstring touch'd breast strong drew
 whizzing air fatal arrow flew
 twanging bow sounding dart
 traitor heard felt point within heart
 beating heels pangs death
 flying friends foreign fields bequeath
 conqu'ring damsel expanded wings
 welcome message mistress brings

 leader lost volscians quit field
 unsustain'd chiefs turnus yield
 frighted soldiers captains fly
 speed strength rely
 confus'd flight bear
 spur horses headlong town
 driv'n foes fears resign'd
 turn take wounds behind
 drop shield lance forego
 shoulders bear slacken'd bow
 hoofs horses rattling sound
 beat short thick shake rotten ground
 black clouds dust come rolling sky
 o'er darken'd walls rampires fly
 trembling matrons lofty stands
 rend heav'n female shrieks wring hands
 pressing pursuers pursued
 crush'd crowds mingled multitude
 happy escape throng late
 rush entrance till choke gate
 ev'n sight home wretched sire
 looks sees helpless son expire
 fright folding gates close
 leave friends excluded foes
 vanquish'd cry victors loudly shout
 't terror within slaughter without
 blind fear bounce wall
 moats pursued precipitate fall

 latian virgins valiant despair
 arm'd tow'rs common danger share
 much zeal country's cause inspir'd
 much camilla's great example fir'd
 poles sharpen'd flames high throw
 imitated darts gall foe
 lives godlike freedom bequeath
 crowd first death
 meantime turnus ambush'd shade
 heavy tidings came th' unhappy maid
 "the volscians overthrown camilla kill'd
 foes entirely masters field
 like resistless flood come rolling
 cry goes plain thickens town"

 inflam'd rage furies fire
 daunian's breast fates require
 leaves hilly pass woods vain
 possess'd downward issues plain
 scarce gone straits freed
 secret foes trojan troops succeed
 thro' black forest ferny brake
 unknowingly secure way take
 rough mountains plain descend
 order drawn line extend
 armies open fields seen
 far distance space
 city bend aeneas sees
 thro' smoking fields hast'ning enemies
 turnus views trojans array
 hears th' approaching horses proudly neigh
 soon hosts bloody battle join'd
 westward sea sun declin'd
 intrench'd town armies lie
 night sable wings involves sky




 book xii

 turnus saw latins leave field
 armies broken courage quell'd
 become mark public spite
 honor question'd promis'd fight
 vulgar hate oppress'd
 fury boil'd within breast
 rous'd vigor last debate
 rais'd haughty soul meet fate

 swains libyan lion chase
 makes sour retreat mends pace
 pointed jav'lin pierce side
 lordly beast returns double pride
 wrenches steel roars pain
 sides lashes erects mane
 turnus fares eyeballs flash fire
 thro' wide nostrils clouds smoke expire

 trembling rage around court ran
 length approach'd king thus began
 "no excuses delays stand
 arms prepar'd combat hand hand
 base deserter native land
 trojan word bound take
 conditions make
 renew truce solemn rites prepare
 single virtue trust war
 latians unconcern'd shall see fight
 arm unaided shall assert right
 prostrate body press plain
 crown beauteous bride remain"

 king sedately thus replied
 "brave youth valor tried
 becomes us due respect
 weigh chance war neglect
 want wealth successive throne
 cities arms made
 towns treasures command
 stor'd blooming beauties land
 laurentum one lavinia sees
 unmarried fair noble families
 let speak patience hear
 things perhaps may grate lover's ear
 sound advice proceeding heart
 sincerely free fraudful art
 gods signs manifestly shown
 prince italian born heir throne
 oft augurs prediction skill'd
 oft priests foreign son reveal'd
 yet worth cannot withstood
 brib'd kindness kindred blood
 urg'd wife would denied
 promis'd lavinia bride
 plighted lord force took
 ties treaties honor broke
 account wag'd impious war
 success 't needless declare
 subjects feel share
 twice vanquish'd bloody fields strive
 scarce walls keep hopes alive
 rolling flood runs warm human gore
 bones latians blanch neighb'ring shore
 put end debate
 still unresolv'd still slave fate
 turnus' death lasting peace give
 procure whilst live
 doubtful arms youth betray
 would kinsmen rutulians say
 fall fight heav'n defend
 curse cause hasten'd end
 daughter's lover father's friend
 weigh mind various chance war
 pity parent's age ease care"

 balmy words pour'd vain
 proffer'd med'cine provok'd pain
 wrathful youth disdaining relief
 intermitting sobs thus vents grief
 "the care best fathers take
 concerns desire forsake
 permit languish days
 make best exchange life praise
 arm lance well dispute prize
 blood follows weapon flies
 goddess mother near shroud
 flying coward empty cloud"

 queen fear'd turnus' life
 loath'd hard conditions strife
 held force dying death
 sad accents gave sorrow breath
 "o turnus adjure thee tears
 whate'er price amata's honor bears
 within thy breast since thou art hope
 sickly mind's repose sinking age's prop
 since safety thy life alone
 depends latinus latian throne
 refuse one pray'r
 waive combat pursue war
 whatever chance attends fatal strife
 think includes thine amata's life
 cannot live slave see throne
 usurp'd strangers trojan son"

 flood tears lavinia shed
 crimson blush beauteous face o'erspread
 varying cheeks turns white red
 driving colors never stay
 run flush fade away
 delightful change thus indian iv'ry shows
 bord'ring paint purple glows
 lilies damask'd neighb'ring rose

 lover gaz'd burning desire
 look'd fed fire
 revenge jealous rage secret spite
 roll breast rouse fight
 fixing queen ardent eyes
 firm first intent thus replies
 "o mother tears prepare
 boding omens prejudge war
 resolv'd fight longer free
 shun death heav'n death decree"
 turning herald thus pursues
 "go greet trojan ungrateful news
 denounce tomorrow's light
 shall gild heav'ns need urge fight
 trojan rutulian troops
 shall dye mutual blood latian shore
 single swords quarrel shall decide
 victor beauteous bride"

 said striding speedy pace
 sought coursers thracian race
 approach toss heads high
 proudly neighing promise victory
 sires orythia sent far
 grace pilumnus went war
 drifts thracian snows scarce white
 northern winds fleetness match'd flight
 officious grooms stand ready side
 combs flowing manes divide
 others stroke chests gently soothe pride

 sheath'd limbs arms temper'd mass
 golden metal mountain brass
 head glitt'ring helm tied
 girt faithful fauchion side
 aetnaean forge god fire
 fauchion labor'd hero's sire
 immortal keenness blade bestow'd
 plung'd hissing stygian flood
 propp'd pillar ceiling bore
 plac'd lance auruncan actor wore
 force brandish'd hand
 tough ash trembled like osier wand
 cried "o pond'rous spoil actor slain
 never yet turnus toss'd vain
 fail day thy wonted force go
 sent hand pierce trojan foe
 give tear corslet breast
 eunuch head rend crest
 dragg'd dust frizzled hair soil
 hot vexing ir'n smear'd fragrant oil"

 thus raves wide nostrils flies
 fiery steam sparkles eyes
 fares bull lov'd female's sight
 proudly bellows preludes fight
 tries goring horns tree
 meditates absent enemy
 pushes winds digs strand
 black hoofs spurns yellow sand

 less trojan lemnian arms
 future fight manly courage warms
 whets fury joy prepares
 terminate ling'ring wars
 cheer chiefs tender son relates
 heav'n promis'd expounds fates
 latian king sends cease
 rage arms ratify peace

 morn ensuing mountain's height
 scarcely spread skies rosy light
 th' ethereal coursers bounding sea
 flaming nostrils breath'd day
 trojan rutulian guard
 friendly labor join'd list prepar'd
 beneath walls measure space
 sacred altars rear sods grass
 religious common gods place
 purest white priests heads attire
 living waters bear holy fire
 o'er linen hoods shaded hair
 long twisted wreaths sacred veryain wear

 order issuing town appears
 latin legion arm'd pointed spears
 fields advancing line
 trojan tuscan forces join
 various arms afford pleasing sight
 peaceful train seem peace prepar'd fight
 betwixt ranks proud commanders ride
 glitt'ring gold vests purple dyed
 mnestheus author memmian line
 messapus born seed divine
 sign giv'n round listed space
 man order fills proper place
 reclining ample shields stand
 fix pointed lances sand
 studious sight num'rous throng
 either sex promiscuous old young
 swarm town rest behind
 gates walls houses' tops lin'd
 meantime queen heav'n beheld sight
 eyes unpleas'd mount albano's height
 since call'd albano succeeding fame
 empty hill without name
 thence survey'd field trojan pow'rs
 latian squadrons laurentine tow'rs
 thus goddess skies bespoke
 sighs tears goddess lake
 king turnus' sister lovely maid
 ere lust lawless jove betray'd
 compress'd force grateful god
 made nais neighb'ring flood
 "o nymph pride living lakes" said
 "o renown'd belov'd
 long hast thou known need record
 wanton sallies wand'ring lord
 ev'ry latian fair jove misled
 mount stealth violated bed
 thee alone grudg'd embrace
 gave part heav'n unenvied place
 learn thy near approaching grief
 think wishes want thy relief
 fortune favor'd heav'n's king denied
 lend succor latian side
 sav'd thy brother sinking state
 struggles unequal fate
 goes gods averse o'ermatch'd might
 meet inevitable death fight
 must break truce sustain sight
 thou thou dar'st thy present aid supply
 well becomes sister's care try"

 lovely nymph grief oppress'd
 thrice tore hair beat comely breast
 saturnia thus "thy tears late
 haste snatch snatch'd fate
 new tumults kindle violate truce
 knows changeful fortune may produce
 't crime t' attempt decree
 discharge crime me"
 said sailing winged wind
 left sad nymph suspended mind

 pomp peaceful kings appear
 four steeds chariot latinus bear
 twelve golden beams around temples play
 mark lineage god day
 two snowy coursers turnus' chariot yoke
 hand two massy spears shook
 issued camp arms divine
 aeneas author roman line
 side ascanius took place
 second hope rome's immortal race
 adorn'd white rev'rend priest appears
 off'rings flaming altars bears
 porket lamb never suffer'd shears
 rising sun turns eyes
 strews beasts design'd sacrifice
 salt meal like officious care
 marks foreheads clips hair
 betwixt horns purple wine sheds
 gen'rous juice flame feeds

 aeneas unsheath'd shining sword
 thus pious pray'rs gods ador'd
 "allseeing sun thou ausonian soil
 sustain'd long toil
 thou king heav'n thou queen air
 propitious reconcil'd pray'r
 thou god war whose unresisted sway
 labors events arms obey
 ye living fountains ye running floods
 pow'rs ocean ethereal gods
 hear bear record fall field
 recreant fight turnus yield
 trojans shall encrease evander's town
 ascanius shall renounce th' ausonian crown
 claims questions debate shall cease
 force infringe peace
 juster arms prevail fight
 sure shall divine aright
 trojans shall o'er th' italians reign
 equal unconquer'd shall remain
 join'd laws lands abodes
 ask altars weary gods
 care religious rites mine
 crown king latinus resign
 sov'reign sway share
 pow'r peace command war
 friends another town shall frame
 bless rising tow'rs fair lavinia's name"

 thus erected eyes hands
 latian king altar stands
 "by heav'n" said "and earth main
 pow'rs three contain
 hell upper god
 whose thunder signs peace seals nod
 let latona's double offspring hear
 doublefronted janus swear
 touch sacred altars touch flames
 pow'rs attest names
 whatever chance befall either side
 term time union shall divide
 force fortune shall vows unbind
 shake steadfast tenor mind
 tho' circling seas break bound
 o'erflow shores sap solid ground
 tho' lamps heav'n spheres forsake
 hurl'd hissing nether lake
 ev'n royal scepter" bore
 scepter hand "shall never
 shoot branches renew birth
 orphan cut mother earth
 keen ax dishonor'd hair
 cas'd brass latian kings bear"

 thus public view peace tied
 solemn vows sworn either side
 dues perform'd holy rites require
 victim beasts slain fire
 trembling entrails bodies torn
 fatten'd flames chargers borne

 already rutulians deem man
 o'ermatch'd arms fight began
 first rising fears whisper'd thro' crowd
 gath'ring sound murmur aloud
 side side measure eyes
 champions' bulk sinews size
 nearer approach known
 th' apparent disadvantage
 turnus appears public sight
 conscious fate desponding fight
 slowly moves altar stands
 eyes dejected trembling hands
 mutters undistinguish'd pray'rs
 livid deadness cheeks appears

 anxious pleasure juturna view'd
 th' increasing fright mad multitude
 short sighs thick'ning sobs heard
 found ready minds change prepar'd
 dissembling immortal form took
 camertus' mien habit look
 chief ancient blood arms well known
 great sire greater son
 shape assum'd amid ranks ran
 humoring first motions thus began
 "for shame rutulians bear sight
 one expos'd single fight
 face heav'n confess
 courage colder numbers less
 view trojan host th' arcadian band
 tuscan army count 'em stand
 undaunted battle go
 scarce ev'ry second man share foe
 turnus 't true unequal strife
 shall lose honor devoted life
 change rather immortal fame
 succeeding gods whence came
 servile inglorious band
 foreign lords shall sow native land
 fruitful fields fighting fathers gain'd
 long lazy sons sustain'd"
 words like carried design
 rising murmur runs along line
 ev'n city troops latians tir'd
 tedious war seem new souls inspir'd
 champion's fate pity lament
 league lately sworn repent

 fails goddess foment rage
 lying wonders false presage
 adds sign present eyes
 inspires new courage glad surprise
 sudden fiery tracts
 appears pomp th' imperial bird jove
 plump fowl spies swim lakes
 o'er heads sounding pinions shakes
 stooping fairest train
 strong talons truss'd silver swan
 th' italians wonder th' unusual sight
 lags labors flight
 behold dastard fowl return anew
 united force foe pursue
 clam'rous around royal hawk fly
 thick'ning cloud o'ershade sky
 cuff scratch cross airy course
 th' incumber'd bird sustain force
 vex'd vanquish'd drops pond'rous prey
 lighten'd burthen wings way

 th' ausonian bands shouts salute sight
 eager action demand fight
 king tolumnius vers'd augurs' arts
 cries thus boasted skill imparts
 "at length 't granted long desir'd
 frequent vows requir'd
 ye gods take omen obey
 advance friends charge lead way
 foreign foes whose impious band
 like rapacious bird infest land
 soon like shall forc'd sea
 strength united forego prey
 timely succor country bring
 haste rescue redeem king"

 said pressing onward thro' crew
 pois'd lifted arm lance threw
 winged weapon whistling wind
 came driving miss'd mark design'd
 cornel rattled skies
 tumultuous shouts clamors rise
 nine brothers goodly band stood
 born arcadian mix'd tuscan blood
 gylippus' sons fatal jav'lin flew

 thick storms steel either army fly

 spurr'd hot courser thro' fighting prease
 king aulestes purple known
 tuscan prince regal crown
 shock encount'ring bore
 backward fell fate design'd
 ruins altar behind
 pitching shoulders head
 amid scatt'ring fires lay supinely spread
 beamy spear descending
 cuirass pierc'd thro' body drove
 scornful smile victor cries
 "the gods found fitter sacrifice"
 greedy spoils th' italians strip dead
 rich armor uncrown head

 priest corynaeus arm'd better hand
 altar blazing brand
 ebusus thund'ring pace
 advanc'd battle dash'd face
 bristly beard shines sudden fires
 crackling crop noisome scent expires
 following blow seiz'd curling crown
 left hand cast
 prostrate body knees press'd
 plung'd holy poniard breast

 podalirius sword pursued
 shepherd alsus thro' flying crowd
 swiftly turns aims deadly blow
 full front unwary foe
 broad ax enters crashing sound
 cleaves chin one continued wound
 warm blood mingled brains besmear arms around
 iron sleep stupid eyes oppress'd
 seal'd heavy lids endless rest

 good aeneas rush'd amid bands
 bare head naked hands
 sign truce thus cries aloud
 "what sudden rage new desire blood
 inflames alter'd minds trojans cease
 impious arms violate peace
 human sanctions laws divine
 terms agreed war mine
 dismiss fears let fight ensue
 hand alone shall right gods
 injur'd altars broken vow
 avenging sword faithless turnus owe"

 thus spoke unmindful defense
 winged arrow struck pious prince
 whether human hand came
 hostile god left unknown fame
 human hand hostile god found
 boast triumph base wound

 turnus saw trojan quit plain
 chiefs dismay'd troops fainting train
 th' unhop'd event heighten'd soul inspires
 arms coursers requires

 dead men's weapons living friends
 thus banks hebrus' freezing flood

 seeks combat calls vain
 juturna heard seiz'd mortal fear
 forc'd beam brother's charioteer
 assumes shape armor mien
 like metiscus seat seen

 black swallow near palace plies
 o'er empty courts arches flies
 hawks aloft skims along flood
 furnish loquacious nest food
 drives rapid goddess o'er plains
 smoking horses run loosen'd reins
 steers various course among foes
 conqu'ring brother shows
 straight wheeling flight
 turns bends shuns single fight
 aeneas fir'd fury breaks crowd
 seeks foe calls name aloud
 runs within narrower ring tries
 stop chariot chariot flies
 gain glimpse juturna fears
 far away daunian hero bears

 arts arms avail
 various cares vain mind assail
 great messapus thund'ring thro' field
 left hand two pointed jav'lins held
 encount'ring prince one dart drew
 unerring aim utmost vigor threw
 aeneas saw come stooping low
 beneath buckler shunn'd threat'ning blow
 weapon hiss'd head tore
 waving plume helm wore
 forced hostile act fir'd spite
 flying turnus still declin'd fight
 prince whose piety long repell'd
 inborn ardor invades field
 invokes pow'rs violated peace
 rites injur'd altars redress
 rage abandoning rein
 blood slaughter'd bodies fills plain

 god tell numbers display
 various labors fatal day
 chiefs champions fell either side
 combat slain deaths died
 turnus trojan hero kill'd
 shar'd fame fortune field
 jove could'st thou view avert thy sight
 two jarring nations join'd cruel fight
 leagues lasting love shortly shall unite

 aeneas first rutulian sucro found
 whose valor made trojans quit ground
 betwixt ribs jav'lin drove
 reach'd heart needs second thrust
 turnus two blows two brethren slew
 first horse fierce amycus threw
 leaping ground foot assail'd
 diores equal fight prevail'd
 lifeless trunks leaves upon place
 heads distilling gore chariot grace

 three cold earth trojan hero threw
 without respite one charge slew
 cethegus tanais tagus fell oppress'd
 sad onythes added rest
 theban blood peridia bore

 turnus two brothers lycian shore
 apollo's fane battle sent
 o'erthrew phoebus could fate prevent
 peaceful menoetes kill'd
 long shunn'd dangers field
 lerna's lake silent life led
 nets angle earn'd bread
 pompous cares palaces knew
 wisely th' infectious world withdrew
 poor house father's painful hand
 discharg'd rent plow'd another's land

 flames among lofty woods thrown
 diff'rent sides winds blown
 laurels crackle sputt'ring fire
 frighted sylvans shades retire
 two neighb'ring torrents fall high
 rapid run foamy waters fry
 roll sea unresisted force
 rocks precipitate course
 less rage rival heroes take
 diff'rent ways less destruction make
 spears afar swords hand strike
 zeal slaughter fires souls alike
 like dauntless men maintain field
 hearts pierc'd unknowing yield
 blow blow return wound wound
 heaps bodies raise level ground

 murranus boasting blood springs
 long royal race latian kings
 trojan chariot thrown
 crush'd weight unwieldy stone
 betwixt wheels fell wheels bore
 living load dying body tore
 starting steeds shun glitt'ring sword
 paw trampled limbs forgetful lord

 fierce hyllus threaten'd high face face
 affronted turnus middle space
 prince encounter'd full career
 temples aim'd deadly spear
 fatally flying weapon sped
 thro' helm pierc'd head
 cisseus couldst thou scape turnus' hand
 vain strongest th' arcadian band
 cupentus could gods afford
 availing aid th' aenean sword
 naked heart pursued course
 could plated shield sustain force

 iolas fell grecian pow'rs
 great subverter trojan tow'rs
 doom'd kill heav'n prolong'd date
 pass bounds prefix'd fate
 high lyrnessus troy held
 two palaces expell'd
 mighty man last remains
 little spot foreign earth contains

 hosts broken troops unite
 equal ranks mix mortal fight
 seresthus undaunted mnestheus join
 trojan tuscan arcadian line
 seaborn messapus atinas heads
 latin squadrons battle leads
 strike push throng scanty space
 resolv'd death impatient disgrace
 one falls another fills place

 cyprian goddess inspires son
 leave th' unfinish'd fight storm town
 rolls eyes around plain
 quest turnus seeks vain
 views th' unguarded city afar
 careless quiet secure war
 occasion offers excites mind
 dare beyond task first design'd
 resolv'd calls chiefs leave fight
 attended thus takes neighb'ring height
 crowding troops gen'ral stand
 arms wait high command
 thus lofty prince "hear obey
 ye trojan bands without least delay
 jove us decreed
 requires utmost vigor speed
 instant arms town prepare
 source mischief seat war
 day latian tow'rs mate sky
 shall level plain ashes lie
 people shall slaves unless time
 kneel pardon repent crime
 twice foes vanquish'd plain
 shall wait till turnus slain
 force perjur'd city bend
 began war shall end
 peace profan'd rightful arms requires
 cleanse polluted place purging fires"

 finish'd one soul inspiring
 form'd wedge foot approach wall
 without town unprovided train
 gaping gazing citizens slain
 firebrands others scaling ladders bear
 toss aloft rear
 flames launch'd feather'd arrows fly
 clouds missive arms obscure sky
 advancing front hero stands
 stretching heav'n pious hands
 attests gods asserts innocence
 upbraids breach faith th' ausonian prince
 declares royal honor doubly stain'd
 twice rites holy peace profan'd

 dissenting clamors town arise
 heard advise
 one part peace one war contends
 would exclude foes admit friends
 helpless king hurried throng
 whate'er tide prevails borne along
 thus swain within hollow rock
 invades bees suffocating smoke
 run around labor wings
 disus'd flight shoot sleepy stings
 shun bitter fumes vain try
 black vapors issuing vent involve sky

 fate envious fortune prepare
 plunge latins last despair
 queen saw foes invade town
 brands tops burning houses thrown
 cast round eyes distracted fear
 troops turnus field appear
 stares abroad still vain
 concludes royal youth slain
 mad anguish impotent bear
 mighty grief loathes vital air
 calls cause ill
 owns dire effects ungovern'd
 raves gods beats breast
 tears hands purple vest
 round beam running noose tied
 fasten'd neck obscenely died

 soon fatal news fame blown
 dames daughter known
 sad lavinia rends yellow hair
 rosy cheeks rest sorrow share
 shrieks palace rings madness despair
 spreading rumor fills public place
 confusion fear distraction disgrace
 silent shame seen ev'ry face
 latinus tears garments goes
 public private woes
 filth venerable beard besmears
 sordid dust deforms silver hairs
 much blames softness mind
 obnoxious charms womankind
 soon seduc'd change well design'd
 break solemn league long desir'd
 finish fates troy requir'd

 turnus rolls aloof o'er empty plains
 straggling foes gleans
 flying coursers please less less
 asham'd easy fight cheap success
 thus halfcontented anxious mind
 distant cries come driving wind
 shouts walls shouts murmurs drown'd
 jarring mixture boding sound
 "alas" said "what mean dismal cries
 doleful clamors town arise"
 confus'd stops backward pulls reins
 driver's office sustains
 replies "neglect lord new alarms
 fight urge fortune arms
 want others defend wall
 rival's hand th' italians fall
 shall fatal sword friends oppress
 honor equal equal success"

 prince "o sister knew
 peace infring'd proceeded first
 knew mingled first fight
 vain would deceive sight
 goddess unprofitable care
 sent heav'n involv'd air
 share mortal sorrows sustain
 see brother bleeding plain
 pow'r turnus recourse
 resist fate's prevailing force
 eyes beheld murranus bite ground
 mighty man mighty wound
 heard dearest friend dying breath
 name invoking revenge death
 brave ufens fell honor place
 shun shameful sight disgrace
 earth supine manly corpse lies
 vest armor victor's prize
 shall see laurentum flame
 wanted complete shame
 latins hoot champion's flight
 drances insult point sight
 death hard bear ye gods
 since small compassion show
 receive soul unsullied yet shame
 belies great forefather's name"

 said spoke flying speed
 came sages urging foamy steed
 fix'd wounded face shaft bore
 seeking turnus sent voice
 "turnus alone depends
 last relief compassionate friends
 like lightning fierce aeneas rolling
 arms invests flames invades town
 brands toss'd high winds conspire
 drive along deluge fire
 eyes fix'd foes rejoice
 ev'n king staggers suspends choice
 doubts deliver defend town
 reject call son
 queen utmost hopes plac'd
 suborning death breath'd last
 't true messapus fearless fate
 fierce atinas' aid defends gate
 ev'ry side surrounded foe
 kill greater numbers grow
 iron harvest mounts still remains mow
 far aloof forsaken bands
 rolling chariot drive o'er empty sands

 stupid sate eyes earth declin'd
 various cares revolving mind
 rage boiling bottom breast
 sorrow mix'd shame soul oppress'd
 conscious worth lay lab'ring thought
 love jealousy madness wrought
 slow degrees reason drove away
 mists passion resum'd sway
 rising car turn'd look
 saw town involv'd fire smoke
 wooden tow'r flames already blaz'd
 hands beams rafters rais'd
 bridges laid join space
 wheels roll place place
 "sister fates vanquish'd let us go
 way heav'n hard fortune show
 fight fix'd shall branded name
 base coward blot brother's fame
 death choice suffer try
 force vent rage die"
 said leaping without delay
 thro' crowds scatter'd foes freed way
 striding pass'd impetuous wind
 left grieving goddess far behind
 fragment mountain torn
 raging tempests torrents borne
 sapp'd time loosen'd roots
 prone thro' void rocky ruin shoots
 rolling crag crag steep steep
 sink shepherds sheep
 involv'd alike rush nether ground
 stunn'd shock fall stunn'd earth rebound
 turnus hasting headlong town
 should'ring shoving bore squadrons
 still pressing onward walls drew
 shafts spears darts promiscuous flew
 sanguine streams slipp'ry ground embrue
 first stretching arm sign peace
 cries aloud make combat cease
 "rutulians hold latin troops retire
 fight mine gods require
 't vindicate alone
 broken truce breach atone
 day shall free wars th' ausonian state
 finish misfortunes fate"

 armies bloody work desist
 bearing backward form spacious list
 trojan hero receiv'd fame
 welcome sound heard champion's name
 soon leaves taken works mounted walls
 greedy war greater glory calls
 springs fight exulting force
 jointed armor rattles course
 like eryx like athos great shows
 father apennine white snows
 head divine obscure clouds hides
 shakes sounding forest sides
 nations overaw'd surcease fight
 immovable bodies fix'd sight
 ev'n death stands still throw
 darts drive batt'ringrams
 silent order either army stands
 drop swords unknowing hands
 th' ausonian king beholds wond'ring sight
 two mighty champions match'd single fight
 born climes remote brought fate
 swords try titles state

 clos'd field afar
 view rushing begin war
 launch spears hand hand meet
 trembling soil resounds beneath feet
 bucklers clash thick blows descend high
 flakes fire hard helmets fly
 courage conspires chance ingage
 equal fortune yet mutual rage
 two bulls fair female fight
 sila's shades taburnus' height
 horns adverse meet keeper flies
 mute stands herd heifers roll eyes
 wait th' event victor shall bear
 shall lord rule lusty year
 rage love jealous rivals burn
 push push wound wound return
 dewlaps gor'd sides lav'd blood
 loud cries roaring sounds rebellow thro' wood
 combat listed ground
 clash swords shields resound

 jove sets beam either scale lays
 champions' fate exactly weighs
 side life lucky chance ascends
 loaded death scale descends
 rais'd stretch young turnus aims blow
 full helm unguarded foe
 shrill shouts clamors ring either side
 hopes fears panting hearts divide
 pieces flies traitor sword
 middle stroke deserts lord
 death flight disarm'd flies
 hand unknown hilt spies
 fame says turnus steeds join'd
 hurrying war disorder'd mind
 snatch'd first weapon haste could find
 't fated sword father bore
 charioteer metiscus wore
 trojans fled toughness held
 vain great vulcanian shield
 mortaltemper'd steel deceiv'd hand
 shiver'd fragments shone amid sand

 surpris'd fear fled along field
 forthright orbits wheel'd
 trojan troops list surround
 pass clos'd pools marshy ground
 aeneas hastens tho' heavier pace
 wound newly knit retards chase
 oft trembling knees aid refuse
 yet pressing foot foot foe pursues

 thus fearful stag clos'd around
 crimson toils river found
 high bank deepmouth'd hound appears
 still opening following still where'er steers
 persecuted creature fro
 turns scape umbrian foe
 steep th' ascent gains land
 purple death pitch'd along strand
 eager foe determin'd chase
 stretch'd length gains ground ev'ry pace
 beamy head makes way
 holds thinks holds prey
 pinch stag springs fear
 bites wind fills sounding jaws air
 rocks lakes meadows ring cries
 mortal tumult mounts thunders skies
 thus flies daunian prince flying blames
 tardy troops calling names
 demands trusty sword trojan threats
 realm ruin ancient seats
 lay ashes dare supply
 arms aid vanquish'd enemy
 thus menacing still pursues course
 vigor tho' diminish'd force
 ten times already round listed place
 one chief fled t' giv'n chase
 trivial prize play'd life
 death turnus depends strife

 within space olive tree stood
 sacred shade venerable wood
 vows faunus paid latins' guardian god
 hung vests tablets ingrav'd
 sinking mariners shipwrack sav'd
 heedless hands trojans fell'd tree
 make ground inclos'd combat free
 deep root whether fate chance
 erring haste trojan drove lance
 stoop'd tugg'd force immense free
 th' incumber'd spear tenacious tree
 fainting limbs pursued vain
 flying weapon might far attain

 confus'd fear bereft human aid
 turnus gods first faunus pray'd
 "o faunus pity thou mother earth
 thy foster son receiv'd birth
 hold fast steel religious hand
 plant honor'd foes profan'd
 propitious hear pious pray'r" said
 successless vows invok'd aid
 th' incumbent hero wrench'd pull'd strain'd
 still stubborn earth steel detain'd
 juturna took time vain
 strove assum'd meticus' form
 imitated shape restor'd
 despairing prince daunian sword
 queen love disdain grief
 saw bold nymph afford prompt relief
 t' assert offspring greater deed
 tough root ling'ring weapon freed

 erect rival chiefs advance
 one trusts sword one pointed lance
 resolv'd alike try fatal chance

 meantime imperial jove juno spoke
 shining cloud beheld shock
 "what new arrest queen heav'n sent
 stop fates lab'ring th' event
 farther hopes left thee pursue
 divine aeneas thou know'st
 foredoom'd celestial seats due
 attempts turnus made
 thus thou ling'rest lonely shade
 becoming due respect
 awful honor god elect
 wound unworthy state feel
 patient human hands earthly steel
 seems sister restore
 second sword one lost
 arm conquer'd wretch conqueror
 without thy knowledge avow
 nay thy dictate durst juturna
 last deference love forbear
 lodge within thy soul anxious care
 reclin'd upon breast thy grief unload
 relieve goddess god
 things utmost issue tend
 push'd fates appointed
 leave giv'n thee lawful hour
 vengeance wrath unresisted pow'r
 toss'd seas thou couldst thy foes distress
 driv'n ashore hostile arms oppress
 deform royal house side
 bridegroom tear plighted bride
 cease command" thund'rer said
 dejected eyes answer juno made
 "because dread decree well knew
 turnus earth unwilling withdrew
 else behold alone
 involv'd empty clouds friends bemoan
 girt vengeful flames open sight
 engag'd foes mortal fight
 't true juturna mingled strife
 command save brother's life
 least try stygian lake
 religious oath gods take
 restriction bend bow
 toss spear trembling dart throw
 resign'd superior might
 tir'd fruitless toils loathe fight
 let beg fates withstand
 father's land
 nuptial bed shall bind peace
 since ordain consent bless
 laws either nation
 let latins still retain name
 speak language spoke
 wear habits grandsires wore
 call trojans perish renown
 name troy detested town
 latium latium still let alba reign
 rome's immortal majesty remain"

 thus founder mankind replies
 unruffled front serene eyes
 "can saturn's issue heav'n's heir
 endless anger bosom bear
 mistress full desires obtain
 quench choler foment vain
 ancient blood th' ausonian people sprung
 shall keep name habit tongue
 trojans customs shall tied
 common rites provide
 natives shall command foreigners subside
 shall latium troy without name
 lost sons forget whence came
 blood mix'd pious race shall flow
 equal gods excelling
 nation respect shall pay
 greater off'rings altars lay"
 juno consents well pleas'd desires
 found success cloud retires

 peace thus made thund'rer next prepares
 force wat'ry goddess wars
 deep dismal regions void light
 three daughters birth born night
 brown mother brooding care
 indued windy wings flit air
 serpents girt alike crown'd hissing hair
 heav'n dirae call'd still hand
 throne angry jove stand
 ministers wrath ready still
 minds mortal men fears fill
 whene'er moody sire wreak hate
 realms towns deserving fate
 hurls diseases death deadly care
 terrifies guilty world war
 one sister plague heav'n sent
 fright juturna dire portent
 pest comes whirling far slow
 springs swift arrow parthian bow
 cydon yew traversing skies
 drench'd pois'nous juice sure destruction flies
 sudden unseen flight
 shot thro' clouds daughter night
 soon field inclos'd view
 afar destin'd quarry knew
 contracted boding bird turns
 haunts ruin'd piles hallow'd urns
 beats tombs nightly wings
 songs obscene sepulchers sings
 thus lessen'd form frightful cries
 fury round unhappy turnus flies
 flaps shield flutters o'er eyes

 lazy chillness crept along blood
 chok'd voice hair horror stood
 juturna afar beheld fly
 knew th' ill omen screaming cry
 stridor wings amaz'd fear
 beauteous breast beat rent flowing hair

 "ah me" cries "in unequal strife
 thy sister save thy life
 weak alas contend
 arms inexorable fiend
 quit field forbear fright
 tender soul ye baleful birds night
 lashing wings know well
 sounding flight fun'ral screams hell
 gifts bring haughty jove
 worthy recompense ravish'd love
 exempt life fate
 hard conditions immortal state
 tho' born death privileg'd die
 forc'd bear impos'd eternity
 take back envious bribes let go
 companion brother's ghost
 joys vanish'd nothing remains
 life immortal immortal pains
 earth open devouring womb
 rest weary goddess tomb"
 drew length sighs said
 azure mantle wrapp'd head
 plung'd stream deep despair
 last sobs came bubbling air

 stern aeneas weighty spear
 foe thus upbraids fear
 "what farther subterfuge turnus find
 empty hopes harbor'd mind
 't thy swiftness secure thy flight
 feet hands valiant fight
 vary thy shape thousand forms dare
 skill courage attempt war
 wish wings winds mount sky
 hid within hollow earth lie"
 champion shook head made short reply
 "no threats thine manly mind move
 't hostile heav'n dread partial jove"
 said sigh repress'd
 mighty sorrow swelling breast

 roll'd troubled eyes around
 antique stone saw common bound
 neighb'ring fields barrier ground
 vast twelve strong men modern days
 th' enormous weight earth could hardly raise
 heav'd lift pois'd high
 ran stagg'ring enemy
 disorder'd scarcely knew
 way unwieldly weight threw
 knocking knees bent beneath load
 shiv'ring cold congeals vital blood
 stone drops arms falling short
 want vigor mocks vain effort
 heavy sleep clos'd sight
 sickly fancy labors night
 seem run destitute force
 sinking limbs forsake us course
 vain heave breath vain cry
 nerves unbrac'd usual strength deny
 tongue falt'ring accents die
 turnus far'd whatever means tried
 force arms points art employ'd
 fury flew athwart made th' endeavor void

 thousand various thoughts soul confound
 star'd aid issue found
 men stop pass walls surround
 pauses looks
 seeks goddess charioteer vain
 trembling views thund'ring chief advance
 brandishing aloft deadly lance
 amaz'd cow'rs beneath conqu'ring foe
 forgets ward waits coming blow
 astonish'd stands fix'd fear
 aim'd shield sees th' impending spear

 hero measur'd first narrow view
 destin'd mark rising threw
 full swing fatal weapon flew
 less rage rattling thunder falls
 stones batt'ringengines break walls
 swift whirlwind arm strong
 lance drove bore death along
 naught could sev'nfold shield prince avail
 aught beneath arms coat mail
 pierc'd thro' grisly wound
 transfix'd thigh doubled ground
 groans latins rend vaulted sky
 woods hills valleys voice reply

 low earth lofty chief laid
 eyes cast upward arms display'd
 recreant thus proud victor pray'd
 "i know death deserv'd hope live
 use gods thy good fortune give
 yet think think mercy may shown
 thou hadst father hast son
 pity sire sinking grave
 anchises' sake old daunus save
 thy vow'd revenge pursue death
 give friends body void breath
 latian chiefs seen beg life
 thine conquest thine royal wife
 yielded man 't mean ignoble strife"

 deep suspense trojan seem'd stand
 prepar'd strike repress'd hand
 roll'd eyes ev'ry moment felt
 manly soul compassion melt
 casting casual glance spied
 golden belt glitter'd side
 fatal spoils haughty turnus tore
 dying pallas triumph wore
 rous'd anew wrath loudly cries
 flames spoke came flashing eyes
 "traitor dost thou dost thou grace pretend
 clad thou art trophies friend
 sad soul grateful off'ring go
 't pallas pallas gives deadly blow"
 rais'd arm aloft word
 deep bosom drove shining sword
 streaming blood distain'd arms around
 disdainful soul came rushing thro' wound

 vi
 six years run since first martial guise

 upon christian lords gracious eye
 wondrous look wherewith oft surveyed
 men's secret thoughts concealed lie
 cast puissant godfrey assayed
 drive turks sion's bulwarks high
 full zeal faith esteemed light
 worldly honor empire treasure might

 ix
 baldwin next spied another thought
 spirits proud vain ambition move
 tancred saw life's joy set naught
 woebegone pains love
 boemond conquered folk antioch brought
 gentle yoke christian rule prove
 taught laws statutes customs new
 arts crafts obedience religion true

 x
 care busy work plied
 naught else acting thoughts bent
 young rinaldo fierce desires spied
 noble heart rest impatient
 wealth sovereign power naught applied
 wits virtue excellent
 patterns rules skill courage bold
 took guelpho fathers old

 xi
 thus lord discovered seen
 hidden secrets worthy's breast
 hierarchies angels sheen
 gentle gabriel called rest
 'twixt god souls men righteous
 ambassador forever blest
 commands heaven's eternal king
 'twixt skies earth doth bring

 xii
 lord thus spake "godfredo find
 name ask doth rest
 arms ease peace resigned
 frees jerusalem distrest
 peers counsel call baser mind
 let stir chieftain rest
 choose earth shall allow
 fellows late shall subjects now"

 said angel swift prepared
 execute charge imposed aright
 form airy members fair imbared

 fringed gold unwearied nimble swift
 parts winds clouds air
 seas earth doth lift
 thus clad cut spheres circles fair
 pure skies sacred feathers clift
 libanon first foot set
 shook wings rory may dews wet

 xv
 tortosa's confines swiftly sped
 sacred messenger headlong flight
 eastern wave appeared red
 rising sun yet scantly half sight
 godfrey e'en morndevotions said
 custom titan bright
 appeared angel shape divine
 whose glory far obscured phoebus' shine

 xvi
 "godfrey" quoth "behold season fit
 war thou waited hast long
 serves time thou o'erslip
 free jerusalem thrall wrong
 thou thy lords council quickly sit
 comfort feeble confirm strong
 lord hosts general doth make thee
 chieftain shall gladly take thee

 xvii
 "i messenger everlasting jove
 great name thus behests tell
 oh sure hope conquest ought thee move
 zeal love thy bosom dwell"
 said vanished seats
 height clearness rest excel
 fell duke joints dissolved asunder
 blind light strucken dead wonder

 sureties shall doubt overcast
 forslow siege well foresee

 xxix
 said hermit peter rose spake
 sate counsel great lords among
 "at request war undertake
 private cell erst lived closed long
 godfrey wills question make
 cast doubts truth plain strong
 acts trust correspond speech
 yet one thing would gladly teach

 xxx
 "these strifes unless far mistake thing
 discords raised oft disordered sort
 disobedience ill managing
 actions lost want due support
 refer justly spring
 spring sedition strife oppression tort
 mean commanding power sundry given
 thought opinion worth estate uneven

 xxxi
 "where divers lords divided empire hold
 causes gifts justice tried
 offices falsely bought sold
 needs must lordship virtue slide
 friendly parts one body uphold
 create one head rest rule guide
 one regal power sceptre give
 henceforth may king sovereign live"

 lxxxii
 fear ill exceeds evil fear
 present harms still annoy us
 mind prest open every ear
 hear new tidings though way joy us
 secret rumor whispered everywhere
 town christians destroy us
 aged king coming evil knew
 cursed thoughts false heart renew

 lxxxiii
 aged prince ycleped aladine
 ruled care new sovereign state
 tyrant erst fell engine

 "but lest effect cursed
 let us destroy serpent nest
 young old let us people kill
 tender infants mothers' breast
 houses burn holy temples fill
 bodies slain loved best
 tomb hold much price
 let's offer priests sacrifice"

 lxxxviii
 thus thought tyrant traitorous mind
 durst follow decreed
 yet innocents mercy find
 cowardice truth proceed
 noble foes durst craven kind
 exasperate bloody deed
 need grace could got
 thus peace broke loosed knot

 lxxxix
 villain heart cursed rage restrained
 thoughts bent fierce desire
 suburbs first flat earth plained
 burnt buildings devouring fire
 loth wretch frenchman gained
 help ease finding aught entire
 cedron bethsaida watering else
 empoisoned fountains springs wells

 xc

 second book

 argument
 ismeno conjures charms vain
 aladine kill christians ire
 sophronia olindo would slain
 save rest king grants desire
 clorinda hears fact fortunes plain
 pardon gets keeps fire
 argantes aletes' speeches
 despised defies duke mortal war



 thus tyrant bends thoughts arms
 ismeno gan tofore sight appear
 ismen dead bones laid cold graves warms
 makes speak smell taste touch see hear
 ismen terror mighty charms
 makes great dis deepest hell fear
 binds looses souls condemned woe
 sends devils errands fro

 ii
 christian macon adores
 could quite wonted faith forsake
 wicked arts oft implores
 help lord aid pluto black
 deep caves acheron's dark shores
 circles vain spells used make
 advise king extremes come
 achitophel counselled absalom

 iii
 "my liege" says "the camp fast hither moves
 axe laid unto cedar's root
 let us work valiant men behoves
 boldest hearts good fortune helpeth
 princely care kingly wisdom proves
 well labored well foreseen
 perform charge duty
 nought grave conquer shall foe

 iv
 "from surest castle secret cell
 come partaker good ill
 counsel sage magic's sacred spell
 may profit us perform
 sprites impure bliss whilom fell
 shall service bow constrained skill
 must begin enterprise
 highness thus brief advise

 v
 "within christian's church light skies
 hidden alter stands far sight
 image consecrated lies
 christ's dear mother called virgin bright
 hundred lamps aye burn eyes
 slender veil tinsel dight
 every side great plenty doth behold
 offerings brought myrrh frankincense gold

 vi
 "this idol would removed away
 thence princely hand transport
 macon's sacred temple safe lay
 enchant wondrous sort
 image church doth stay
 strength arms shall win noble fort
 shake puissant wall passing might
 spells charms said aright"

 vii
 advised thus king impatient
 flew fury house god
 image took words unreverent
 abused prelates deed forbode
 swift prey away tyrant went
 god's sharp justice naught feared rod
 chapel vile image laid
 enchanter charms witchcraft said

 viii
 phoebus next unclosed wakeful eye
 rose sexton place profane
 missed image used lie
 sough grief fear vain
 king loss gan descry
 sore enraged killed pain
 straight conceived malicious wit
 christian bade great offence commit

 ix
 whether act mortal hand
 else prince heaven's eternal pleasure
 mercy would wretch withstand
 let vile chest hold treasure
 yet conjecture hath fully scanned
 godliness let us action measure
 truth purest faith fitly prove
 rare grace came heaven

 x
 busy search tyrant gan invade
 house hold temple tent
 fault faulty one bewrayed
 hid promised gifts punishment
 idle charms false enchanter said
 maze still wandered miswent
 heaven decreed conceal
 make miscreant feel shame

 xi
 angry king discovered
 guilty hand sacrilege wrought
 ireful courage boiled vengeance hot
 christians faulters thought
 ruth compassion mercy forgot
 staff beat dog long sought
 "let die" quoth "kill great small
 shall offender perish sure withal

 xii
 "to spill wine poison mixed spares
 slay righteous faulty one
 destroy field yieldeth naught tares
 thorns vineyard overgone
 among wretches one cares
 us laws religion
 dear subjects fire weapon take
 burn murder kill traitors sake"

 xiii
 herod thus would bethlem's infants kill
 christians soon direful news receave
 trump death sounds hearing shrill
 weapon faith fortress grave
 courage time device
 fight fly excuse pardon crave
 stood prepared die yet help find
 whence least hope knots heaven unbind

 xiv
 among dwelt parents' joy pleasure
 maid whose fruit ripe overyeared
 beauty esteemed treasure
 field love plough virtue eared
 labor goodness godliness leisure
 house heaven full moon aye cleared
 lovers' eyes withdrawn alone
 virgin beams spotless cynthia shone

 xv
 availed resolution chaste
 whose soberest looks whetstones desire
 love consents beauty's field lie waste
 visage set olindo's heart fire
 subtle love thousand wiles thou hast
 humble suit service hire
 win maiden's hold thing soon done
 nature framed women

 xvi
 sophronia olindo hight youth
 one town one faith taught
 fair full bashfulness truth
 loved much hoped little desired nought
 durst speak suit purchase ruth
 saw marked wist sought
 thus loved thus served long regarded
 unseen unmarked unpitied unrewarded

 xvii
 came message murderment
 wherein guiltless friends hopeless starve
 noble wise fair gent
 cast might harmless lives preserve
 zeal spring whence flowed hardiment
 maiden shame yet loth swerve
 yet courage ta'en sure hold
 boldness shamefaced shame made bold

 xviii
 forth went shop merchandise
 full rich stuff none sale exposed
 veil obscured sunshine eyes
 rose within sweetness closed
 ornament seemly lies
 curious chance careless art composed
 neglects curious prove
 beauty's helped nature heaven love

 xix
 admired went noble maid
 presence king gained
 swelled ire afraid
 fierce wrath fearless grace sustained
 "i come" quoth "but thine anger stayed
 causeless rage 'gainst faultless souls restrained
 come show thee bring thee
 wight whose fact hath made thy heart wroth"

 xx
 molest boldness lightning ray
 sweet beauty streamed face
 struck prince wonder dismay
 changed cheer cleared moody grace
 eyes disposed looks play
 king snared love's strong lace
 wayward beauty doth fancy move
 frown forbids smile engendereth love

 xxi
 amazement wonder delight
 although love moved cruel sense
 "tell on" quoth "unfold chance aright
 thy people's lives grant recompense"
 "behold faulter sight
 hand committed supposed offence
 took image mine fault fact
 mine glory virtuous act"

 xxii
 spotless lamb thus offered blood
 save rest christ's selected fold
 noble lie ever truth good
 blest lips leasing told
 thoughtful awhile remained tyrant wood
 native wrath gan space withhold
 said "that thou discover soon
 aid counsel had'st thou ill"

 xxiii
 "my lofty thoughts" answered "envied
 another's hand work high desire
 thirst glory partner bide
 mine self alone conspire"
 "on thee alone" tyrant replied
 "shall fall vengeance wrath ire"
 "'tis right" quoth "i yield consent
 mine honor mine punishment"

 xxiv
 wretch new enraged
 asked hid image conveyed
 "not hid" quoth "but quite consumed flame
 idol eternal maid
 least preserved
 hands profane eft betrayed
 lord thing thus stolen demand
 see thief scorneth death therefor

 xxv
 "and yet theft sin
 brought unjustly took"
 heard tyrant rage begin
 whet teeth bend frowning look
 pity youth fairness grace could win
 joy comfort hope virgin forsook
 wrath killed remorse vengeance stopped mercy's breath
 love's thrall hate beauty's slave death

 xxvi
 ta'en damsel without remorse
 king condemned guiltless fire
 veil mantle plucked force
 bound tender arms twisted wire
 dumb silver dove corse
 hungry kites plucked rich attire
 deal perplexed sprite
 damask late changed purest white

 xxvii
 news mishap spread far near
 people ran young old gaze
 olindo also ran gan fear
 lady partner case
 found bound stript gear
 vile tormentors ready saw place
 broke throng presence brast
 thus bespake king rage haste

 xxxviii
 "not grief shall bear away
 honor noble feat
 durst could convey
 massy substance idol great
 sleight wardens betray
 strength heave goddess seat
 lord sails wind"
 ah thus loved yet love unkind

 xxix
 added "where shining glass
 lets light amid temple's side
 broken byways inward pass
 window made postern wide
 shall therefore illadvised lass
 usurp glory fact betide
 mine bonds mine flames pure
 glorious death glorious sepulture"

 xxx
 sophronia raised modest looks ground
 lover bent eyesight mild
 "tell fury conceit unsound
 presenteth death sweet child
 sufficient courage found
 bear anger tyrant wild
 hath fond love thy heart overgone
 wouldst thou live let die alone"

 xxxi
 thus spake nymph yet spake wind
 could alter wellsettled thought
 miracle strife wondrous kind
 love virtue contention wrought
 death victor meed assigned
 neglect other's safety sought
 thus king provoked ire
 strife bellows served anger's fire

 xxxii
 thinks thoughts selfguiltiness finds
 scorned power therefore scorned pain
 "nay nay" quoth "let strife doubt
 shall win fit reward obtain"
 sergeants hent young man stout
 bound likewise worthless chain
 back back fast stake ties
 two harmless turtles dight sacrifice

 xxxiii
 pile fagots sticks hay
 bellows raised newlykindled flame
 thus olindo doleful lay
 begun late bootless plaints frame
 "be bonds hopedfor day
 join longdesired dame
 fire alike burn hearts
 ah hard reward lovers' kind desarts

 xxxiv
 "far flames bonds kind lovers prove
 thus fortune casts hapless die
 death hath exchanged shafts love
 cupid thus lets borrowed arrows fly
 hymen say fury doth thee move
 lend thy lamps light tragedy
 yet contents die thee
 thy flames mine death torment

 xxxv
 "yet happy death mine ending blest
 torments easy full sweet delight
 could obtain breast breast
 thy bosom might receive yielded sprite
 thine heaven's pure clothing drest
 clearest skies might take united flight"
 thus complained gently reproved
 sweetly spake thus loved

 xxxvi
 "far plaints dear friend tears laments
 time place estates require
 think thy sins man's old foe presents
 judge quits soul hire
 name suffer pain torments

 thou didst live die feed thine eyes

 lxix
 "our loss thine provokes plaints tears
 lost thee ship mast

 echo sighed groves unseen
 weeping nymphs fled bowers exiled

 funeral cypress holly ever green
 weeping fir thick beech sailing pine

 lxxvi

 barren plantain walnut sound
 myrrh foul sin doth still deplore
 alder owner waterish ground
 sweet juniper whose shadow hurteth sore
 proud cedar oak king forests crowned
 thus fell trees noise deserts roar

 false words kindled fire began
 every vein poisoned heart reach
 swelled scornful heart forth ran
 proud looks audacious speech
 thought blameworthy man
 disgrace would preach
 termed proud vain worth fight
 called foolhardise rashness madness right

 xxiv
 rare excellent
 good princely found
 sharp words malice could invent
 blamed power wicked tongue wound
 youth everywhere rumors went
 reproaches heard sometimes sound
 tongue fault amend
 brought woful end

 xxv
 cursed fiend set tongue large
 still bred fancies idle brain
 heart slanders new overcharge
 soothed still angry vein
 amid camp place broad large
 one fair regiment might easily train
 tilt harmless tournament
 days rest youths gallants spent

 xxvi
 fortune would betide
 amid press gernando gan retire
 vomit venom unespied
 wherewith foul envy heart inspire
 rinaldo heard stood beside
 could bridle wrath ire
 "thou liest" cried loud word
 head tossed flaming sword

 xxvii
 thunder voice lightning seemed brand
 fell look furious cheer
 gernando trembled saw hand
 pale death neither help comfort near
 yet soldiers witness stand
 made proud sign though naught fear
 bravely drew littlehelping blade
 valiant show strong resistance made

 xxviii
 thousand blades burnished steel
 glistered heaps like flames fire sight
 hundreds knew yet quarrel weel

 xxxii

 beheld sad rueful sight
 signs death upon face appear
 dust blood locks loathly dight

 made sudden death great knight
 amazed asked durst much

 xxxiii

 prince murdered quarrel vain
 young rinaldo desperate wrath

 one christ's champions bold killed hath

 xxxiv

 law law inviolate
 none offence could greater uneath
 yet place fault aggravate
 escapes mischief would take breath
 flourish bold spite rule state
 gernando's friends would venge wrong
 although justice first belong

 xxxv

 raise mutinies therefore ensueth
 lastly praised dead still rife
 words thought could vengeance move rut
 tancred argued life
 honest reasons excuse youth
 duke heard sober cheer
 banished hope still increased fear

 xxxvi
 "great prince" quoth tancred "set thine eyes
 rinaldo's worth courage
 much hope conquest lies
 regard princely house race
 correcteth every fault spies
 judgeth alike doth amiss
 faults know greater thought less
 person's self doth transgress"

 xxxvii
 godfredo answered "if high low
 sovereign power alike feel stroke
 tancred ill counsel us trow
 lords know law erst spoke
 vile base empire know
 none slaves peasants bear yoke
 weak sceptre power small
 provisos bring annexed withal

 xxxviii
 "but mine freely given ere 'twas sought
 lessened consent

 give condign reward punishment
 since like subjection brought
 high low obey content"
 heard tancredi wisely stayed words
 weight sayings kings lords

 xxxix

 "'tis best" quoth "to make great ones shrink

 yet dare say godfredo means know
 knowledge hath looks speeches wrought

 xlii
 bitter smile well might see
 rinaldo cast scorn high disdain
 "let fetters plead cause" quoth
 "that base peasants born servile stain
 free born live die free

 otho chosen doth strength assay
 saddle tumbleth dust
 captive town sent away
 tancred begins new fight trust

 ii
 wary king commands

 whether sun moon stars appear
 give time work time comes wrong
 every street new weapons forged
 cunning smiths sweating labor long
 thus careful prince provision made
 argantes came boasting said

 iii
 "how long shall like prisoners chains
 captived lie inclosed within wall
 see workmen taking endless pains

 meanwhile western thieves destroy plains
 towns burnt forts castles fall
 yet none us dares gates outpeep

 iv
 "their time feasting good cheer spend

 king upon aid relied
 "within power sir king" says "united

 "perchance comes heavenly messenger

 yearned courage hot foes find

 "if go forth remain behind

 xxii
 thus spake king soon without abode
 troop went forth shining armor clad
 rest pagan champion rode
 wonted arms ensigns
 goodly plain displayed wide broad
 city camp spread
 place like wherein proud rome beheld
 forward young men manage spear shield

 xxiii
 alone argantes took stand
 defying christ servants true
 stature stomach strength hand
 pride presumption dreadful show
 encelade like phlegrean strand
 huge giant jesse's infant slew
 fierce semblant esteemed light
 knew else feared might

 xxiv
 yet one godfrey singled
 undertake hardy enterprise
 prince tancred saw rout
 fixed wishes cast eyes
 spied gazing round
 though honor prowess lies
 whispered louder meant
 godfrey heard saw content

 xxv
 rest gave place every one descried
 chieftain's incline
 "tancred" quoth "i pray thee calm pride
 abate rage yonder saracine"
 longer would chosen champion bide
 face joy eyes gladness shine
 helm took ready steed bestrode
 guarded trusty friends forth rode

 xxvi
 scantly spurred courser swift
 near plain proud argantes stayed
 unawares eyes chanced lift
 hill beheld warlike maid
 white snow upon alpine clift
 virgin shone silver arms arrayed

 xxvii

 looks would foeman kill
 full thoughts forward fared
 sent looks hill

 last marble rock standeth still
 stone cold without within burnt love's flame
 quite forgot came

 xxviii
 challenger yet saw none appear
 made sign show came
 "how long" cried "shall attend
 dares none come forth dares none fortune trust"
 stood amazed love stopped ear
 thinks cupid think mars lust

 xxix
 youth one late desired
 vainglorious boaster fought
 tancred chosen retired
 slackness awhile admired
 saw elsewhere employed thought
 though chosen proffered
 boldly took fit occasion offered

 xxx

 tancredi started noise heard
 waked sleep dreamed long
 "oh stay" cried "to belongs war"
 cried late otho gone far

 xxxi

 stayed horse waxed red shame
 fight disgraced quite
 thought another played game
 meanwhile saracen hugely smite
 otho's helm requite
 foe quite sevenfold targe bear
 breastplate stuck broke spear

 xxxii

 yet proud foe strong sturdy

 knight lay full low alas
 high disdain thus gan tell
 "yield thee slave thine honor

 xxxiii
 "not so" quoth "pardy guise
 christian knights though fall'n soon yield
 fall excuse better wise

 great circassian bent frowning eyes
 like grim visage minerva's shield
 "then learn" quoth "what force argantes useth
 fool proffered grace refuseth"

 xxxiv
 spurred horse speed haste
 forgetting good knights virtue owe
 otho fury shunned passed
 right side reached noble blow
 wide wound blood outstreamed fast

 avails hurt wounds augment
 foe's fierce courage strength hardiment

 xxxv
 argantes nimbly turned ready steed
 ere foe wist well aware

 force could gainst great might prepare
 weak feeble joints courage dead
 heart amazed paleness showed care
 tender side gainst hard earth cast
 shamed first fall bruised last

 xxxvi
 victor spurred lightfoot steed
 made passage otho's heart
 cried "these fools thus foot tread
 dare contend equal mart"
 tancred anger shook noble head
 grieved unknightly part
 fault slow
 double valor would salve sore

 xxxvii
 forward galloped fast loudly cried
 "villain" quoth "thy conquest thy shame
 praise honor shall fact betide
 gain guerdon shall befall
 among arabian thieves thy face go hide
 far resort men worth fame
 else woods mountains wild night
 savage beasts employ thy savage might"

 xxxviii
 pagan patience never knew used
 trembling ire sandy locks tore
 lips flew sound confused
 lions make deserts thick roar
 clouds together crushed bruised
 pour tempest caspian shore
 speech imperfect stopped broken
 roared thundered spoken

 xxxix

 xli

 xlviii

 fury new force courage new supplies
 armors forged metal frail
 every side thereof huge cantels flies
 land strewed plate mail
 earth warm blood lies

 xlix

 twixt hope fear stood long time amazed

 lxiii
 hence furious combat surveyed

 secret thoughts thus fancy said
 behold thy dear danger slain

 saw lord wounds hurts tormented
 complained called help fainted
 found awaked unquiet sleeping
 heart panting sore eyes red weeping

 lxxi
 "o spotless virgin" honor thus begun
 "that true lore observed firmly hast
 thy foes thou didst bondage
 remember kept thee pure chaste
 liberty wouldest thou run
 lay field princely virtue waste
 lose jewel ladies hold dear
 maidenhood great load bear

 lxxii
 "or deem'st thou praise little prize
 glorious title virgin's name

 amid thine armed foes seek thy shame
 fool woman conquers flies
 refusal kindleth proffers quench flame
 thy lord judge thou sinnest beyond measure
 vainly thus thou waste rich treasure"

 lxxiii
 sly deceiver cupid thus beguiled
 simple damsel filed tongue
 "thou wert born" quoth "in desert wild
 cruel bears savage beasts among
 shouldest scorn fair citherea's child
 hate pleasures youth belong

 lxxiv
 "go go whither sweet desire inviteth

 "besides thanks praises deed

 thy soft hand doth wholesome plaisters speed

 thence thy dearest lord may health succeed
 strength limbs blood cheeks thin
 rare beauties half dead

 lxxvii
 "so shall part adventures bold
 valiant acts henceforth held thine
 dear embracements shall thee straight enfold
 together joined marriage rites divine
 lastly high place honor shalt thou hold

 lxxx
 kept secret clorinda heard
 make complaints secretly lament
 cause sorrow referred
 matter enough discontent
 like bird close imbarred
 tender young ones springing bent

 lxxxi
 alone within chamber's secret part
 sitting one day upon heavy thought
 devising means sleight art
 close departure safest wrought
 assembled unresolved heart
 hundred passions strove ceaseless fought
 last saw high hanging wall
 clorinda's silver arms sighed withal

 lxxxii
 sighing softly said
 "how blessed virgin might
 envy glory maid

 steps trailing garments stayed
 chambers hide valor shining bright
 armed rides breaketh sword spear

 lxxxiii
 "alas heaven members frail

 soul rest quiet slide

 lxxxvi
 "alas impossible things

 heedless porter beguiled therefore

 maiden's beast speed likewise pass
 yet divers ways fear went
 squire late returned alas
 tardy news prince tancredi's tent
 fled likewise saw mistress gone

 cxii
 alicandro wiser rest

 cxiii

 rode haste though half arms miss
 among sandy fields valleys green

 jolly shepherd sung lusty round

 thither went old man found
 whose right hand little flock feed
 sat making baskets three sons among

 vii
 beholding one shining arms appear
 seely man sore dismay'd
 sweet erminia comforted fear

 happy folk heav'n beloved dear

 dreadful arms bear warfare bring

 "but father since land towns towers

 "haply heaven's defence shield right

 "time one hath doating time

 xiii
 "enticed hope future gain
 suffered long soul displease
 youth spent hope vain
 felt native strength last decrease
 gan loss lusty years complain
 wished enjoyed country's peace

 xiv
 thus spake erminia hushed still
 wise discourses heard great attention
 speeches grave idle fancies kill
 troubled soul bred dissension
 much thought reformed
 within woods dwell intention
 till fortune occasion new afford
 turn home desired lord

 xv
 said therefore "o shepherd fortunate
 troubles didst whilom feel prove
 yet livest contented state
 let mishap thy thoughts pity move
 entertain willing mate
 shepherd's life admire love
 within pleasant groves perchance heart
 discomforts may unload part

 xvi
 "if gold wealth esteemed dear

 trickled many silver tear
 two crystal streams fell watery eyes
 part sad misfortunes told
 wept wept shepherd old

 xvii
 speeches kind gan virgin dear
 toward cottage gently home guide
 aged wife made homely cheer
 yet welcomed placed side
 princess donned poor pastoral's gear
 kerchief coarse upon head tied
 yet gestures looks guess
 ill beseemed shepherdess

 xviii
 rude garments could obscure hide
 heavenly beauty angel's face
 princely offspring damnified

 xxxi
 castle meadow plain
 beside bridge's end stayed stood
 entreated speeches vain
 false guide pass beyond flood
 upon bridge appeared warlike swain
 top toe clad armor good
 brandishing broad cutting sword
 thus threatened death many idle word

 xxxii
 "o thou chance brings soil
 fair armida doth sceptre guide
 thou canst fly arms thyself despoil
 let thy hands iron chains tied
 enter rest thee thy weary toil
 within dungeon shalt thou safe abide
 never hope see day
 thy hair age shall turn gray

 xxxiii
 "except thou swear valiant knights aid
 traitors christian crew"
 tancred discourse little stayed

 rambaldo false maid
 forsook country religion true

 xxxiv
 warrior answered blushing red shame
 "cursed apostate ungracious wight

 wander hither thou art dead
 naught help thy courage strength skill
 godfrey send thy cursed head

 xxxvi

 wicked steel seized deep right side

 great loudly rung sounding steel
 yet pierced helmet blow

 prince whose looks disdainful anger show
 meant use puissance every deal
 shaked head crashed teeth ire

 xliv

 swift flight hope life reposed
 fast lord tancredi sped
 equal pace almost closed
 burning lamps extinguished
 shining fort goodly splendor losed

 lxxix
 thus prayed county prayers dear

 aged dragon bloody fight
 dreadful thunders forged new
 storms plagues poor sinners light
 massy trident mayest thou pendant view
 golden pin hung height
 wherewith sometimes smites solid land

 lxxxii
 among blessed weapons stands
 upon diamond shield looks bended
 great might cover lands
 twixt caucasus atlas hills extended
 lord's dear flocks faithful bands
 holy kings cities defended
 sacred angel took target sheen

 lxxxiii

 king clorinda sent brave rout

 godfrey likewise christian bands sent
 armed ranked good array stood still
 champions empty let remain
 twixt either troop large spacious plain

 lxxxiv
 argantes looked tancredi bold
 saw uncouth foe last appear
 raymond rode asked told
 better chance "tancred elsewhere
 yet glory behold
 come prepared bid thee battle
 place fight
 lo scorn thy heathenish might"

 lxxxv
 pagan cast scornful smile said
 "but tancred still bed
 looks late seemed make high heaven afraid
 dread dead fled
 whe'er earth's centre deep sea made
 lurking hole save head"
 "thou liest" says "to say brave knight
 fled thee thee exceeds might"

 lxxxvi
 angry pagan said "i spilt

 maintain thy foolish words brave lie"
 thus parleyed meet equal tilt

 bit lips rage cursed swore
 foe returned swift wind
 half mad arms second match find

 lxxxviii
 like ram butts horned head
 spurred forth horse desperate race
 raymond right hand let slide steed
 passed struck pagan's face
 turned earl nothing dread
 yet stept aside rage gave place
 helm strength gan smite
 hard courtlax could bite

 lxxxix
 saracen employed art force
 grip foe within mighty arms
 avoided nimbly horse
 prentice fierce alarms
 made many winding course
 strength sleight subtle warrior harms
 nimble steed obeyed ready hand
 stept print left sand

 trieth ways wiles thousandfold

 fared county pagan bold
 head breast none ill
 weaker parts wisely gan assail
 entrance searched oft 'twixt mail mail

 xci
 last hit place twain
 arms red blood trickled
 yet untouched remain
 nail broke plume cut crown
 argantes raging spent strength vain
 waste strokes thrusts idle thrown
 yet pressed doubled still blows
 hits neither cares knows

 xcii
 among thousand blows saracine
 last struck one raymond near
 swiftness aquiline
 could dear lord huge danger bear
 lo hand unseen help divine
 saves worldly comforts none appear
 angel targe received stroke
 shield argantes' sword broke

 xciii
 sword broke therein wonder lies
 earthly tempered metal could hold
 target forged skies
 fell blade pieces mould
 proud circassian scant believed eyes
 though naught left hilts gold
 full thoughts amazed awhile stood
 wondering christian's armor good

 xciv
 brittle web rich sword thought
 broke hardness county's shield
 thought raymond discovered naught
 succor heaven safety yield
 saw man gainst fought
 unweaponed still stood field
 noble heart esteemed glory light
 advantage slew knight

 xcv
 "go fetch" would said "another blade"
 heart better thought arose
 christ's glory champion made
 godfrey combat chose
 army's honor shoulder laid
 hazards new list expose
 thus thoughts debated case
 hilts argantes hurled face

 xcvi
 forward spurred mounture fierce withal
 within arms longing foe strain
 upon whose helm heavy blow fall
 bent wellnigh metal brain
 whose courage heroical
 leapt makes pagan's onset vain
 wounds hand outstretched saw
 fiercer eagles' talon lions' paw

 xcvii
 every side rode
 nimble speed spurred
 went came still laid load
 lord argantes' arms weak thin
 huge force arms abode
 wrath ire great desire win
 foe together bent
 heaven fortune furthered intent

 xcviii
 whose courage peril fails
 well armed better hearted scorns power
 like tall ship spent sails
 still resists rage storm shower
 whose mighty ribs fast bound bands nails
 withstand fierce neptune's wrath many hour
 yields bruised keel winds
 whose stern blast ruth grace finds

 xcix
 argantes thy present danger
 satan stirred aid thee thy need
 human shape forged airy mass
 made shade body seem indeed
 well might spirit clorinda pass
 like armor weed
 stature beauty countenance face
 looks speech gesture pace

 c
 spirit seem indeed
 whose show shape
 toward wall rode feigned speed
 stood people dismayed sad
 see knight help great need
 yet law arms help forbad
 turret sat soldier stout
 watch loophole peeped

 ci
 spirit spake called oradine
 noblest archer handled bow
 "o oradine" quoth "who straight line
 can'st shoot hit mark set high low
 yonder knight alas slain fine
 likest great ruth know
 greater shame victorious foe
 spoils triumphant homeward go

 cii
 "now prove thy skill thine arrow's sharp head dip
 yonder thievish frenchman's guilty blood
 promise thee thy sovereign shall slip
 give thee large rewards good"
 thus said spirit man laugh skip
 hope future gain longer stood
 quiver huge shaft hent
 set mighty bow new bent

 ciii
 twanged string flew quarrel long
 subtle air singing pass
 hit knight buckles rich among
 wherewith precious girdle fastened
 bruised pierced hauberk strong
 little blood trickled grass
 light wound angel unseen
 sharp head blunted weapon keen

 civ
 raymond drew forth shaft much behoved
 steel blood streaming came
 bitter words foe reproved
 breaking faith eternal shame
 godfrey whose careful eyes beloved
 never turned saw marked
 viewed wounded county bleed
 sighed feared perchance need

 cv
 words threatening eyes
 stirred captains revenge wrong
 forthwith spurred courser forward hies
 within rests put lances long
 either side squadron brave flies
 boldly made fierce encounter strong
 raised dust overspread begun
 shining arms far shining sun

 cvi
 breaking spears ringing helm shield
 dreadful rumor roared every side
 lay horse another field
 ran masterless dismounted guide
 one lay dead another yield
 sighed sobbed prayed cried
 fierce fight longer still lasted
 fiercer fewer still wasted

 cvii
 argantes nimbly leapt amid throng
 soldier wrung iron mace
 breaking ranks ranges long
 therewith passage made place
 raymond sought thickest press among
 take revenge late received disgrace
 greedy wolf seemed would assuage
 raymond's blood hunger rage

 cviii
 way found easy would
 fierce encounters put oft pain
 met ormanno rogero bold
 balnavile guy gerrards twain
 yet nothing might rage haste withhold
 worthies strove stop vain
 strong lets increased still ire
 like rivers stopped closely smouldered fire

 cix
 slew ormanno wounded guy laid
 rogero low among people slain
 every side new troops man invade
 yet blows waste onsets vain
 argantes thus prizes played
 seemed alone skirmish sustain
 duke brother called thus spake
 "go thy troop fight thy saviour's sake

 cx
 "there enter hottest fight
 thy force left wing strongly bend"
 said brave onset gave knight
 many paynim bold made end
 turks weak seemed sustain might
 could power lives defend
 ensigns rent broke array
 men horse heaps together lay

 cxi
 o'erthrown likewise away right wing ran
 one turned face
 save bold argantes else fled every man
 fear drove thence heaps headlong chase
 stayed alone battle new began
 five hundred men weaponed sword mace
 great resistance never could made
 argantes single blade

 cxii
 strokes swords thrusts many spear
 shock many joust long sustained
 seemed strength enough charge bear
 time strike gained
 armors broke members bruised
 sweat bled yet courage still feigned
 foes upon pressed fast
 weight bore back last

 cxiii
 back storm length turned
 whose headlong fury bore backward still
 like one fled one mourned
 foes greater ill
 threatening eyes like flaming torches burned
 courage thirsted yet blood spill
 every way every mean sought
 stay flying mates naught

 cxiv
 good thus played part
 bands troops ease safe retired
 yet coward dread lacks order fear wants art
 deaf attend commanded desired
 godfrey perceived wise heart
 bold knights victory aspired
 fresh soldiers sent make quick pursuit
 help gather conquest's precious fruit

 cxv
 alas appointed day
 set heaven end mortal war
 western lords time borne away
 prize travelled far
 devils saw sure decay
 false kingdom bloody war
 made heaven earth darkness blind
 stirred tempests storms blustering wind

 cxvi
 heaven's glorious lamp wrapped ugly veil
 shadows dark hid mortal eye
 hell's grim blackness bright skies assail
 every side fiery lightnings fly
 thunders roar streaming rain hail
 pour make sea erst dry
 tempests rend oaks cedars brake
 make trees rocks mountains shake

 cxvii
 rain lightning raging wind
 beat frenchmen's eyes hideous force
 soldiers stayed amazed heart mind
 terror stopped man horse
 surprised evil way find
 whither succor direct course
 wise clorinda soon advantage spied
 spurring forth thus soldiers cried

 cxviii
 "you hardy men arms behold" quoth
 "how heaven justice aid doth fight
 visages tempest free
 hands may wield weapons bright
 fury friendly storm see
 upon foreheads foes doth light
 blinds eyes let us take tide
 come follow good fortune guide"

 cxix
 said foes rode dame
 turned backs wind rain
 upon french furious rage came
 scorned idle blows struck vain
 argantes instant
 chased chased
 naught fearful back christian shows
 tempest blows

 cxx
 cruel hail deadly wounding blade
 upon shoulders smote fled
 blood new spilt thus slaughter made
 water fallen skies dyed red
 among murdered bodies pyrrhus laid
 valiant raiphe heart blood bled
 first subdued strong argantes' might
 second conquered virgin knight

 cxxi
 thus fled french pursued chase
 wicked sprites syrian train
 gainst force gainst fell menace
 hail wind tempest rain
 godfrey alone turned audacious face
 blaming barons fear vain
 camp gate boldly stood keep
 saved men within trenches deep

 cxxii
 twice upon argantes proud flew
 beat backward maugre might
 twice thirsty sword imbrue
 pagan's blood thickest fight
 last folk withdrew
 day's conquest gave virgin bright
 got home retired men
 thus chased lion den

 cxxiii
 yet ceased fury ire
 huge storms wind rain hail
 dark shone lightning fire
 wind water every place assail
 bank safe rampire left entire
 tent could stand beam cordage fail
 wind thunder rain gave dreadful sound
 music deafed trembling ground

 said discords strifes advised
 "great solyman day light hath lost
 christians shall assail sudden war

 xvi

 night half consumed spent
 headlong western hill goes
 distant scant mile godfrey's tent

 deeply sighed naked sword
 coach leaped mire
 ismen called angry lord
 grave words appeased foolish ire
 prince content remounted sword
 toward hill drove aged sire
 hasting forward bank pass
 till far behind christian leaguer

 xxviii
 alight took way foot
 empty chariot vanished sight
 yet still cloud environed
 left hand went height
 sion's hill till approached route
 side west looketh right
 ismen stayed eyesight bent
 upon bushy rocks thither went

 xxix
 hollow cave craggy stone
 wrought hand number years tofore
 long way walked none
 vault hid plants bushes hoar
 wizard stooping thereat gone
 thorns aside scratching brambles bore
 right hand sought passage cleft
 guide gave prince left

 xxx
 "what" quoth soldan "by privy mine
 hidden vault behoves creep
 sword find better way thine
 although foes passage guard keep"
 "let not" quoth "thy princely foot repine
 tread secret path though dark deep
 great king herod used tread
 arms whilom great fame

 xxxi
 "this passage made would suppress
 subjects' pride bondage hold
 could small forteress
 antonia called antony bold
 convey folk unseen less
 even middest temple old
 thence hither privy ways begin
 bring unseen whole armies

 xxxii
 "but saye world lives none
 knows secret darksome place
 come aladine sits throne
 lords princes set grace
 feareth fitteth one
 signs doubt show cheer face
 fitly come hear see keep still
 till time season serve speak fill"

 xxxiii
 said narrow entrance passed knight
 creeps camel needle's eye
 ways black darkest night
 followed rule guie
 strait way first withouten light

 upright walked ease men
 ere passed half secret den

 xxxiv
 privy door ismen unlocked last
 clomb littleused stair
 thereat day feeble beam cast
 dim light nothing clear air
 hollow cave length passed
 goodly hall high broad fair
 crowned gold purple clad
 sate sad king among nobles sad

 xxxv
 turk close hollow cloud imbarred
 unseen prease behold
 heavy speeches king heard
 thus lofty siege pleasure told
 "my lords last day state much impaired
 friends slain killed soldiers bold
 great helps greater hopes us bereft
 aught aid egypt land left

 xxxvi
 "and well see far distant aid
 upon heels danger treadeth still
 advice assembly made
 thinketh speak will"
 whisper soft arose said
 gentle winds groves murmur fill
 bold face high looks merry cheer
 argantes rose rest talk forbear

 xxxvii
 "o worthy sovereign" thus began say
 hardy young man tyrant wise
 "what words fears dismay
 knows need advice
 hand hope conquest lay
 loss true virtue damnifies
 make shield pray us succors give
 without let us wish live

 xxxviii
 "nor say aught misdeem
 egypt's promised succors fail us might
 doubtful great master's words seem
 neither lawful right
 speak words spurs esteem
 waken dull fearful sprite
 make hearts resolved assays
 win honor die praise"

 xxxix
 thus much argantes said said
 case clear spoke
 orcano rose princely stem ybore

 coupled new marriage yoke
 young babes fight made loth

 "my lord" quoth "i reprehend

 though good circassian friend

 xli
 "but beseem graver age
 long experience hath made wise sly

 somewhat misled knight awry
 equal balance ponder gauge

 xlii
 "but may say think unblamed

 xliii
 "for store cattle grain

 proud foes triumphant plain
 naught shedding blood conquest thought

 xliv
 "but appointed day miss

 oh save town ruin us shame
 godfrey still warfare

 xlv
 "and thou argantes wotest

 xlvii
 "the king tripoli well advised

 solyman godfrey's love despised
 either dead deep prison thrown

 xlviii
 thus spake orcanes inkling gave
 doubtful words would said
 sue peace yield slave
 durst openly king persuade
 words soldan gan rave
 gainst wrapt cloud stayed
 ismen thus bespake "how bear
 words lord reproaches hear"

 xlix
 "oh let speak" quoth "with ire scorn
 burn gains thus hid stay"
 said smoky cloud cleft torn
 like veil upon stretched lay
 open heaven forthwith borne
 left prince view lightsome day
 princely look amid press shined
 sudden thus declared mind

 l
 "of speak behold soldan
 neither afraid run away dread
 slanders lies fables
 hand shall prove upon coward's head
 shed sea blood well near
 heaped mountains high christians dead
 camp still maintained fray

 "if coward vile beside
 false faith country dares reply
 speak concord yon men pride
 good leave sir king shall die
 lambs wolves shall one fold abide
 doves serpents one nest shall lie
 one town us christians shall
 peace love unite within one wall"

 lii
 thus spoke broad trenchant sword
 hand held high aloft threatening guise
 dumb stood knights dreadful word
 storm front fire eyes
 turned last sion's aged lord
 calmed visage stern humbler wise
 "behold" quoth "good prince aid bring
 since solyman joined juda's king"

 liii
 king aladine rich throne upstart
 said "oh joy thy face view

 dear embracements long enfold

 liv

 among rose ormusses' valiant knight

 lvi
 surly countenance disdainful grace
 sullen sad sat circassian stout
 like fierce lion grumbling place
 fiery eyes turns rolls
 durst orcanes view soldan's face

 thus lords peers counselling
 turkish monarch sat juda's king

 lvii
 godfrey gave victory rein

 heathen enclosed doth threat

 lviii
 noble squadron known

 lix
 thus said "some one declare

 blush ground amazed stare

 last english prince countenance bold

 lx
 "we elect exploit lot
 secret flight hence withdrew
 following false cupid deny
 enticed forth love beauty's hue

 lxi
 "at last gan approach woful clime

 lxiv

 lxv
 "she sweet words false enticing smiles
 infused love among dainties set
 empoisoned cups souls beguiles

 lxvi
 "she read change felt thought

 lxvii
 "the rest like shape like garments wore

 full sweetly cabins slept

 "alas idle prise expect

 xxiv
 "when camp battle strong shall

 till builded new dreadful tower
 reared high downfallen rams
 workmen therefore despatched hour
 hew trees forest main
 went scant wood appeared sight
 wonders new fearful hearts affright

 xviii
 silly children dare bend eye
 told strange bugbears haunt place
 new monsters bed lie
 fearful thoughts present face
 feared fled yet wist
 pursued fearful chase
 except fear perchance thus fled
 new chimeras sphinxes like monsters bred

 xix
 swift camp turned back dismayed
 words confused uncertain tales told
 heard scorned said
 reports lies fables hold
 chosen crew shining arms arrayed
 duke godfrey thither sent soldiers bold
 guard men faint arms provoke
 cut dreadful trees hardy stroke

 xx
 drawing near wood close ypent
 wicked sprites sylvan pinfolds
 eyes upon shades sooner bent
 frozen dread pierced entrails dear
 yet stalked still went
 bold semblance hiding coward fear
 far wandered forth trembling pace
 till approached nigh enchanted place

 xxi
 grove fearful sound outbreaks
 earthquake hill mountain tore
 wherein southern wind rumbling makes
 like sea waves scraggy shore
 lions grumble hiss scaly snakes
 howl wolves rugged bears roar
 trumpets shrill heard thunders fell
 sounds one sound expressed well

 xxii
 upon faces pale well might note
 thousand signs heartamating fear
 reason gone device wot
 press nigh stay still
 sudden dread breasts smote
 courage weak shield proof could bear
 last fled one bold
 excused flight thus wonders told

 xxiii
 "my lord one us grant
 dares cut one branch yonder spring
 think dwells sprite every plant
 keeps court great dis infernal king
 hath heart hardened adamant
 without trembling dares attempt thing
 sense wanteth hardy
 hear forest thunder roar hiss"

 xxiv
 said alcasto words gave heed
 alcasto leader switzers grim
 man void wit void dreed
 feared loss life loss limb
 savage beasts deserts wild feed
 ugly monster could dishearten
 whirlwind thunder earthquake storm aught
 world strange fearful thought

 xxv
 shook head smiling thus gan say
 "the hardiness wood fell
 proud trees low dust lay
 wherein grisly fiends monsters dwell
 roaring ghost courage dismay
 shriek birds beast's roar dragon's yell
 forest wend
 although deepest hell paths descend"

 xxvi
 thus boasted leave go desired
 forward went joyful cheer
 viewed wood thick shades admired
 heard wondrous noise rumbling shrill
 yet one foot audacious man retired
 scorned peril pressing forward still
 till forest's outmost marge stepped
 flaming fire entrance kept

 xxvii
 fire increased built stately wall
 burning coals quick sparks embers hot
 bright flames wood environed
 tree twist alcasto got
 higher stretched flames seemed bulwarks tall
 castles turrets full fiery shot
 slings engines strong every sort
 mortal wight durst scale strange fort

 xxviii
 oh strange monsters battlement
 loathsome forms stood defend place
 frowning looks upon knight bent
 threatened death shot sword mace
 last fled though slow went
 lions jolly hunters chase
 yet fled man sad fear withdrew
 though fear till never felt knew

 xxix
 fled long time never wist
 far run discoverd
 wonder hand blist
 bitter sorrow heart bit
 amazed ashamed disgraced sad silent trist
 alone would day darkness sit
 durst look man worth fame
 pride late great greater made shame

 xxx
 godfredo called found delays
 causes cabin keep
 length perforce comes naught says
 talks like babble sleep
 shamefacedness godfrey plain bewrays
 flight sighs sadness deep
 whereat amazed "what chance this" quoth
 "these witchcrafts strange nature's wonders

 xxxi
 "but courage champion move
 try hazard dreadful spring
 give leave adventure great prove
 news may report us thing"
 said lords attempt charmed grove
 yet nothing back fear flight bring
 inforced trembling retire
 sight sound monsters fire

 xxxii

 nathless need high attempts led
 labor would shun danger fear

 fearless yet heedful silent well advised
 terrors forest's dreadful sight
 storms earthquakes thunders cries despised
 feared nothing yet motion light
 quickly vanished heart arised
 lo charmed wood
 fiery city high heaven stood

 xxxiv
 knight stepped back took sudden pause
 "what help arms" quoth
 "if fire monster's gaping jaws
 headlong cast boots
 common profit country's cause

 xxxv
 fly pagans say

 fire oh wondrous boldness leapt

 xxxvi
 bolted neither warmth heat
 felt sign fire scorching flame
 yet wist dismayed conceit
 fire came
 first touch vanished monsters great
 stead clouds black night frame
 hideous storms showers hail rain
 yet storms tempests vanished straight

 xxxvii
 amazed afraid champion good
 stood still tempest passed spied
 entered boldly forbidden wood
 forest secrets eyed
 walk sprite phantasm stood
 stopped way passage free denied
 save growing trees thick set
 oft sight passage oft let

 xxxviii
 length fair spacious green spied
 like calmest waters plain like velvet soft
 wherein cypress clad summer's pride
 pyramidwise lift tops aloft
 whose smooth bark upon evenest side
 strange characters found viewed oft
 like priests egypt erst instead
 letters used none could read

 xxxix
 mongst picked words last
 writ syriac tongue well could
 "oh hardy knight woods hast passed
 death palace court doth hold
 oh trouble souls quiet placed
 oh cruel thy heart bold
 pardon ghosts deprived heavenly light
 spirits dead men living fight"

 xl
 found graven tender rind
 mused uncouth writ
 thought heard softly whistling wind
 blasts amid leaves branches knit
 frame sound like speech human kind
 full sorrow grief woe
 whereby gentle thoughts filled
 pity sadness grief compassion fear

 xli
 drew sword last gave tree
 mighty blow made gaping wound
 rift red streams trickling see
 bebled verdant plain around
 hair start yet stroke
 nould give till end found
 adventure plaint moan
 hollow grave heard one groan

 xlii
 "enough enough" voice lamenting said
 "tancred thou hast hurt thou didst drive
 body noble maid
 lived late kept live
 within woful cypress laid
 tender rind thy weapon sharp doth rive
 cruel is't enough thy foes kill
 graves wilt thou torment still

 xliii
 "i clorinda imprisoned

 every pagan lord christian peer
 city's walls last day fell
 bodies new graves wot clear
 confined magic's spell

 murderer thou cut one twist art thou"

 xliv
 sick man sleep doth see
 ugly dragon chimera new
 though suspect half persuaded
 idle dream monster true
 yet still fears quakes strives flee
 fearful wondrous form view
 feared knight yet knew thought
 illusions false witchcraft wrought

 xlv
 cold trembling waxed frozen heart
 strange effects passions torment
 feeble hand weapon start
 wits nigh went
 wounded saw thought pain smart
 lady weep complain mourn lament
 could suffer dear blood see
 hear sighs deep far fetched

 xlvi
 thus fierce heart death scorned oft
 strange shape monster could dismay
 feigned shows tender love made soft
 spirit false vain plaints betray
 whirling wind sword heaved aloft
 forest bare quite away
 o'ercome retired prince came
 sword found repossessed

 xlvii
 yet nould return mind try
 courage forests green
 godfrey's tent proached nigh
 spirits waked thoughts composed
 "my lord" quoth "a witness true
 wonders strange believe scant though seen
 fire shades dreadful sound
 heard true proof found

 xlviii
 "a burning fire deserts charmed
 built like battled wall heaven reared
 whereon darts dreadful weapons armed
 monsters foul misshaped whole bands appeared
 passed unhurt unharmed
 flame threatened blow felt feared
 rain night found straight
 day night sunshine turned rain

 xlix
 "what would tree wood
 hath sense hath life hath speech like human kind
 heard words grove stood
 mournful voice still still bear mind
 flesh purple blood
 every blow streams wounded rind
 else trow
 hath power cut one leaf one branch one bough"
 l
 thus said christian's noble guide
 felt uncouth strife contentious thought
 thought perzon tried
 witchcrafts strange bring charms naught
 deemed elsewhere provide
 timber easier got though sought
 study last abraid
 called hermit old said

 li
 "leave thy hardy thought another's hands
 plants wood dispoilen shall
 fatal ship conquest lands
 sails struck silver anchors fall
 champion broken hath worthless bands
 looseth soil held thrall

 lii
 said visage shone beams divine
 mortal voice's sound

 working brain never idle found
 crab bright titan shine
 scorched scalding beams parched ground
 made unfit toil warlike feat
 soldiers weak labor faint sweat

 liii
 planets mild lamps benign quenched
 cruel stars heaven signorize

 hot impressions earth skies
 growing heat still gathered deeper rout
 noisome warmth lands kingdoms flies
 harmful night hurtful day succeeds

 phoebus rose left golden weed

 sanguine beams forehead spread
 sad presage ill betide

 thus bent gainst earth scorching rays
 burnt flowers burnt clytie dear
 leaves grew wan upon withered sprays

 earth cleft rifts floods streams decays
 barren clouds lightning bright appear
 mankind feared lest climenes' child

 neither marching far tedious way
 weighty arms shoulders hung

 fourteenth book

 argument
 lord godfrey dream doth show
 rinaldo must return last
 asking pardon sue
 two knights find prince sent haste
 peter vision foreknew
 sendeth searchers wizard placed
 deep vault first large declares
 armida's trains shun snares


 fresh soft tender bed
 still mother gentle night flew
 fleeting balm hills dales shed
 honey drops pure precious dew
 verdure green forests spread
 virgin primrose violet blue
 sweetbreathed zephyr spreading wings
 sleep ease repose rest peace quiet brings

 ii
 thoughts troubles broadwaking day
 softly dipped mild oblivion's lake
 whose godhead heaven earth doth sway
 eternal light watch wake
 bent godfrey gracious ray
 bright eye still ope godfrey's sake
 silent dream lord sent
 told pleasure intent

 iii
 far east golden gate beside
 whence phoebus comes crystal port
 ere sun broad doors open wide
 beam springing day uncloseth
 hence comes dreams heaven's sacred guide
 reveals man high degrees
 hence toward godfrey ere left bed
 vision strange golden plumes bespread

 iv
 semblances shapes portraits fair
 never yet dream sleep appear
 forms sea earth air
 signs heaven stars every sphere
 wondrous uncouth strange rare
 vision well presented
 dream placed crystal wide
 beset golden fires top bottom side

 v
 wondereth circles vast
 stars motions course harmony
 knight shining rays fire embraced
 presents unwares eye
 voice far sweetness passed
 human speech thus said approaching nigh
 "what godfrey knowest thou thy hugo
 come embrace thy friend fellow dear"

 vi
 answered "thy glorious shining light
 thine eyes glistering beams doth place
 estranged hath foreknowledge quite
 thy countenance thy favor thy face"
 said three times stretched hands outright
 would friendly arms knight embrace
 thrice spirit fled thrice twined
 naught folded arms air wind

 vii
 lord hugo smiled "not think" quoth
 "i clothed flesh earthly mould
 spirit pure naked soul see
 citizen celestial hold
 place heaven room thee
 prepared among christ's champions bold"
 "ah when" quoth "these mortal bonds unknit
 shall peace ease rest sit"

 viii
 hugo replied "ere many years shall run
 amid saints bliss shalt thou reign
 first great wars must thy hand done
 much blood shed many pagans slain
 holy city assault
 land set free servile yoke
 wherein thou shalt christian empire frame
 thee shall baldwin rule

 ix
 "but increase thy love great desire
 heavenward blessed place behold
 shining lamps globes living fire
 turned guided moved rolled
 angels' singing hear choir
 bend thine eyes yonder earth mould
 mass globe compass see
 land sea spring fountain man beast grass tree

 x
 "how vile small slender price
 reward goodness virtue's gain
 narrow room glory vain upties
 little circle doth pride contain
 earth like isle amid water lies
 sea sometime called sometime main
 yet naught therein responds name great
 lake pond marish strait"

 xi
 thus said one bended
 looks ground half scorn smiled
 saw earth sea flood castle town
 strangely divided strangely compiled
 wondered folly man far drown
 set heart things base vild
 servile empire searcheth dumb fame
 scorns heaven's bliss yet proffereth heaven

 xii
 wherefore answered "since lord yet
 free spirit cage clay
 lest worldly error vain voyage let
 teach heaven best surest way"
 hugo replied "thy happy foot set
 true path passage stray
 exile young rinaldo call
 give thee charge else naught

 xiii
 "for lord hosts king bliss
 hath chosen thee rule faithful band
 thy stratagems appointed
 execute shall win land
 first thine second place
 thou art army's head hand
 champion place supply
 thou doth thy state deny

 xiv
 "the enchanted forest charmed treen
 cutting steel shall earth hew
 thy weak armies feeble
 scale walls reinforced new
 fainting lie dispersed green
 shall take new strength new courage view
 highbuilt towers eastern squadrons
 shall conquered shall fly shall die shall fall"

 xv
 held peace godfrey answered
 "oh presence would recomfort
 man's hidden thoughts perceive know
 say truth love see
 say messengers shall go
 shall speeches errand
 shall entreat else command man
 credit neither well perform can"

 xvi
 "the eternal lord" knight replied
 "that many graces hath thee blest
 among troops thou hast guide
 thou honored feared least
 speak thou lest blemish betide
 thy sacred empire thou make request
 suit thou moved art ruth
 yield forgive home recall youth

 xvii
 "guelpho shall pray thee god shall inspire
 pardon offence fault commit
 hasty wrath rash headstrong ire
 call knight yield thou
 though youth enwrapped fond desire
 far hence love looseness idle sit
 year fear shall return speed

 xviii
 "your hermit peter whose sapient heart
 high heaven secrets opens tells shews
 messengers direct part
 prince shall hear certain news
 learn way manner art
 bring back thy warlike crews
 thy soldiers wandered misgone
 heaven may unite join one

 xix
 "but conclusion shall speeches end
 know blood shall mixed thine
 whence barons bold worthies shall descend
 many great exploits shall bring fine"
 said vanished sleeping friend
 like smoke wind mist titan's shine
 sleep fled likewise troubled thought
 wonder pleasure joy marvel fought

 heaven infused new sudden thought
 pleasing words thus duke addressed
 "good prince mild though unasked kind unbesought
 oh let thy mercy grant request
 pardon fault rage malice wrought
 great offence grant late commit
 suit hasty perchance unfit

 xxii
 since godfrey meek benign kind
 prince rinaldo bold humbly sue
 suitor's self behind
 thy greatest friends state friendship true
 trust shall thy grace mercy find
 acceptable crew
 oh call home trespass amend
 shall blood godfrey's service spend

 xxiii
 "and else dares undertake
 enchanted wood cut one tree
 gainst death danger dares battle make
 bold face fearless heart
 beat walls gates pieces break
 leap o'er rampires high thou shalt see
 restore therefore desirous band
 wish hope strength shield hand

 xxiv
 "to nephew thyself restore
 trusty help strength hand thou needs
 idleness let consume
 recall noble acts deeds
 known worth strength yore
 wher'er thy standard broad cross outspreads
 oh let fame praise spread far wide

 xxv
 thus entreated rest approve
 words friendly murmurs whispered low
 godfrey though suit mind move
 whereon never thought tell
 "how heart" quoth "if love
 request suit bend bow
 let rigor go right justice
 wherein consent agree

 xxvi
 "rinaldo shall return let restrain
 henceforth headstrong wrath hasty ire
 hardy deeds let take pain
 correspond hope desire
 guelpho thou must call home knight
 see speed tents retire

 "that aged wood whence heretofore got
 build scaling engines timber fit
 fearful seat none wot
 ugly fiends damned spirits sit
 cut one twist thereof adventureth
 boldest knight without
 wall battered others doubt
 venture thou show thy courage stout"

 iv
 thus said knight speeches
 proffered service attempt thing
 hard assays courage willing flew
 praise spur words sting
 dear friends embraced crew
 welcome came ring
 guelpho tancred rest
 stood camp greatest chief best

 v
 prince lords iterate
 welcomes oft oft dear embrace
 toward rest lesser worth state
 turned received gentle grace
 merry soldiers bout shout prate
 cries joyful cheerful face
 triumph's chariot bright sun

 vi
 thus marched tent champion good
 sat friends around
 war asked wood
 answered demand list propound
 left ease stood
 hermit fit time speak found
 "my lord" said "your travels wondrous
 far strayed erred wandered far

 vii
 "much bound god brought
 safe false armida's charmed hold
 thee straying sheep bought
 hath reduced fold
 gainst heathen foes men naught
 hath chosen thee place next godfrey bold
 yet mayest thou polluted thus sin
 high service war fight begin

 viii
 "the world flesh infection vile
 pollute thoughts impure thy spirit stain
 po ganges sevenmouthed nile
 wide seas wash thee clean
 purge faults thee defile
 blood hath power thy sins slain
 help therefore invoke bewray
 thy secret faults mourn weep complain pray"

 ix
 said knight first witch unchaste
 idle loves follies vain lamented
 kneeling low heavy looks downcast
 sins confessed repented
 meekly pardon craved first last
 hermit zeal well contented
 said "on yonder hill next morn go pray
 turns forehead gainst morning ray

 x
 "that done march wood whence one brings
 news furies goblins fiends sprites
 giants monsters dreadful things
 thou shalt subdue dark grove unites
 let strange voice mourns sweetly sings
 beauty whose glad smile frail hearts delights
 within thy breast make ruth pity rise
 false looks prayers false despise"

 xi
 thus advised hardy knight
 prepared gladly enterprise
 thoughtful passed day sad night
 ere silver morn began rise
 arms took coat dight
 color strange cut warlike guise
 way sole silent forth went
 alone left friends left tent

 xii
 time gainst breaking day
 rebellious night yet strove still repined
 east appeared morning gray
 yet lamps jove's high palace shined
 mount olivet took way
 saw round eyes twined
 night's shadows hence thence morning's shine
 bright dark earthly divine

 xiii
 thus thought many bright
 splendent lamps shine heaven's temple high
 day hath golden sun moon night
 fixed wandering stars azure sky
 framed creator's might
 still live shine ne'er shall die
 till moment last day's brand
 burn burn sea air land

 xiv
 thus mused top went
 kneeled reverence fear
 eyes upon heaven's eastern face bent
 thoughts heavens uplifted
 "the sins errors repent
 mine unbridled youth father dear
 remember let thy mercy fall
 purge faults mine offences all"

 xv
 thus prayed purple wings upflew
 golden weed morning's lusty queen
 begilding radiant beams threw
 helm harness mountain green
 upon breast forehead gently blew
 air balm nardus breathed unseen
 o'er head let clearest skies
 cloud pure precious clew flies

 xvi
 heavenly dew garments spread
 compared clothes pale ashes seem
 sprinkled paleness fled
 thence purest white bright rays outstream
 cheered flowers late withered
 sweet comfort morning beam
 returned youth serpent old
 adorns new native gold

 xvii
 lovely whiteness changed weed
 prince perceived well long admired
 toward forest marched speed
 resolved adventures great required
 thither came whence shrinking back dread
 strange desert's sight first retired
 fearful loathsome made
 forest sweet pleasant shade

 xviii
 forward passed mid grove
 heard sound strange sweet pleasing
 rolled crystal brook gentle roar
 sighed winds leaves pass
 nightingale wrongs deplore
 sung swan singing died alas
 lute harp cittern human voice heard
 sounds one sound right well declared

 xix
 dreadful thunderclap last heard
 aged trees plants wellnigh rent
 yet heard nymphs sirens afterward
 birds winds waters sing sweet consent
 whereat amazed stayed well prepared
 defence heedful slow forth went
 way passage aught withstood
 except quiet still transparent flood

 xx
 green banks fair stream inbound
 flowers odors sweetly smiled smelled
 reaching stretched arms around
 large desert bosom held
 grove one channel passage found
 wood forest dwelled
 trees clad streams streams green trees aye made
 exchanged moisture shade

 xxi
 knight way sought flood pass
 sought wondrous bridge appeared
 bridge gold huge weighty mass
 arches great rich metal reared
 golden way entered
 fell bridge swelled stream weared
 work away sign left stood
 river calm became flood

 xxii
 turned amazed see troubled
 like sudden brooks increased molten snow
 billows fierce tossed fro
 whirlpools sucked bosoms low
 went search wonders mo
 thick trees high broad grow
 forest huge desert wide
 sought wonders still spied

 xxiii
 whereso stepped seemed joyful ground
 renewed verdure flowery weed
 fountain wellspring found
 bud roses lilies spread
 aged wood o'er round
 flourished blossoms new new leaves new seed
 boughs branches treen
 bark softened renewed green

 xxiv
 manna leaf pearled lie
 honey stilled tender rind
 heard wondrous harmony
 songs sweet complaints lovers kind
 human voices sung triple high
 respond birds streams wind
 yet unseen nymphs singers
 unseen lutes harps viols bear

 xxv
 looked listened yet thoughts denied
 think true heard see
 myrtle ample plain spied
 thither beaten path went
 myrtle spread mighty branches wide
 higher pine palm cypress tree
 far plants seen
 forest's lady desert's queen

 xxvi
 upon trees eyes rinaldo bent
 marvel great strange began
 aged oak beside cleft rent
 fertile hollow womb forth ran
 clad rare weeds strange habiliment
 nymph age able go man
 hundred plants beside even sight
 childed hundred nymphs great dight

 xxvii
 stages play see
 dryads painted wild satyrs love
 whose arms halfnaked locks untrussed
 buskins laced legs
 silken robes tucked short knee
 seemed sylvan daughters grove

 xxviii
 wantonly cast ring

 rinaldo round environing

 tree compassed eke gan sing
 woods streams admired excellence
 "welcome dear lord welcome sweet grove
 welcome lady's hope welcome love

 xxix
 "thou com'st cure princess faint sick
 love love thee faint sick distressed
 late black late dreadful forest thick
 fit dwelling sad folk grief oppressed
 see thy coming branches quick
 revived new blosoms dressed"
 song went
 first sweet sound myrtle rent

 xxx
 antique times admired silenus old
 oft appeared set lazy ass
 would wonder behold

 xxxi
 sad smiling look cast
 twenty passions strange bewrays
 "and art thou come" quoth "returned last

 com'st thou comfort sorrows past
 ease widow nights careful days
 comest thou work grief harm

 xxxii
 "com'st thou friend foe frame
 golden bridge entertain foe
 opened flowers fountains came
 welcome joy brings woe
 put thy helm rejoice flame
 thy bright eyes whence first fires grow
 kiss embrace venture
 love keeps gate fort eath enter"

 xxxiii
 thus woos rolls rueful eyes
 piteous look changeth oft cheer
 hundred sighs false heart upflies
 sobs mourns great ruth hear
 hardest breast sweet pity mollifies
 stony heart resists woman's tear
 yet knight wise wary unkind
 drew forth sword careless twined

 xxxiv
 toward tree marched thither start
 stepped embraced plant cried
 "ah never spiteful part
 cut tree forest's joy pride
 put thy sword else pierce therewith heart
 thy forsaken despised armide
 breast heart unkind
 fair tree thy sword shall passage find"

 xxxv
 lift brand cared though oft prayed
 form shape change
 monsters huge men dreams laid
 oft idle fancies roam range
 body swelled face obscure made
 vanished garments face vestures strange
 giantess high stands
 like briareus armed hundred hands

 xxxvi
 fifty swords fifty targets bright
 threatened death roared cried fought
 nymph armor likewise dight
 cyclops great became feared naught
 myrtle smote might
 groaned like living souls death nigh brought
 sky seemed pluto's court air seemed hell
 therein monsters roar spirits yell

 xxxvii
 lightened heavens earth

 blustered tempests strong whirlwinds blow
 bitter storm drove hailstones look
 yet arm grew neither weak slow
 fury heed care took
 till low earth wounded tree bended

 xxxviii

 wood returned wonted state
 withcrafts free quite void spirits ill
 horror full horror innate
 proved aught withstood
 cut trees charms late
 finding naught stop smiled said
 "o shadows vain fools shades afraid"

 xxxix

 death fear care save lives
 forsaken walls pagans chase
 yet neither force fear wisdom drives
 constant knight argantes place

 lxiv
 "'these arms ormondo took noble fight
 godfrey proud spoiled asia's lands

 lxv

 lxxi
 "cheer thy looks" answered indian king
 "and sweet beauty's sake appease thy woe

 ciii

 saw whereas another champion laid
 dead land soiled blood mire
 "this christian knight" vafrino said
 marking well arms rich attire
 loosed helm saw visage plain
 cried "alas lies tancredi slain"

 civ
 woful virgin tarried gave heed
 fierce looks proud saracine
 till high cry full sad fear dread
 pierced heart sorrow grief pine
 tancred's name thither ran speed
 like one half mad drunk much wine
 saw face pale bloodless dead

 springs tears looseth forth cries
 "hither bring'st thou ah fortune blind
 dead lived comfort lies

 tancred thee see thee yet thine eyes
 looked upon thy love handmaid kind

 "i never thought mine eyes dear

 cvii
 "though gone though dead love thee still behold
 death wounds kills love yet thou live
 sweet soul still breast follies bold
 ah pardon love's desires stealths forgive
 grant pale mouth kisses cold
 since death doth love reward deprive
 thy spoils sad death afford
 let mouth pale cold bloodless kiss

 cviii
 "o gentle mouth speeches kind sweet
 thou didst relieve grief woe pain
 ere weak soul frail body fleet
 ah comfort one dear kiss twain
 perchance alive happed meet

 feeble life betwixt lips fly
 oh let kiss thee first let die

 cix
 "receive yielding spirit thine

 said sighed tore tresses fine
 eyes two streams poured face
 man revived showers divine
 awaked opened lips space
 lips open fast shut eyes

 dame perceived tancred breathed sighed
 calmed grief somedeal eased fears
 "unclose thine eyes" says "my lord knight
 see last services plaints tears
 see dies see thy woful plight

 cxi
 tancred looked closed eyes

 plucked armor vein

 cxii
 weariness loss blood spied
 greatest pains anguish proceed
 naught veil amid deserts wide

 love could bands though strange provide
 pity wept joy see deed

 cxiii
 veil short thin deep
 cruel hurts fasten roll blind
 salve simple yet keep

 said drove deadly sleep
 eyes lifted turned twined

 "you shall know all" says "your surgeon

 cxv
 vafrine devised might bear
 master home ere night obscured land
 lo troop soldiers appear
 descried tancredi's band
 argant met
 went combat hand hand
 bade stay behind obeyed

 cxvi
 besides many followed enquest
 alone found rightest way
 upon friendly arms men addressed
 seat whereon sat leaned lay
 quoth tancred "shall strong circassian rest
 broad field wolves crows prey
 ah defraud champion brave

 cxvii
 "with dead bones longer war

 death alonely doth remain"
 pagan dead lifted high
 tancred bore plain
 close virgin chaste vafrine ride

 "not home" quoth tancred "to wonted tent

 performed shall vow pilgrimage"

 cxix
 thus city tancredi borne

 cxxvi
 said young rinaldo's angry eyes

 duke vafrine talk applies
 "the greatest news lord yet behind

 cxxvii
 point point gan expose
 false compact made wrought

 ormondo's vaunt praise thank sought

 silence made awhile godfrey thus
 "raymondo say counsel givest thou us"

 cxxviii
 "not purposed late next morn" quoth
 "let us scale round besiege tower

 camp well rested refreshed see
 provided well gainst last storm shower
 pitched field fight

 cxxix
 "but lest endangered hurt slain

 else rule guide squadrons brave
 traitors shall noted plain

 cxxx
 "as hath ever" thus duke begun
 "thy counsel shows thy wisdom thy love

 strength manhood assay
 try open field open day

 cxxxi
 "the fame great conquests sustain
 bide looks threats able
 army subdued slain
 empire settled firm stable
 tower shall yield resist vain
 fear anchor despair cable"
 thus concludes rolling west
 fast set stars called rest

 pagan host arrives cruel fight

 sun called world idle sleep
 day ten hours gone past
 bold troop tower keep
 espied sudden mist overcast
 earth mirksome clouds darkness deep
 saw egyptian camp last

 iv
 till morning next refused fight
 haste heat bridled brake
 yet sudden fray skirmish light
 new foes would vain trial make
 "after many wars" says "good right
 one day's rest least take"
 thus vain foes cherish would
 hope strength hold

 v
 see aurora's gentle beam appear
 soldiers armed prest ready lay
 skies never half fair clear
 breaking blessed day
 merry morning smiled seemed wear
 upon silver crown sun's golden ray
 without cloud heaven redoubled light

 pagans would backs invade

 night's azure mantle oft doth run
 fall sliding star shining flame
 bosom burning sun

 godfredo's noble head encompassed round

 "there lie shame" says "disgraced o'erthrown
 blunt weapons blunt arms move
 weak revenge harms harm foe
 shafts blunt ah love would thine

 cxxiv
 alas among many could one
 one draw blood one wound rend skin
 breasts marble stone
 dare pierce woman's bosom thin
 see see naked heart alone
 employ force fort eath win
 love shoot mighty bow
 weak shot dripile falls snow

 cxxv
 "i pardon fear weakness past
 strong mine arrows cruel sharp gainst
 ah wretch thy chance fortune cast

 since hope vain help waste
 since hurts ease hurts wounds must cure wounds thee
 thine arrow's stroke cure stroke love
 death thy heart must salve surgeon prove

 cxxvi
 "and happy dead slain
 bear strange plague hell
 love stay behind come thou disdain
 wronged soul forever dwell

 vex knight dreams visions fell
 tell twixt life death strove

 cxxvii
 word half mad half dead seems
 arrow poignant strong sharp took
 dear knight found extremes
 fit die pass stygian brook
 prest quench beauty's beams
 death sat eyes death look
 back stepped stayed arm
 stretched forth service last last harm

 cxxviii
 turns ere knows lord spies
 whose coming unwished unthought unknown
 shrieks twines away sdainful eyes
 sweet face falls dead swoon

 cxxix
 fair face fair bosom bedews
 tears tears remorse ruth sorrow
 pale rose color lost renews
 fresh drops fallen silver morrow
 revives cheeks empurpled shows
 moist tears tears borrow
 thrice looked eyes thrice closed
 say "let die ere look thee"

 cxxx
 strong arm weak feeble hand
 would thrust away loosed untwined
 oft strove vain break band
 hold got yet resigned
 fast bound dear knots fand
 dear though feigned scorn strove repined
 last speaks weeps complains cries
 yet durst would see eyes

 cxxxi
 "cruel thy departure return
 cruel say chance thee hither guideth
 would'st thou prevent death whose heart forlorn
 thee thee death's strokes hour divideth
 com'st thou save life alas scorn
 torment armida poor abideth
 thy crafts sleights well descry
 little cannot die

 cxxxii
 "thy triumph great well arrayed
 unless chains thou lead captive dame
 dame ta'en force betrayed
 thy greatest glory greatest fame
 time thee love life prayed
 let death end love life shame
 yet let thy false hand bereave breath
 thy gift hateful death

 cxxxiii
 "cruel hundred ways find
 rid thy malice thy hate
 weapons sharp poisons kind
 fire strangling fail estate
 yet ways enough know stop wind
 thousand entries hath house fate
 ah leave flatteries leave weak hope move
 cease cease hope dead dead love"

 cxxxiv
 thus mourned watery eyes
 disdain love dropped rolled tears
 pure fountains ran two streams likewise
 wherein chaste pity mild ruth appears
 thus sweet words queen pacifies
 "madam appease grief wrath fears
 crowned scorned life save
 foe nay friend knight slave

 cxxxv
 "but trust speech oath word
 yet mine eyes zeal truth behold
 throne whereof thy sire lord
 restore thee crown thee gold
 high heaven would much grace afford
 thy heart cloud veil unfold
 paganism east dame
 equalize thy fortune state fame"

 cxxxvi
 thus plaineth thus prays desire
 endears sighs fly tears fall
 warmth titan's fire
 snowdrifts consume tops mountains tall
 melts wrath love remains entire
 "behold" says "your handmaid thrall
 life crown wealth use pleasure"
 thus death life became loss proved tensure

 cxxxvii
 captain egyptian host

 "cease cease strife" cried "and thou brave knight

 cxliii
 said gave knights keep
 fled course bent
 rampiers fled trenches deep
 yet could death's cruel stroke prevent
 camp blood doth steep
 blood rivers streamed tent tent

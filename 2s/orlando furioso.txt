 canto 1

 argument
 angelica pressing danger frights
 flies disorder greenwood shade
 rinaldo's horse escapes following fights
 ferrau spaniard forest glade
 second oath haughty paynim plights
 keeps better first made
 king sacripant regains longlost treasure
 good rinaldo mars promised pleasure



 loves ladies knights arms sing
 courtesies many daring feat
 ancient days story bring
 moors afric passed hostile fleet
 ravaged france agramant king
 flushed youthful rage furious heat
 king charles' roman emperor's head
 vowed due vengeance troyano dead

 ii
 strain roland tell
 things unattempted yet prose rhyme
 strange madness rank fury fell
 man esteemed wise former time
 like cruel pass well
 nigh brought feeble wit fain would climb
 hourly wastes sense concede skill
 strength daring promise fulfil

 iii
 good seed hercules give ear deign
 thou age's grace splendour art
 hippolitus smile upon pain
 tenders humble heart
 though hope quit score vain
 pen pages may pay debt part
 jealous eye offering scan
 scorn gifts give thee

 iv
 amid worthiest shalt thou hear
 fitting praise prepare grace
 record good rogero valiant peer
 ancient root thine illustrious race
 thou wilt lend willing ear
 worth warlike feats shall retrace
 thou thy graver cares little time
 postponing lend thy leisure rhyme

 v
 roland long lady catay
 angelica loved brand
 raised countless trophies damsel gay
 india median tartarian land
 westward measured back way
 nigh pyrenees many band
 germany france king charlemagne
 camped faithful host upon plain

 vi
 make king agramant penance smite
 cheek rash marsilius rue hour
 trained lance sword fight
 led africa swell power
 pushed fell despite
 realm france spain's martial flower
 'twas thus orlando came charles tented
 evil hour soon deed repented

 vii
 seized dame peerless charms
 often human judgment wanders wide
 long warfare kept harms
 western climes eastern shores guide
 land 'mid friends kindred arms
 without contest severed side
 fearing mischief kindled eyes
 prudent emperor reft prize

 viii
 bold orlando cousin free
 rinaldo late contended maid
 enamored beauty rare since
 alike glowing breast either swayed
 charles little liked rivalry
 drew omen thence feebler aid
 abate cause quarrel seized fair
 placed bavarian namus' care

 ix
 vowing warrior content
 conflict fatal day
 good hand gainful succour lent
 slew paynims martial fray
 counter hopes battle went
 thinned squadrons fled disarray
 namus christian captains taken
 pavilion rout forsaken

 x
 lodged charles gentle bonnibel
 ordained valiant victor's meed
 event sprung sell
 combat turned time need
 presaging wisely fortune would rebel
 fatal day christian creed
 entering thick wood discovered near
 close path horseless cavalier

 xi
 shield upon arm knightly wise
 belted mailed helmet head
 knight lightly forest hies
 halfclothed churl win cloth red
 cruel snake swiftly flies
 timid shepherdess startled tread
 poor angelica bridle turns
 approaching knight foot discerns

 xii
 paladin good aymon's seed
 mount albano command
 late baiardo lost gallant steed
 escaped strange adventure hand
 soon seen maid rode speed
 warrior knew yet distant scanned
 angelic features gentle air
 long held fast cupid's snare

 xiii
 affrighted damsel turns palfrey round
 shakes floating bridle wind
 panic seeks choose ground
 open grove prefers thicket blind
 reckless pale trembling astound
 leaves horse devious way find
 forest bore dame
 till sylvan river's bank came

 xiv
 stood fierce ferrau grisly plight
 begrimed dust bathed sweat blood
 lately withdrawn fight
 rest drink refreshing flood
 tarried despite
 since bending bank hasty mood
 dropped helmet crystal tide
 vainly regain treasure tried

 xv
 thither speed drives evermore
 wild panic utters fearful cries
 voice upleaping shore
 saracen lovely visage spies
 pale cheek troubled sore
 arriving quickly warrior's eyes
 though many days news shown
 beautiful angelica known

 xvi
 courteous haply gifted breast
 warm either cousins two
 bold brows steel dressed
 succour sought lent drew
 faulchion rinaldo pressed
 saw little fear champion true
 known sight
 proved arms foeman's might

 xvii
 thus foot warriors vie
 cruel strife blade blade oppose
 marvel plate brittle mail fly
 anvils stood deafening blows
 behoves palfrey swift ply
 feet knights combat close
 vexed utmost speed goading spurs
 waste wood frighted damsel stirs

 xviii
 two struggled long throw
 strife vainly still
 since neither valiant warrior
 opposite force knightly skill
 first parley spanish foe
 good master albano's hill
 one within whose raging breast pent
 reckless fire struggled vent

 xix
 "thou think'st" said "to injure alone
 know thou wilt thyself much molest
 fight yon rising sun
 raging heat kindled thy breast
 thy gain guerdon
 though yield life stoop crest
 shall never thy glorious meed
 flies vainly battle bleed

 xx
 "then much better since stake's
 thou loving like should'st mount stay
 wait battle's end lovely dame
 fly yet way
 lady taken repeat claim
 naked faulchion peerless prey
 else long toil see gain
 simple loss unrequited pain"

 xxi
 peer's proposal pleased paynim well
 hot contention foregone
 fair truce replaced discord fell
 mutual wrongs forgot mischief done
 departure seated sell
 foot spaniard left aymon's son
 mount courser's crupper prayed
 united chased royal maid

 xxii
 oh goodly truth cavaliers old
 rivals different faith bred
 yet weary warriors' wounds cold 
 still smarting strokes fell dread
 yet together ride waste wold
 unsuspecting devious dingle thread
 four spurs infest foaming sides
 courser brings way divides

 xxiii
 warlike pair fault
 knew might palfrey goad
 since without distinction survey
 recent print hoofs either road
 commit chase fortune way
 paynim pricked rinaldo strode
 fierce ferrau bewildered wood
 found late stood

 xxiv
 beside water stoop'd drink
 dropt knightly helmet  cost
 sunk stream since could think
 retrieve late hopes crossed
 treasure fell descends brink
 swift stream seeks morion lost
 casque lies bedded sands
 'twill ask light endeavour hands

 xxv
 bough severs neighbouring tree
 shreds shapes branch pole
 sounds stream anxiously
 fathoms rakes ransacks shelf hole
 angered sore heart restless
 lingered troubled waters roll
 breasthigh mid river rose upright
 apparition angry knight

 xxvi
 armed points except head
 better hand helmet bore
 casque river's bed
 ferrau sought vainly toiling long sore
 upon spanish knight frowned said
 "thou traitor thy word thou perjured moor
 grieve goodly helmet resign
 due long since justly mine

 xxvii
 "remember pagan thine arm laid low
 brother angelica knight
  thy word plighted throw
 arms helmet bright
 fortune compel thee forego
 prize thy despite
 grieve rather grieve thou
 art found perjured traitor thy vow

 xxviii
 "but thou seek'st helmet thy task
 win wear thy renown
 noble prize good orlando's casque
 rinaldo's yet fairer crown
 almontes' mambrino's iron masque
 make one force arms thine
 good helm fitly bestowed
 thy promise long owed"

 xxix
 bristled paynim's every hair view
 grim shade uprising tide
 vanished fresh healthful hue
 lips halfformed accents died
 next hearing argalia slew
 warrior hight stream beside
 thus unknightly breach promise blame
 burned flushed rage shame

 xxx
 time falsehood excuse
 knowing well true phantom's lore
 stood speechless remorse words infuse
 lanfusa's life warrior swore
 never fight foray would use
 helmet good orlando bore
 aspramont bold almontes paid
 life forfeit christian blade

 xxxi
 new vow discharged faithfully
 vain promise whilom plight
 stream departing heavily
 many days sore vexed grieved sprite
 still intent seek orlando
 roved wheresoe'er hoped find knight
 different lot befel rinaldo
 chanced another pathway pursue

 xxxii
 far warrior fared ere spied
 bounding across path gallant steed
 "stay bayardo mine" rinaldo cried
 "too cruel care loss thee breed"
 horse returned side
 deaf prayer flew better speed
 furious chase rinaldo hies
 follow angelica flies

 xxxiii
 dreary woods dark damsel fled
 rude unharboured heath savage height
 every leaf spray rustled bred
 oak elm beech new affright
 foaming palfrey sped
 strange crooked paths furious flight
 shadow seen valley blind
 mountain feared rinaldo behind

 xxxiv
 young roe fawn fallow deer
 mid shelter native glade
 seen hungry pard tiger tear
 bosom bleeding dam dismayed
 bounds forest green ceaseless fear
 destroying beast shade shade
 sapling touched amid pangs
 believes monster's fangs

 xxxv
 one day night half following day
 damsel wanders wide whither knows
 enters deep wood whose branches play
 moved lightly freshening breeze blows
 two clear murmuring rivers stray
 upon banks fresher herbage grows
 twin streams passage slowly clear
 make music stones please ear

 xxxvi
 weening removed way wends
 thousand miles loathed rinaldo's beat
 rest maid intends
 wearied long flight summer's heat
 saddle 'mid spring flowers descends
 takes bridle courser fleet
 loose along river lets pass
 roving banks search lusty grass

 xxxvii
 behold hand thicket surveys
 gay flowering thorn vermeil rose
 tuft reflected stream strays
 beside overshadowing oaks enclose
 hollow within safe vulgar gaze
 seemed place constructed repose
 bows interwoven light
 pierced tangled screen far less sight

 xxxviii
 within soft moss herbage form bed
 delay rest traveller woo
 'twas limbs weary damsel spread
 eyeballs bathed slumber's balmy dew
 little time eased drooping head
 ere weened courser's tramp knew
 softly rises river near
 armed capapie beholds cavalier

 xxxix
 friend foe nothing comprehends
 hope fear doubting bosom tear
 adventure's issue mute attends
 even sigh disturbs air
 cavalier upon bank descends
 sits motionless lost care
 visage propt upon arm sight
 changed senseless stone appeared knight

 xl
 pensive hour drooping head
 rested mute ere began moan
 piteous tale sorrow said
 lamenting soft sweet tone
 tiger's breast pity bred
 mournful wailings rent stone
 sighed wept like rivers flowed
 tears bosom like aetna glowed

 xli
 "thought makes burn freeze hate
 gnaws heart rankles root
 what's left me" said "arrived late
 one favoured bears away fruit
 bare words looks scarce cheered hopeless state
 prime spoils reward another's suit
 since fruit blossom hangs
 longer pine hopeless pangs

 xlii
 "the virgin image rose
 sheltered garden native stock
 solitude safe repose
 blooms unapproached sheperd flock
 earth teems freshening water flows
 breeze dewy dawn sweets unlock
 wistful youth bosom dresses
 enamored damsel braids tresses

 xliii
 "but wanton hands sooner displace
 maternal stem grown
 withered whatsoever grace
 found man heaven bloom beauty gone
 damsel hold higher place
 light life flower
 suffering spoiler's hand crop prize
 forfeits worth every other's eyes

 xliv
 "and cheap except wight
 large boon bestow
 ah false cruel fortune foul despite
 others triumph drown'd woe
 treasure slight
 life forego
 let die 'twere happiness
 longer life must cease love"

 xlv
 ask made sorrowing
 pour'd stream many tears
 answer fair circassia's king
 sacripant oppressed amorous cares
 love source troubles spring
 sole occasion pains fears
 lover's service paid
 well remembered royal maid

 xlvi
 sake orient's farthest reign
 roved thither sun descends rest
 told india pain
 orlando followed west
 learned france charlemagne
 secluded champion rest
 fit guerdon mewed knight
 protect lilies best fight

 xlvii
 warrior field viewed
 short time king charlemagne's disgrace
 vainly angelica pursued
 damsel's footsteps found trace
 weeping monarch rued
 bewailed doleful case
 hence words lamentations run
 might pity stop passing sun

 xlviii
 sacripant laments plight
 makes tepid fountain eyes
 deem needful recite
 pours forth yet plaints piteous cries
 propitious fortune lady bright
 hear youth lament wise
 thus moment compassed without
 chance long ages brought

 xlix
 deep attention warrior weeps
 marks fashion grief tears
 words whose passion never sleeps
 first confession hears
 plaint heart measure keeps
 cold column builder rears
 like haughty maid holds
 world deems none worthy love

 l
 harm amid woods keep
 damsel weened might guidance need
 poor drowning caitiff chindeep
 implores help obstinate indeed
 let occasion sleep
 find escort stand stead
 king long experience knew
 lovers kind true

 li
 maid intends
 heal mischief charms wrought
 past ills furnish glad amends
 full bliss pining lover sought
 keep king play ends
 help device fiction bought
 purpose taxed daring
 reassume wont haughty bearing

 lii
 apparition bright unforeseen
 stood like venus diana fair
 solemn pageant issuing scene
 shadowy wood murky lair
 "peace you" cried youthful queen
 "and god preserve honour care
 suffer blindly entertain
 opinion fame false vain"

 liii
 wonderment mother eyes
 excessive bliss son mourned
 dead lamented still tears sighs
 since thinned files without boy returned
  rapture king's surprise
 ecstasy joy discerned
 lofty presence cheeks heavenly hue
 lovely form broke upon view

 liv
 full fond eager passion pressed
 towards lady divinity
 clasped warrior breast
 catay haply less free
 maid thoughts addressed
 towards native land empery
 feels hope revived bosom beat
 shortly repossess sumptuous seat

 lv
 chances damsel said
 since eastward sent sericane
 seek martial monarch's aid
 swayed sceptre fair domain
 told oft orlando's friendly blade
 saved dishonour death pain
 preserved virgin flower
 pure blossomed natal hour

 lvi
 haply tale true yet seem
 likely one sober sense possessed
 sacripant waked worser dream
 without cavil acquiesced
 since love sees without one guiding gleam
 spies broad day likes best
 one sign afflicted man's disease
 give ready faith things please

 lvii
 "if good anglante's lord prize forbore
 seized fair occasion might
 loss fortune never
 enjoy fair prize invite
 imitate lord little lore
 think not" said apart circassa's knight
 "to quit proffered good shame
 afterthought blame

 lviii
 "no pluck fresh morning rose
 tarry may overblown
 woman experience shows
 deed sweet welcome done
 whatsoever scorn damsel shows
 though awhile may weep make moan
 unchecked anger false true
 sharp repulse bold design pursue"

 lix
 said soft assault prepares
 loud noise within greenwood shade
 beside rang astounded ears
 sore monarch stayed
 donned helm arms wears
 aye wont rove steel belted blade
 replaced bridle courser fleet
 grappled lance sprang seat

 lx
 bold semblance valiant knight
 behold warrior threads forest hoar
 stranger's mantle snowy white
 white alike waving plume wore
 balked bliss full fell despite
 monarch ill interruption bore
 spurred horse meet mid space
 hate fury glowing face

 lxi
 defies fight approaching nigh
 weens make stoop haughty crest
 knight whose worth rate high
 warlike prowess puts present test
 cuts short haughty threats angry cry
 spurs lays levelled lance rest
 tempest wheels circassia's valiant peer
 foeman's head aims spear

 lxii
 brindled bulls tawny lions spring
 forest warfare deadly
 two knights stranger king
 spears alike opposing bucklers thrill
 solid ground encountering
 trembles fruitful vale naked hill
 well mail dressed
 bodies proof saved breast

 lxiii
 swerved chargers destined course
 met like rams butted head head
 warlike saracen's illfated horse
 well valued alive dropt short dead
 stranger's fell senseless perforce
 roused rowel grassy bed
 paynim king extended straight
 lay battered lord weight

 lxiv
 upright upon steed knight unknown
 encounter horse rider threw
 deeming enough conflict done
 cares worthless warfare renew
 endlong readiest path gone
 measures pricking frith forest
 mile little less furious heat
 ere foiled saracen regains feet

 lxv
 bewildered astonished clown
 held plough thunder storm o'erpast
 deafening bolt beat
 nigh deathstricken cattle wakes aghast
 sees distant pine without crown
 saw clad leafy honours last
 rose paynim knight troubled face
 maid spectatress cruel case

 lxvi
 sighs groans yet mischief sore
 endured wounded arm foot bled
 mere shame never
 dyed cheek deep red
 rued fall grieved
 dame lift courser dead
 speechless remained ween
 prisoned tongue voice set free

 lxvii
 "grieve not" said "sir monarch thy fall
 let blame upon thy courser
 welcome forage stall
 rest joust jeopardy
 well thy foe loser may call
 shall glory gain
 first quit ground aught
 angelica fighting fields taught"

 lxviii
 seeks saracen cheer
 behold messenger pouch horn
 panting hackney  man horse appear
 long journey weary forlorn
 questions sacripant approaching near
 seen warrior pass borne
 shield crest white search
 wide forest pricked weary groom

 lxix
 king sacripant made answer "as see
 threw went way
 tell warrior's name may
 informed whose valour foiled fray"
 groom  "that ask
 shall relate without delay
 know combat prostrate laid
 tried valour gentle maid

 lxx
 "bold maid fairer yet bold
 redoubted virgin's name veil
 'twas bradamant marred praise old
 prowess ever sword mail"
 said spurred story told
 left little gladdened tale
 recks says shame
 flushed visage kindles flame

 lxxi
 woeful warrior long thought
 upon cruel case still vain
 found woman defeat wrought
 thinking increased monarch's pain
 climbed horse spake aught
 silently uplifted plain
 upon croup bestowed damsel sweet
 reserved gladder use safer seat

 lxxii
 two miles rode hear
 sweeping woods spread sound
 loud crash trample far near
 forest seemed tremble around
 shortly see steed appear
 housings wrought gold richly bound
 clears bush stream furious force
 whatsoever else impedes course

 lxxiii
 "unless misty air" damsel cries
 "and boughs deceive sight yon noble steed
 sure bayardo us flies
 parts wood impetuous speed
  yes 'tis bayardo's self recognize
 well courser understands need
 two riders ill foundered jade would bear
 hither speeds horse end care"

 lxxiv
 bold circassian lighted applied
 hand seize flowing rein
 swiftly turning heels replied
 like lightning wheeled upon plain
 woe king leaps aside
 smite would lash vain
 bone sinew shock
 good heels split metal rock

 lxxv
 maid goes submissively
 gentle blandishment humble mood
 dog greets lord frolic glee
 short season past viewed
 good bayardo memory
 albracca hands prepared food
 time damsel loved rinaldo bold
 rinaldo ungrateful stern cold

 lxxvi
 left hand takes bit
 pats sides chest
 good steed marvellous wit
 lamblike obeyed damsel caressed
 meantime king sees moment fit
 leapt knees courser pressed
 palfrey eased half weight
 lady left croup gained seat

 lxxvii
 hazard directs sight
 sounding arms man foot espies
 glows sudden anger despite
 son aymon eyes
 life esteems youthful knight
 like crane falcon flies
 time lady sighed passion slighted
 'tis rinaldo loves ill requited

 lxxviii
 effect two different fountains wrought
 whose wonderous waters different moods inspire
 spring arden rare virtue fraught
 fills heart amorous desire
 taste fountain untaught
 love change ice former fire
 rinaldo drank first vainly sighs
 angelica last hates flies

 lxxix
 mixed secret bane waters glide
 amorous care convert sudden hate
 maid sooner rinaldo spied
 laughing eyes deep darkness sate
 sad mien trembling voice cried
 sacripant prayed wait
 near approach detested knight
 wood pursue flight

 lxxx
 saracen anger hot
 "is knightly worship sunk low
 thou should'st hold valour cheap
 sufficient make yonder champion flee
 already albracca's fights forgot
 dread night singly stood thee
 night though naked thy shield
 king agrican field"

 lxxxi
 answers knows fear
 'tis rinaldo nigh
 afar furious cavalier
 threats bold saracen angry cry
 soon known steed damsel dear
 whose charms flame kindled meet eye
 ensued haughty pair
 another canto shall declare


 canto 2

 argument
 hermit parts means hollow sprite
 two redoubted rivals' dangerous play
 rinaldo goes love hope invite
 dispatched charles another way
 bradamont seeking devoted knight
 good rogero nigh becomes prey
 pinabel drops damsel brave
 dungeon living grave



 injurious love still mar accord
 desires thy favourite feat
 please thee perfidious lord
 two hearts different measure beat
 thou wilt let take certain ford
 dragging stream deep fleet
 abandon love desires
 hates respect love inspires

 ii
 thou rinaldo show'st damsel fair
 seems hideous gentle dame
 lady's pride care
 paid back deepest hate amorous flame
 pines victim despair
 scorned turn reward
 changed damsel sort abhorred
 would choose death hated lord

 iii
 pagan cries "forego thy theft
 false felon pilfer'd steed
 wont let reft
 seeks dearly pays deed
  shall take thee yon lovely weft
 leave thee prize foul misdeed
 horse maid whose worth outstrips belief
 ill methinks relinquished thief"

 iv
 "thou liest" haughty saracen retorts
 proud burning fierce flame
 "a thief thyself fame truth reports
 let good deeds decide dubious claim
 steed damsel fair assorts
 best proved valiant deeds though dame
 nothing precious thee
 search wide world throughout may well agree"

 v
 two fierce dogs somtimes stand gaze
 hate springs strife inspire
 grind teeth foe surveys
 sidelong glance eyes red fire
 either falls bites hoarsely bays
 stiff bristles stand end ire
 reproach menace sword
 pass sacripant clermont's angry lord

 vi
 thus kindling wrath knights engage
 one foot horse
 small gain inexperienced page
 would better rein charger course
 baiardo's sense wage
 war master put force
 voice hand manage stir
 rebellious rein goading spur

 vii
 king would urge takes rest
 curbs runs giddy rings
 drops head beneath spreading chest
 plays spine runs anend flings
 furious saracen distressed
 sees 'tis time tame beast springs
 one hand pummel ground
 clear restless courser bound

 viii
 soon sacripant welltimed leap
 fury bayardo freed
 may believe battle sleep
 champions matched heart deed
 sounding blades changeful measure keep
 hammerstrokes vulcan less speed
 descend dim cavern heats
 jove's red thunders anvil beats

 ix
 sometimes lunge feign thrust parry
 deep masters desperate game play
 rise upon furious stroke carry
 swords aloft stoop stand bay
 close exhausted tarry
 hide show give way
 one knight inch ground granted
 foeman's foot upon inch planted

 x
 lo rinaldo impatient grown
 strikes full sacripant lifted blade
 puts forth buckler made bone
 well strong stubborn steel inlaid
 though passing thick fusberta cleaves groan
 greenwood covert close sunny glade
 paynim's arm rings senseless blow
 steel bone like ice shivers go

 xi
 fair damsel saw timid eye
 ruin follow faulchion's sway
 like criminal whose doom nigh
 changed fair countenance sore dismay
 deemed little time left fly
 would rinaldo's prey
 rinaldo loathed much
 doats scornful damsel miserably

 xii
 turned horse gloomy chase
 drove rough path tangled ally
 oftentimes bent back bloodless face
 saw rinaldo thicket sally
 flying long urged frantic race
 met hermit valley
 devotion aspect expressed
 long beard descended breast

 xiii
 wasted much fasts age
 ass mounted slow sure
 visage warranted never sage
 conscience precise passing pure
 though arteries time stilled rage
 blood spake feeble demure
 sight delighted damsel
 inly stirred charity

 xiv
 lady prayed kindly friar
 would straight conduct near
 land france might flee
 never loathed rinaldo hear
 hermit skilled sorcery
 ceased soothe gentle damsel's fear
 promise deliverance shook
 pocket drew forth secret book

 xv
 opened quick mighty marvel wrought
 leaf finished sage
 spirit bidding brought
 waits command likeness page
 magic writ constrained taught
 hastes warriors face face engage
 cool shade  cool disport 
 steps stops battle short

 xvi
 "in courtesy" cried "let either show
 foe's death either avail
 guerdon conquest bestow
 battle shall prevail
 roland though struck blow
 snapt fight single link mail
 paristown conveys damsel gay
 engaged bitter fray

 xvii
 "within easy mile saw peer
 pricking paris lady bright
 riding merry mood laugh jeer
 mocking fierce fruitless fight
 sure better yet near
 follow peer damsel flight
 paris place prize
 lady never shall meet eyes"

 xviii
 might seen angry cavaliers
 change demon's tale rage shame
 curse wanting eyes ears
 let rival cheat dame
 towards horse good rinaldo steers
 breathing forth piteous sighs seem flame
 joins orlando  ere part 
 swears fury heart

 xix
 passing prompt bayardo stood
 leaps back leaves swift wind
 without farewell rival wood
 much less invites seat behind
 goaded charger heat blood
 forces whate'er eager course confined
 ditch river tangled thorn marble block
 swims river clears rock

 xx
 let sir sound strangely ear
 rinaldo took steed thus readily
 long vainly followed far near
 endued reasoning faculty
 vice lured following peer
 fled cherished lord
 might guide whither went gentle dame
 heard nursed flame

 xxi
 angelica random dread
 pavilion winged rapid flight
 bayardo marked damsel fled
 saddle lightened mount alban's knight
 foot equal combat sped
 matched baron meaner might
 chased maid woods floods strands
 hopes place warrior's hands

 xxii
 desire bring maid
 gallopped still rampant play
 would let master mount afraid
 might make take another way
 luring rinaldo shade
 twice brought unexpected prey
 twice foiled endeavour bold
 ferrau sacripant lately told

 xxiii
 good bayardo believed tiding
 fair damsel produced accord
 devil's cunning tale confiding
 renewed wonted service lord
 behold rinaldo fury riding
 pushing still courser parisward
 though fly fast champion's wishes go
 faster wind seemed slow

 xxiv
 night rinaldo rests steed pain
 meet anglante's lord burned sore
 lent credit tidings vain
 false courier wizard hoar
 day next flowing rein
 rode till royal city rose
 eyes charlemagne taken post
 sad remnant broken host

 xxv
 fears afric king's pursuit
 sap siege upon vassals calls
 gather fresh victual recruit
 cleanse ditches repair walls
 may best annoy foes suit
 safety without delay forestalls
 plans embassy england thence
 gather fresher forces defence

 xxvi
 bent try fate
 arms tented field though lately shamed
 send rinaldo neighbouring state
 britain england named
 ill liked paladin cross strait
 people land blamed
 king charles sudden day
 would grant valiant envoy delay

 xxvii
 rinaldo never executed thing
 less willingly prevented quest
 fair visage following
 whose charms heart ravished breast
 yet obediance christian king
 prepared royal hest
 calais good envoy wends speed
 day embarks steed

 xxviii
 scorn cautious pilot's skill
 impatience regain home
 launched doubtful sea boded ill
 rolled heavy billows white foam
 wind enraged opposed
 stirred waves 'mid gathering gloom
 loud storm tempest's fury grew
 topmasthigh flashing waters flew

 xxix
 watchful mariners wary sort
 haul mainsail attempt wear
 would put back panic port
 whence ill hour loosed little care
  "not so" exclaims wind stops short
 "so poor penance pay dare"
 fain would veer fiercer roar
 pelts back reeling prow blusters

 xxx
 starboard larboard bears fitful gale
 never thought ire assuages
 strained vessel drives humble sail
 billows tempest rages
 still pursue varying tale
 must leave awhile paladin wages
 weary warfare wind flood
 follow fair virgin blood

 xxxi
 speak famed damsel whose spear
 o'erthrown king sacripant earth flung
 worthy sister valiant peer
 beatrix good duke aymon sprung
 daring deeds puissance less dear
 charlemagne france since proved among
 first prowess tried many test
 equal good rinaldo's shone confessed

 xxxii
 cavalier suitor dame
 afric passed agramant
 rogero valiant father's name
 mother child agolant
 bear lion came
 disdained child love plant
 though cruel fortune ill wishes meeting
 granted pair single greeting

 xxxiii
 alone thenceforth sought lover
 named owed birth
 roved safe company
 thousands trusting single worth
 made king circassy
 salute visage old mother earth
 traversed wood wood past mountain
 stopt length beside lovely fountain

 xxxiv
 delicious mead fountainrill
 ancient trees o'ershaded glides away
 whose ear pleasing murmurs fill
 invites drink banks stay
 left side cultivated hill
 excludes fervors middle day
 first damsel thither turns eyes
 youthful cavalier seated spies

 xxxv
 cavalier underneath shade
 seems lost melancholy dream
 bank gaudy flowers displayed
 reposing overhangs crystal stream
 horse beneath spreading beech laid
 bough shield helmet gleam
 moist eyes sad downcast air
 speak broken victim despair

 xxxvi
 urged passion lodged every breast
 restless curiosity know
 others' cares gentle maid addressed
 knight sought occasion woe
 secret grief confessed
 gentle speech courteous show
 gallant bearing sight
 prepared saw nimble knight

 xxxvii
 "fair sir band horse foot" said
 "i brought charlemagne thither pressed
 ambush marsilius spread
 descending pyrenean crest
 company damsel led
 whose charms fervid love fired breast
 journey rhone's current
 rider winged courser spy

 xxxviii

 spacious meadow's level sward
 pair already begun fight
 porter opened mount alban's lord
 straight behind peer portal hight
 rinaldo empty city rode
 hostel first dame bestowed

 lxxx
 long delay
 seek till return repose
 quickly lists pursued way
 two made fell exchange blows
 strove struggled yet bloody fray
 lurcanio's heart vengeful hatred glows
 geneura knight
 well maintains quarrel right

 lxxxi
 six knights foot within palisade
 stand covered corslet's iron case
 beneath duke albany arrayed
 borne puissant steed noble race
 lord highconstable obeyed
 keeper field place
 joyed geneura's peril espy
 swelling bosom exulting eye

 lxxxii
 rinaldo pierces parted swarm
 wide felt good bayardo's sway
 hears courser come storm
 halts desire make way
 seen rinaldo's lofty form
 flower mix martial fray
 stops horse monarch's chair
 hear paladin repair

 lxxxiii
 "dread sir" good rinaldo said
 "let pair combat longer ply
 since whichsoever two falls dead
 know let perish wrongfully
 thinks right misled
 vouches false knows 'tis lie
 since brought brother end
 moves causeless battle contend

 lxxxiv
 "that pure gentleness little care
 maintains wrong right
 would preserve maid fair
 perils person furious fight
 injured innocence safety bear
 evil man opposite
 first love god battle stay
 list sir king shall display"

 lxxxv
 moved king grave authority
 one seemed worthy cheer
 made sign battle
 continued sword spear
 together chivalry
 barons realm others near
 rinaldo treacherous plot displayed
 polinesso geneura layed

 lxxxvi
 next arms would testify
 truth vouched warrior cried
 false polinesso called troubled eye
 stood forth daringly tale denied
 good rinaldo reply
 "by deeds doubtful quarrel tried"
 field cleared ready armed foes
 without let deadly duel close

 lxxxvii
 hope king people dear
 proof might show geneura innocent
 trust god make treason clear
 show accused foul intent
 polinesso greedy severe
 proud held false fraudulent
 none assembled deemed
 marvel knight fraud schemed

 lxxxviii
 false polinesso mien distressed
 pallid cheek heart thickly beat
 third trumpet laid lance rest
 well rinaldo spurred knight meet
 levelled evil foeman's breast
 eager finish single heat
 counter wish event
 since warrior half weapon went

 lxxxix
 breast impaled upon spear
 six yards beyond horse bore
 speed alighted mount albano's peer
 ere rose unlaced helm wore
 mercy prayed humble cheer
 unfit strive joust warfare
 king court faltering breath
 confessed fraud brought death

 xc
 brings confession close
 pangs death failing accents drown
 prince ended saw daughter's woes
 redeemed death scorn virtue shown
 delight rapture overflows
 lost kingly crown
 saw first upon head replaced
 good rinaldo singly graced

 xci
 uplifted casque displaid
 features well known king descried
 thanks god lifted hands paid
 deigned succour provide
 cavalier bared blade
 unknown upon geneura's side
 thither came far aid impart
 looked upon passed stood apart

 xcii
 good king entreated declare
 name least visage shew
 might grace guerdon fair
 good intent justly due
 stranger long earnest prayer
 lifted covering casque bared view

 argument
 ariodantes worthy meed
 loved bride fief albany
 meantime rogero flying steed
 arrives false alcina's empery
 myrtletree every deed
 human myrtle hears treachery
 thence would go first withdrew
 one strife engage new



 wretched evil man lives trust
 secret sin safe possession
 since nought else air dust
 crime buried makes confession
 oftentimes guilt compels unjust
 though sometime unarraigned worldly session
 accuser bewray
 god willed deeds hidden day

 ii
 unhappy polinesso hopes nursed
 wholly secret treason conceal
 taking dalinda versed
 could fact reveal
 adding thus second first
 offence hurried dread appeal
 haply stunned least deferred
 selfdestruction blindly spurred

 iii
 forfeited estate life love
 friends honour
 cavalier unknown said
 long king court entreated sore
 length covering helmet remove
 showed visage often seen
 cherished face ariodantes true
 late lamented weeping scotland

 iv
 ariodantes tearful eye
 brother geneura wept dead
 king people nobility
 light goodness valour shed
 pilgrim therefore might appear lie
 missing warrior said
 yet true headland
 seen plunge foaming sea

 v
 oft befalls despairing wight
 grisly death desires till appear
 loathes sought nearer sight
 painful seems cruel pass drear
 thus sea engulphed wretched knight
 repentant deed touched fear
 matchless spirit hand
 beat back billows returned land

 vi
 despising folly bred
 fond desire death impell
 thence soaked dripping wet way tread
 halted hermit's humble cell
 housed within holy father's shed
 secretly awhile designed dwell
 till ears rumour voiced
 geneura sorrowed rejoiced

 vii
 first heard excess woe
 miserable damsel wellnigh died
 abroad doleful tidings go
 'twas talked island far wide
 far proof deceitful show
 cruel grief thought spied
 next fair geneura heard
 lurcanio sire charge preferred

 viii
 brother felt less enmity
 love lately bore maid
 foul full cruelty
 esteemed deed although essayed
 hearing jeopardy
 none appeared lend damsel aid
 puissant lurcanio's might
 dreaded encounter knight

 ix
 well youthful champion knew
 believed wary discreet
 related untrue
 never would risqued rash feat
  greater part fight eschew
 fearing wrongful cause knight meet 
 ariodantes long doubts weighed
 meet brother geneura's aid

 x
 "alas said cannot bear see
 thus cause royal damsel die
 death bitter dread would
 death descry
 still lady divinity
  light comfort eye
 right wrong cannot choose shield
 safety perish field

 xi
 "i know choose wrong
 cause shall die would move
 alas death well know
 lovely dame's destruction prove
 death one comfort go
 polinesso bears love
 manifestly displayed
 hitherto moves aid

 xii
 "and wronged maid shall view
 encounter death defence
 brother flames discord blew
 shall pay debt vengeance due
 well ween make lurcanio rue
 informed event cruelty
 thought venge brand
 slain hand"

 xiii
 concluded thought
 made new provision arms steed shield
 black vest buckler bought
 green yellow striped sable field
 hazard found squire brought
 stranger country concealed
 already told unhappy knight
 brother came prepared fight

 xv
 yielding natural inclination
 suit court beside
 mostly rinaldo's instigation
 assigned youth damsel bride
 albany's duchy sequestration
 late polinesso's duel died
 could forfeited happier hour
 since monarch made daughter's dower

 xvi
 rinaldo dalinda mercy
 fault's due punishment went free
 satiate world shun
 damsel vowed god flee
 hence denmark's land live nun
 straight native scotland sailed sea
 time rogero pursue
 courser posts welkin

 xvii
 although rogero constant mind
 cheek wonted hues depart
 ween faster leaf i' wind
 fluttered within breast stripling's heart
 europe's region left behind
 swift course issuing part
 passed mighty space southern sound
 great alcides fixed sailor's bound

 xviii
 hippogryph huge fowl strange sight
 bears warrior rapid wing
 would distanced airy flight
 thunder bearing bird aether's king
 living creature soars height
 mighty swiftness equalling
 scarce believe bolt lightning flies
 darts swiftly parted skies

 xix
 huge bird pinions long plied
 straight line without one stoop bend
 tired air sweeping wheel wide
 began upon island descend
 like fair region whither long unspied
 wayward mood long offend
 whilom vain strange secret sluice
 passed sea virgin arethuse

 xx
 delightful place wherever hurled
 whole air rogero found
 ranged universal world
 would seen lovelier round
 wheeling wide courser furled
 spreading wings lighted ground
 'mid cultivated plain delicious hill
 moist meadow shady bank crystal rill

 xxi
 small thickets scented laurel gay
 cedar orange full fruit flower
 myrtle palm interwoven spray
 pleached mixed modes lovely form bower
 breaking shade scorching ray
 make cool shelter noontide hour
 nightingales among branches wing
 flight safely amorous descants sing

 xxii
 amid red roses white lilies
 soft breezes freshen fly
 secure cony haunts timid hare
 stag branching forehead broad high
 fearless hunter's dart snare
 feed ease ruminating lie
 swarming wilds tuft steep
 dun deer nimble goat disporting leap

 xxiii
 hyppogryph island hung
 approached nigh landscape fair
 rider saddle sprung
 might leap little danger dare
 rogero lit grass flowers among
 held lest remount air
 myrtle nigh rolling brine
 made fast baytree pine

 xxiv

 drops shield helmet front

 xxv
 bathe burning lips strains
 dabbles crystal wave chase
 scorching heat rages veins
 caught heavy corslet's burning case
 marvel burden pains
 ramble square marketplace
 three thousand miles without repose went
 still speed ponderous armour pent

 xxvi
 meanwhile courser myrtle's side
 left stabled cool retreat
 started something wood descried
 scared know heat
 made myrtle shake tied
 brought shower leaves feet
 made myrtle shake foliage fall
 struggling could loose withal

 xxvii
 stick feed chimney rent
 scanty pith ill fills narrow sheath
 vapour little channel pent
 struggles tormented fire beneath
 till prisoned fury find vent
 heard hiss bubble sing seethe
 offended myrtle inly pined
 groaned murmured last unclosed rind

 xxviii
 hence clear intelligible speech
 thus issued melancholy sound
 "if thy cheer gentle presence teach
 thou courteous art good reign unbound
 release monster beseech
 griefs inflict sufficient wound
 need compassed ills
 new pain plague without"

 xxix
 first sound rogero turns see
 whence came voice unused surprise

 "pardon whatsoe'er thou art good

 xxxi
 "and ever despite

 canto 10

 argument
 another love assails bireno's breast
 leaves one night olympia shore
 logistilla's holy realm addressed
 rogero goes heeds alcina
 flying courser repossest
 hippogryph airy voyage bore
 whence good rinaldo's levy sees
 next angelica beholds frees



 loves fidelity
 yet proved constant hearts true
 lovers felicity
 sorrow faithful found famous crew
 olympia would give first degree
 rather second due
 well may say tale told
 truer love present times old

 ii
 many proofs clear
 made apparent zealand lord
 woman's faith certain could appear
 man though open heart explored
 fair truth spirits endear
 mutual love deserve reward
 bireno nay
 say kind olympia love

 iii
 nevermore deceive
 another woman
 made europe wide asia grieve
 fairer yet one fair
 rather quit light leave
 sweet taste touch hear see
 life fame beside aught
 precious truth styled thought

 iv
 bireno loved loved
 bireno love repay
 faith like still truth unmoved
 veered shifting sail another way
 ingrate service  cruel proved
 fair love faith say
 lips comprest eyebrows bent
 shall listen tale wonderment

 v
 shall heard impiety
 passing goodness meed
 woman take warning perfidy
 let none make lover's word creed
 mindless god things hear see
 lover eager desires speed
 heaps promises vows aye prompt swear
 afterwards winds disperse air

 vi
 promises empty vows dispersed
 air winds dissipated go
 lovers greedy thirst
 appeased fevered palates glow
 example offer versed
 prayers tears credit slow
 cheaply dear ladies mine wisdom bought
 wit other's cost taught

 vii
 first flower youth beware
 whose visage soft smooth sight
 past soon bred fancies
 like straw fire every appetite
 keen hunter follows hare
 heat cold shore mountainheight
 'tis taken esteems prize
 hurries flies

 viii
 practise striplings
 time treat austerity
 love revere homage
 pay service faithfully
 vaunt sooner victory
 mistresses shall servants grieve
 mourn see fickle love owed
 diverted elsewhere bestowed

 ix
 wrong opine
 cease love without
 lover like uncultivated vine
 would prop wind
 first pray decline
 fly volatile inconstant rout
 make choice riper fruits among
 yet gather long hung

 x
 daughter found said
 proud king ruled friesland state
 bireno's brother wed
 far rumour tells relate
 truth longing bireno bred
 sight food passing delicate

 xi
 gentle damsel past fourteen
 beautiful fresh like rose
 first opening bud seen
 vernal sun expands grows
 say bireno loved youthful queen
 little less blaze lit tinder glows
 ripened corn wherever envious hand
 foe amid grain cast brand

 xii
 bireno's bosom fed
 marrow burned weeping sore
 fate unhappy father dead
 saw bathed ceaseless tears deplore
 cold water cauldron shed
 shops short bubbling wave boiled
 raging rife olympia blew
 within breast extinguished new

 xiii
 feels bireno mere satiety
 loathes ill endures sight
 hope long deferred die
 fickle appetite
 yet till day prefixed satisfy
 fond desire feigns wary knight
 olympia less love adore
 seems pleasure explore

 xiv
 much caress
 cannot caress none
 see evil deed rather guess
 pity goodness done
 since raise comfort distress
 fortune's wheel beats changeful run
 never blamed glory oftener paid
  much young  harmless maid

 xv

 human judgment dimmed clouds obscure
 bireno's actions impious profane
 others reputed pure
 already stooping oars train
 loosed vessel port secure

 contented faithless knight
 supt unsuspecting cause dread

 long upon dame broke rest
 finding safe greenwood shade
 removed noise tranquil breast
 knowing lover beside laid
 thoughts cares molest
 olympia lap slumber profound
 sheltered bear dormouse sleeps sound

 xix
 lover false hatching treason lies
 stole bed silence knew
 slept clothes bundle ties
 raiment body threw
 issuing forth pavilion hies
 newborn wings towards crew
 roused unmoor without cry
 commands loosen thence put sea

 xx
 behind land left pine
 olympia yet slept woods among
 till gilded wheels frosty rhine
 aurora upon earth beneath flung
 old woe beside tumbling brine
 lamenting halcyons mournful descant sung
 'twixt sleep waking made strain
 reach loved bireno vain

 xxi
 one found dame arm withdrew
 tried yet one found spread
 arms sought anew
 either leg yet better sped
 fear banished sleep oped eyes view
 nothing widowed bed
 would keep couch fury sprung
 headlong forth pavilion flung

 xxii
 seaward ran visage tearing sore
 presaging certain plight
 beat bosom tresses tore
 looked moon shining might
 discover thing beside shore
 save shore thing sight
 calls bireno caverns round
 pitying grief bireno's name rebound

 xxiii
 far shore rose rock
 scooped breaker's beating frequently
 cliff hollowed underneath show
 arch overhung foaming sea
 olympia mind vigour bestow
 sprang frowning crest impetuously
 distance stretched favouring gale
 thence saw cruel lord's departing sail

 xxiv

 face snow cold white hue
 found strength rise
 guiding voice towards bark flew
 calling might unhappy dame
 calls often cruel consort's name

 xxv
 unavailing feeble note
 wept clapt hands agony
 "without freight" cried "thy ship float
  cruel dost thou fly swiftly 
 receive well  small hinderance thy boat

 raiment waving hand
 signed frigate return land

 xxvi
 loud wind sweeping ocean bears
 faithless stripling's sail across deep
 bears well shriek moan prayers
 sad olympia sorrowing steep
 thrice cruel dame prepares
 high rock amid waves leap
 water lifts length sight

 xxvii
 stretched bed upon face lay
 bathing tears "last night thee
 together two found shelter" say
 "alas two together
 rising false bireno cursed day

 repossess thing held dear
 love light cause incites dame aggrieved

 xlix
 choler never felt
 upon bosom fed
 hence made followers ply oar
 till white foam either bank shed
 deafening noise din o'er sea shore

 oh many battles success
 different hoped
 failed dame repossess
 thought lover flying shore
 ships even numberless
 ample ocean scarce navy bore
 vessels flames prey
 one bark escaped wretched fay

 lv
 alcina flies sad troop around
 routed taken burnt sunk remains
 lost rogero sorrow profound
 wakes breast pains
 bitter tears ever drowned
 child's loss night day complains
 bent end woes many sigh
 often laments cannot die

 lvi
 fairy dies overhead
 sun shall burn heaven preserve stile
 clotho moved cut thread
 touched grief funeral pile
 fair dido beneath steel bled
 haply like gorgeous queen nile
 mortal slumber would closed eye
 fairies cannot pleasure die

 lvii
 return eternal fame due
 leaving alcina trouble sore
 speak valorous rogero
 disembarked upon safer shore
 turned back upon waters blue
 giving god thanks pious lore
 dry ground landed made repair
 towards lofty castle planted

 lviii
 stronger bright show
 never yet mortal sight
 viewed stones ramparts glow
 rich carbuncle diamond bright
 like gems discourse
 would nature read aright
 must thither speed none elsewhere ween
 except perhaps heaven seen

 lix

 o'er every sort gem confessed
 man soul may see

 hence shall heed flattery
 yet wrongful censure depressed
 form lucid mirror eyes
 knowledge grows wise

 marvellous gems skill

 well contend mastery two
 'tis hard judge preference due

 green odoriferous shrubs seen grow

 lxii
 never place goodly tree
 grown except within gardens fine
 rose violet like quality

 canto 11

 argument
 assisted magic ring wears
 angelica evanishes view
 next damsel giant bears
 beneath arm bride rogero true
 beholds orlando shore repairs
 fell orc many damsels slew
 olympia frees spoils beast life
 afterwards oberto takes wife



 although feeble rein mid career
 oft suffice stop courageous horse
 'tis seldom reason's bit serve steer
 desire turn furious course
 pleasure reach like headstrong bear
 honeyed meal 'tis ill force
 scent tempting mess sup
 drop hangs upon luscious cup

 ii
 reason rogero shall withhold
 taking angelica delight 
 gentle maid naked hold

 xenocrates would chaste
 impatient child dropt shield spear

 vi

 doubts dream amaze
 hardly believes hand eyes
 softly mouth hoop conveys
 quicker flash cleaves skies
 bold rogero's sight beauty shrowds
 disappears sun concealed clouds

 vii
 yet still rogero gazed like wight distraught
 hurried fruitless speed
 recalled ring thought
 foiled astounded cursed little heed
 vanished lady sought
 ungrateful discourteous deed
 accusing stood wherewith repaid
 unfitting recompense generous aid

 viii
 "ungrateful damsel pay
 render service done" said
 "why rather would steal ring away
 welcome gift
 use may
 shield courser shall
 conceal beauteous cheer
 cruel though answering know hear"

 ix
 saying like one blind bootless care
 feeling way fount strayed
 often embraced empty air
 hoping embraced maid
 meanwhile far removed flying fair
 halted till cave conveyed
 formed mountain harbour rude
 spacious need supplied food

 x
 'twas aged herdsman one tended
 numerous troop mares made
 seeking pasture valley wended
 green grass fed freshening run
 stalls either side cave defended
 charge oppressive noontide sun
 angelica within livelong day
 unseen prying eyes prolonged stay

 xi
 evening refreshed rest
 food deemed course might renew
 certain rustic weeds body dressed
 different robes red blue
 green yellow purple accustomed vest
 various fashion shape hue
 yet habit misbecame
 looked fair noble dame

 xii
 phillis' neaera's praise forbear
 ye sing amaryllis cease

 awakened foolish dream last

 slipt bit winged horse
 towered soared air freer course

 xiv
 first ill addition grave sore
 lost bird rapid wing
 better mockery bore
 put maid deeper sting
 implants pains
 thought lost precious ring
 power much esteemed
 worth given lady love

 xv
 afflicted beyond measure shield
 cast shoulder newcased mail
 left seaside grassy field
 pursued way towards spacious vale
 beheld path wood concealed
 widest beaten dale
 far wound closest shades within
 ere right heard mighty din

 xvi
 heard din fearful clashing sound
 arms hurrying eager pace
 'twixt tree tree two furious champions found
 waging fierce fight close straightened place
 warring ground
 know neither showed regard grace
 one giant haughty cheer
 one bold gallant cavalier

 xvii
 covered shield sword one leaping sped
 thus defended
 lest twohanded mace upon head
 fall giant still offended 
 field lay horse already dead
 rogero paused strife attended
 straight wishes leant towards knight
 would fain see conqueror fight

 xviii
 yet would lend champion aid
 behold cruel strife stood nigh
 lo twohanded stroke giant made
 upon lesser warrior's casque
 mighty blow knight overlaid
 astound saw lie
 deal foe death helm untied
 warrior's face rogero spied

 xix
 sweet lady passing fair
 dearest bradamant rogero spies
 lovely visage helmet bare
 towards deal death giant hies
 advancing sword air
 sudden battle child defies
 wait new alarm
 takes halflifeless lady arm

 xxvi

 didst thou find place within human heart
 thee martial glory lost thee
 trade arms became worthless art
 ebb worth chivalry
 base often plays better part
 thee shall gallantry

 xxvii
 thee alas dead die
 many noble lords cavaliers
 war shall end italy
 afflicting drowned world tears
 said word err

 "oh" circassia's king cried roland dread
 "thy morion man let entreat

  "who would fool" monarch said
 "but indeed deem suit discreet
 lend thine shall less fit
 haply thee school lack wit"

 xlii
  "fools you" fierce ferrau replied
 "as wear helm delight

 canto 19

 argument
 medoro angelica's quaint hand
 healed weds bears catay
 length marphisa chosen band
 long suffering makes laiazzi's bay
 guido savage bondsman land
 impious women rule civil sway
 marphisa strives single fight
 lodges full night



 beloved one know
 top fortune's wheel seated
 since true faithless friends show
 equal faith glad estate greeted
 felicity changed woe
 flattering multitude turned fleeted
 loves master heart
 even death performs faithful part

 ii
 heart seen outward cheer
 court held sovereign grace
 lord little dear
 parts reversed would fill other's place
 humble man greater would appear
 first hindmost race
 medoro's faithful story said
 youth loved lord alive dead

 iii
 closest path amid forest gray
 save pursued youth forlorn
 schemes marred delay
 sore weight upon shoulders born
 place knew mistook way
 hid sheltering thorn
 secure distant mate
 greenwood shade lighter shoulders flew

 iv
 far cloridan advanced
 heard boy longer wind
 marked absence medore
 seemed heart left behind
 "ah negligent" moor
 exclaimed "so far beside blind
 medoro without thee fare
 know deserted thee where"

 saying wood disappears
 plunging maze hurried pace
 thither whence lately issued steers
 desperate death returns trace
 cries tread steeds hears
 word tread foemen chase
 lastly medoro voice known
 disarmed foot 'mid many horse alone

 hundred horsemen youth surround
 zerbino leads bids followers seize
 stripling like top boy turns round
 keeps among trees
 behind oak elm beech ash takes ground
 cherished load shoulders frees
 wearied length burden bestowed
 upon grass stalked load

 close warfare alpine hunters wage
 uncertain hangs shaggy care
 growls mingled sound love rage
 unsheath claws blood tushes bare
 would natural hate wrath beast engage
 love softens bids strife retire
 offspring watch amid ire

 viii
 cloridan aid knows
 medoro willingly would die
 would death forego
 foes one lifeless lie
 ambushed sharpest arrow bow
 fits directs true eye
 feathered weapon bores scotchman's brain
 lays warrior dead upon plain

 ix

 turned thither whence shot murderous reed
 meanwhile launched another stand
 new foe might weapon bleed
 made demand
 loudly questioned done deed
 arrow reached  transfixed wretch's throat

 "by thy god sir knight" exclaims "i pray

 xii
 "and needs must feed beast bird

 medoro thus suit grace preferred
 words  move mountain
 upon zerbino's mood kindness turned

 xiii
 churlish horseman band

 lance uplifting wounded overhand
 unhappy suppliant dainty breast
 zerbino cruel action scanned

 "nought shalt thou hear thy comfort assure
 isabel yielded breath

 scarcely heart found room within breast

 xci
 thinking thus journeyed way
 rogero stumbled upon sought
 middle track lay

 whither thirsty herd noon day

 rogero said " 'tis must provide

 xcv
 upon rogero's parting thence fell
 four good champions evil law
 made castle's lord sir pinnabel
 discomfited like men straw
  shield withdrawn  removed well

 xcvii

 faithless pinnabel sorely prest
 many times buried half blade

 "ah would were" maid replied
 "for haply would make thee change thy thought
 better knight thee horse doth ride
 vainly would match earth sought"
  "who tramples thus other's fame"  cried

 cheerful content fully blest
 would die since die upon thy breast

 lxxix
 "but since abandon thee prize

 companions often turned gaze
 marked rivalry might
 admiring upon bestowed praise
 rogero fixed sight

 horse rider bleeding dust
 heads others shoulders bore
 parted hips bleeding bust
 often blow cleft five
  doubt hears might distrust
 seeming falsehood bears impress 
 would say parforce say less

 xxiii
 good turpin knows tells true
 leaves men believe think right
 says rogero wondrous things
 hearing related would falsehoods slight
 thus marphisa matched hostile crew
 appears like ice like burning light
 rogero less marvel eyes
 marked valour surprise

 xxiv

 sufficed soul valour four
 better arms remained fled
 sharp goads heels wore
 happy courser well bested
 trot amble set little store

 wretched poor footsoldier's trade

 footman left muleteer
 moor took maganza took way
 one leaves prisoners one leaves gear

 last reached hill whose boundary height
 arragonese neighbouring frank divides
 thither directing aye course outright
 descending sun visage hides
 reached path upon rugged steep
 overhung valley dark deep

 lii
 chance encountered mid road
 two youths wood men drove
 ass along pathway load
 logs marking well scanty store
 brain poor orlando's head stowed
 called approaching knight threatened sore
 bidding stand aside else go back
 hindrance block common track

 liii

 save foot beast applied
 smote midbreast vigour fraught
  force exceeding every force beside 
 tost hight beholders thought
 bird air descried
 ass upon mountainsummit fell

 upon youths next sprang furious knight
 better luck wit one woodman shear
 tall cliff twice thirty yards height
 cast headlong downward fear
 moist patch brambles flight
 received amid grass bushes
 mischief safe stripling lit
 scratches face quit

 jutting fragment clung
 gain higher steep would strive
 hopes crags among
 keep fool may contrive
 feet orlando ere sprung

 stretching wide could strain
 stretched arms rent prey twain

 lvi

 falconer heron puller
 whose entrails plucks satisfy
 merlin falcon game pursue
 happy die
 risqued neck deep bottom
 rehearsed tale often turpin heard
 handed us wondrous word

 lvii

 steps across mountain plain
 seeking long path length descends
 towards south upon land spain
 way along beach wends
 near arragon beside rumbling main
 ever prompted phrensy rank

 lix
 different sight
 nought orlando surveyed
 time rage possest sprite
 gone naked forth sun shade
 born hot syene's site
 sands worship ammon paid
 nigh hills whence nile's full waters spin
 orlando borne dingier skin

 dishevelled hair woeful wise
 frightful beard cheek overgrown

 angelica trembling sore flown
 shrieking loud trembling dismaid

 lxii

 courser spurs pursuit gone
 naked faulchion sped
 cut thrust roland run
 shoulders hoped cleave head
 found madman's skin hard bone
 yea harder far steel harmed
 good orlando birth charmed

 lxiii
 back orlando felt beat
 turned turning youthful foe
 smote clenched fist force nought meet
  smote horse's head fearful blow
 skull smashed like glass courser fleet
 madman's furious stroke laid low
 breath orlando turned anew
 chased damsel flew

 lxiv
 speed angelica impelled mare
 whipt spurred evermore slow
 would esteem albeit palfrey
 yet faster shaft dismist bow
 ring thought upon fair
 placed mouth failed virtue
 putting lips like light
 extinguished puff past sight

 lxv
 fear stript
 finger shaken seat
 rather palfrey tript
 neither surely weet
 angelica 'twixt lips slipt
 virtuous ring hid visage sweet
 stirrups lost tumbling form sell
 reversed upon sand lady fell

 lxvi
 two inches short fallen prey
 upon would pounced orlando near
 would crushed furious way
 kind fortune saved peer
 let theft purvey
 palfrey whilere

 chased swift orlando scours shore

 lxvii

 follow mad orlando's rear
 whose rage fury nevermore subside
 wroth angelica disappear
 beast along sands hied
 aye gaining mare career

 grasps secures rein

 lxviii
 orlando seizes delight
 man might seize damsel fair
 bit bridle adjusts aright
 springs back o'er seabeach bare
 many miles impels palfrey's flight
 without repose pause
 ever sell bridle displaced
 let grass heartening forage taste

 lxix

 head heels rider went
 harmed felt tumble aright
 shoulder slipt lay foully shent
 long bear thence orlando thought
 end upon shoulders hent
 bottom climbed thus loaded sore
 carried three bowshots' length

 lxx
 next felt weight irksome grow
 put lead rein
 followed limping gait slow
 "come on" orlando cried cried vain
 could palfrey gallop go
 ill would satisfy mood insane
 halter head last unloosed
 wherewith hind offfoot madman noosed

 lxxi
 'tis thus comforts drags mare
 may follow ease led
 whiles despoiled flesh whiles hair
 scathed stones ill road o'erspread
 length misused beast wear tear
 rude rocks suffering sore lies dead
 orlando nought slaughtered mare regards
 anywise headlong course retards

 lxxii
 drag palfrey ceased though dead
 continuing still course towards west
 sacked hamlet farm stead
 whenever hunger distrest
 aye glut meat bread
 fruit every one force opprest
 one hand slain one foully shent
 seldom stopt ever onward went

 lxxiii
 much little less would knight
 love damsel hide
 wretch discerns black white
 harms would help curse betide
 wonderworking ring eke wight
 gave lady full pride
 since roland would venge scorn
 thousand borne

 lxxiv
 would orlando possest
 women ground
 one ingrates best
 ounce goodness found
 meet let hearer rest
 ere strained chords return faltering sound
 may less tedious deem rhyme
 defer story till another time

 scarce marphisa started plain
 intent fell mischief sword
 bradamant couched golden spear
 yet damsel overthrew
 yet bradamant though blest might main
 much stronger two
 flung maid every
 power lance's thrust

 xxiv
 knights knights upon side
 say forth issuing city go
 towards field strife divide
 squadrons either foe
  half league one another wide 
 seeing knight mighty prowess show
 knight otherwise knew
 warrior christian crew

 xxv
 troyano's generous son espied
 band approaching citywall
 due defence would every means provide
 every peril every case forestall
 orders many take arms ride
 forth ramparts monarch's call
 rogero goes armour cased
 balked battle marphisa's haste

 xxvi
 enamoured youth beating heart intent
 stood issue view
 dear cousin fearing event
 well marphisa's valour knew
  beginning would say  bent
 mischief fiercely closed furious two
 duel's turn stripling eyes
 stands amazed stupid surprize

 xxvii
 saw unfinished fight
 first onset like justs whilere
 misdoubting strange accident sprite
 sore vexed remained cavalier
 either maid wished well youthful knight
 loved alike dear
 stripling's love fury fire
 'twas rather fondness desire

 xxviii
 rogero could honour
 willingly warriors would divide
 companions fear view
 victory king charles's knight abide
 esteeming better two
 break turn arms aside
 upon part christian foes
 advance divisions come blows

 xxix
 side rings alarm
 camps sounded every day
 bidding unmounted mount unarmed arm
 standards seek without delay
 separate flags squadrons swarm
 one shrilling trump heard bray
 rattling notes riders call
 rousing foot beat drum ataball

 xxx
 fierce thought could think 'twixt either host
 kindled fell sanguinary fray
 daring damsel fair dordona's boast
 sore vexed troubled affray
 cannot compass covets
  marphisa avenging steel slay 
 amid medley flies
 hoping see youth sighs

 xxxi
 eagle argent shield blue
 recognized rogero mid rest
 eyes thought intent stops view
 warrior's manly shoulders breast
 fair face movements full graceful shew
 maid mickle spite possest
 thinking another joys stripling's love
 thus speaks sovereign rage fury move

 xxxii
 "shall another kiss lips bright
 sweet fair lips lost
 ah never shall thee delight
 mine other's shalt thou
 rather die alone despite
 hand slay thee
 lose thee least hell
 thee eternity may dwell

 xxxiii
 "if thou slay'st good reason
 comfort vengeance obtain
 edicts equity
 death causes death ordain
 since justly unjustly die
 deem thine equal pain
 seeks life alas shall spill
 thou loves worships thee wouldst kill

 xxxiv
 "my hand hast thou hardiment
 rive steel bosom foe
 many times death shent
 faith love peaceful show
 take life consent
 even pity cruel woe
 dare valiant heart impious man slay
 let death thousand deaths appay"

 xxxv
 said spurred amid throng
 first  "defend thee false rogero"  cried
 "no power spoil wrong
 done virgin heart shalt thou take pride"
 hearing voice hostile ranks among
 deems  truly deems  hears bride
 whose voice youth remembers wise
 mid thousand would recognize

 xxxvi
 meaning well divine
 weening speech would blame
 broke pact  design
 occasion failure proclaim 
 desire parley made sign
 vizor closed already came
 raging grieved intent vengeful hand
 fling youth haply upon sand

 xxxvii
 rogero saw offended
 fixed firmly arms seat
 rests lance holds stave suspended
 shall harm meet
 smite pierce child intended
 pitiless inflamed furious heat
 courage sees near
 fling outrage spear

 xxxviii
 void effect 'tis thus lances go
 well since love burning dart
 tilting one foe
 lanced enamoured warriors midheart
 unable child aim blow
 lady spent rage part
 mighty deeds achieved fame earn
 overhead circling heavens shall turn

 xxxix
 three hundred men affray
 little space dismounted lie
 alone warlike damsel wins day
 alone moorish people fly
 rogero circling threads way
 says "unless speak die
 hear love heaven  done done
 alas ever mine approach ye shun"

 xl
 soft southern breezes unpent
 tepid breath seaward blow
 snows dissolve torrents find vent
 ice hard erewhile seen flow
 entreaties brief lament
 rinaldo's sister's heart softened
 forthwith compassionate pious grown
 anger fain made hard stone

 xli
 would could nought replied
 spurred aslant ready rabicane
 signing rogero rode wide
 could wend embattled train
 sheltered valley turned aside
 wherein embosomed little plain
 mid lawn wood cypress grew
 whose saplings one stamp appeared view

 xlii
 within thicket white marble wrought
 proud monument newly made
 makes enquiry taught
 brief verses therein laid
 lines methinks took little thought
 fair bradamant arriving glade
 rogero spurred courser pursued
 overtook damsel wood

 xliii

 sought valiant champion
 first onset cast mead

 xliv

 xlv

  "perfidious enough said
 know thy perfidy fame

 wot drive thee thine aim

 xlvi
 angrier venomed viper bound
 saying upon marphisa flies
 plants well spear astound
 fell backward champaigne guise
 nigh half helm buried ground

 nay best encounter withstand
 yet helmed head smote sand

 xlvii

 half buried lies murderous blow
 away enchanted lance damsel flings

 xlviii

 inflamed second heat
 easily reversed upon plain
 hears vain exclaim vain entreat
 rogero beholds strife pain
 blinded pair spite rage
 desperate fury battle wage

 xlix
 halfsword's engage struggling foes
  stubborn mood  shortened brand
 still approach fiercely close
 cannot choose grapple hand hand
 sword longer needful foregoes
 either new means mischief planned
 rogero implores earnest suit
 supplicates twain little fruit

 l
 entreaties unavailing found
 youth prepared force part two
 poniards snatched away ground
 beneath cypresstree daggers threw
 weapons wherewith wound
 prayer threat interferes anew
 vainly since better weapons lack
 fists feet attack

 li
 rogero ceased task caught
 hand arm fiercely struggling pair
 till utmost pitch fury wrought
 fell marphisa's angry passions
 ample world esteemed nought
 child's friendship care
 plucked foe ran seize sword
 fastened next upon youthful lord

 lii
 "like discourteous man churl ye
 rogero disturb another's fight
 deed cried hand shall make ye rue
 intend shall vanquished both" knight
 sought fierce marphisa's fury subdue
 gentle speech full despite
 found inflamed disdain
 parley waste time pain

 liii

 seemed mars marphisa eye
 seemed infernal fury part
 'tis true youthful knight
 damsel put forth might

 lv
 knew virtues weapon well
 proof thereof knight erewhile made
 where'er falls parforce every spell
 annulled stronger virtue stayed
 hence rogero smote never fell
 upon edge point still blade
 descended flat long rule observes
 yet patient purpose swerves

 lvi
 mighty stroke marphisa sped
 meaning cleave brainpan foe
 raised buckler defend head
 sword smote upon bird snow
 broke bruised shield spell bested
 arm rang astounded blow
 aught hector's mail sword stopt
 whose furious blow would left arm lopt

 lvii

 whereat designed strike savage fair
 scarce left arm good rogero rear
 scarce shield blazoned bird upbear

 canto 39

 argument
 agramant breaks pact overthrown
 forced fair france afric forego
 meanwhile astolpho biserta's town
 numerous host besieged foe
 hazard arrives bold milo's son
 duke instructed
 restores wits sea dudon meet
 king agramant sore annoys fleet



 fell woe rogero weighs
 harder bitterer pain forsooth none
 upon flesh spirit preys
 two deaths scaping one
 strife o'erlaid rinaldo slays
 bradamant rinaldo outdone
 killed brother well knew
 hate death hateful would ensue

 ii
 rinaldo unimpeded thought
 strove ways rogero o'erthrow
 fierce despiteous whirled axe sought
 arms head wound foe
 rogero circled caught
 upon weapon's shaft coming blow
 ever smote aye strove smite
 injure least montalban's knight

 iii
 led paynim bands
 unequal seemed fierce assay
 slowly young rogero plied hands
 well rinaldo kept child bay
 troubled face king afric stands
 sighed breathless gazed upon fray
 blame ill counsel flung
 king sobrino's head sprung

 iv
 meanwhile weird melissa  font
 wizards enchanters know 
 art transformed female front
 taken argier's mighty shape show
 gesture appeared rodomont
 seemed like dragon's hide go
 belied sword shield

 v
 towards troyano's mournful son guide
 form courser familiar sprite
 troubled visage loudly cried
 "my liege foul oversight
 stripling boy peril yet untried
 gaul stout famed fight
 champion fierce strife make
 afric's realm honour stake

 vi
 "let battle pursued lord
 'twould cost moorish cause dear
 let sin broken faith forfeit word
 fall upon rodomont take thou fear
 let show metal sword
 hundred stands here"
 upon agramant counsel wrought
 king pressed forward without thought

 vii
 thinking monarch algiers
 pact little care
 would rate thousand cavaliers
 high handed aid
 hence steeds reinedin spurred hence levelled spears
 seen one short instant
 melissa hosts mixed fight
 false phantoms vanishes sight

 viii

 faith disturbed duel see
 longer strive fight pledge word
  yea put aside hostile injury 
 neither part draw sword

 broke pact established twain
 young agramant aged charlemagne

 ix

 torments mourns despair
 whines strives leash turns

 watched rich prize throughout day
 obliged treaty refrain
 laying hands upon costly prey
 sore lamented grieved vain
 gazing longing eyes array
 seeing truce treaty broke among
 moorish squadrons rejoicing sprung

 xii
 marphisa piercing first victim's breast
 two yards beyond back lance pass
 briefer time 'tis exprest
 broke sword four helms flew like glass
 less bradamant upon rest
 spear reduced pass

 doubling marphisa's score yet none slew

 xiii

 maids one another near
 whither fury drives martial pair
 dividing moorish ranks career
 could several warrior's name declare
 stretched champaign golden spear
 reckon every head marphisa left

 xiv

 uproot hard rocks mighty trees grow

 scowering field separate courses made
 huge havock moors pursue
 one couched lance one lifted blade

 foot furious peer would throw
 astolpho others seize arms waste

 warriors thus orlando flung parforce

 shakes plunges

 astolpho bade hence prisoner bear
 would heal said warrior's brain

 lvi
 seven times astolpho makes wash knight
 seven times plunged beneath brine goes
 cleanse away scurf blight
 stupid limbs visage grows

 stop mouth wherewith puffs blows
 save nostrils would astolpho leave
 passage whence count might air receive

 lvii
 valiant astolpho prepared vase

 mystic cup withal oh wondrous case
 unsettled mind ancient seat regained
 glorious reasonings yet clear
 lucid waxed wisdom whilere

 lviii
 one seems troubled sleep see
 abominable shapes horrid crew
 monsters cannot
 seems strange unlawful thing
 yet marvels slumber free
 recovered senses play true
 good orlando made sound
 remains yet full wonder astound

 lix
 aldabelle's brother monodantes' son

 turned restless eyes

 marvelling naked cast
 wherefore tethered neck heels fast

 lx

 lxi

 lxii
 meanwhile bardino told brandimart
 monodantes good sire dead
 brother gigliantes' part

 lxiii
 said mid many reasons prest

 lxiv
 upon following day provence steer
 shipping danish dudon's care
 duke retired anglantes' peer
 heard lord warfare's state declare
 prest siege biserta far near
 let good england's knight honour wear
 every vantage astolpho still
 guided orlando's

 lxv
 order taken attack town
 huge biserta side
 first assault walls
 orlando palm divide
 lament shall leave unshown
 since short time lay tale aside
 meanwhile fierce overthrow
 moors received france pleased know

 lxvi
 well nigh abandoned royal lord
 worst peril arles
 gone many paynim horde
 sage sobrino king spain
 deemed land unsafe aboard
 barks sought refuge numerous train
 barons cavaliers served moor
 moved example put shore

 lxvii
 yet royal agramant fight maintains
 longer make stand
 turns combat directly strains
 arles far remote upon strand
 rabican pursues flowing reins
 aymon's daughter drives heel hand
 would slay often crost
 martial maid rogero lost

 lxviii
 marphisa desire stirred
 thoughts tardy vengeance placed
 dead sire fiercely spurred
 made hot courser feel rider's haste
 neither martial maid amid herd
 flying moors well monarch chased
 o'ertake swift retreat
 first arles aboard fleet

 lxix
 two fair generous pards crag
 together dart stretch across plain
 perceive vigorous goat stag
 nimble quarry pursued vain
 ashamed chase lag
 return repentant high disdain
 sigh return damsels two
 paynim king safety view

 lxx
 yet therefore halt fury go
 amid crowd flies possest dread
 feeling every blow
 many never uprear head
 evil pass brought broken foe
 safety even fled
 since agramant sure retreat gain
 bade shut citygate faced plain

 lxxi
 bade rhone break bridges
 unhappy people ever held cheap
  weighed tyrant's want wears crown 
 worthless herd goats silly sheep
 sea river drown
 blood thirsty fallows steep
 franks prisoners made many slew
 ransom battle

 lxxii
 great multitude either train
 christened paynim killed last fight
 though unequal parts slain
 far saracens killed flight
 hands redoubted damsels twain
 signs even day remain sight
 hard arles sleeps lazy rhone
 plain rising sepulchres strown

 lxxiii
 meanwhile heavy ships deepest draught
 king agramant made put forth sea
 leaving barks port  lightest craft 
 would aboard navy flee
 stays two days stragglers waft
 winds wild contrary
 third day sail give command
 trust make return africk's land

 lxxiv
 royal marsilius fatal hour
 fearing costs fall upon spain
 clouds big tempest lower
 end burst upon fields grain

 lxxv
 king agramant sails africk bent
 barks illarmed almost empty go
 empty men full discontent
 threefourths perished foe
 cruel weak proud shent
 king still happens like woe
 hate privily fear
 fury presence mute appear

 lxxvi
 yet sometimes two three lips unclose
  knot friends relies 
 pent choler rage expose
 yet agramant beneath illusion lies
 love pity overflows
 befalls still espies
 false faces hears voices applaud
 nought adulation lies fraud

 lxxvii
 biserta's port host land
 sage king africa's intent
 sure news shore nubia's band
 held far meant
 steer moorish squadron strand
 steep rugged descent

 forthwith people broken dismaid

 lxxviii

 willed fleet leaves greenwood tree
 produced upon beach wondrous guise

 meet king night surprise
 dark dismal hour amid crew

 lxxix

 would believed said
 hundred barks sprung one small bough
 hence africa king weighed
 fearing encounter hostile prow
 watchmen tops spy

 lxxx
 `twas ships england's peer supplied
 dudon manned good armed crew
 see moorish fleet eventide
 strange armament forthwith pursue
 assailed unawares far wide
 among barks grapplingirons threw
 linked chains opponents clung
 known moors foemen tongue

 lxxxi
 bearing impelled winds blow
 propitious danish chief's intent
 weighty ships shocked paynim foe
 many vessels bottom went
 taxing wits hands work woe
 fire sword stones christians shent
 ships wide ruin pour
 like tempest never vext sea

 lxxxii
 bold dudon's men unwonted might
 daring imparted high
 since hour come paynims requite
 one ill deed far nigh
 moors pestilently gall smite
 agramant finds shelter sky
 thick clouds whistling arrows strike
 around gleam hook hatchet sword pike

 lxxxiii
 king hears huge heavy stones descend
 charged machine thundering engine sent
 falling poop prow broadside rend
 opening ravening seas mighty vent
 furious fires offend
 fires quickly kindled slowly spent
 wretched crews would fain danger shun
 ever direr peril run

 lxxxiv
 one headlong plunged pursued fire sword
 perished mid waters one wrought
 faster arms feet passage oared
 barque already overfraught
 repulsed wretch fain would board
 whose hand importunately sought
 clamber grasped side lopt arm
 body stained wave lifeblood warm

 lxxxv
 save life i' waters thought
 worst perish less pain
 since swimming profited caitiff nought
 perceived strength courage drain
 hungry fires refuge sought
 fear drowning hurries back
 grasps burning plank dread
 dying either death sped

 lxxxvi
 vainly sea resorts spear

 stone arrow following rear
 permit craven make little way
 haply yet delights ear
 'twere well wisely done end lay
 rather harp upon theme long

 xxxvii
 "what victory lord" sobrino cries
 "could better thy death christian cheer
 whence might hope joy quiet wise
 fair africa annoyance clear
 thy yet alive hope denies
 hence shall evermore cause fear
 well foeman knows save thou art gone

 xxxviii
 "thy subjects thy death deprived

 fair conquest roland's blade
 sansonet astolpho make great cheer
 yet mirth warriors would made
 brandimart perished hear
 dead joy allayed
 troubled visage clear
 tidings woe
 unhappy flordelice shall show

 clv
 night preceding illomened day
 flordelice dreamed vest sable grain
 made husband array
 woven hand worked pain
 eyes sprinkledover lay
 ruddy drops guise pattering rain
 worked lady thought
 grieved seeing wrought

 clvi
 seemed say "yet lord
 command make sable hue
 wherefore stained dye
 mode strange view"
 dream draws evil augury
 thither eve tidings flew
 concealed astolpho dame
 till sansonetto came

 clvii
 entered sees show
 joyful triumphs without word
 without hint indicate woe
 knows longer living lord
 gentle heart riven
 harassed eyes light abhorred
 every sense astound
 like one dead sank upon ground

 clviii
 hair life returns
 fastens hand lovely cheeks
 repeating beloved name vain
 force scorn fury wreaks
 uproots tears locks pain
 like woman smit evil demon shrieks
 bacchante horn's rude sound
 erewhile seen run restless round

 clix
 one prayer
 made knife wherewith heart smite
 aboard pinnace would repair
 brought corse either paynim knight
 would either lifeless
 cruel scathe vent fierce despite
 would seek lord till side
 rested weary search died

 clx
 "ah wherefore brandimart let thee
 without wend dire emprize
 ne'er thy departure see
 flordelice aye followed thee" cries
 "well aided mightest thou
 thee still kept eyes
 gradasso came behind thee
 thee might succoured single cry

 clxi
 "and haply nimbly might made
 stroke might caught
 head buckler stayed
 little ill dying would wrought
 anyhow shall die  debt paid 
 melancholy death profit nought
 died defending thee strife
 could better bestowed life

 clxii
 "even averse hard destiny
 heaven's host thee sought aid
 least tears bathed thy visage
 last kiss thereon least laid
 ere amid blessed hierarchy
 thy spirit mixt `depart'  said 
 `in peace wait thy rest
 where'er thou art swiftly shall repair'

 clxiii
 "is brandimart reign
 whose honoured sceptre thou wast take
 thee dommogire thy fair domain
 thus went thus welcome dost thou make
 alas hope today thou renderest vain
 ah designs fell fortune dost thou break
 ah wherefore fear since lot blest
 lost lose well worthless rest"

 clxiv
 repeating plaint spite
 fury waxed despair
 made new assault upon tresses bright
 fault wholly hair
 wildly hands together doth smite
 gnaw nails lip bosom tear
 return roland peers
 bemoans melts tears

 clxv
 roland olivier much requires
 leech's care anguish allay
 worthy place desires
 much wherein sir brandimart lay
 steers lofty mountain fires
 brightens night smoke obscures day
 wind blows fair starboard hand
 widely distant lies land

 clxvi
 fresh wind favour blows
 loose hawser close day
 heaven silent goddess shows
 shining horn guide way
 following morn rose
 pleasant shores round girgenti lay
 roland orders ensuing night
 needful funeral rite

 clxvii
 saw order duly done
 westering sun's fair light spent
 many nobles neighbouring town
 invital girgenti went
  shore torches blazing
 sounding wide cries loud lament 
 thither returned late life bereft
 friends beloved life death left

 clxviii
 stands bardino weeping o'er bier
 age's heavy burden bows
 tears shipboard shed whilere
 might well wept away eyes brows
 upbraiding skies stars cavalier
 like lion whose veins fever glows
 roars wreathes wayward hands within
 hoary hair rends wrinkled skin

 clxix
 upon paladin's return cry
 redoubled mourning louder grew
 orlando corse approached nigh
 speechless stood awhile friends view
 pale eve acanthus' dye
 lily's plucked morn drew
 heavy sigh warrior dead
 fixing stedfast eyes county said

 clxx
 "o comrade bold true liest slain
 dost live heaven know
 rewarded life thy glorious gain
 neither heat cold take woe
 forgive thou beholdest complain

 clxxi
 "alone without thee nought may
 ever possess without thee please
 still thee tempest affray
 ah wherefore thee calm ease
 right sore must trespass since clay
 follow thee soul release
 thy troubles still bore burden
 partner thy guerdon

 clxxii
 "thine guerdon mine loss thy gain
 single single woe

 grieving france italy oh
 lord uncle charlemagne
 paladins lament blow
 christian church empire moan
 whose best defence thee overthrown

 clxxiii
 "oh thy foes death thee
 freed henceforward alarm fear
 alas strengthened paynimry
 hardiment cheer

 even mourning outcries hear

 every hope lies low

 clxxiv
 "yet one comfort flordelice followed
 loss us reft remain
 death surpassing glory hallowed
 die living warriors fain
 decii curtius rome's forum swallowed
 cordus vaunted grecian train

 clxxv
 sad laments orlando made
 white friars black gray
 clerks two two arrayed
 behind long procession took way
 god departed prayed

 torches reared

 beadsmen black trailing gown

 clxxviii

 burning torches like others bore
 mantled say rather closely muffled goes
 roland sables next evermore
 eyes suffused red weeping shows

 clxxx

 verse wherewith sir brandimart mourned
 mantles black purple given away
 many torches eve burned

 clxxxi

 canto 44

 argument
 rinaldo sister child hath plight
 marseilles warrior gone
 crimsoned wide field fight
 therein arrives king otho's valiant son
 paris thence squadron bright
 mighty grace wonderous honour done
 child departs resolved leo's slaughter
 duke aymon betrothed daughter



 poor abode mid paltry walls bare
 amid discomforts calamities
 often friendship heart united
 better roof lordly guise
 royal court beset snare
 mid envious wealth ease luxuries
 charity spent every side
 friendship unless counterfeit spied

 ii
 hence ensues peace pact
 princes peers shortlived wear
 today king pope emperor leagued seen
 marrow deadly foemen
 outward mien
 heart spirit sovereigns bear
 since wholly careless right wrong
 profit look faithless throng

 iii
 though little prone friendship sort
 loveth dwell
 talk earnest sport
 speak except cozening tale tell
 yet together poor resort
 prisoned fortune false fell
 friendship speedily discern
 though years past yet learn

 iv
 retreat ancient eremite
 could bind inmates faster noose
 true love firmly unite
 could domes courtiers use
 enduring knot tight
 nothing short death tie could loose
 benignant hermit found crew
 whiter heart swans outward hue

 v
 kind found courteous lore
 untainted iniquity wise
 painted nevermore
 go forth unless concealed disguise
 injuries among done
 memory comrades buried lies
 could better love one womb
 one seed warlike band come

 vi
 rinaldo lordly train
 rogero graced lovingly caressed
 well listed plain

 courteous humane
 knight e'er laid lance rest
 much many ground

 vii
 fearful risk richardetto run

 time spanish monarch's hest done
 daughter seized bed
 delivered either son
 good duke buovo erewhile said
 bertolagi maganza's hand
 evil followers paynim band

 viii
 honour hold rogero dear
 sir rinaldo thought debt constrained
 could done whilere
 warlike lord sorely grieved pained
 one africk's monarch couched spear
 one cause royal charles maintained
 rogero christian knew
 could done would

 ix
 welcome endless proffers side
 honour good rogero paid
 prudent sire kindness spied
 opening made pass assayed
 "and nothing else remains" hermit cried
 "nor trust counsel gainsaid
 conjoined friendship shall
 yet faster coupled affinity

 x
 "that two bright progenies none
 equal illustrious blood
 race may spring brighter sun
 shine wherever bright sun may glow
 years ages run
 course yet endure fairer show
 orbits burn heavenly fires
 instruction god inspires"

 xi
 discourse pursuing still seer
 spake moves rinaldo rede
 give sister cavalier
 albeit either small entreaties need
 together orlando olivier
 counsel lauds would union speed
 king charles aymon hopes approve
 france welcome wide wedded love

 xii
 spake together peer paladine
 knew aymon king charles' consent
 unto grecian emperor constantine
 give gentle daughter intent
 young leo lofty line
 heir hope crave maid sent
 warmth praises worth inspired
 love unseen leo fired

 xiii
 hath aymon answered alone
 cannot conclude thereon sort
 first hath spoken son
 rinaldo absent charles's court
 winged haste deems thither run
 joy kinsman high report
 high regard bears heir
 nought resolve till thither repair

 xiv
 good rinaldo father wide
 imperial practice knowing nought
 promised beauteous sister bride
 upon well roland's thought
 others harboured cell beside
 hermit wrought
 marriage 'twas peer's belief
 could choose pleasure clermont's chief

 xv
 day night following day
 great part sage monk warriors spent
 scarce mindful crew coming stay
 albeit wind blew fair intent
 impatient long delay
 one message warriors sent
 return barons urged sore
 parforce parted hermit hoar

 xvi
 child long banished stayed
 lone rock whereon waters roared
 farewell holy master made
 taught true faith anew sword

 xvii
 though enchanted sword better right
 would worn good anglantes' chief
 fearful garden might

 rogero faulchion bright
 received good frontino thief
 willingly thereof rest
 soon asked warrior repossest

 xviii

 clear skies gentle gales
 vow prayer patron makes moors
 pinnace marseilles
 safely harboured let chiefs remain
 till conduct astolpho train

 xix

 scarcely joyful tale astolpho knew
 seeing evermore fair france would
 secure mischief moorish crew
 homeward send king aethiopy
 devised together army

 xx

 xxvii

 sister would make rogero's bride
 olivier milo's son

 xxxvi
 duke aymon heard heir disdain
 without concert alone
 dared plight daughter fain
 would marry grecian emperor's son
 kingly reign
 nay ought call
 know little nobleness
 valued without wealth virtue less

 xxxvii
 beatrice wife despite
 arraigns son calls arrogant
 moves open way hidden sleight
 break rogero's match bradamant
 resolved tax every means might
 make empress wide levant
 firm purpose montalban's lord
 ought forego plighted word

 xxxviii
 beatrice believes highminded fair

 xxxix

 xlviii
 cruel thoughts afflicted maid torment
 rogero's mind enjoys repose
 albeit sad tidings vent
 yet city secret knows
 o'er humble fortunes makes lament
 enjoying good oppose
 unendowed riches reign

 xlix

 lii
 rogero said "if aymon disposed

 liii
 "but give without delay said

 grief signified

 less cruel woe known
 lamented sorrows

 lx
 sorrows said

 hence belief error head

 trustiest bowerwomen one day

 lxiii

 lxiv
 "for thou hire aids assault none

 nobility kingly crown
 dazzle silly vulgar train
 beauty puissant weak light

 lxv
 "thou hast cause amid thy griefs fear

 lxvi
 "ivory gem every hardgrained stone

 heart either's weal woe
 hour hour would hear

 mid gloomy shades rogero descried
 firm swallow food kind
 purpose turned aside
 die hunger designed
 weird melissa speedy aid supplied
 took road home forth issuing
 met grecian emperor's youthful heir

 xxii
 leo one one dispatched train
 followers far wide every bourn
 afterwards person went vain
 find warrior unicorn
 wise enchantress sell rein
 day equipt demon borne

 constantine's son encountered course

 xxiii
 "if ingenuous mien" cried
 leo "is soul's nobility
 corresponding fair outside
 inward goodness courtesy
 help comfort sir one provide
 best living knights see
 save ye help comfort quickly lend
 little distant latter end

 xxiv
 "the best knights die
 e'er donned sword buckler fair
 gentle warriors gone
 throughout world yet living
 simply courteous deed none

 come sir love heaven try

 xxv
 suddenly came leo's mind
 knight parlayed
 throughout land sought find
 seeking person came
 obeying would persuade
 pious work spurred behind dame
 thither led tedious way
 nigh reduced death stripling lay

 xxvi
 found rogero fasting food
 three long days broken pain
 knight could upon feet stood
 fall albeit unpushed ground

 begirt lay reclined plate chain
 pillow buckler made

 xxvii
 thinking injury done
 lady love  ingrate untrue

 o'erwhelmed height fury grew
 bit hands lips pouring
 cheeks tears unceasing ran
 passion wrapt troubled sprite
 leo melissa heard knight

 xxviii

 checks sighs checks trickling tears
 young leo halts hear speech intent
 lights courser towards steers

 rogero remains unsaid

 xxix

 greets brother's love stooping low
 neck encircles fast embrace

 xxx
 sweetest words young leo plied
 warmest love could show
 "let irk thee" child cried
 "to tell cause whence thy sorrows flow
 desperate evils man betide
 deliverance woe
 cause known bereft
 hope ever life left

 xxxi
 "much grieve thou wouldst hide thyself
 known thy faithful friend true
 bound thee
 knot never undo
 even beginning

 hope succour thee pelf
 friends following life

 xxxii
 "nor shun thy sorrow explain
 beseech thee leave try
 wealth avail free thee thy pain
 art cunning open force flattery
 assistance employed vain
 last relief remains thee die
 content awhile deed shun
 till thou canst shall first done"

 xxxiii
 said forceful prayer appealed
 gently benignly soothed moan
 good rogero could choose yield
 whose heart iron stone
 deemed unless lips unsealed
 foul discourteous deed done
 fain would replied made assay
 yet twice thrice ere words could find way

 xxxiv
 "my lord known

 "i wot thou like content wilt
 haply content die

 rogero repaid hate
 'tis many days since intent
 putting thee death court went

 xxxv
 "because would see promised bride
 borne thee duke aymon's love
 favour engaged upon thy side
 man purposes god
 disposes thy great courtesy well tried
 sore need fixt resolve move

 xxxvi
 "what time rogero unknown
 thou madest suit would obtain thee
 lady bradamant one
 demand heart soul
 whether thy wish rather mine
 sought content thou hast made see
 thine lady peace possess
 far mine prize thy happiness

 xxxvii
 "content thee deprived well
 worthless life deprive
 better without soul could dwell
 without bradamant remain alive
 never veins lifeblood swell
 canst thou legitimately wive
 vows erewhile us said
 two husbands wed"

 xxxviii
 filled gentle leo amaze
 stranger rogero knows
 lips brow unmoved stedfast gaze
 rooted feet like statue shows
 like statue man votaries raise
 churches acquittance vows
 deems courtesy high strain
 never done done

 xxxix

 xliii
 "the damsel thee due

 would thy death free woo
 hallowed bands wedlock clear
 wherein lady hath thee tied

 xliv
 "not bradamant would forego
 whatsoe'er world possess
 rather forfeit life ever know
 grief knight oppress
 thy distrust great cause woe
 since thou couldst dispose less
 thyself thou  rather apply
 succour  wouldst sorrow die"

 xlv
 words spake intent
 tedious verses recite
 refuting evermore argument
 might used answer knight
 said last "i yield content

 impious saracen forthwith slay

 cxl
 smiting twice thrice horrid front
 raising high could raise air
 dagger buried rodomont
 freed withal care
 loosed icy corse font
 fetid acheron hell's foul repair
 indignant spirit fled blaspheming loud
 erewhile earth haughty proud

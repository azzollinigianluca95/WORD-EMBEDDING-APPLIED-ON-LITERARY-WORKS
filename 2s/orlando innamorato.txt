 introduction



 many years since first entertained vague idea
 translating _orlando furioso_ circumstances little
 importance reader led recently undertake
 earnest work laid afterwards resumed
 instance distinguished friend odd coincidence
 indebted also suggestion another eminent person
 idea present translation _orlando innamorato_
 observe intended auxiliary
 first greater undertaking though need scarcely say
 story boiardo necessary prologue poem
 ariosto

 intention translated first mentioned work
 exactly upon model adopted tressan version
 french romances scheme afterwards executed much better
 success late excellent friend mr george ellis
 english work description consideration
 subject however induced imitate
 general plan illustrating compendious prose translation
 extracts without seeking add poignancy might
 give false idea tone original recollected
 stood different predicament either
 authors compare work one
 likely familiar readers 'specimens early
 english romances' originals composed spirit
 gravity hardly confused gay style
 translator therefore nobody misled vein
 pleasantry runs mr ellis's work sure
 exclusively ascribed author _rifacimento_
 however would possibly case
 _innamorato_ great measure humourous work
 might give false impression infusing different
 species wit distinguishes it�a
 consideration induced adopt scheme pursued
 following sheets

 project give mere groundplan gothic edifice
 boiardo upon small scale accompanied elevations
 sections chambers sought colour
 original speak plainly reader look
 mere story prose abridgement may form
 notion tone style stanzas
 interspersed

 _story_ indeed seems likely interest
 english reader took strong possession
 imagination milton refers apparent enthusiasm
 _innamorato_ _furioso_ whose apparent
 preference justifiable richer stream invention
 consummate art distribution legitimate titles
 admiration

 latter qualification especially boiardo however
 inferior poet must considered superior artist
 ariosto weaving complicated web successor
 curious observe much excels storyteller
 tales indeed ariosto want connexion among
 eyes essential defect many loose
 episodes may compared parallel streams flowing
 towards one reservoir separate independent
 channels boiardo contrary like waters
 however may diverge preserve relation
 parent river accession always seems necessary
 reunite previous discharging contents
 common restingplace short example may serve
 illustrate laid damsel _innamorato_
 relates rinaldo adventures two worthies named iroldo
 prasildo narration interrupted though good
 first appears insulated episode rinaldo
 however afterwards falls iroldo friend
 history thus resumed unites naturally
 paladin thus stories dovetailed one
 form mosaic striking nice union
 parts brilliancy colours

 boiardo's art though indeed cannot said excel
 ariosto conspicuous also direction strange
 undercurrent allegory pervades poem
 distribution stream story sort esoteric
 doctrines conveyed gives mysterious interest even
 imperfectly comprehend

 indeed case many fables odyssey
 even iliad allegory moreover always
 subservient poetry poetry never made subservient
 allegory remarkable piece judgment greek poet
 think well imitated boiardo ariosto
 neglect principle made allegory often
 offensive _faery queene_ spenser obtrusive nature
 well compared mr george ellis
 specimens early english poets ghost daylight
 moreover destructive character spenser's heroes
 mere abstract personifications virtue vice
 almost always know though actions
 often unnatural considered actions human beings
 hence never entertained pictures manners
 _faery queen_ form one great charms
 poems contrasting

 may however said justice ascribe
 picturesque effect allegory rather spirit
 age fabulist perhaps true
 early fable purely allegorical degrees mixed
 circumstances mixed character
 conducive poetical effect later age
 later process refinement greater tendency
 abstract allegory stript adventitious ornaments
 last forced upon us poetry painting sculpture
 unveiled unencompassed sort pleasing halo
 necessary give effect

 whether ascribe boiardo's success particular
 character age superior judgment
 think doubt fact think
 little difficulty conceding author upon
 grounds praise skill executing singular work
 architect

 extraordinary man matteo maria boiardo count
 scandiano native reggio modenese flourished
 beginning sixteenth century circumstances
 worthy mention tend explain
 may seem strange composition _innamorato_
 provincial character diction especially
 careless almost contemptuous tone jest
 earnest distinguishes poem doubtless
 account ugo foscolo observes ingenious critique
 italian romantic poets _quarterly review_* tells
 story tone feudal baron thus applying
 justly de balzac objected another says
 "qu'il s'est comport� dans son po�me comme un prince dans ses
 �tats c'est en vertu de cette souveraint� qu'il ne reconnoit
 point les lois et qu'il se met au dessus du droit commun"

 * article purporting review _whistlecraft's
 poem_ entitled _the monks giants_ _the court
 parliament beasts_

 speaking mode arranged work
 natural transition substance boiardo built
 shews strong internal evidence* taken main
 old french romances charlemagne rather
 italian works raised upon foundation hoole mentions one
 called _aspramonte_ &c uncertain date
 titles two others anterior _innamorato_
 one called _li fatti di carlo magno e dei paladini di francia_
 printed 1481 printed 1491 entitled _la
 historia real di francia che tratta dei fatti dei paladini e di
 carlo magno set libri_ indeed would seem deny
 boiardo dug mines would wish us believe
 compounded manufactured materials
 wrought least would appear drift
 one observes agramant sacripant gradassso
 names certain vassals scandiano means
 insinuate boiardo also indebted
 source fictions characters well might critic
 today contend author _monks giants_
 writes name _whistlecraft_ borrowed idea
 cause quarrel pulci given
 ridiculous modern names giants
 taken leaders amongst _dramatis person�_ romances
 _round table_ conferred "two leopards'
 faces" arms single knight perishes
 sir tristram's successful expedition

 * single circumstance cite
 appreciated every body would convince stories
 found _innamorato_ growth
 boiardo's century author age could imagined
 friendly ties alliance consanguinity christians
 paynims though fictions justified facts thus
 learn gibbon like relations existed greeks
 turks informed mr lockhart preface
 _spanish ballads_ work presents striking pictures
 manners passion spaniards moors need
 things surprise us though barriers separate
 christian mahomedan render impossible nations like
 individuals brought close constant
 intercourse whatever kind passions good bad must
 kindled contact

 boiardo apparently taken principal fictions
 romances charlemagne also resorted known
 quarries ransacked classical well romantic fable
 materials

 edifice constructed boiardo live
 finish soon underwent alteration repairs first made
 niccolo degli agostini later century second
 celebrated _rifacimento_
 translation composed produced francesco berni whose
 name given distinctive epithet style poetry
 excelled vulgarly supposed
 inventor

 man born poor noble parents small town
 tuscany entered church evidently
 disposition means livelihood though unqualified
 servitude discharge clerical duties spent
 better part life dependence appears however
 blessed vein cheerfulness seconded
 lively imagination enabled beguile wearisome nature
 occupations uncongenial
 left many monuments sonnets pieces _terza rima_ styled
 italian _capitoli_ consisting satires various species
 ludicrous composition titles many sufficiently
 attest whimsicality _capitoli sugli orinali
 sulle anguille_ _eulogy plague_ &c &c mode
 handled last subject give best
 insight character humour premised
 different persons gave preference different seasons�as
 poet spring reveller autumn�he observes
 one may well like season flowers
 fruits part preferred time plague
 backs predilection rehearsal advantages
 attending visitation observing man times
 free solicitations borrowers creditors safe
 disagreeable companions elbowroom church
 market said full possession
 natural liberty rung sorts changes
 theme nothing humorous details

 worked singular powers diction set
 great apparent facility style less remarkable
 music rythm richness rhyme happy boldness
 expression respect analogy though
 likeness berni dryden real merits
 therefore imperfectly estimated foreigners even
 generality countrymen many italians indeed
 consider berni mere buffoon english reader
 think less extraordinary hears lord glenbervie*
 observes think notes ricciardetto
 opinion entertained italy even regard
 ariosto

 * state lord glenbervie's sole authority
 however weighty one opinion probably current
 first knew italy imagine could hardly
 entertained present

 better reasons may seem palliate mistake real
 poetical character berni ariosto
 general description others nature
 peculiarly applicable case may observe
 first whoever indulges wit whatever species
 composition usually misjudged wit sight
 world overlays qualities author whatever
 act pursuit may engaged thus great english painter
 single walk distinguished various powers
 looked upon multitude mere caricaturist even
 caricature intended foil beauty
 orators reason sunk jesters opinion
 mob though may equally distinguished
 argumentative discussion pathetic effect

 particular circumstances tended fix
 character upon berni men delicate perception
 familiar expression still fewer yet nice feeling
 delicacies prosody

 untwisting links tie

 bold however dexterous use language
 rythm berni principally distinguished hence
 means works imperfectly understood
 majority readers object frequently mistaken
 cite illustration description storm
 sea often deemed burlesque
 poet would justly considered working fine effect
 unwonted means

 let us try question rules analogy men

 guided natural taste judgment lean upon rule
 direct infallible guide depending upon

 might cited prove widely different effects produced
 weapon differently wielded impressed
 notions laws verse specified
 knowing almost metrical rules
 alluded merely conditional italians***
 certainly almost english readers italian poetry suppose
 triple rhyme _la rima sdrucciola_ dactyl
 called us exclusively applied ludicrous
 composition italian double rhyme imagined
 english perhaps one cause berni's
 stanzas abound triple rhymes utterly
 misconceived england yet berni ariosto frequently
 employed _versi sdruccioli_ aimed bold
 pathetic effect though also undoubtedly used
 heighten comic satirical composition caro
 cotemporary berni even profuse triple rhymes

 another cause misconception already alluded

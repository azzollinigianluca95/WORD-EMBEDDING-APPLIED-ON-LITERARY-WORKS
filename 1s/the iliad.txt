 harangue among danaans fardarter bringeth woes upon
 forsooth would take goodly ransom damsel

 house yea prefer klytaimnestra wedded wife wise
 lacking beside neither favour stature wit
 skill yet give back better rather
 would see folk whole perishing make ye ready prize
 honour forthwith lest alone argives disprized
 thing beseemeth ye behold prize departing

 made answer fleetfooted goodly achilles "most noble son
 atreus men covetous shall greathearted achaians
 give thee meed honour know naught wealth common
 store spoil soe'er took captured cities hath
 apportioned beseemeth beg back folk
 nay yield thou damsel god achaians pay thee
 back threefold fourfold ever zeus grant us sack
 wellwalled town troyland"

 lord agamemnon made answer said "not wise strong

 outwit persuade dost thou wish thou mayest keep thy
 meed honour sit idle bereavement biddest give
 back nay greathearted achaians give meed suited
 mind recompense equalbut give

 odysseus' take unto wroth shall whomsoever
 come take counsel hereafter let us launch
 black ship great sea gather picked oarsmen set therein
 hecatomb embark chryseis fair cheeks let one
 counsellors captain aias idomeneus goodly odysseus
 thou peleides redoubtable men sacrifice us
 propitiate fardarter"

 achilles fleet foot looked scowling said "ah
 thou clothed shamelessness thou crafty mind shall
 achaian hearken thy bidding heart go journey
 fight foe amain reason trojan spearmen came

 sons achaians gave never win meed like unto thine
 achaians sack populous citadel trojan men hands bear
 brunt furious war apportioning cometh thy meed
 far ampler betake ships small thing yet
 fought weariness depart phthia
 seeing far better return home beaked ships
 minded dishonour draw thee thy fill riches wealth"

 agamemnon king men made answer "yea flee thy soul
 set thereon beseech thee tarry sake
 others side shall honour zeus lord
 counsel hateful art thou kings fosterlings zeus
 thou ever lovest strife wars fightings though thou
 strong yet ween gift thee god go home thy ships

 thee seeing phoebus apollo bereaveth chryseis ship
 company send back mine self go thy hut
 take briseis fair cheeks even thy meed honour
 thou mayest well know far greater thou shall
 another hereafter abhor match words mine rival
 face"

 said grief came upon peleus' son heart within
 shaggy breast divided counsel whether draw keen blade
 thigh set company aside slay atreides
 assuage anger curb soul yet doubted thereof
 heart soul drawing great sword sheath athene
 came heaven sent forth whitearmed goddess hera
 whose heart loved alike care stood behind
 peleus' son caught golden hair visible

 straightway knew pallas athene terribly shone eyes
 spake winged words said "why art thou come hither

 agamemnon son atreus yea tell thee deem shall even
 brought pass haughtinesses shall soon lose
 life"

 brighteyed goddess athene spake "i came
 heaven stay thine anger perchance thou wilt hearken
 sent forth whitearmed goddess hera loveth twain alike
 careth go cease strife let thine hand
 draw sword yet words indeed revile even shall come
 pass thus say thee shall fulfilled

 reason despite hold thou thine hand hearken us"

 achilles fleet foot made answer said "goddess needs
 must man observe saying twain even though wroth
 heart better way whosoever obeyeth gods
 gladly hearken"

 said stayed heavy hand silver hilt thrust
 great sword back sheath disobedient saying
 athene forthwith departed olympus gods
 palace aegisbearing zeus

 peleus' son spake bitter words atreus' son
 wise ceased anger "thou heavy wine thou face dog

 traditionsso shall mighty oath thine eyesverily shall
 longing achilles come hereafter upon sons achaians one
 wilt thou wise avail save thy
 grief multitudes fall dying manslaying hector shalt
 thou tear thy heart within thee anger thou didst wise
 honour best achaians"

 said peleides dashed earth staff studded golden
 nails sat atreides waxed
 furious midst rose nestor pleasant speech
 clearvoiced orator pylians whose tongue flowed
 discourse sweeter honey two generations mortal men already
 seen perish old time born nurtured
 goodly pylos king among third good intent made

 zeus apportioneth glory though thou strong goddess
 mother bare thee yet greater place king
 thou atreides abate thy fury nay even beseech
 thee let go thine anger achilles made unto
 achaians mighty bulwark evil war"

 lord agamemnon answered said "yea verily old man
 thou sayest according unto right fellow would
 others would lord king among captain
 wherein deem none hearken though immortal gods made
 spearman therefore put revilings mouth
 utter"

 goodly achilles brake answered "yea
 called coward man naught yield thee every matter
 howsoe'er thou bid others give thine orders play
 master thee deem shall obey moreover
 say thee thou lay thy heart know
 violence strive damsel's sake neither thee
 ye gave ye taken away else mine
 beside fleet black ship thereof shalt thou take anything bear

 idomeneus leader cretans answered "o thaos

 idomeneus leader cretans answered "i know

 answered hera oxeyed queen "shaker earth thyself
 thine mind take counsel whether thou wilt save aineias
 leave slain brave though achilles peleus' son

 withdraw thee whensoever thou fallest lest even contrary
 thy fate thou enter house hades achilles shall met
 death doom thou good courage fight among

 spoke left shown things
 quickly achilles' eyes purged magic mist stared
 wide eyes trouble spake unto proud soul "ha verily
 great marvel behold mine eyes spear lieth upon

 slay truly aineias likewise dear immortal gods
 howbeit deemed boosting thereof altogether vanity away

 thus spake urging trojans glorious hector called
 aloud proclaimed would go forth achilles
 "highhearted trojans fear peleus' son words could fight
 even immortals spear hard stronger
 far neither shall achilles accomplish talk part thereof
 accomplish part break asunder midst
 go forth though hands even fire yea though

 thus spake urging trojans raised spears

 sword alone devised grim work heart smote turned
 every way groaning went ghastly
 stricken sword water reddened blood

 fairhavened bay terror devoureth amain whichsoever

 crouched beneath precipitous sides hands weary
 slaughter chose twelve young men alive river atonement
 patroklos menoitios' son dead brought forth

 met son dardanid priam flight river

 unlookedfor bane came goodly achilles time sold
 wellpeopled lemnos sending ship board son

 flying secretly came father's house eleven days rejoiced
 among friends come lemnos twelfth
 god brought hands achilles send
 house hades though nowise fain go fleetfooted noble
 achilles saw bare helm shield neither spear

 wrath spake achilles great heart "ha verily great marvel
 behold eyes surely proud trojans

 man come back escaped pitiless fate though sold
 goodly lemnos neither hath deep hoary sea stayed
 holdeth many come spear's point

 thus pondered place came near amazed fain
 touch knees soul longed exceedingly flee evil death
 black destruction goodly achilles lifted long spear
 intent smite stooped ran caught
 knees spear went back stood ground
 hungering flesh men lykaon besought one hand
 holding knees held sharp spear
 loosed spake winged words "i cry thee mercy
 achilles thou regard pity thee fosterling
 zeus bonds suppliantship thy table first

 footsoldiers didst thou lay low even godlike polydoros thou
 smotest sharp spear go hard
 hope escape thy hands since god hath delivered
 thereunto yet one thing tell thee thou lay heart

 comrade gentle brave"

 thus spake noble son priam beseeching words
 heard voice implacable "fond fool proffer ransom

 soul spare men troy many took alive sold beyond
 sea none shall escape death whomsoever ilios

 lamentest thou patroklos dead better far thou seest

 thus spake other's knees heart unstrung let go
 achilles' spear sat hands outspread achilles drew
 sharp sword smote collarbone beside neck
 twoedged sword sank lay stretched prone upon
 earth blood flowed dark soaked earth seized
 achilles foot sent stream exulting
 spake winged words "there lie thou among fishes shall lick

 thus spake river waxed ever wroth heart

 made answer pelegon's noble son "highhearted son
 peleus askest thou lineage come deepsoiled paionia
 land far leading paionian men long spears
 eleventh morn since come ilios lineage

 thus spake defiance goodly achilles lifted pelian ash

 said steep bank drew bronze spear left

 flooded around eels fishes swarmed tearing gnawing
 fat kidneys achilles went charioted paiones
 still along eddying river huddled fear saw
 best man stress battle slain violently hands
 sword son peleus slew thersilochos mydon

 deepeddying river called unto wrath semblance man
 eddy's depth sent forth voice "o achilles thy might thy

 answered achilles fleet foot "so heavensprung

 thus saying set upon trojans like god unto apollo spake
 deepeddying river "out lord silver bow child

 said spearfamed achilles sprang bank leapt
 midst rushed furious wave stirred
 streams tumult swept many dead lay thick
 slain achilles land cast bellowing like

 eddies deep wide terribly around achilles arose tumultuous
 wave stream smote violently shield availed

 thus spake quickly poseidon athene came near stood

 thus spoken departed immortals toward

 said rushed tumult achilles raging high

 peleus hera cried aloud terror achilles lest great
 deepeddying river sweep away straightway called

 thus spake hephaistos made ready fierceblazing fire first
 plain fire blazed burnt many dead lay thick
 slain achilles plain parched bright water

 thus spake burnt fire fair streams bubbling

 cunning hephaistos violently afflicted unto hera earnestly
 beseeching her' spake winged words "hera wherefore hath thy son

 whitearmed goddess hera heard speech straightway

 thus said hephaistos quenched fierceblazing fire
 wave rolled fair riverbed

 rage xanthos overcome ceased hera stayed
 though wrath among gods fell grievous bitter
 strife hearts carried diverse breasts
 clashed together great noise wide earth groaned
 clarion great heaven rang around zeus heard sate upon olympus
 heart within laughed pleasantly beheld strife
 gods longer stood asunder ares piercer shields
 began battle first made athene bronze spear
 spake taunting word "wherefore dogfly dost thou match gods
 gods strife stormy daring thy great spirit moveth thee
 rememberest thou thou movedst diomedes tydeus' son wound
 thyself didst take visible spear thrust straight
 pierce fair skin therefore deem thou shalt pay

 thus saying smote dread tasselled aegis even
 lightning zeus overcomethereon smote bloodstained ares
 long spear giving back grasped stout hand stone
 lay upon plain black rugged huge men old time set
 landmark field hurled smote impetuous ares

 athene laughed spake winged words exultingly "fool
 even yet hast thou learnt far better thou claim
 thus thou matchest thy might mine thus shalt thou satisfy thy
 mother's curses deviseth mischief thee wrath

 thus said turned shining eyes aphrodite
 daughter zeus take hand lead away groaning continually
 scarce gathered spirit back whitearmed

 said whitearmed goddess hera smiled apollo

 miserably children noble wives"

 answered king apollo fardarter "shaker earth
 sound mind wouldst thou repute fight thee

 thus saying turned away felt shame deal blows
 father's brother sister upbraided sore queen wild

 fleest fardarter hast quite yielded poseidon victory
 given glory naught fond god bearest thou ineffectual
 bow vain let hear thee halls sire boast

 thus spake fardarting apollo answered angrily
 noble spouse zeus upbraided archer queen taunting words
 "how art thou fain bold vixen set thyself hard

 thus said leto gathered curved bow arrows fallen

 divine vesture quivered father kronos' son took
 asked laughing gently "who inhabitants

 book xxii

 achilles fought hector slew brought
 body ships

 thus throughout city scared like fawns cooling
 sweat drinking slaking thirst leaning fair
 battlements achaians drew near wall setting shields
 shoulders hector deadly fate bound abide place front
 ilios skaian gates son peleus spake phoebus
 apollo "wherefore son peleus pursuest thou swift feet
 thyself mortal deathless god thou hast even yet known
 god strivest vehemently truly thou regardest
 thy task among affliction trojans thou affrightedst
 gathered city thou heat wandered hither thou
 wilt never slay subject unto death"

 mightily moved spake unto achilles fleet foot "thou hast
 baulked fardarter mischievous gods thou
 hast turned hither wall else full many yet
 bitten dust ever within ilios come hast thou robbed
 great renown lightly hast saved thou hadst
 vengeance fear thereafter verily would avenge thee
 power"

 thus saying toward city gone pride heart rushing like
 victorious horse chariot runneth lightly full speed
 plain swiftly plied achilles feet knees
 old man priam first beheld sped across plain blazing
 star cometh forth harvesttime plain seen rays shine
 forth amid host stars darkness night star whose
 name men call orion's dog brightest yet evil sign
 set bringeth much fever upon hapless men even
 achilles' breast bronze gleamed ran old man cried
 aloud beat upon head hands raising high
 cry called aloud beseeching dear son gates
 standing hot battle achilles old man spake
 piteously unto stretching forth hands "hector beloved son
 pray thee await man alone none beside thee lest thou
 quickly meet thy doom slain son peleus since mightier
 far merciless man would gods loved even

 cruel pain go heartthe man hath bereft many valiant
 sons slaying selling captive faroff isles ay even
 twain children lykaon polydoros cannot see among
 trojans throng fastness sons laothoe bare
 princess among women yet alive amid enemy's host

 much goods gave old man famous altes child dead
 even house hades shall sorrow soul
 mother even us gave birth rest
 folk briefer sorrow thou die achilles' hand nay come
 within wall child thou preserve men women troy
 neither give great triumph son peleus thyself bereft
 sweet life compassion also helpless one still
 feel illfated father kronos' son bring naught
 grievous doom path old age seen full many ills
 sons perishing daughters carried away captive
 chambers laid waste infant children hurled ground terrible
 war sons' wives dragged away ruinous hands
 achaians last street door ravening dogs

 guard door drunk blood maddened heart
 shall lie gateway young man beseemeth even slain
 war torn sharp bronze lie field though
 dead yet honourable whate'er seen dogs
 defile hoary head hoary beard old man slain
 piteous thing cometh upon hapless men"

 thus spake old man grasped hoary hairs plucking
 head persuaded hector's soul mother turn
 wailed tearfully loosening folds robe
 hand showed breast tears spake winged
 words "hector child regard unto bosom pity
 ever gave thee consolation breast think dear child
 side wall drive back foe stand front meet
 merciless slay thee bed
 thy wife shall bewail thee dear child far away us
 ships argives swift dogs devour thee"

 thus wailing spake dear son beseeching sore yet
 persuaded hector's soul stood awaiting achilles
 drew nigh giant might serpent mountains upon den
 awaiteth man fed evil poisons fell wrath hath entered
 terribly glared coileth den
 hector courage unquenchable gave back leaning shining
 shield jutting tower sore troubled spake great
 heart "ay go within gates walls polydamas
 first bring reproach since bade lead trojans
 city ruinous night noble achilles arose
 regarded yet surely better far
 undone host wantonness ashamed men troy
 women trailing robes lest time worse man
 shall say 'hector trusting might undid host'
 speak would better far face achilles
 either slay go home die gloriously city

 promise helen possessions alexandros

 within wherefore doth heart debate thus might come unto

 youth maiden hold dalliance one another better join
 battle speed let us know upon us twain olympian

 thus pondered stood nigh came achilles peer
 enyalios warrior waving helm brandishing right shoulder
 pelian ash terrible spear around bronze
 flashed like gleam blazing fire sun ariseth
 trembling seized hector aware endured abide
 place left gates behind fled fear
 son peleus darted trusting swift feet falcon

 answered brighteyed goddess athene "o father lord
 bright lightning dark cloud thou hast said
 man mortal doomed long ago fate wouldst thou redeem back
 illboding death gods approve"

 unto answer spake cloudgathering zeus "be good cheer
 tritoborn dear child full earnest speak would fain
 kind thee seemeth good thy mind draw back"

 thus saying roused athene already set thereon
 crests olympus darted

 hector sped fleet achilles chasing vehemently
 mountains hound hunteth fawn deer started
 covert glens glades crouch baffle
 bush yet scenting hound runneth constantly
 find hector baffled peleus' fleetfooted son oft

 oft would achilles gain turn toward plain

 time utterly last wherein apollo came nigh
 nerved strength swift knees host noble

 father hung golden balances set therein two lots dreary

 midst poised hector's fated day sank fell

 brighteyed goddess athene standing near spake winged words
 "now verily glorious achilles dear zeus hope twain

 thus spake athene obeyed glad heart stood
 leaning bronzepointed ashenspear left came
 noble hector like unto deiphobos shape strong voice
 standing near spake winged words "dear brother verily fleet
 achilles doth thee violence chasing thee round priam's town swift
 feet come let us make stand await defence"

 answered great hector glancing helm "deiphobos verily
 aforetime wert thou far dearest brothers methinks shall
 honour thee even thou hast dared sake thou
 sawest come forth wall others tarry within"

 spake brighteyed goddess athene "dear brother
 truth father lady mother comrades around besought
 much entreating turn tarry greatly
 tremble heart within sore dismal grief
 fight straightset resolve let sparing
 spears may know whether achilles slay us carry
 bloody spoils hollow ships whether might vanquished

 thus saying athene subtlety led come
 nigh onset one another achilles first spake great hector
 glancing helm "no longer son peleus fly thee
 thrice ran round great town priam endured await thy
 onset heart biddeth stand thee either slay
 slain come hither let us pledge us gods
 shall best witnesses beholders covenants entreat thee
 outrageous sort zeus grant outstay thee take
 thy life despoiled thee thy glorious armour
 achilles give back thy dead body achaians thou

 unto grim gaze spake achilles fleet foot "hector talk
 thou madman covenants men lions
 pledge faith wolves sheep one mind imagine
 evil continually impossible thee
 friends neither shall pledge us one
 shall fallen glutted blood ares stubborn god war
 bethink thee thy soldiership behoveth thee quit thee
 good spearman valiant man war longer way
 escape thee pallas athene straightway subdue thee
 spear one hour shalt thou pay back sorrows
 friends thou hast slain fury thy spear"

 said poised farshadowing spear hurled noble hector
 watched coming thereof avoided eye
 crouched bronze spear flew fixed
 earth pallas athene caught gave back achilles
 unknown hector shepherd hosts hector spake unto noble
 son peleus "thou hast missed wise yet godlike achilles
 thou known zeus hour doom though thou thoughtest
 cunning tongue art thou deceiver speech fearing thee
 might forget valour strength flee shalt thou plant thy
 spear reins drive straight breast set
 thee god hath given thee thy turn avoid spear
 bronze thou mightst take thy flesh would
 war lighter trojans thou wert dead thou art
 greatest bane"

 said poised longshadowed spear hurled smote
 midst shield peleus' son missed far
 shield spear leapt back hector wroth swift weapon
 left hand vain stood downcast second
 ashen spear called loud shout deiphobos white
 shield asked long spear wise nigh
 hector knew truth heart spake said "ay

 thus saying drew sharp sword flank hung great
 strong gathered swooped like soaring eagle
 darteth plain dark clouds seize tender lamb
 crouching hare hector swooped brandishing sharp sword
 achilles made heart filled wild fierceness

 among hollow ships comrade mightier far even left
 behind unstrung thy knees thee shall dogs birds tear
 foully funeral shall achaians make"

 faint breath spake unto hector glancing helm "i
 pray thee thy life knees parents leave dogs
 achaians devour ships take good store bronze gold
 gifts father lady mother shall give thee give
 home body back trojans trojans' wives give
 due fire death"

 unto grim gaze spake achilles fleet foot "entreat
 dog knees parents would heart's desire could bid
 carve eat raw thy flesh evil thou hast wrought
 surely none shall keep dogs thee even
 bring ten twenty fold ransom weigh
 promise even even priam dardanos' son bid pay thy
 weight gold even shall thy lady mother lay thee bed
 mourn son dogs birds shall devour thee utterly"

 dying spake unto hector glancing helm "verily know
 thee behold thee thou art destined persuade thee
 truly thy heart iron thy breast take heed lest draw upon

 body hector ransomed funeral

 assembly broken tribes scattered betake
 swift ships rest bethought supper
 sweet sleep joy thereof achilles wept remembering
 dear comrade sleep conquereth take hold
 kept turning side yearning patroklos'
 manhood excellent valour toils achieved
 woes bare cleaving battles men grievous waves
 thought thereon shed big tears lying side
 back face anon would arise upon feet
 roam wildly beside beach salt sea would unaware
 dawn arose sea shores yoked
 swift steeds car would bind hector behind chariot
 drag withal thrice drawn round barrow
 dead son menoitios rested hut left hector lying
 stretched face dust apollo kept away defacement
 flesh pity even death covered
 golden aegis achilles might tear
 dragged

 thus achilles anger entreated noble hector shamefully
 blessed gods beheld pitied urged
 clearsighted slayer argus steal corpse away
 others seemed good yet hera poseidon brighteyed
 maiden continued beginning sacred ilios became
 hateful priam people reason sin
 alexandros contemned goddesses came
 steading preferred brought deadly lustfulness
 twelfth morn day arose spake among immortals
 phoebus apollo "hard heart ye gods cruel hath hector
 never burnt thighbones unblemished bulls goats
 ye taken heart rescue even corpse wife look upon
 mother child father priam people
 speedily would burn fire make funeral fell
 achilles gods ye fain abet whose mind nowise
 purpose breast turned away cruelly minded
 lion great strength bidding proud heart goeth
 forth men's flocks make meal even thus achilles hath
 cast pity neither hath shame doth harm profit men
 greatly must many man lose even dearer one
 brother womb born perchance son yet bringeth
 wailing lamentation end enduring soul
 fates given unto men achilles bereaving noble hector
 life bindeth behind horses draggeth around tomb
 dear comrade verily honourable better
 let take heed lest wax wroth good man though
 fury entreating shamefully senseless clay"

 anger spake unto whitearmed hera "even thus mightest thou
 speak lord silver bow ye give equal honour
 achilles hector hector mortal suckled
 woman's breast achilles child goddess bred
 reared gave man wife even peleus
 dearest men immortals' heart ye gods came
 bridal thou among wert feasting thy lyre lover ill
 company faithless ever"

 answer spake zeus gathereth clouds "hera
 wroth utterly gods men's honour

 steam sacrifice even honour falleth due verily
 say stealing away brave hector cannot
 hidden achilles mother abideth ever nigh night
 day fain one gods would call thetis come

 arms and the man i sing who forc'd by fate
 and haughty juno's unrelenting hate
 expell'd and exil'd left the trojan shore
 long labors both by sea and land he bore
 and in the doubtful war before he won
 the latian realm and built the destin'd town
 his banish'd gods restor'd to rites divine
 and settled sure succession in his line
 from whence the race of alban fathers come
 and the long glories of majestic rome

 o muse the causes and the crimes relate
 what goddess was provok'd and whence her hate
 for what offense the queen of heav'n began
 to persecute so brave so just a man
 involv'd his anxious life in endless cares
 expos'd to wants and hurried into wars
 can heav'nly minds such high resentment show
 or exercise their spite in human woe

 against the tiber's mouth but far away
 an ancient town was seated on the sea
 a tyrian colony the people made
 stout for the war and studious of their trade
 carthage the name belov'd by juno more
 than her own argos or the samian shore
 here stood her chariot here if heav'n were kind
 the seat of awful empire she design'd
 yet she had heard an ancient rumor fly
 long cited by the people of the sky
 that times to come should see the trojan race
 her carthage ruin and her tow'rs deface
 nor thus confin'd the yoke of sov'reign sway
 should on the necks of all the nations lay
 she ponder'd this and fear'd it was in fate
 nor could forget the war she wag'd of late
 for conqu'ring greece against the trojan state
 besides long causes working in her mind
 and secret seeds of envy lay behind
 deep graven in her heart the doom remain'd
 of partial paris and her form disdain'd
 the grace bestow'd on ravish'd ganymed
 electra's glories and her injur'd bed
 each was a cause alone and all combin'd
 to kindle vengeance in her haughty mind
 for this far distant from the latian coast
 she drove the remnants of the trojan host
 and sev'n long years th' unhappy wand'ring train
 were toss'd by storms and scatter'd thro' the main
 such time such toil requir'd the roman name
 such length of labor for so vast a frame

 now scarce the trojan fleet with sails and oars
 had left behind the fair sicilian shores
 ent'ring with cheerful shouts the wat'ry reign
 and plowing frothy furrows in the main
 when lab'ring still with endless discontent
 the queen of heav'n did thus her fury vent

 "then am i vanquish'd must i yield" said she
 "and must the trojans reign in italy
 so fate will have it and jove adds his force
 nor can my pow'r divert their happy course
 could angry pallas with revengeful spleen
 the grecian navy burn and drown the men
 she for the fault of one offending foe
 the bolts of jove himself presum'd to throw
 with whirlwinds from beneath she toss'd the ship
 and bare expos'd the bosom of the deep
 then as an eagle gripes the trembling game
 the wretch yet hissing with her father's flame
 she strongly seiz'd and with a burning wound
 transfix'd and naked on a rock she bound
 but i who walk in awful state above
 the majesty of heav'n the sister wife of jove
 for length of years my fruitless force employ
 against the thin remains of ruin'd troy
 what nations now to juno's pow'r will pray
 or off'rings on my slighted altars lay"

 thus rag'd the goddess and with fury fraught
 the restless regions of the storms she sought
 where in a spacious cave of living stone
 the tyrant aeolus from his airy throne
 with pow'r imperial curbs the struggling winds
 and sounding tempests in dark prisons binds
 this way and that th' impatient captives tend
 and pressing for release the mountains rend
 high in his hall th' undaunted monarch stands
 and shakes his scepter and their rage commands
 which did he not their unresisted sway
 would sweep the world before them in their way
 earth air and seas thro' empty space would roll
 and heav'n would fly before the driving soul
 in fear of this the father of the gods
 confin'd their fury to those dark abodes
 and lock'd 'em safe within oppress'd with mountain loads
 impos'd a king with arbitrary sway
 to loose their fetters or their force allay
 to whom the suppliant queen her pray'rs address'd
 and thus the tenor of her suit express'd

 "o aeolus for to thee the king of heav'n
 the pow'r of tempests and of winds has giv'n
 thy force alone their fury can restrain
 and smooth the waves or swell the troubled main
 a race of wand'ring slaves abhorr'd by me
 with prosp'rous passage cut the tuscan sea
 to fruitful italy their course they steer
 and for their vanquish'd gods design new temples there
 raise all thy winds with night involve the skies
 sink or disperse my fatal enemies
 twice sev'n the charming daughters of the main
 around my person wait and bear my train
 succeed my wish and second my design
 the fairest deiopeia shall be thine
 and make thee father of a happy line"

 to this the god "'t is yours o queen to will
 the work which duty binds me to fulfil
 these airy kingdoms and this wide command
 are all the presents of your bounteous hand
 yours is my sov'reign's grace and as your guest
 i sit with gods at their celestial feast
 raise tempests at your pleasure or subdue
 dispose of empire which i hold from you"

 he said and hurl'd against the mountain side
 his quiv'ring spear and all the god applied
 the raging winds rush thro' the hollow wound
 and dance aloft in air and skim along the ground
 then settling on the sea the surges sweep
 raise liquid mountains and disclose the deep
 south east and west with mix'd confusion roar
 and roll the foaming billows to the shore
 the cables crack the sailors' fearful cries
 ascend and sable night involves the skies
 and heav'n itself is ravish'd from their eyes
 loud peals of thunder from the poles ensue
 then flashing fires the transient light renew
 the face of things a frightful image bears
 and present death in various forms appears
 struck with unusual fright the trojan chief
 with lifted hands and eyes invokes relief
 and "thrice and four times happy those" he cried
 "that under ilian walls before their parents died
 tydides bravest of the grecian train
 why could not i by that strong arm be slain
 and lie by noble hector on the plain
 or great sarpedon in those bloody fields
 where simois rolls the bodies and the shields
 of heroes whose dismember'd hands yet bear
 the dart aloft and clench the pointed spear"

 thus while the pious prince his fate bewails
 fierce boreas drove against his flying sails
 and rent the sheets the raging billows rise
 and mount the tossing vessels to the skies
 nor can the shiv'ring oars sustain the blow
 the galley gives her side and turns her prow
 while those astern descending down the steep
 thro' gaping waves behold the boiling deep
 three ships were hurried by the southern blast
 and on the secret shelves with fury cast
 those hidden rocks th' ausonian sailors knew
 they call'd them altars when they rose in view
 and show'd their spacious backs above the flood
 three more fierce eurus in his angry mood
 dash'd on the shallows of the moving sand
 and in mid ocean left them moor'd aland
 orontes' bark that bore the lycian crew
 a horrid sight ev'n in the hero's view
 from stem to stern by waves was overborne
 the trembling pilot from his rudder torn
 was headlong hurl'd thrice round the ship was toss'd
 then bulg'd at once and in the deep was lost
 and here and there above the waves were seen
 arms pictures precious goods and floating men
 the stoutest vessel to the storm gave way
 and suck'd thro' loosen'd planks the rushing sea
 ilioneus was her chief alethes old
 achates faithful abas young and bold
 endur'd not less their ships with gaping seams
 admit the deluge of the briny streams

 meantime imperial neptune heard the sound
 of raging billows breaking on the ground
 displeas'd and fearing for his wat'ry reign
 he rear'd his awful head above the main
 serene in majesty then roll'd his eyes
 around the space of earth and seas and skies
 he saw the trojan fleet dispers'd distress'd
 by stormy winds and wintry heav'n oppress'd
 full well the god his sister's envy knew
 and what her aims and what her arts pursue
 he summon'd eurus and the western blast
 and first an angry glance on both he cast
 then thus rebuk'd "audacious winds from whence
 this bold attempt this rebel insolence
 is it for you to ravage seas and land
 unauthoriz'd by my supreme command
 to raise such mountains on the troubled main
 whom i but first 't is fit the billows to restrain
 and then you shall be taught obedience to my reign
 hence to your lord my royal mandate bear
 the realms of ocean and the fields of air
 are mine not his by fatal lot to me
 the liquid empire fell and trident of the sea
 his pow'r to hollow caverns is confin'd
 there let him reign the jailer of the wind
 with hoarse commands his breathing subjects call
 and boast and bluster in his empty hall"
 he spoke and while he spoke he smooth'd the sea
 dispell'd the darkness and restor'd the day
 cymothoe triton and the seagreen train
 of beauteous nymphs the daughters of the main
 clear from the rocks the vessels with their hands
 the god himself with ready trident stands
 and opes the deep and spreads the moving sands
 then heaves them off the shoals where'er he guides
 his finny coursers and in triumph rides
 the waves unruffle and the sea subsides
 as when in tumults rise th' ignoble crowd
 mad are their motions and their tongues are loud
 and stones and brands in rattling volleys fly
 and all the rustic arms that fury can supply
 if then some grave and pious man appear
 they hush their noise and lend a list'ning ear
 he soothes with sober words their angry mood
 and quenches their innate desire of blood
 so when the father of the flood appears
 and o'er the seas his sov'reign trident rears
 their fury falls he skims the liquid plains
 high on his chariot and with loosen'd reins
 majestic moves along and awful peace maintains
 the weary trojans ply their shatter'd oars
 to nearest land and make the libyan shores

 within a long recess there lies a bay
 an island shades it from the rolling sea
 and forms a port secure for ships to ride
 broke by the jutting land on either side
 in double streams the briny waters glide
 betwixt two rows of rocks a sylvan scene
 appears above and groves for ever green
 a grot is form'd beneath with mossy seats
 to rest the nereids and exclude the heats
 down thro' the crannies of the living walls
 the crystal streams descend in murm'ring falls
 no haulsers need to bind the vessels here
 nor bearded anchors for no storms they fear
 sev'n ships within this happy harbor meet
 the thin remainders of the scatter'd fleet
 the trojans worn with toils and spent with woes
 leap on the welcome land and seek their wish'd repose

 first good achates with repeated strokes
 of clashing flints their hidden fire provokes
 short flame succeeds a bed of wither'd leaves
 the dying sparkles in their fall receives
 caught into life in fiery fumes they rise
 and fed with stronger food invade the skies
 the trojans dropping wet or stand around
 the cheerful blaze or lie along the ground
 some dry their corn infected with the brine
 then grind with marbles and prepare to dine
 aeneas climbs the mountain's airy brow
 and takes a prospect of the seas below
 if capys thence or antheus he could spy
 or see the streamers of caicus fly
 no vessels were in view but on the plain
 three beamy stags command a lordly train
 of branching heads the more ignoble throng
 attend their stately steps and slowly graze along
 he stood and while secure they fed below
 he took the quiver and the trusty bow
 achates us'd to bear the leaders first
 he laid along and then the vulgar pierc'd
 nor ceas'd his arrows till the shady plain
 sev'n mighty bodies with their blood distain
 for the sev'n ships he made an equal share
 and to the port return'd triumphant from the war
 the jars of gen'rous wine acestes' gift
 when his trinacrian shores the navy left
 he set abroach and for the feast prepar'd
 in equal portions with the ven'son shar'd
 thus while he dealt it round the pious chief
 with cheerful words allay'd the common grief
 "endure and conquer jove will soon dispose
 to future good our past and present woes
 with me the rocks of scylla you have tried
 th' inhuman cyclops and his den defied
 what greater ills hereafter can you bear
 resume your courage and dismiss your care
 an hour will come with pleasure to relate
 your sorrows past as benefits of fate
 thro' various hazards and events we move
 to latium and the realms foredoom'd by jove
 call'd to the seat the promise of the skies
 where trojan kingdoms once again may rise
 endure the hardships of your present state
 live and reserve yourselves for better fate"

 these words he spoke but spoke not from his heart
 his outward smiles conceal'd his inward smart
 the jolly crew unmindful of the past
 the quarry share their plenteous dinner haste
 some strip the skin some portion out the spoil
 the limbs yet trembling in the caldrons boil
 some on the fire the reeking entrails broil
 stretch'd on the grassy turf at ease they dine
 restore their strength with meat and cheer their souls with
 wine
 their hunger thus appeas'd their care attends
 the doubtful fortune of their absent friends
 alternate hopes and fears their minds possess
 whether to deem 'em dead or in distress
 above the rest aeneas mourns the fate
 of brave orontes and th' uncertain state
 of gyas lycus and of amycus
 the day but not their sorrows ended thus

 when from aloft almighty jove surveys
 earth air and shores and navigable seas
 at length on libyan realms he fix'd his eyes
 whom pond'ring thus on human miseries
 when venus saw she with a lowly look
 not free from tears her heav'nly sire bespoke

 "o king of gods and men whose awful hand
 disperses thunder on the seas and land
 disposing all with absolute command
 how could my pious son thy pow'r incense
 or what alas is vanish'd troy's offense
 our hope of italy not only lost
 on various seas by various tempests toss'd
 but shut from ev'ry shore and barr'd from ev'ry coast
 you promis'd once a progeny divine
 of romans rising from the trojan line
 in after times should hold the world in awe
 and to the land and ocean give the law
 how is your doom revers'd which eas'd my care
 when troy was ruin'd in that cruel war
 then fates to fates i could oppose but now
 when fortune still pursues her former blow
 what can i hope what worse can still succeed
 what end of labors has your will decreed
 antenor from the midst of grecian hosts
 could pass secure and pierce th' illyrian coasts
 where rolling down the steep timavus raves
 and thro' nine channels disembogues his waves
 at length he founded padua's happy seat
 and gave his trojans a secure retreat
 there fix'd their arms and there renew'd their name
 and there in quiet rules and crown'd with fame
 but we descended from your sacred line
 entitled to your heav'n and rites divine
 are banish'd earth and for the wrath of one
 remov'd from latium and the promis'd throne
 are these our scepters these our due rewards
 and is it thus that jove his plighted faith regards"

 to whom the father of th' immortal race
 smiling with that serene indulgent face
 with which he drives the clouds and clears the skies
 first gave a holy kiss then thus replies

 "daughter dismiss thy fears to thy desire
 the fates of thine are fix'd and stand entire
 thou shalt behold thy wish'd lavinian walls
 and ripe for heav'n when fate aeneas calls
 then shalt thou bear him up sublime to me
 no councils have revers'd my firm decree
 and lest new fears disturb thy happy state
 know i have search'd the mystic rolls of fate
 thy son nor is th' appointed season far
 in italy shall wage successful war
 shall tame fierce nations in the bloody field
 and sov'reign laws impose and cities build
 till after ev'ry foe subdued the sun
 thrice thro' the signs his annual race shall run
 this is his time prefix'd ascanius then
 now call'd iulus shall begin his reign
 he thirty rolling years the crown shall wear
 then from lavinium shall the seat transfer
 and with hard labor alba longa build
 the throne with his succession shall be fill'd
 three hundred circuits more then shall be seen
 ilia the fair a priestess and a queen
 who full of mars in time with kindly throes
 shall at a birth two goodly boys disclose
 the royal babes a tawny wolf shall drain
 then romulus his grandsire's throne shall gain
 of martial tow'rs the founder shall become
 the people romans call the city rome
 to them no bounds of empire i assign
 nor term of years to their immortal line
 ev'n haughty juno who with endless broils
 earth seas and heav'n and jove himself turmoils
 at length aton'd her friendly pow'r shall join
 to cherish and advance the trojan line
 the subject world shall rome's dominion own
 and prostrate shall adore the nation of the gown
 an age is ripening in revolving fate
 when troy shall overturn the grecian state
 and sweet revenge her conqu'ring sons shall call
 to crush the people that conspir'd her fall
 then caesar from the julian stock shall rise
 whose empire ocean and whose fame the skies
 alone shall bound whom fraught with eastern spoils
 our heav'n the just reward of human toils
 securely shall repay with rites divine
 and incense shall ascend before his sacred shrine
 then dire debate and impious war shall cease
 and the stern age be soften'd into peace
 then banish'd faith shall once again return
 and vestal fires in hallow'd temples burn
 and remus with quirinus shall sustain
 the righteous laws and fraud and force restrain
 janus himself before his fane shall wait
 and keep the dreadful issues of his gate
 with bolts and iron bars within remains
 imprison'd fury bound in brazen chains
 high on a trophy rais'd of useless arms
 he sits and threats the world with vain alarms"

 he said and sent cyllenius with command
 to free the ports and ope the punic land
 to trojan guests lest ignorant of fate
 the queen might force them from her town and state
 down from the steep of heav'n cyllenius flies
 and cleaves with all his wings the yielding skies
 soon on the libyan shore descends the god
 performs his message and displays his rod
 the surly murmurs of the people cease
 and as the fates requir'd they give the peace
 the queen herself suspends the rigid laws
 the trojans pities and protects their cause

 meantime in shades of night aeneas lies
 care seiz'd his soul and sleep forsook his eyes
 but when the sun restor'd the cheerful day
 he rose the coast and country to survey
 anxious and eager to discover more
 it look'd a wild uncultivated shore
 but whether humankind or beasts alone
 possess'd the newfound region was unknown
 beneath a ledge of rocks his fleet he hides
 tall trees surround the mountain's shady sides
 the bending brow above a safe retreat provides
 arm'd with two pointed darts he leaves his friends
 and true achates on his steps attends
 lo in the deep recesses of the wood
 before his eyes his goddess mother stood
 a huntress in her habit and her mien
 her dress a maid her air confess'd a queen
 bare were her knees and knots her garments bind
 loose was her hair and wanton'd in the wind
 her hand sustain'd a bow her quiver hung behind
 she seem'd a virgin of the spartan blood
 with such array harpalyce bestrode
 her thracian courser and outstripp'd the rapid flood
 "ho strangers have you lately seen" she said
 "one of my sisters like myself array'd
 who cross'd the lawn or in the forest stray'd
 a painted quiver at her back she bore
 varied with spots a lynx's hide she wore
 and at full cry pursued the tusky boar"

 thus venus thus her son replied again
 "none of your sisters have we heard or seen
 o virgin or what other name you bear
 above that style o more than mortal fair
 your voice and mien celestial birth betray
 if as you seem the sister of the day
 or one at least of chaste diana's train
 let not an humble suppliant sue in vain
 but tell a stranger long in tempests toss'd
 what earth we tread and who commands the coast
 then on your name shall wretched mortals call
 and offer'd victims at your altars fall"
 "i dare not" she replied "assume the name
 of goddess or celestial honors claim
 for tyrian virgins bows and quivers bear
 and purple buskins o'er their ankles wear
 know gentle youth in libyan lands you are
 a people rude in peace and rough in war
 the rising city which from far you see
 is carthage and a tyrian colony
 phoenician dido rules the growing state
 who fled from tyre to shun her brother's hate
 great were her wrongs her story full of fate
 which i will sum in short sichaeus known
 for wealth and brother to the punic throne
 possess'd fair dido's bed and either heart
 at once was wounded with an equal dart
 her father gave her yet a spotless maid
 pygmalion then the tyrian scepter sway'd
 one who condemn'd divine and human laws
 then strife ensued and cursed gold the cause
 the monarch blinded with desire of wealth
 with steel invades his brother's life by stealth
 before the sacred altar made him bleed
 and long from her conceal'd the cruel deed
 some tale some new pretense he daily coin'd
 to soothe his sister and delude her mind
 at length in dead of night the ghost appears
 of her unhappy lord the specter stares
 and with erected eyes his bloody bosom bares
 the cruel altars and his fate he tells
 and the dire secret of his house reveals
 then warns the widow with her household gods
 to seek a refuge in remote abodes
 last to support her in so long a way
 he shows her where his hidden treasure lay
 admonish'd thus and seiz'd with mortal fright
 the queen provides companions of her flight
 they meet and all combine to leave the state
 who hate the tyrant or who fear his hate
 they seize a fleet which ready rigg'd they find
 nor is pygmalion's treasure left behind
 the vessels heavy laden put to sea
 with prosp'rous winds a woman leads the way
 i know not if by stress of weather driv'n
 or was their fatal course dispos'd by heav'n
 at last they landed where from far your eyes
 may view the turrets of new carthage rise
 there bought a space of ground which byrsa call'd
 from the bull's hide they first inclos'd and wall'd
 but whence are you what country claims your birth
 what seek you strangers on our libyan earth"

 to whom with sorrow streaming from his eyes
 and deeply sighing thus her son replies
 "could you with patience hear or i relate
 o nymph the tedious annals of our fate
 thro' such a train of woes if i should run
 the day would sooner than the tale be done
 from ancient troy by force expell'd we came
 if you by chance have heard the trojan name
 on various seas by various tempests toss'd
 at length we landed on your libyan coast
 the good aeneas am i call'd a name
 while fortune favor'd not unknown to fame
 my household gods companions of my woes
 with pious care i rescued from our foes
 to fruitful italy my course was bent
 and from the king of heav'n is my descent
 with twice ten sail i cross'd the phrygian sea
 fate and my mother goddess led my way
 scarce sev'n the thin remainders of my fleet
 from storms preserv'd within your harbor meet
 myself distress'd an exile and unknown
 debarr'd from europe and from asia thrown
 in libyan desarts wander thus alone"

 his tender parent could no longer bear
 but interposing sought to soothe his care
 "whoe'er you are not unbelov'd by heav'n
 since on our friendly shore your ships are driv'n
 have courage to the gods permit the rest
 and to the queen expose your just request
 now take this earnest of success for more
 your scatter'd fleet is join'd upon the shore
 the winds are chang'd your friends from danger free
 or i renounce my skill in augury
 twelve swans behold in beauteous order move
 and stoop with closing pinions from above
 whom late the bird of jove had driv'n along
 and thro' the clouds pursued the scatt'ring throng
 now all united in a goodly team
 they skim the ground and seek the quiet stream
 as they with joy returning clap their wings
 and ride the circuit of the skies in rings
 not otherwise your ships and ev'ry friend
 already hold the port or with swift sails descend
 no more advice is needful but pursue
 the path before you and the town in view"

 thus having said she turn'd and made appear
 her neck refulgent and dishevel'd hair
 which flowing from her shoulders reach'd the ground
 and widely spread ambrosial scents around
 in length of train descends her sweeping gown
 and by her graceful walk the queen of love is known
 the prince pursued the parting deity
 with words like these "ah whither do you fly
 unkind and cruel to deceive your son
 in borrow'd shapes and his embrace to shun
 never to bless my sight but thus unknown
 and still to speak in accents not your own"
 against the goddess these complaints he made
 but took the path and her commands obey'd
 they march obscure for venus kindly shrouds
 with mists their persons and involves in clouds
 that thus unseen their passage none might stay
 or force to tell the causes of their way
 this part perform'd the goddess flies sublime
 to visit paphos and her native clime
 where garlands ever green and ever fair
 with vows are offer'd and with solemn pray'r
 a hundred altars in her temple smoke
 a thousand bleeding hearts her pow'r invoke

 they climb the next ascent and looking down
 now at a nearer distance view the town
 the prince with wonder sees the stately tow'rs
 which late were huts and shepherds' homely bow'rs
 the gates and streets and hears from ev'ry part
 the noise and busy concourse of the mart
 the toiling tyrians on each other call
 to ply their labor some extend the wall
 some build the citadel the brawny throng
 or dig or push unwieldly stones along
 some for their dwellings choose a spot of ground
 which first design'd with ditches they surround
 some laws ordain and some attend the choice
 of holy senates and elect by voice
 here some design a mole while others there
 lay deep foundations for a theater
 from marble quarries mighty columns hew
 for ornaments of scenes and future view
 such is their toil and such their busy pains
 as exercise the bees in flow'ry plains
 when winter past and summer scarce begun
 invites them forth to labor in the sun
 some lead their youth abroad while some condense
 their liquid store and some in cells dispense
 some at the gate stand ready to receive
 the golden burthen and their friends relieve
 all with united force combine to drive
 the lazy drones from the laborious hive
 with envy stung they view each other's deeds
 the fragrant work with diligence proceeds
 "thrice happy you whose walls already rise"
 aeneas said and view'd with lifted eyes
 their lofty tow'rs then entiring at the gate
 conceal'd in clouds prodigious to relate
 he mix'd unmark'd among the busy throng
 borne by the tide and pass'd unseen along

 full in the center of the town there stood
 thick set with trees a venerable wood
 the tyrians landing near this holy ground
 and digging here a prosp'rous omen found
 from under earth a courser's head they drew
 their growth and future fortune to foreshew
 this fated sign their foundress juno gave
 of a soil fruitful and a people brave
 sidonian dido here with solemn state
 did juno's temple build and consecrate
 enrich'd with gifts and with a golden shrine
 but more the goddess made the place divine
 on brazen steps the marble threshold rose
 and brazen plates the cedar beams inclose
 the rafters are with brazen cov'rings crown'd
 the lofty doors on brazen hinges sound
 what first aeneas this place beheld
 reviv'd his courage and his fear expell'd
 for while expecting there the queen he rais'd
 his wond'ring eyes and round the temple gaz'd
 admir'd the fortune of the rising town
 the striving artists and their arts' renown
 he saw in order painted on the wall
 whatever did unhappy troy befall
 the wars that fame around the world had blown
 all to the life and ev'ry leader known
 there agamemnon priam here he spies
 and fierce achilles who both kings defies
 he stopp'd and weeping said "o friend ev'n here
 the monuments of trojan woes appear
 our known disasters fill ev'n foreign lands
 see there where old unhappy priam stands
 ev'n the mute walls relate the warrior's fame
 and trojan griefs the tyrians' pity claim"
 he said his tears a ready passage find
 devouring what he saw so well design'd
 and with an empty picture fed his mind
 for there he saw the fainting grecians yield
 and here the trembling trojans quit the field
 pursued by fierce achilles thro' the plain
 on his high chariot driving o'er the slain
 the tents of rhesus next his grief renew
 by their white sails betray'd to nightly view
 and wakeful diomede whose cruel sword
 the sentries slew nor spar'd their slumb'ring lord
 then took the fiery steeds ere yet the food
 of troy they taste or drink the xanthian flood
 elsewhere he saw where troilus defied
 achilles and unequal combat tried
 then where the boy disarm'd with loosen'd reins
 was by his horses hurried o'er the plains
 hung by the neck and hair and dragg'd around
 the hostile spear yet sticking in his wound
 with tracks of blood inscrib'd the dusty ground
 meantime the trojan dames oppress'd with woe
 to pallas' fane in long procession go
 in hopes to reconcile their heav'nly foe
 they weep they beat their breasts they rend their hair
 and rich embroider'd vests for presents bear
 but the stern goddess stands unmov'd with pray'r
 thrice round the trojan walls achilles drew
 the corpse of hector whom in fight he slew
 here priam sues and there for sums of gold
 the lifeless body of his son is sold
 so sad an object and so well express'd
 drew sighs and groans from the griev'd hero's breast
 to see the figure of his lifeless friend
 and his old sire his helpless hand extend
 himself he saw amidst the grecian train
 mix'd in the bloody battle on the plain
 and swarthy memnon in his arms he knew
 his pompous ensigns and his indian crew
 penthisilea there with haughty grace
 leads to the wars an amazonian race
 in their right hands a pointed dart they wield
 the left for ward sustains the lunar shield
 athwart her breast a golden belt she throws
 amidst the press alone provokes a thousand foes
 and dares her maiden arms to manly force oppose

 thus while the trojan prince employs his eyes
 fix'd on the walls with wonder and surprise
 the beauteous dido with a num'rous train
 and pomp of guards ascends the sacred fane
 such on eurotas' banks or cynthus' height
 diana seems and so she charms the sight
 when in the dance the graceful goddess leads
 the choir of nymphs and overtops their heads
 known by her quiver and her lofty mien
 she walks majestic and she looks their queen
 latona sees her shine above the rest
 and feeds with secret joy her silent breast
 such dido was with such becoming state
 amidst the crowd she walks serenely great
 their labor to her future sway she speeds
 and passing with a gracious glance proceeds
 then mounts the throne high plac'd before the shrine
 in crowds around the swarming people join
 she takes petitions and dispenses laws
 hears and determines ev'ry private cause
 their tasks in equal portions she divides
 and where unequal there by lots decides
 another way by chance aeneas bends
 his eyes and unexpected sees his friends
 antheus sergestus grave cloanthus strong
 and at their backs a mighty trojan throng
 whom late the tempest on the billows toss'd
 and widely scatter'd on another coast
 the prince unseen surpris'd with wonder stands
 and longs with joyful haste to join their hands
 but doubtful of the wish'd event he stays
 and from the hollow cloud his friends surveys
 impatient till they told their present state
 and where they left their ships and what their fate
 and why they came and what was their request
 for these were sent commission'd by the rest
 to sue for leave to land their sickly men
 and gain admission to the gracious queen
 ent'ring with cries they fill'd the holy fane
 then thus with lowly voice ilioneus began

 "o queen indulg'd by favor of the gods
 to found an empire in these new abodes
 to build a town with statutes to restrain
 the wild inhabitants beneath thy reign
 we wretched trojans toss'd on ev'ry shore
 from sea to sea thy clemency implore
 forbid the fires our shipping to deface
 receive th' unhappy fugitives to grace
 and spare the remnant of a pious race
 we come not with design of wasteful prey
 to drive the country force the swains away
 nor such our strength nor such is our desire
 the vanquish'd dare not to such thoughts aspire
 a land there is hesperia nam'd of old
 the soil is fruitful and the men are bold
 th' oenotrians held it once by common fame
 now call'd italia from the leader's name
 to that sweet region was our voyage bent
 when winds and ev'ry warring element
 disturb'd our course and far from sight of land
 cast our torn vessels on the moving sand
 the sea came on the south with mighty roar
 dispers'd and dash'd the rest upon the rocky shore
 those few you see escap'd the storm and fear
 unless you interpose a shipwreck here
 what men what monsters what inhuman race
 what laws what barb'rous customs of the place
 shut up a desart shore to drowning men
 and drive us to the cruel seas again
 if our hard fortune no compassion draws
 nor hospitable rights nor human laws
 the gods are just and will revenge our cause
 aeneas was our prince a juster lord
 or nobler warrior never drew a sword
 observant of the right religious of his word
 if yet he lives and draws this vital air
 nor we his friends of safety shall despair
 nor you great queen these offices repent
 which he will equal and perhaps augment
 we want not cities nor sicilian coasts
 where king acestes trojan lineage boasts
 permit our ships a shelter on your shores
 refitted from your woods with planks and oars
 that if our prince be safe we may renew
 our destin'd course and italy pursue
 but if o best of men the fates ordain
 that thou art swallow'd in the libyan main
 and if our young iulus be no more
 dismiss our navy from your friendly shore
 that we to good acestes may return
 and with our friends our common losses mourn"
 thus spoke ilioneus the trojan crew
 with cries and clamors his request renew

 the modest queen a while with downcast eyes
 ponder'd the speech then briefly thus replies
 "trojans dismiss your fears my cruel fate
 and doubts attending an unsettled state
 force me to guard my coast from foreign foes
 who has not heard the story of your woes
 the name and fortune of your native place
 the fame and valor of the phrygian race
 we tyrians are not so devoid of sense
 nor so remote from phoebus' influence
 whether to latian shores your course is bent
 or driv'n by tempests from your first intent
 you seek the good acestes' government
 your men shall be receiv'd your fleet repair'd
 and sail with ships of convoy for your guard
 or would you stay and join your friendly pow'rs
 to raise and to defend the tyrian tow'rs
 my wealth my city and myself are yours
 and would to heav'n the storm you felt would bring
 on carthaginian coasts your wand'ring king
 my people shall by my command explore
 the ports and creeks of ev'ry winding shore
 and towns and wilds and shady woods in quest
 of so renown'd and so desir'd a guest"

 rais'd in his mind the trojan hero stood
 and long'd to break from out his ambient cloud
 achates found it and thus urg'd his way
 "from whence o goddessborn this long delay
 what more can you desire your welcome sure
 your fleet in safety and your friends secure
 one only wants and him we saw in vain
 oppose the storm and swallow'd in the main
 orontes in his fate our forfeit paid
 the rest agrees with what your mother said"
 scarce had he spoken when the cloud gave way
 the mists flew upward and dissolv'd in day

 the trojan chief appear'd in open sight
 august in visage and serenely bright
 his mother goddess with her hands divine
 had form'd his curling locks and made his temples shine
 and giv'n his rolling eyes a sparkling grace
 and breath'd a youthful vigor on his face
 like polish'd ivory beauteous to behold
 or parian marble when enchas'd in gold
 thus radiant from the circling cloud he broke
 and thus with manly modesty he spoke

 "he whom you seek am i by tempests toss'd
 and sav'd from shipwreck on your libyan coast
 presenting gracious queen before your throne
 a prince that owes his life to you alone
 fair majesty the refuge and redress
 of those whom fate pursues and wants oppress
 you who your pious offices employ
 to save the relics of abandon'd troy
 receive the shipwreck'd on your friendly shore
 with hospitable rites relieve the poor
 associate in your town a wand'ring train
 and strangers in your palace entertain
 what thanks can wretched fugitives return
 who scatter'd thro' the world in exile mourn
 the gods if gods to goodness are inclin'd
 if acts of mercy touch their heav'nly mind
 and more than all the gods your gen'rous heart
 conscious of worth requite its own desert
 in you this age is happy and this earth
 and parents more than mortal gave you birth
 while rolling rivers into seas shall run
 and round the space of heav'n the radiant sun
 while trees the mountain tops with shades supply
 your honor name and praise shall never die
 whate'er abode my fortune has assign'd
 your image shall be present in my mind"
 thus having said he turn'd with pious haste
 and joyful his expecting friends embrac'd
 with his right hand ilioneus was grac'd
 serestus with his left then to his breast
 cloanthus and the noble gyas press'd
 and so by turns descended to the rest

 the tyrian queen stood fix'd upon his face
 pleas'd with his motions ravish'd with his grace
 admir'd his fortunes more admir'd the man
 then recollected stood and thus began
 "what fate o goddessborn what angry pow'rs
 have cast you shipwrack'd on our barren shores
 are you the great aeneas known to fame
 who from celestial seed your lineage claim

 the same aeneas whom fair venus bore
 to fam'd anchises on th' idaean shore
 it calls into my mind tho' then a child
 when teucer came from salamis exil'd
 and sought my father's aid to be restor'd
 my father belus then with fire and sword
 invaded cyprus made the region bare
 and conqu'ring finish'd the successful war
 from him the trojan siege i understood
 the grecian chiefs and your illustrious blood
 your foe himself the dardan valor prais'd
 and his own ancestry from trojans rais'd
 enter my noble guest and you shall find
 if not a costly welcome yet a kind
 for i myself like you have been distress'd
 till heav'n afforded me this place of rest
 like you an alien in a land unknown
 i learn to pity woes so like my own"
 she said and to the palace led her guest
 then offer'd incense and proclaim'd a feast
 nor yet less careful for her absent friends
 twice ten fat oxen to the ships she sends
 besides a hundred boars a hundred lambs
 with bleating cries attend their milky dams
 and jars of gen'rous wine and spacious bowls
 she gives to cheer the sailors' drooping souls
 now purple hangings clothe the palace walls
 and sumptuous feasts are made in splendid halls
 on tyrian carpets richly wrought they dine
 with loads of massy plate the sideboards shine
 and antique vases all of gold emboss'd
 the gold itself inferior to the cost
 of curious work where on the sides were seen
 the fights and figures of illustrious men
 from their first founder to the present queen

 the good aeneas paternal care
 iulus' absence could no longer bear
 dispatch'd achates to the ships in haste
 to give a glad relation of the past
 and fraught with precious gifts to bring the boy
 snatch'd from the ruins of unhappy troy
 a robe of tissue stiff with golden wire
 an upper vest once helen's rich attire
 from argos by the fam'd adultress brought
 with golden flow'rs and winding foliage wrought
 her mother leda's present when she came
 to ruin troy and set the world on flame
 the scepter priam's eldest daughter bore
 her orient necklace and the crown she wore
 of double texture glorious to behold
 one order set with gems and one with gold
 instructed thus the wise achates goes
 and in his diligence his duty shows

 but venus anxious for her son's affairs
 new counsels tries and new designs prepares
 that cupid should assume the shape and face
 of sweet ascanius and the sprightly grace
 should bring the presents in her nephew's stead
 and in eliza's veins the gentle poison shed
 for much she fear'd the tyrians doubletongued
 and knew the town to juno's care belong'd
 these thoughts by night her golden slumbers broke
 and thus alarm'd to winged love she spoke
 "my son my strength whose mighty pow'r alone
 controls the thund'rer on his awful throne
 to thee thy muchafflicted mother flies
 and on thy succor and thy faith relies
 thou know'st my son how jove's revengeful wife
 by force and fraud attempts thy brother's life
 and often hast thou mourn'd with me his pains
 him dido now with blandishment detains
 but i suspect the town where juno reigns
 for this 't is needful to prevent her art
 and fire with love the proud phoenician's heart
 a love so violent so strong so sure
 as neither age can change nor art can cure
 how this may be perform'd now take my mind
 ascanius by his father is design'd
 to come with presents laden from the port
 to gratify the queen and gain the court
 i mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep
 and ravish'd in idalian bow'rs to keep
 or high cythera that the sweet deceit
 may pass unseen and none prevent the cheat
 take thou his form and shape i beg the grace
 but only for a night's revolving space
 thyself a boy assume a boy's dissembled face
 that when amidst the fervor of the feast
 the tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast
 and with sweet kisses in her arms constrains
 thou may'st infuse thy venom in her veins"
 the god of love obeys and sets aside
 his bow and quiver and his plumy pride
 he walks iulus in his mother's sight
 and in the sweet resemblance takes delight

 the goddess then to young ascanius flies
 and in a pleasing slumber seals his eyes
 lull'd in her lap amidst a train of loves
 she gently bears him to her blissful groves
 then with a wreath of myrtle crowns his head
 and softly lays him on a flow'ry bed
 cupid meantime assum'd his form and face
 foll'wing achates with a shorter pace
 and brought the gifts the queen already sate
 amidst the trojan lords in shining state
 high on a golden bed her princely guest
 was next her side in order sate the rest
 then canisters with bread are heap'd on high
 th' attendants water for their hands supply
 and having wash'd with silken towels dry
 next fifty handmaids in long order bore
 the censers and with fumes the gods adore
 then youths and virgins twice as many join
 to place the dishes and to serve the wine
 the tyrian train admitted to the feast
 approach and on the painted couches rest
 all on the trojan gifts with wonder gaze
 but view the beauteous boy with more amaze
 his rosycolor'd cheeks his radiant eyes
 his motions voice and shape and all the god's disguise
 nor pass unprais'd the vest and veil divine
 which wand'ring foliage and rich flow'rs entwine
 but far above the rest the royal dame
 already doom'd to love's disastrous flame
 with eyes insatiate and tumultuous joy
 beholds the presents and admires the boy
 the guileful god about the hero long
 with children's play and false embraces hung
 then sought the queen she took him to her arms
 with greedy pleasure and devour'd his charms
 unhappy dido little thought what guest
 how dire a god she drew so near her breast
 but he not mindless of his mother's pray'r
 works in the pliant bosom of the fair
 and molds her heart anew and blots her former care
 the dead is to the living love resign'd
 and all aeneas enters in her mind

 now when the rage of hunger was appeas'd
 the meat remov'd and ev'ry guest was pleas'd
 the golden bowls with sparkling wine are crown'd
 and thro' the palace cheerful cries resound
 from gilded roofs depending lamps display
 nocturnal beams that emulate the day
 a golden bowl that shone with gems divine
 the queen commanded to be crown'd with wine
 the bowl that belus us'd and all the tyrian line
 then silence thro' the hall proclaim'd she spoke
 "o hospitable jove we thus invoke
 with solemn rites thy sacred name and pow'r
 bless to both nations this auspicious hour
 so may the trojan and the tyrian line
 in lasting concord from this day combine
 thou bacchus god of joys and friendly cheer
 and gracious juno both be present here
 and you my lords of tyre your vows address
 to heav'n with mine to ratify the peace"
 the goblet then she took with nectar crown'd
 sprinkling the first libations on the ground
 and rais'd it to her mouth with sober grace
 then sipping offer'd to the next in place
 't was bitias whom she call'd a thirsty soul
 he took challenge and embrac'd the bowl
 with pleasure swill'd the gold nor ceas'd to draw
 till he the bottom of the brimmer saw
 the goblet goes around iopas brought
 his golden lyre and sung what ancient atlas taught
 the various labors of the wand'ring moon
 and whence proceed th' eclipses of the sun
 th' original of men and beasts and whence
 the rains arise and fires their warmth dispense
 and fix'd and erring stars dispose their influence
 what shakes the solid earth what cause delays
 the summer nights and shortens winter days
 with peals of shouts the tyrians praise the song
 those peals are echo'd by the trojan throng
 th' unhappy queen with talk prolong'd the night
 and drank large draughts of love with vast delight
 of priam much enquir'd of hector more
 then ask'd what arms the swarthy memnon wore
 what troops he landed on the trojan shore
 the steeds of diomede varied the discourse
 and fierce achilles with his matchless force
 at length as fate and her ill stars requir'd
 to hear the series of the war desir'd
 "relate at large my godlike guest" she said
 "the grecian stratagems the town betray'd
 the fatal issue of so long a war
 your flight your wand'rings and your woes declare
 for since on ev'ry sea on ev'ry coast
 your men have been distress'd your navy toss'd
 sev'n times the sun has either tropic view'd
 the winter banish'd and the spring renew'd"




 book ii

 all were attentive to the godlike man
 when from his lofty couch he thus began
 "great queen what you command me to relate
 renews the sad remembrance of our fate
 an empire from its old foundations rent
 and ev'ry woe the trojans underwent
 a peopled city made a desart place
 all that i saw and part of which i was
 not ev'n the hardest of our foes could hear
 nor stern ulysses tell without a tear
 and now the latter watch of wasting night
 and setting stars to kindly rest invite
 but since you take such int'rest in our woe
 and troy's disastrous end desire to know
 i will restrain my tears and briefly tell
 what in our last and fatal night befell

 "by destiny compell'd and in despair
 the greeks grew weary of the tedious war
 and by minerva's aid a fabric rear'd
 which like a steed of monstrous height appear'd
 the sides were plank'd with pine they feign'd it made
 for their return and this the vow they paid
 thus they pretend but in the hollow side
 selected numbers of their soldiers hide
 with inward arms the dire machine they load
 and iron bowels stuff the dark abode
 in sight of troy lies tenedos an isle
 while fortune did on priam's empire smile
 renown'd for wealth but since a faithless bay
 where ships expos'd to wind and weather lay
 there was their fleet conceal'd we thought for greece
 their sails were hoisted and our fears release
 the trojans coop'd within their walls so long
 unbar their gates and issue in a throng
 like swarming bees and with delight survey
 the camp deserted where the grecians lay
 the quarters of the sev'ral chiefs they show'd
 here phoenix here achilles made abode
 here join'd the battles there the navy rode
 part on the pile their wond'ring eyes employ
 the pile by pallas rais'd to ruin troy
 thymoetes first 't is doubtful whether hir'd
 or so the trojan destiny requir'd
 mov'd that the ramparts might be broken down
 to lodge the monster fabric in the town
 but capys and the rest of sounder mind
 the fatal present to the flames designed
 or to the wat'ry deep at least to bore
 the hollow sides and hidden frauds explore
 the giddy vulgar as their fancies guide
 with noise say nothing and in parts divide
 laocoon follow'd by a num'rous crowd
 ran from the fort and cried from far aloud
 'o wretched countrymen what fury reigns
 what more than madness has possess'd your brains
 think you the grecians from your coasts are gone
 and are ulysses' arts no better known
 this hollow fabric either must inclose
 within its blind recess our secret foes
 or 't is an engine rais'd above the town
 t' o'erlook the walls and then to batter down
 somewhat is sure design'd by fraud or force
 trust not their presents nor admit the horse'
 thus having said against the steed he threw
 his forceful spear which hissing as flew
 pierc'd thro' the yielding planks of jointed wood
 and trembling in the hollow belly stood
 the sides transpierc'd return a rattling sound
 and groans of greeks inclos'd come issuing thro' the wound
 and had not heav'n the fall of troy design'd
 or had not men been fated to be blind
 enough was said and done t'inspire a better mind
 then had our lances pierc'd the treach'rous wood
 and ilian tow'rs and priam's empire stood
 meantime with shouts the trojan shepherds bring
 a captive greek in bands before the king
 taken to take who made himself their prey
 t' impose on their belief and troy betray
 fix'd on his aim and obstinately bent
 to die undaunted or to circumvent
 about the captive tides of trojans flow
 all press to see and some insult the foe
 now hear how well the greeks their wiles disguis'd
 behold a nation in a man compris'd
 trembling the miscreant stood unarm'd and bound
 he star'd and roll'd his haggard eyes around
 then said 'alas what earth remains what sea
 is open to receive unhappy me
 what fate a wretched fugitive attends
 scorn'd by my foes abandon'd by my friends'
 he said and sigh'd and cast a rueful eye
 our pity kindles and our passions die
 we cheer youth to make his own defense
 and freely tell us what he was and whence
 what news he could impart we long to know
 and what to credit from a captive foe

 "his fear at length dismiss'd he said 'whate'er
 my fate ordains my words shall be sincere
 i neither can nor dare my birth disclaim
 greece is my country sinon is my name
 tho' plung'd by fortune's pow'r in misery
 't is not in fortune's pow'r to make me lie
 if any chance has hither brought the name
 of palamedes not unknown to fame
 who suffer'd from the malice of the times
 accus'd and sentenc'd for pretended crimes
 because these fatal wars he would prevent
 whose death the wretched greeks too late lament
 me then a boy my father poor and bare
 of other means committed to his care
 his kinsman and companion in the war
 while fortune favor'd while his arms support
 the cause and rul'd the counsels of the court
 i made some figure there nor was my name
 obscure nor i without my share of fame
 but when ulysses with fallacious arts
 had made impression in the people's hearts
 and forg'd a treason in my patron's name
 i speak of things too far divulg'd by fame
 my kinsman fell then i without support
 in private mourn'd his loss and left the court
 mad as i was i could not bear his fate
 with silent grief but loudly blam'd the state
 and curs'd the direful author of my woes
 't was told again and hence my ruin rose
 i threaten'd if indulgent heav'n once more
 would land me safely on my native shore
 his death with double vengeance to restore
 this mov'd the murderer's hate and soon ensued
 th' effects of malice from a man so proud
 ambiguous rumors thro' the camp he spread
 and sought by treason my devoted head
 new crimes invented left unturn'd no stone
 to make my guilt appear and hide his own
 till calchas was by force and threat'ning wrought
 but why why dwell i on that anxious thought
 if on my nation just revenge you seek
 and 't is t' appear a foe t' appear a greek
 already you my name and country know
 assuage your thirst of blood and strike the blow
 my death will both the kingly brothers please
 and set insatiate ithacus at ease'
 this fair unfinish'd tale these broken starts
 rais'd expectations in our longing hearts
 unknowing as we were in grecian arts
 his former trembling once again renew'd
 with acted fear the villain thus pursued

 "'long had the grecians tir'd with fruitless care
 and wearied with an unsuccessful war
 resolv'd to raise the siege and leave the town
 and had the gods permitted they had gone
 but oft the wintry seas and southern winds
 withstood their passage home and chang'd their minds
 portents and prodigies their souls amaz'd
 but most when this stupendous pile was rais'd
 then flaming meteors hung in air were seen
 and thunders rattled thro' a sky serene
 dismay'd and fearful of some dire event
 eurypylus t' enquire their fate was sent
 he from the gods this dreadful answer brought

 "o grecians when the trojan shores you sought
 your passage with a virgin's blood was bought
 so must your safe return be bought again
 and grecian blood once more atone the main"
 the spreading rumor round the people ran
 all fear'd and each believ'd himself the man
 ulysses took th' advantage of their fright
 call'd calchas and produc'd in open sight
 then bade him name the wretch ordain'd by fate
 the public victim to redeem the state
 already some presag'd the dire event
 and saw what sacrifice ulysses meant
 for twice five days the good old seer withstood
 th' intended treason and was dumb to blood
 till tir'd with endless clamors and pursuit
 of ithacus he stood no longer mute
 but as it was agreed pronounc'd that i
 was destin'd by the wrathful gods to die
 all prais'd the sentence pleas'd the storm should fall
 on one alone whose fury threaten'd all
 the dismal day was come the priests prepare
 their leaven'd cakes and fillets for my hair
 i follow'd nature's laws and must avow
 i broke my bonds and fled the fatal blow
 hid in a weedy lake all night i lay
 secure of safety when they sail'd away
 but now what further hopes for me remain
 to see my friends or native soil again
 my tender infants or my careful sire
 whom they returning will to death require
 will perpetrate on them their first design
 and take the forfeit of their heads for mine
 which o if pity mortal minds can move
 if there be faith below or gods above
 if innocence and truth can claim desert
 ye trojans from an injur'd wretch avert'

 "false tears true pity move the king commands
 to loose his fetters and unbind his hands
 then adds these friendly words 'dismiss thy fears
 forget the greeks be mine as thou wert theirs
 but truly tell was it for force or guile
 or some religious end you rais'd the pile'
 thus said the king he full of fraudful arts
 this wellinvented tale for truth imparts
 'ye lamps of heav'n' he said and lifted high
 his hands now free 'thou venerable sky
 inviolable pow'rs ador'd with dread
 ye fatal fillets that once bound this head
 ye sacred altars from whose flames i fled
 be all of you adjur'd and grant i may
 without a crime th' ungrateful greeks betray
 reveal the secrets of the guilty state
 and justly punish whom i justly hate
 but you o king preserve the faith you gave
 if i to save myself your empire save
 the grecian hopes and all th' attempts they made
 were only founded on minerva's aid
 but from the time when impious diomede
 and false ulysses that inventive head
 her fatal image from the temple drew
 the sleeping guardians of the castle slew
 her virgin statue with their bloody hands
 polluted and profan'd her holy bands
 from thence the tide of fortune left their shore
 and ebb'd much faster than it flow'd before
 their courage languish'd as their hopes decay'd
 and pallas now averse refus'd her aid
 nor did the goddess doubtfully declare
 her alter'd mind and alienated care
 when first her fatal image touch'd the ground
 she sternly cast her glaring eyes around
 that sparkled as they roll'd and seem'd to threat
 her heav'nly limbs distill'd a briny sweat
 thrice from the ground she leap'd was seen to wield
 her brandish'd lance and shake her horrid shield
 then calchas bade our host for flight
 and hope no conquest from the tedious war
 till first they sail'd for greece with pray'rs besought
 her injur'd pow'r and better omens brought
 and now their navy plows the wat'ry main
 yet soon expect it on your shores again
 with pallas pleas'd as calchas did ordain
 but first to reconcile the blueey'd maid
 for her stol'n statue and her tow'r betray'd
 warn'd by the seer to her offended name
 we rais'd and dedicate this wondrous frame
 so lofty lest thro' your forbidden gates
 it pass and intercept our better fates
 for once admitted there our hopes are lost
 and troy may then a new palladium boast
 for so religion and the gods ordain
 that if you violate with hands profane
 minerva's gift your town in flames shall burn
 which omen o ye gods on graecia turn
 but if it climb with your assisting hands
 the trojan walls and in the city stands
 then troy shall argos and mycenae burn
 and the reverse of fate on us return'

 "with such deceits he gain'd their easy hearts
 too prone to credit his perfidious arts
 what diomede nor thetis' greater son
 a thousand ships nor ten years' siege had done
 false tears and fawning words the city won

 "a greater omen and of worse portent
 did our unwary minds with fear torment
 concurring to produce the dire event
 laocoon neptune's priest by lot that year
 with solemn pomp then sacrific'd a steer
 when dreadful to behold from sea we spied
 two serpents rank'd abreast the seas divide
 and smoothly sweep along the swelling tide
 their flaming crests above the waves they show
 their bellies seem to burn the seas below
 their speckled tails advance to steer their course
 and on the sounding shore the flying billows force
 and now the strand and now the plain they held
 their ardent eyes with bloody streaks were fill'd
 their nimble tongues they brandish'd as they came
 and lick'd their hissing jaws that sputter'd flame
 we fled amaz'd their destin'd way they take
 and to laocoon and his children make
 and first around the tender boys they wind
 then with their sharpen'd fangs their limbs and bodies grind
 the wretched father running to their aid
 with pious haste but vain they next invade
 twice round his waist their winding volumes roll'd
 and twice about his gasping throat they fold
 the priest thus doubly chok'd their crests divide
 and tow'ring o'er his head in triumph ride
 with both his hands he labors at the knots
 his holy fillets the blue venom blots
 his roaring fills the flitting air around
 thus when an ox receives a glancing wound
 he breaks his bands the fatal altar flies
 and with loud bellowings breaks the yielding skies
 their tasks perform'd the serpents quit their prey
 and to the tow'r of pallas make their way
 couch'd at her feet they lie protected there
 by her large buckler and protended spear
 amazement seizes all the gen'ral cry
 proclaims laocoon justly doom'd to die
 whose hand the will of pallas had withstood
 and dared to violate the sacred wood
 all vote t' admit the steed that vows be paid
 and incense offer'd to th' offended maid
 a spacious breach is made the town lies bare
 some hoistinglevers some the wheels prepare
 and fasten to the horse's feet the rest
 with cables haul along th' unwieldly beast
 each on his fellow for assistance calls
 at length the fatal fabric mounts the walls
 big with destruction boys with chaplets crown'd
 and choirs of virgins sing and dance around
 thus rais'd aloft and then descending down
 it enters o'er our heads and threats the town
 o sacred city built by hands divine
 o valiant heroes of the trojan line
 four times he struck as oft the clashing sound
 of arms was heard and inward groans rebound
 yet mad with zeal and blinded with our fate
 we haul along the horse in solemn state
 then place the dire portent within the tow'r
 cassandra cried and curs'd th' unhappy hour
 foretold our fate but by the god's decree
 all heard and none believ'd the prophecy
 with branches we the fanes adorn and waste
 in jollity the day ordain'd to be the last
 meantime the rapid heav'ns roll'd down the light
 and on the shaded ocean rush'd the night
 our men secure nor guards nor sentries held
 but easy sleep their weary limbs compell'd
 the grecians had embark'd their naval pow'rs
 from tenedos and sought our wellknown shores
 safe under covert of the silent night
 and guided by th' imperial galley's light
 when sinon favor'd by the partial gods
 unlock'd the horse and op'd his dark abodes
 restor'd to vital air our hidden foes
 who joyful from their long confinement rose
 tysander bold and sthenelus their guide
 and dire ulysses down the cable slide
 then thoas athamas and pyrrhus haste
 nor was the podalirian hero last
 nor injur'd menelaus nor the fam'd
 epeus who the fatal engine fram'd
 a nameless crowd succeed their forces join
 t' invade the town oppress'd with sleep and wine
 those few they find awake first meet their fate
 then to their fellows they unbar the gate

 "'t was in the dead of night when sleep repairs
 our bodies worn with toils our minds with cares
 when hector's ghost before my sight appears
 a bloody shroud he seem'd and bath'd in tears
 such as he was when by pelides slain
 thessalian coursers dragg'd him o'er the plain
 swoln were his feet as when the thongs were thrust
 thro' the bor'd holes his body black with dust
 unlike that hector who return'd from toils
 of war triumphant in aeacian spoils
 or him who made the fainting greeks retire
 and launch'd against their navy phrygian fire
 his hair and beard stood stiffen'd with his gore
 and all the wounds he for his country bore
 now stream'd afresh and with new purple ran
 i wept to see the visionary man
 and while my trance continued thus began
 'o light of trojans and support of troy
 thy father's champion and thy country's joy
 o long expected by thy friends from whence
 art thou so late return'd for our defense
 do we behold thee wearied as we are
 with length of labors and with toils of war
 after so many fun'rals of thy own
 art thou restor'd to thy declining town
 but say what wounds are these what new disgrace
 deforms the manly features of thy face'

 "to this the specter no reply did frame
 but answer'd to the cause for which he came
 and groaning from the bottom of his breast
 this warning in these mournful words express'd
 'o goddessborn escape by timely flight
 the flames and horrors of this fatal night
 the foes already have possess'd the wall
 troy nods from high and totters to her fall
 enough is paid to priam's royal name
 more than enough to duty and to fame
 if by a mortal hand my father's throne
 could be defended 't was by mine alone
 now troy to thee commends her future state
 and gives her gods companions of thy fate
 from their assistance walls expect
 which wand'ring long at last thou shalt erect'
 he said and brought me from their blest abodes
 the venerable statues of the gods
 with ancient vesta from the sacred choir
 the wreaths and relics of th' immortal fire

 "now peals of shouts come thund'ring from afar
 cries threats and loud laments and mingled war
 the noise approaches tho' our palace stood
 aloof from streets encompass'd with a wood
 louder and yet more loud i hear th' alarms
 of human cries distinct and clashing arms
 fear broke my slumbers i no longer stay
 but mount the terrace thence the town survey
 and hearken what the frightful sounds convey
 thus when a flood of fire by wind is borne
 crackling it rolls and mows the standing corn
 or deluges descending on the plains
 sweep o'er the yellow year destroy the pains
 of lab'ring oxen and the peasant's gains
 unroot the forest oaks and bear away
 flocks folds and trees and undistinguish'd prey
 the shepherd climbs the cliff and sees from far
 the wasteful ravage of the wat'ry war
 then hector's faith was manifestly clear'd
 and grecian frauds in open light appear'd
 the palace of deiphobus ascends
 in smoky flames and catches on his friends
 ucalegon burns next the seas are bright
 with splendor not their own and shine with trojan light
 new clamors and new clangors now arise
 the sound of trumpets mix'd with fighting cries
 with frenzy seiz'd i run to meet th' alarms
 resolv'd on death resolv'd to die in arms
 but first to gather friends with them t' oppose
 if fortune favor'd and repel the foes
 spurr'd by my courage by my country fir'd
 with sense of honor and revenge inspir'd

 "pantheus apollo's priest a sacred name
 had scap'd the grecian swords and pass'd the flame
 with relics loaden to my doors he fled
 and by the hand his tender grandson led
 'what hope o pantheus whither can we run
 where make a stand and what may yet be done'
 scarce had i said when pantheus with a groan
 'troy is no more and ilium was a town
 the fatal day th' appointed hour is come
 when wrathful jove's irrevocable doom
 transfers the trojan state to grecian hands
 the fire consumes the town the foe commands
 and armed hosts an unexpected force
 break from the bowels of the fatal horse
 within the gates proud sinon throws about
 the flames and foes for entrance press without
 with thousand others whom i fear to name
 more than from argos or mycenae came
 to sev'ral posts their parties they divide
 some block the narrow streets some scour the wide
 the bold they kill th' unwary they surprise
 who fights finds death and death finds him who flies
 the warders of the gate but scarce maintain
 th' unequal combat and resist in vain'

 "i heard and heav'n that wellborn souls inspires
 prompts me thro' lifted swords and rising fires
 to run where clashing arms and clamor calls
 and rush undaunted to defend the walls
 ripheus and iph'itus by my side engage
 for valor one renown'd and one for age
 dymas and hypanis by moonlight knew
 my motions and my mien and to my party drew
 with young coroebus who by love was led
 to win renown and fair cassandra's bed
 and lately brought his troops to priam's aid
 forewarn'd in vain by the prophetic maid
 whom when i saw resolv'd in arms to fall
 and that one spirit animated all
 'brave souls' said i 'but brave alas in vain
 come finish what our cruel fates ordain
 you see the desp'rate state of our affairs
 and heav'n's protecting pow'rs are deaf to pray'rs
 the passive gods behold the greeks defile
 their temples and abandon to the spoil
 their own abodes we feeble few conspire
 to save a sinking town involv'd in fire
 then let us fall but fall amidst our foes
 despair of life the means of living shows'
 so bold a speech incourag'd their desire
 of death and added fuel to their fire

 "as hungry wolves with raging appetite
 scour thro' the fields nor fear the stormy night
 their whelps at home expect the promis'd food
 and long to temper their dry chaps in blood
 so rush'd we forth at once resolv'd to die
 resolv'd in death the last extremes to try
 we leave the narrow lanes behind and dare
 th' unequal combat in the public square
 night was our friend our leader was despair
 what tongue can tell the slaughter of that night
 what eyes can weep the sorrows and affright
 an ancient and imperial city falls
 the streets are fill'd with frequent funerals
 houses and holy temples float in blood
 and hostile nations make a common flood
 not only trojans fall but in their turn
 the vanquish'd triumph and the victors mourn
 ours take new courage from despair and night
 confus'd the fortune is confus'd the fight
 all parts resound with tumults plaints and fears
 and grisly death in sundry shapes appears
 androgeos fell among us with his band
 who thought us grecians newly come to land
 'from whence' said he 'my friends this long delay
 you loiter while the spoils are borne away
 our ships are laden with the trojan store
 and you like truants come too late ashore'
 he said but soon corrected his mistake
 found by the doubtful answers which we make
 amaz'd he would have shunn'd th' unequal fight
 but we more num'rous intercept his flight
 as when some peasant in a bushy brake
 has with unwary footing press'd a snake
 he starts aside astonish'd when he spies
 his rising crest blue neck and rolling eyes
 so from our arms surpris'd androgeos flies
 in vain for him and his we compass'd round
 possess'd with fear unknowing of the ground
 and of their lives an easy conquest found
 thus fortune on our first endeavor smil'd
 coroebus then with youthful hopes beguil'd
 swoln with success and a daring mind
 this new invention fatally design'd
 'my friends' said he 'since fortune shows the way
 't is fit we should th' auspicious guide obey
 for what has she these grecian arms bestow'd
 but their destruction and the trojans' good
 then change we shields and their devices bear
 let fraud supply the want of force in war
 they find us arms' this said himself he dress'd
 in dead androgeos' spoils his upper vest
 his painted buckler and his plumy crest
 thus ripheus dymas all the trojan train
 lay down their own attire and strip the slain
 mix'd with the greeks we go with ill presage
 flatter'd with hopes to glut our greedy rage
 unknown assaulting whom we blindly meet
 and strew with grecian carcasses the street
 thus while their straggling parties we defeat
 some to the shore and safer ships retreat
 and some oppress'd with more ignoble fear
 remount the hollow horse and pant in secret there

 "but ah what use of valor can be made
 when heav'n's propitious pow'rs refuse their aid
 behold the royal prophetess the fair
 cassandra dragg'd by her dishevel'd hair
 whom not minerva's shrine nor sacred bands
 in safety could protect from sacrilegious hands
 on heav'n she cast her eyes she sigh'd she cried
 't was all she could her tender arms were tied
 so sad a sight coroebus could not bear
 but fir'd with rage distracted with despair
 amid the barb'rous ravishers he flew
 our leader's rash example we pursue
 but storms of stones from the proud temple's height
 pour down and on our batter'd helms alight
 we from our friends receiv'd this fatal blow
 who thought us grecians as we seem'd in show
 they aim at the mistaken crests from high
 and ours beneath the pond'rous ruin lie
 then mov'd with anger and disdain to see
 their troops dispers'd the royal virgin free
 the grecians rally and their pow'rs unite
 with fury charge us and renew the fight
 the brother kings with ajax join their force
 and the whole squadron of thessalian horse

 "thus when the rival winds their quarrel try
 contending for the kingdom of the sky
 south east and west on airy coursers borne
 the whirlwind gathers and the woods are torn
 then nereus strikes the deep the billows rise
 and mix'd with ooze and sand pollute the skies
 the troops we squander'd first again appear
 from several quarters and enclose the rear
 they first observe and to the rest betray
 our diff'rent speech our borrow'd arms survey
 oppress'd with odds we fall coroebus first
 at pallas' altar by peneleus pierc'd
 then ripheus follow'd in th' unequal fight
 just of his word observant of the right
 heav'n thought not so dymas their fate attends
 with hypanis mistaken by their friends
 nor pantheus thee thy miter nor the bands
 of awful phoebus sav'd from impious hands
 ye trojan flames your testimony bear
 what i perform'd and what i suffer'd there
 no sword avoiding in the fatal strife
 expos'd to death and prodigal of life
 witness ye heavens i live not by my fault
 i strove to have deserv'd the death i sought
 but when i could not fight and would have died
 borne off to distance by the growing tide
 old iphitus and i were hurried thence
 with pelias wounded and without defense
 new clamors from th' invested palace ring
 we run to die or disengage the king
 so hot th' assault so high the tumult rose
 while ours defend and while the greeks oppose
 as all the dardan and argolic race
 had been contracted in that narrow space
 or as all ilium else were void of fear
 and tumult war and slaughter only there
 their targets in a tortoise cast the foes
 secure advancing to the turrets rose
 some mount the scaling ladders some more bold
 swerve upwards and by posts and pillars hold
 their left hand gripes their bucklers in th' ascent
 while with their right they seize the battlement
 from their demolish'd tow'rs the trojans throw
 huge heaps of stones that falling crush the foe
 and heavy beams and rafters from the sides
 such arms their last necessity provides
 and gilded roofs come tumbling from on high
 the marks of state and ancient royalty
 the guards below fix'd in the pass attend
 the charge undaunted and the gate defend
 renew'd in courage with recover'd breath
 a second time we ran to tempt our death
 to clear the palace from the foe succeed
 the weary living and revenge the dead

 "a postern door yet unobserv'd and free
 join'd by the length of a blind gallery
 to the king's closet led a way well known
 to hector's wife while priam held the throne
 thro' which she brought astyanax unseen
 to cheer his grandsire and his grandsire's queen
 thro' this we pass and mount the tow'r from whence
 with unavailing arms the trojans make defense
 from this the trembling king had oft descried
 the grecian camp and saw their navy ride
 beams from its lofty height with swords we hew
 then wrenching with our hands th' assault renew
 and where the rafters on the columns meet
 we push them headlong with our arms and feet
 the lightning flies not swifter than the fall
 nor thunder louder than the ruin'd wall
 down goes the top at once the greeks beneath
 are piecemeal torn or pounded into death
 yet more succeed and more to death are sent
 we cease not from above nor they below relent
 before the gate stood pyrrhus threat'ning loud
 with glitt'ring arms conspicuous in the crowd
 so shines renew'd in youth the crested snake
 who slept the winter in a thorny brake
 and casting off his slough when spring returns
 now looks aloft and with new glory burns
 restor'd with poisonous herbs his ardent sides
 reflect the sun and rais'd on spires he rides
 high o'er the grass hissing he rolls along
 and brandishes by fits his forky tongue
 proud periphas and fierce automedon
 his father's charioteer together run
 to force the gate the scyrian infantry
 rush on in crowds and the barr'd passage free
 ent'ring the court with shouts the skies they rend
 and flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend
 himself among the foremost deals his blows
 and with his ax repeated strokes bestows
 on the strong doors then all their shoulders ply
 till from the posts the brazen hinges fly
 he hews apace the double bars at length
 yield to his ax and unresisted strength
 a mighty breach is made the rooms conceal'd
 appear and all the palace is reveal'd
 the halls of audience and of public state
 and where the lonely queen in secret sate
 arm'd soldiers now by trembling maids are seen
 with not a door and scarce a space between
 the house is fill'd with loud laments and cries
 and shrieks of women rend the vaulted skies
 the fearful matrons run from place to place
 and kiss the thresholds and the posts embrace
 the fatal work inhuman pyrrhus plies
 and all his father sparkles in his eyes
 nor bars nor fighting guards his force sustain
 the bars are broken and the guards are slain
 in rush the greeks and all the apartments fill
 those few defendants whom they find they kill
 not with so fierce a rage the foaming flood
 roars when he finds his rapid course withstood
 bears down the dams with unresisted sway
 and sweeps the cattle and the cots away
 these eyes beheld him when he march'd between
 the brother kings i saw th' unhappy queen
 the hundred wives and where old priam stood
 to stain his hallow'd altar with his brood
 the fifty nuptial beds such hopes had he
 so large a promise of a progeny
 the posts of plated gold and hung with spoils
 fell the reward of the proud victor's toils
 where'er the raging fire had left a space
 the grecians enter and possess the place

 "perhaps you may of priam's fate enquire
 he when he saw his regal town on fire
 his ruin'd palace and his ent'ring foes
 on ev'ry side inevitable woes
 in arms disus'd invests his limbs decay'd
 like them with age a late and useless aid
 his feeble shoulders scarce the weight sustain
 loaded not arm'd he creeps along with pain
 despairing of success ambitious to be slain
 uncover'd but by heav'n there stood in view
 an altar near the hearth a laurel grew
 dodder'd with age whose boughs encompass round
 the household gods and shade the holy ground
 here hecuba with all her helpless train
 of dames for shelter sought but sought in vain
 driv'n like a flock of doves along the sky
 their images they hug and to their altars fly
 the queen when she beheld her trembling lord
 and hanging by his side a heavy sword
 'what rage' she cried 'has seiz'd my husband's mind
 what arms are these and to what use design'd
 these times want other aids were hector here
 ev'n hector now in vain like priam would appear
 with us one common shelter thou shalt find
 or in one common fate with us be join'd'
 she said and with a last salute embrac'd
 the poor old man and by the laurel plac'd
 behold polites one of priam's sons
 pursued by pyrrhus there for safety runs
 thro' swords and foes amaz'd and hurt he flies
 thro' empty courts and open galleries
 him pyrrhus urging with his lance pursues
 and often reaches and his thrusts renews
 the youth transfix'd with lamentable cries
 expires before his wretched parent's eyes
 whom gasping at his feet when priam saw
 the fear of death gave place to nature's law
 and shaking more with anger than with age
 'the gods' said he 'requite thy brutal rage
 as sure they will barbarian sure they must
 if there be gods in heav'n and gods be just
 who tak'st in wrongs an insolent delight
 with a son's death t' infect a father's sight
 not he whom thou and lying fame conspire
 to call thee his not he thy vaunted sire
 thus us'd my wretched age the gods he fear'd
 the laws of nature and of nations heard
 he cheer'd my sorrows and for sums of gold
 the bloodless carcass of my hector sold
 pitied the woes a parent underwent
 and sent me back in safety from his tent'

 "this said his feeble hand a javelin threw
 which flutt'ring seem'd to loiter as it flew
 just and but barely to the mark it held
 and faintly tinkled on the brazen shield

 "then pyrrhus thus 'go thou from me to fate
 and to my father my foul deeds relate
 now die' with that he dragg'd the trembling sire
 slidd'ring thro' clotter'd blood and holy mire
 the mingled paste his murder'd son had made
 haul'd from beneath the violated shade
 and on the sacred pile the royal victim laid
 his right hand held his bloody falchion bare
 his left he twisted in his hoary hair
 then with a speeding thrust his heart he found
 the lukewarm blood came rushing thro' the wound
 and sanguine streams distain'd the sacred ground
 thus priam fell and shar'd one common fate
 with troy in ashes and his ruin'd state
 he who the scepter of all asia sway'd
 whom monarchs like domestic slaves obey'd
 on the bleak shore now lies th' abandon'd king
 a headless carcass and a nameless thing

 "then not before i felt my cruddled blood
 congeal with fear my hair with horror stood
 my father's image fill'd my pious mind
 lest equal years might equal fortune find
 again i thought on my forsaken wife
 and trembled for my son's abandon'd life
 i look'd about but found myself alone
 deserted at my need my friends were gone
 some spent with toil some with despair oppress'd
 leap'd headlong from the heights the flames consum'd the rest
 thus wand'ring in my way without a guide
 the graceless helen in the porch i spied
 of vesta's temple there she lurk'd alone
 muffled she sate and what she could unknown
 but by the flames that cast their blaze around
 that common bane of greece and troy i found
 for ilium burnt she dreads the trojan sword
 more dreads the vengeance of her injur'd lord
 ev'n by those gods who refug'd her abhorr'd
 trembling with rage the strumpet i regard
 resolv'd to give her guilt the due reward
 'shall she triumphant sail before the wind
 and leave in flames unhappy troy behind
 shall she her kingdom and her friends review
 in state attended with a captive crew
 while unreveng'd the good old priam falls
 and grecian fires consume the trojan walls
 for this the phrygian fields and xanthian flood
 were swell'd with bodies and were drunk with blood
 't is true a soldier can small honor gain
 and boast no conquest from a woman slain
 yet shall the fact not pass without applause
 of vengeance taken in so just a cause
 the punish'd crime shall set my soul at ease
 and murm'ring manes of my friends appease'
 thus while i rave a gleam of pleasing light
 spread o'er the place and shining heav'nly bright
 my mother stood reveal'd before my sight
 never so radiant did her eyes appear
 not her own star confess'd a light so clear
 great in her charms as when on gods above
 she looks and breathes herself into their love
 she held my hand the destin'd blow to break
 then from her rosy lips began to speak
 'my son from whence this madness this neglect
 of my commands and those whom i protect
 why this unmanly rage recall to mind
 whom you forsake what pledges leave behind
 look if your helpless father yet survive
 or if ascanius or creusa live
 around your house the greedy grecians err
 and these had perish'd in the nightly war
 but for my presence and protecting care
 not helen's face nor paris was in fault
 but by the gods was this destruction brought
 now cast your eyes around while i dissolve
 the mists and films that mortal eyes involve
 purge from your sight the dross and make you see
 the shape of each avenging deity
 enlighten'd thus my just commands fulfil
 nor fear obedience to your mother's will
 where yon disorder'd heap of ruin lies
 stones rent from stones where clouds of dust arise
 amid that smother neptune holds his place
 below the wall's foundation drives his mace
 and heaves the building from the solid base
 look where in arms imperial juno stands
 full in the scaean gate with loud commands
 urging on shore the tardy grecian bands
 see pallas of her snaky buckler proud
 bestrides the tow'r refulgent thro' the cloud
 see jove new courage to the foe supplies
 and arms against the town the partial deities
 haste hence my son this fruitless labor end
 haste where your trembling spouse and sire attend
 haste and a mother's care your passage shall befriend'
 she said and swiftly vanish'd from my sight
 obscure in clouds and gloomy shades of night
 i look'd i listen'd dreadful sounds i hear
 and the dire forms of hostile gods appear
 troy sunk in flames i saw nor could prevent
 and ilium from its old foundations rent
 rent like a mountain ash which dar'd the winds
 and stood the sturdy strokes of lab'ring hinds
 about the roots the cruel ax resounds
 the stumps are pierc'd with oftrepeated wounds
 the war is felt on high the nodding crown
 now threats a fall and throws the leafy honors down
 to their united force it yields tho' late
 and mourns with mortal groans th' approaching fate
 the roots no more their upper load sustain
 but down she falls and spreads a ruin thro' the plain

 "descending thence i scape thro' foes and fire
 before the goddess foes and flames retire
 arriv'd at home he for whose only sake
 or most for his such toils i undertake
 the good anchises whom by timely flight
 i purpos'd to secure on ida's height
 refus'd the journey resolute to die
 and add his fun'rals to the fate of troy
 rather than exile and old age sustain
 'go you whose blood runs warm in ev'ry vein
 had heav'n decreed that i should life enjoy
 heav'n had decreed to save unhappy troy
 't is sure enough if not too much for one
 twice to have seen our ilium overthrown
 make haste to save the poor remaining crew
 and give this useless corpse a long adieu
 these weak old hands suffice to stop my breath
 at least the pitying foes will aid my death
 to take my spoils and leave my body bare
 as for my sepulcher let heav'n take care
 't is long since i for my celestial wife
 loath'd by the gods have dragg'd a ling'ring life
 since ev'ry hour and moment i expire
 blasted from heav'n by jove's avenging fire'
 this oft repeated he stood fix'd to die
 myself my wife my son my family
 intreat pray beg and raise a doleful cry
 'what will he still persist on death resolve
 and in his ruin all his house involve'
 he still persists his reasons to maintain
 our pray'rs our tears our loud laments are vain

 "urg'd by despair again i go to try
 the fate of arms resolv'd in fight to die
 'what hope remains but what my death must give
 can i without so dear a father live
 you term it prudence what i baseness call
 could such a word from such a parent fall
 if fortune please and so the gods ordain
 that nothing should of ruin'd troy remain
 and you conspire with fortune to be slain
 the way to death is wide th' approaches near
 for soon relentless pyrrhus will appear
 reeking with priam's blood the wretch who slew
 the son inhuman in the father's view
 and then the sire himself to the dire altar drew
 o goddess mother give me back to fate
 your gift was undesir'd and came too late
 did you for this unhappy me convey
 thro' foes and fires to see my house a prey
 shall i my father wife and son behold
 welt'ring in blood each other's arms infold
 haste gird my sword tho' spent and overcome
 't is the last summons to receive our doom
 i hear thee fate and i obey thy call
 not unreveng'd the foe shall see my fall
 restore me to the yet unfinish'd fight
 my death is wanting to conclude the night'
 arm'd once again my glitt'ring sword i wield
 while th' other hand sustains my weighty shield
 and forth i rush to seek th' abandon'd field
 i went but sad creusa stopp'd my way
 and cross the threshold in my passage lay
 embrac'd my knees and when i would have gone
 shew'd me my feeble sire and tender son
 'if death be your design at least' said she
 'take us along to share your destiny
 if any farther hopes in arms remain
 this place these pledges of your love maintain
 to whom do you expose your father's life
 your son's and mine your now forgotten wife'
 while thus she fills the house with clam'rous cries
 our hearing is diverted by our eyes
 for while i held my son in the short space
 betwixt our kisses and our last embrace
 strange to relate from young iulus' head
 a lambent flame arose which gently spread
 around his brows and on his temples fed
 amaz'd with running water we prepare
 to quench the sacred fire and slake his hair
 but old anchises vers'd in omens rear'd
 his hands to heav'n and this request preferr'd
 'if any vows almighty jove can bend
 thy will if piety can pray'rs commend
 confirm the glad presage which thou art pleas'd to send'
 scarce had he said when on our left we hear
 a peal of rattling thunder roll in air
 there shot a streaming lamp along the sky
 which on the winged lightning seem'd to fly
 from o'er the roof the blaze began to move
 and trailing vanish'd in th' idaean grove
 it swept a path in heav'n and shone a guide
 then in a steaming stench of sulphur died

 "the good old man with suppliant hands implor'd
 the gods' protection and their star ador'd
 'now now' said he 'my son no more delay
 i yield i follow where heav'n shews the way
 keep o my country gods our dwelling place
 and guard this relic of the trojan race
 this tender child these omens are your own
 and you can yet restore the ruin'd town
 at least accomplish what your signs foreshow
 i stand resign'd and am prepar'd to go'

 "he said the crackling flames appear on high
 and driving sparkles dance along the sky
 with vulcan's rage the rising winds conspire
 and near our palace roll the flood of fire
 'haste my dear father 't is no time to wait
 and load my shoulders with a willing freight
 whate'er befalls your life shall be my care
 one death or one deliv'rance we will share
 my hand shall lead our little son and you
 my faithful consort shall our steps pursue
 next you my servants heed my strict commands
 without the walls a ruin'd temple stands
 to ceres hallow'd once a cypress nigh
 shoots up her venerable head on high
 by long religion kept there bend your feet
 and in divided parties let us meet
 our country gods the relics and the bands
 hold you my father in your guiltless hands
 in me 't is impious holy things to bear
 red as i am with slaughter new from war
 till in some living stream i cleanse the guilt
 of dire debate and blood in battle spilt'
 thus ord'ring all that prudence could provide
 i clothe my shoulders with a lion's hide
 and yellow spoils then on my bending back
 the welcome load of my dear father take
 while on my better hand ascanius hung
 and with unequal paces tripp'd along
 creusa kept behind by choice we stray
 thro' ev'ry dark and ev'ry devious way
 i who so bold and dauntless just before
 the grecian darts and shock of lances bore
 at ev'ry shadow now am seiz'd with fear
 not for myself but for the charge i bear
 till near the ruin'd gate arriv'd at last
 secure and deeming all the danger past
 a frightful noise of trampling feet we hear
 my father looking thro' the shades with fear
 cried out 'haste haste my son the foes are nigh
 their swords and shining armor i descry'
 some hostile god for some unknown offense
 had sure bereft my mind of better sense
 for while thro' winding ways i took my flight
 and sought the shelter of the gloomy night
 alas i lost creusa hard to tell
 if by her fatal destiny she fell
 or weary sate or wander'd with affright
 but she was lost for ever to my sight
 i knew not or reflected till i meet
 my friends at ceres' now deserted seat
 we met not one was wanting only she
 deceiv'd her friends her son and wretched me

 "what mad expressions did my tongue refuse
 whom did i not of gods or men accuse
 this was the fatal blow that pain'd me more
 than all i felt from ruin'd troy before
 stung with my loss and raving with despair
 abandoning my now forgotten care
 of counsel comfort and of hope bereft
 my sire my son my country gods i left
 in shining armor once again i sheathe
 my limbs not feeling wounds nor fearing death
 then headlong to the burning walls i run
 and seek the danger i was forc'd to shun
 i tread my former tracks thro' night explore
 each passage ev'ry street i cross'd before
 all things were full of horror and affright
 and dreadful ev'n the silence of the night
 then to my father's house i make repair
 with some small glimpse of hope to find her there
 instead of her the cruel greeks i met
 the house was fill'd with foes with flames beset
 driv'n on the wings of winds whole sheets of fire
 thro' air transported to the roofs aspire
 from thence to priam's palace i resort
 and search the citadel and desart court
 then unobserv'd i pass by juno's church
 a guard of grecians had possess'd the porch
 there phoenix and ulysses watch prey
 and thither all the wealth of troy convey
 the spoils which they from ransack'd houses brought
 and golden bowls from burning altars caught
 the tables of the gods the purple vests
 the people's treasure and the pomp of priests
 a rank of wretched youths with pinion'd hands
 and captive matrons in long order stands
 then with ungovern'd madness i proclaim
 thro' all the silent street creusa's name
 creusa still i call at length she hears
 and sudden thro' the shades of night appears
 appears no more creusa nor my wife
 but a pale specter larger than the life
 aghast astonish'd and struck dumb with fear
 i stood like bristles rose my stiffen'd hair
 then thus the ghost began to soothe my grief
 'nor tears nor cries can give the dead relief
 desist my muchlov'd lord't indulge your pain
 you bear no more than what the gods ordain
 my fates permit me not from hence to fly
 nor he the great controller of the sky
 long wand'ring ways for you the pow'rs decree
 on land hard labors and a length of sea
 then after many painful years are past
 on latium's happy shore you shall be cast
 where gentle tiber from his bed beholds
 the flow'ry meadows and the feeding folds
 there end your toils and there your fates provide
 a quiet kingdom and a royal bride
 there fortune shall the trojan line restore
 and you for lost creusa weep no more
 fear not that i shall watch with servile shame
 th' imperious looks of some proud grecian dame
 or stooping to the victor's lust disgrace
 my goddess mother or my royal race
 and now farewell the parent of the gods
 restrains my fleeting soul in her abodes
 i trust our common issue to your care'
 she said and gliding pass'd unseen in air
 i strove to speak but horror tied my tongue
 and thrice about her neck my arms i flung
 and thrice deceiv'd on vain embraces hung
 light as an empty dream at break of day
 or as a blast of wind she rush'd away

 "thus having pass'd the night in fruitless pain
 i to my longing friends return again
 amaz'd th' augmented number to behold
 of men and matrons mix'd of young and old
 a wretched exil'd crew together brought
 with arms appointed and with treasure fraught
 resolv'd and willing under my command
 to run all hazards both of sea and land
 the morn began from ida to display
 her rosy cheeks and phosphor led the day
 before the gates the grecians took their post
 and all pretense of late relief was lost
 i yield to fate unwillingly retire
 and loaded up the hill convey my sire"




 book iii

 "when heav'n had overturn'd the trojan state
 and priam's throne by too severe a fate
 when ruin'd troy became the grecians' prey
 and ilium's lofty tow'rs in ashes lay
 warn'd by celestial omens we retreat
 to seek in foreign lands a happier seat
 near old antandros and at ida's foot
 the timber of the sacred groves we cut
 and build our fleet uncertain yet to find
 what place the gods for our repose assign'd
 friends daily flock and scarce the kindly spring
 began to clothe the ground and birds to sing
 when old anchises summon'd all to sea
 the crew my father and the fates obey
 with sighs and tears i leave my native shore
 and empty fields where ilium stood before
 my sire my son our less and greater gods
 all sail at once and cleave the briny floods

 "against our coast appears a spacious land
 which once the fierce lycurgus did command
 thracia the name the people bold in war
 vast are their fields and tillage is their care
 a hospitable realm while fate was kind
 with troy in friendship and religion join'd
 i land with luckless omens then adore
 their gods and draw a line along the shore
 i lay the deep foundations of a wall
 and aenos nam'd from me the city call
 to dionaean venus vows are paid
 and all the pow'rs that rising labors aid
 a bull on jove's imperial altar laid
 not far a rising hillock stood in view
 sharp myrtles on the sides and cornels grew
 there while i went to crop the sylvan scenes
 and shade our altar with their leafy greens
 i pull'd a plant with horror i relate
 a prodigy so strange and full of fate
 the rooted fibers rose and from the wound
 black bloody drops distill'd upon the ground
 mute and amaz'd my hair with terror stood
 fear shrunk my sinews and congeal'd my blood
 mann'd once again another plant i try
 that other gush'd with the same sanguine dye
 then fearing guilt for some offense unknown
 with pray'rs and vows the dryads i atone
 with all the sisters of the woods and most
 the god of arms who rules the thracian coast
 that they or he these omens would avert
 release our fears and better signs impart
 clear'd as i thought and fully fix'd at length
 to learn the cause i tugged with all my strength
 i bent my knees against the ground once more
 the violated myrtle ran with gore
 scarce dare i tell the sequel from the womb
 of wounded earth and caverns of the tomb
 a groan as of a troubled ghost renew'd
 my fright and then these dreadful words ensued
 'why dost thou thus my buried body rend
 o spare the corpse of thy unhappy friend
 spare to pollute thy pious hands with blood
 the tears distil not from the wounded wood
 but ev'ry drop this living tree contains
 is kindred blood and ran in trojan veins
 o fly from this unhospitable shore
 warn'd by my fate for i am polydore
 here loads of lances in my blood embrued
 again shoot upward by my blood renew'd'

 "my falt'ring tongue and shiv'ring limbs declare
 my horror and in bristles rose my hair
 when troy with grecian arms was closely pent
 old priam fearful of the war's event
 this hapless polydore to thracia sent
 loaded with gold he sent his darling far
 from noise and tumults and destructive war
 committed to the faithless tyrant's care
 who when he saw the pow'r of troy decline
 forsook the weaker with the strong to join
 broke ev'ry bond of nature and of truth
 and murder'd for his wealth the royal youth
 o sacred hunger of pernicious gold
 what bands of faith can impious lucre hold
 now when my soul had shaken off her fears
 i call my father and the trojan peers
 relate the prodigies of heav'n require
 what he commands and their advice desire
 all vote to leave that execrable shore
 polluted with the blood of polydore
 but ere we sail his fun'ral rites prepare
 then to his ghost a tomb and altars rear
 in mournful pomp the matrons walk the round
 with baleful cypress and blue fillets crown'd
 with eyes dejected and with hair unbound
 then bowls of tepid milk and blood we pour
 and thrice invoke the soul of polydore

 "now when the raging storms no longer reign
 but southern gales invite us to the main
 we launch our vessels with a prosp'rous wind
 and leave the cities and the shores behind

 "an island in th' aegaean main appears
 neptune and wat'ry doris claim it theirs
 it floated once till phoebus fix'd the sides
 to rooted earth and now it braves the tides
 here borne by friendly winds we come ashore
 with needful ease our weary limbs restore
 and the sun's temple and his town adore

 "anius the priest and king with laurel crown'd
 his hoary locks with purple fillets bound
 who saw my sire the delian shore ascend
 came forth with eager haste to meet his friend
 invites him to his palace and in sign
 of ancient love their plighted hands they join
 then to the temple of the god i went
 and thus before the shrine my vows present
 'give o thymbraeus give a resting place
 to the sad relics of the trojan race
 a seat secure a region of their own
 a lasting empire and a happier town
 where shall we fix where shall our labors end
 whom shall we follow and what fate attend
 let not my pray'rs a doubtful answer find
 but in clear auguries unveil thy mind'
 scarce had i said he shook the holy ground
 the laurels and the lofty hills around
 and from the tripos rush'd a bellowing sound
 prostrate we fell confess'd the present god
 who gave this answer from his dark abode
 'undaunted youths go seek that mother earth
 from which your ancestors derive their birth
 the soil that sent you forth her ancient race
 in her old bosom shall again embrace
 thro' the wide world th' aeneian house shall reign
 and children's children shall the crown sustain'
 thus phoebus did our future fates disclose
 a mighty tumult mix'd with joy arose

 "all are concern'd to know what place the god
 assign'd and where determin'd our abode
 my father long revolving in his mind
 the race and lineage of the trojan kind
 thus answer'd their demands 'ye princes hear
 your pleasing fortune and dispel your fear
 the fruitful isle of crete well known to fame
 sacred of old to jove's imperial name
 in the mid ocean lies with large command
 and on its plains a hundred cities stand
 another ida rises there and we
 from thence derive our trojan ancestry
 from thence as 't is divulg'd by certain fame
 to the rhoetean shores old teucrus came
 there fix'd and there the seat of empire chose
 ere ilium and the trojan tow'rs arose
 in humble vales they built their soft abodes
 till cybele the mother of the gods
 with tinkling cymbals charm'd th' idaean woods
 she secret rites and ceremonies taught
 and to the yoke the savage lions brought
 let us the land which heav'n appoints explore
 appease the winds and seek the gnossian shore
 if jove assists the passage of our fleet
 the third propitious dawn discovers crete'
 thus having said the sacrifices laid
 on smoking altars to the gods he paid
 a bull to neptune an oblation due
 another bull to bright apollo slew
 a milkwhite ewe the western winds to please
 and one coalblack to calm the stormy seas
 ere this a flying rumor had been spread
 that fierce idomeneus from crete was fled
 expell'd and exil'd that the coast was free
 from foreign or domestic enemy

 "we leave the delian ports and put to sea
 by naxos fam'd for vintage make our way
 then green donysa pass and sail in sight
 of paros' isle with marble quarries white
 we pass the scatter'd isles of cyclades
 that scarce distinguish'd seem to stud the seas
 the shouts of sailors double near the shores
 they stretch their canvas and they ply their oars
 'all hands aloft for crete for crete' they cry
 and swiftly thro' the foamy billows fly
 full on the promis'd land at length we bore
 with joy descending on the cretan shore
 with eager haste a rising town i frame
 which from the trojan pergamus i name
 the name itself was grateful i exhort
 to found their houses and erect a fort
 our ships are haul'd upon the yellow strand
 the youth begin to till the labor'd land
 and i myself new marriages promote
 give laws and dwellings i divide by lot
 when rising vapors choke the wholesome air
 and blasts of noisome winds corrupt the year
 the trees devouring caterpillars burn
 parch'd was the grass and blighted was the corn
 nor 'scape the beasts for sirius from on high
 with pestilential heat infects the sky
 my men some fall the rest in fevers fry
 again my father bids me seek the shore
 of sacred delos and the god implore
 to learn what end of woes we might expect
 and to what clime our weary course direct

 "'t was night when ev'ry creature void of cares
 the common gift of balmy slumber shares
 the statues of my gods for such they seem'd
 those gods whom i from flaming troy redeem'd
 before me stood majestically bright
 full in the beams of phoebe's ent'ring light
 then thus they spoke and eas'd my troubled mind
 'what from the delian god thou go'st to find
 he tells thee here and sends us to relate
 those pow'rs are we companions of thy fate
 who from the burning town by thee were brought
 thy fortune follow'd and thy safety wrought
 thro' seas and lands as we thy steps attend
 so shall our care thy glorious race befriend
 an ample realm for thee thy fates ordain
 a town that o'er the conquer'd world shall reign
 thou mighty walls for mighty nations build
 nor let thy weary mind to labors yield
 but change thy seat for not the delian god
 nor we have giv'n thee crete for our abode
 a land there is hesperia call'd of old
 the soil is fruitful and the natives bold
 th' oenotrians held it once by later fame
 now call'd italia from the leader's name
 lasius there and dardanus were born
 from thence we came and thither must return
 rise and thy sire with these glad tidings greet
 search italy for jove denies thee crete'

 "astonish'd at their voices and their sight
 nor were they dreams but visions of the night
 i saw i knew their faces and descried
 in perfect view their hair with fillets tied
 i started from my couch a clammy sweat
 on all my limbs and shiv'ring body sate
 to heav'n i lift my hands with pious haste
 and sacred incense in the flames i cast
 thus to the gods their perfect honors done
 more cheerful to my good old sire i run
 and tell the pleasing news in little space
 he found his error of the double race
 not as before he deem'd deriv'd from crete
 no more deluded by the doubtful seat
 then said 'o son turmoil'd in trojan fate
 such things as these cassandra did relate
 this day revives within my mind what she
 foretold of troy renew'd in italy
 and latian lands but who could then have thought
 that phrygian gods to latium should be brought
 or who believ'd what mad cassandra taught
 now let us go where phoebus leads the way'

 "he said and we with glad consent obey
 forsake the seat and leaving few behind
 we spread our sails before the willing wind
 now from the sight of land our galleys move
 with only seas around and skies above
 when o'er our heads descends a burst of rain
 and night with sable clouds involves the main
 the ruffling winds the foamy billows raise
 the scatter'd fleet is forc'd to sev'ral ways
 the face of heav'n is ravish'd from our eyes
 and in redoubled peals the roaring thunder flies
 cast from our course we wander in the dark
 no stars to guide no point of land to mark
 ev'n palinurus no distinction found
 betwixt the night and day such darkness reign'd around
 three starless nights the doubtful navy strays
 without distinction and three sunless days
 the fourth renews the light and from our shrouds
 we view a rising land like distant clouds
 the mountaintops confirm the pleasing sight
 and curling smoke ascending from their height
 the canvas falls their oars the sailors ply
 from the rude strokes the whirling waters fly
 at length i land upon the strophades
 safe from the danger of the stormy seas
 those isles are compass'd by th' ionian main
 the dire abode where the foul harpies reign
 forc'd by the winged warriors to repair
 to their old homes and leave their costly fare
 monsters more fierce offended heav'n ne'er sent
 from hell's abyss for human punishment
 with virgin faces but with wombs obscene
 foul paunches and with ordure still unclean
 with claws for hands and looks for ever lean

 "we landed at the port and soon beheld
 fat herds of oxen graze the flow'ry field
 and wanton goats without a keeper stray'd
 with weapons we the welcome prey invade
 then call the gods for partners of our feast
 and jove himself the chief invited guest
 we spread the tables on the greensward ground
 we feed with hunger and the bowls go round
 when from the mountaintops with hideous cry
 and clatt'ring wings the hungry harpies fly
 they snatch the meat defiling all they find
 and parting leave a loathsome stench behind
 close by a hollow rock again we sit
 new dress the dinner and the beds refit
 secure from sight beneath a pleasing shade
 where tufted trees a native arbor made
 again the holy fires on altars burn
 and once again the rav'nous birds return
 or from the dark recesses where they lie
 or from another quarter of the sky
 with filthy claws their odious meal repeat
 and mix their loathsome ordures with their meat
 i bid my friends for vengeance then prepare
 and with the hellish nation wage the war
 they as commanded for the fight provide
 and in the grass their glitt'ring weapons hide
 then when along the crooked shore we hear
 their clatt'ring wings and saw the foes appear
 misenus sounds a charge we take th' alarm
 and our strong hands with swords and bucklers arm
 in this new kind of combat all employ
 their utmost force the monsters to destroy
 in vain the fated skin is proof to wounds
 and from their plumes the shining sword rebounds
 at length rebuff'd they leave their mangled prey
 and their stretch'd pinions to the skies display
 yet one remain'd the messenger of fate
 high on a craggy cliff celaeno sate
 and thus her dismal errand did relate
 'what not contented with our oxen slain
 dare you with heav'n an impious war maintain
 and drive the harpies from their native reign
 heed therefore what i say and keep in mind
 what jove decrees what phoebus has design'd
 and i the furies' queen from both relate
 you seek th' italian shores foredoom'd by fate
 th' italian shores are granted you to find
 and a safe passage to the port assign'd
 but know that ere your promis'd walls you build
 my curses shall severely be fulfill'd
 fierce famine is your lot for this misdeed
 reduc'd to grind the plates on which you feed'
 she said and to the neighb'ring forest flew
 our courage fails us and our fears renew
 hopeless to win by war to pray'rs we fall
 and on th' offended harpies humbly call
 and whether gods or birds obscene they were
 our vows for pardon and for peace prefer
 but old anchises off'ring sacrifice
 and lifting up to heav'n his hands and eyes
 ador'd the greater gods 'avert' said he
 'these omens render vain this prophecy
 and from th' impending curse a pious people free'

 "thus having said he bids us put to sea
 we loose from shore our haulsers and obey
 and soon with swelling sails pursue the wat'ry way
 amidst our course zacynthian woods appear
 and next by rocky neritos we steer
 we fly from ithaca's detested shore
 and curse the land which dire ulysses bore
 at length leucate's cloudy top appears
 and the sun's temple which the sailor fears
 resolv'd to breathe a while from labor past
 our crooked anchors from the prow we cast
 and joyful to the little city haste
 here safe beyond our hopes our vows we pay
 to jove the guide and patron of our way
 the customs of our country we pursue
 and trojan games on actian shores renew
 our youth their naked limbs besmear with oil
 and exercise the wrastlers' noble toil
 pleas'd to have sail'd so long before the wind
 and left so many grecian towns behind
 the sun had now fulfill'd his annual course
 and boreas on the seas display'd his force
 i fix'd upon the temple's lofty door
 the brazen shield which vanquish'd abas bore
 the verse beneath my name and action speaks
 'these arms aeneas took from conqu'ring greeks'
 then i command to weigh the seamen ply
 their sweeping oars the smoking billows fly
 the sight of high phaeacia soon we lost
 and skimm'd along epirus' rocky coast

 "then to chaonia's port our course we bend
 and landed to buthrotus' heights ascend
 here wondrous things were loudly blaz'd fame
 how helenus reviv'd the trojan name
 and reign'd in greece that priam's captive son
 succeeded pyrrhus in his bed and throne
 and fair andromache restor'd by fate
 once more was happy in a trojan mate
 i leave my galleys riding in the port
 and long to see the new dardanian court
 by chance the mournful queen before the gate
 then solemniz'd her former husband's fate
 green altars rais'd of turf with gifts she crown'd
 and sacred priests in order stand around
 and thrice the name of hapless hector sound
 the grove itself resembles ida's wood
 and simois seem'd the welldissembled flood
 but when at nearer distance she beheld
 my shining armor and my trojan shield
 astonish'd at the sight the vital heat
 forsakes her limbs her veins no longer beat
 she faints she falls and scarce recov'ring strength
 thus with a falt'ring tongue she speaks at length

 "'are you alive o goddessborn' she said
 'or if a ghost then where is hector's shade'
 at this she cast a loud and frightful cry
 with broken words i made this brief reply
 'all of me that remains appears in sight
 i live if living be to loathe the light
 no phantom but i drag a wretched life
 my fate resembling that of hector's wife
 what have you suffer'd since you lost your lord
 by what strange blessing are you now restor'd
 still are you hector's or is hector fled
 and his remembrance lost in pyrrhus' bed'
 with eyes dejected in a lowly tone
 after a modest pause she thus begun

 "'o only happy maid of priam's race
 whom death deliver'd from the foes' embrace
 commanded on achilles' tomb to die
 not forc'd like us to hard captivity
 or in a haughty master's arms to lie
 in grecian ships unhappy we were borne
 endur'd the victor's lust sustain'd the scorn
 thus i submitted to the lawless pride
 of pyrrhus more a handmaid than a bride
 cloy'd with possession he forsook my bed
 and helen's lovely daughter sought to wed
 then me to trojan helenus resign'd
 and his two slaves in equal marriage join'd
 till young orestes pierc'd with deep despair
 and longing to redeem the promis'd fair
 before apollo's altar slew the ravisher
 by pyrrhus' death the kingdom we regain'd
 at least one half with helenus remain'd
 our part from chaon he chaonia calls
 and names from pergamus his rising walls
 but you what fates have landed on our coast
 what gods have sent you or what storms have toss'd
 does young ascanius life and health enjoy
 sav'd from the ruins of unhappy troy
 o tell me how his mother's loss he bears
 what hopes are promis'd from his blooming years
 how much of hector in his face appears'
 she spoke and mix'd her speech with mournful cries
 and fruitless tears came trickling from her eyes

 "at length her lord descends upon the plain
 in pomp attended with a num'rous train
 receives his friends and to the city leads
 and tears of joy amidst his welcome sheds
 proceeding on another troy i see
 or in less compass troy's epitome
 a riv'let by the name of xanthus ran
 and i embrace the scaean gate again
 my friends in porticoes were entertain'd
 and feasts and pleasures thro' the city reign'd
 the tables fill'd the spacious hall around
 and golden bowls with sparkling wine were crown'd
 two days we pass'd in mirth till friendly gales
 blown from the south supplied our swelling sails
 then to the royal seer i thus began
 'o thou who know'st beyond the reach of man
 the laws of heav'n and what the stars decree
 whom phoebus taught unerring prophecy
 from his own tripod and his holy tree
 skill'd in the wing'd inhabitants of air
 what auspices their notes and flights declare
 o say for all religious rites portend
 a happy voyage and a prosp'rous end
 and ev'ry power and omen of the sky
 direct my course for destin'd italy
 but only dire celaeno from the gods
 a dismal famine fatally forebodes
 o say what dangers i am first to shun
 what toils vanquish and what course to run'

 "the prophet first with sacrifice adores
 the greater gods their pardon then implores
 unbinds the fillet from his holy head
 to phoebus next my trembling steps he led
 full of religious doubts and awful dread
 then with his god possess'd before the shrine
 these words proceeded from his mouth divine
 'o goddessborn for heav'n's appointed will
 with greater auspices of good than ill
 foreshows thy voyage and thy course directs
 thy fates conspire and jove himself protects
 of many things some few i shall explain
 teach thee to shun the dangers of the main
 and how at length the promis'd shore to gain
 the rest the fates from helenus conceal
 and juno's angry pow'r forbids to tell
 first then that happy shore that seems so nigh
 will far from your deluded wishes fly
 long tracts of seas divide your hopes from italy
 for you must cruise along sicilian shores
 and stem the currents with your struggling oars
 then round th' italian coast your navy steer
 and after this to circe's island veer
 and last before your new foundations rise
 must pass the stygian lake and view the nether skies
 now mark the signs of future ease and rest
 and bear them safely treasur'd in thy breast
 when in the shady shelter of a wood
 and near the margin of a gentle flood
 thou shalt behold a sow upon the ground
 with thirty sucking young encompass'd round
 the dam and offspring white as falling snow
 these on thy city shall their name bestow
 and there shall end thy labors and thy woe
 nor let the threaten'd famine fright thy mind
 for phoebus will assist and fate the way will find
 let not thy course to that ill coast be bent
 which fronts from far th' epirian continent
 those parts are all by grecian foes possess'd
 the salvage locrians here the shores infest
 there fierce idomeneus his city builds
 and guards with arms the salentinian fields
 and on the mountain's brow petilia stands
 which philoctetes with his troops commands
 ev'n when thy fleet is landed on the shore
 and priests with holy vows the gods adore
 then with a purple veil involve your eyes
 lest hostile faces blast the sacrifice
 these rites and customs to the rest commend
 that to your pious race they may descend

 "'when parted hence the wind that ready waits
 for sicily shall bear you to the straits
 where proud pelorus opes a wider way
 tack to the larboard and stand off to sea
 veer starboard sea and land th' italian shore
 and fair sicilia's coast were one before
 an earthquake caus'd the flaw the roaring tides
 the passage broke that land from land divides
 and where the lands retir'd the rushing ocean rides
 distinguish'd by the straits on either hand
 now rising cities in long order stand
 and fruitful fields so much can time invade
 the mold'ring work that beauteous nature made
 far on the right her dogs foul scylla hides
 charybdis roaring on the left presides
 and in her greedy whirlpool sucks the tides
 then spouts them from below with fury driv'n
 the waves mount up and wash the face of heav'n
 but scylla from her den with open jaws
 the sinking vessel in her eddy draws
 then dashes on the rocks a human face
 and virgin bosom hides her tail's disgrace
 her parts obscene below the waves descend
 with dogs inclos'd and in a dolphin end
 't is safer then to bear aloof to sea
 and coast pachynus tho' with more delay
 than once to view misshapen scylla near
 and the loud yell of wat'ry wolves to hear

 "'besides if faith to helenus be due
 and if prophetic phoebus tell me true
 do not this precept of your friend forget
 which therefore more than once i must repeat
 above the rest great juno's name adore
 pay vows to juno juno's aid implore
 let gifts be to the mighty queen design'd
 and mollify with pray'rs her haughty mind
 thus at the length your passage shall be free
 and you shall safe descend on italy
 arriv'd at cumae when you view the flood
 of black avernus and the sounding wood
 the mad prophetic sibyl you shall find
 dark in a cave and on a rock reclin'd
 she sings the fates and in her frantic fits
 the notes and names inscrib'd to leafs commits
 what she commits to leafs in order laid
 before the cavern's entrance are display'd
 unmov'd they lie but if a blast of wind
 without or vapors issue from behind
 the leafs are borne aloft in liquid air
 and she resumes no more her museful care
 nor gathers from the rocks her scatter'd verse
 nor sets in order what the winds disperse
 thus many not succeeding most upbraid
 the madness of the visionary maid
 and with loud curses leave the mystic shade

 "'think it not loss of time a while to stay
 tho' thy companions chide thy long delay
 tho' summon'd to the seas tho' pleasing gales
 invite thy course and stretch thy swelling sails
 but beg the sacred priestess to relate
 with willing words and not to write thy fate
 the fierce italian people she will show
 and all thy wars and all thy future woe
 and what thou may'st avoid and what must undergo
 she shall direct thy course instruct thy mind
 and teach thee how the happy shores to find
 this is what heav'n allows me to relate
 now part in peace pursue thy better fate
 and raise by strength of arms the trojan state'

 "this when the priest with friendly voice declar'd
 he gave me license and rich gifts prepar'd
 bounteous of treasure he supplied my want
 with heavy gold and polish'd elephant
 then dodonaean caldrons put on board
 and ev'ry ship with sums of silver stor'd
 a trusty coat of mail to me he sent
 thrice chain'd with gold for use and ornament
 the helm of pyrrhus added to the rest
 that flourish'd with a plume and waving crest
 nor was my sire forgotten nor my friends
 and large recruits he to my navy sends
 men horses captains arms and warlike stores
 supplies new pilots and new sweeping oars
 meantime my sire commands to hoist our sails
 lest we should lose the first auspicious gales

 "the prophet bless'd the parting crew and last
 with words like these his ancient friend embrac'd
 'old happy man the care of gods above
 whom heav'nly venus honor'd with her love
 and twice preserv'd thy life when troy was lost
 behold from far the wish'd ausonian coast
 there land but take a larger compass round
 for that before is all forbidden ground
 the shore that phoebus has design'd for you
 at farther distance lies conceal'd from view
 go happy hence and seek your new abodes
 blest in a son and favor'd by the gods
 for i with useless words prolong your stay
 when southern gales have summon'd you away'

 "nor less the queen our parting thence deplor'd
 nor was less bounteous than her trojan lord
 a noble present to my son she brought
 a robe with flow'rs on golden tissue wrought
 a phrygian vest and loads with gifts beside
 of precious texture and of asian pride
 'accept' she said 'these monuments of love
 which in my youth with happier hands i wove
 regard these trifles for the giver's sake
 't is the last present hector's wife can make
 thou call'st my lost astyanax to mind
 in thee his features and his form i find
 his eyes so sparkled with a lively flame
 such were his motions such was all his frame
 and ah had heav'n so pleas'd his years had been the same'

 "with tears i took my last adieu and said
 'your fortune happy pair already made
 leaves you no farther wish my diff'rent state
 avoiding one incurs another fate
 to you a quiet seat the gods allow
 you have no shores to search no seas to plow
 nor fields of flying italy to chase
 deluding visions and a vain embrace
 you see another simois and enjoy
 the labor of your hands another troy
 with better auspice than her ancient tow'rs
 and less obnoxious to the grecian pow'rs
 if e'er the gods whom i with vows adore
 conduct my steps to tiber's happy shore
 if ever i ascend the latian throne
 and build a city i may call my own
 as both of us our birth from troy derive
 so let our kindred lines in concord live
 and both in acts of equal friendship strive
 our fortunes good or bad shall be the same
 the double troy shall differ but in name
 that what we now begin may never end
 but long to late posterity descend'

 "near the ceraunian rocks our course we bore
 the shortest passage to th' italian shore
 now had the sun withdrawn his radiant light
 and hills were hid in dusky shades of night
 we land and on the bosom of the ground
 a safe retreat and a bare lodging found
 close by the shore we lay the sailors keep
 their watches and the rest securely sleep
 the night proceeding on with silent pace
 stood in her noon and view'd with equal face
 her steepy rise and her declining race
 then wakeful palinurus rose to spy
 the face of heav'n and the nocturnal sky
 and listen'd ev'ry breath of air to try
 observes the stars and notes their sliding course
 the pleiads hyads and their wat'ry force
 and both the bears is careful to behold
 and bright orion arm'd with burnish'd gold
 then when he saw no threat'ning tempest nigh
 but a sure promise of a settled sky
 he gave the sign to weigh we break our sleep
 forsake the pleasing shore and plow the deep

 "and now the rising morn with rosy light
 adorns the skies and puts the stars to flight
 when we from far like bluish mists descry
 the hills and then the plains of italy
 achates first pronounc'd the joyful sound
 then 'italy' the cheerful crew rebound
 my sire anchises crown'd a cup with wine
 and off'ring thus implor'd the pow'rs divine
 'ye gods presiding over lands and seas
 and you who raging winds and waves appease
 breathe on our swelling sails a prosp'rous wind
 and smooth our passage to the port assign'd'
 the gentle gales their flagging force renew
 and now the happy harbor is in view
 minerva's temple then salutes our sight
 plac'd as a landmark on the mountain's height
 we furl our sails and turn the prows to shore
 the curling waters round the galleys roar
 the land lies open to the raging east
 then bending like a bow with rocks compress'd
 shuts out the storms the winds and waves complain
 and vent their malice on the cliffs in vain
 the port lies hid within on either side
 two tow'ring rocks the narrow mouth divide
 the temple which aloft we view'd before
 to distance flies and seems to shun the shore
 scarce landed the first omens i beheld
 were four white steeds that cropp'd the flow'ry field
 'war war is threaten'd from this foreign ground'
 my father cried 'where warlike steeds are found
 yet since reclaim'd to chariots they submit
 and bend to stubborn yokes and champ the bit
 peace may succeed to war' our way we bend
 to pallas and the sacred hill ascend
 there prostrate to the fierce virago pray
 whose temple was the landmark of our way
 each with a phrygian mantle veil'd his head
 and all commands of helenus obey'd
 and pious rites to grecian juno paid
 these dues perform'd we stretch our sails and stand
 to sea forsaking that suspected land

 "from hence tarentum's bay appears in view
 for hercules renown'd if fame be true
 just opposite lacinian juno stands
 caulonian tow'rs and scylacaean strands
 for shipwrecks fear'd mount aetna thence we spy
 known by the smoky flames which cloud the sky
 far off we hear the waves with surly sound
 invade the rocks the rocks their groans rebound
 the billows break upon the sounding strand
 and roll the rising tide impure with sand
 then thus anchises in experience old
 ''t is that charybdis which the seer foretold
 and those the promis'd rocks bear off to sea'
 with haste the frighted mariners obey
 first palinurus to the larboard veer'd
 then all the fleet by his example steer'd
 to heav'n aloft on ridgy waves we ride
 then down to hell descend when they divide
 and thrice our galleys knock'd the stony ground
 and thrice the hollow rocks return'd the sound
 and thrice we saw the stars that stood with dews around
 the flagging winds forsook us with the sun
 and wearied on cyclopian shores we run
 the port capacious and secure from wind
 is to the foot of thund'ring aetna join'd
 by turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high
 by turns hot embers from her entrails fly
 and flakes of mounting flames that lick the sky
 oft from her bowels massy rocks are thrown
 and shiver'd by the force come piecemeal down
 oft liquid lakes of burning sulphur flow
 fed from the fiery springs that boil below
 enceladus they say transfix'd by jove
 with blasted limbs came tumbling from above
 and where he fell th' avenging father drew
 this flaming hill and on his body threw
 as often as he turns his weary sides
 he shakes the solid isle and smoke the heavens hides
 in shady woods we pass the tedious night
 where bellowing sounds and groans our souls affright
 of which no cause is offer'd to the sight
 for not one star was kindled in the sky
 nor could the moon her borrow'd light supply
 for misty clouds involv'd the firmament
 the stars were muffled and the moon was pent

 "scarce had the rising sun the day reveal'd
 scarce had his heat the pearly dews dispell'd
 when from the woods there bolts before our sight
 somewhat betwixt a mortal and a sprite
 so thin so ghastly meager and so wan
 so bare of flesh he scarce resembled man
 this thing all tatter'd seem'd from far t' implore
 our pious aid and pointed to the shore
 we look behind then view his shaggy beard
 his clothes were tagg'd with thorns and filth his limbs
 besmear'd
 the rest in mien in habit and in face
 appear'd a greek and such indeed he was
 he cast on us from far a frightful view
 whom soon for trojans and for foes he knew
 stood still and paus'd then all at once began
 to stretch his limbs and trembled as he ran
 soon as approach'd upon his knees he falls
 and thus with tears and sighs for pity calls
 'now by the pow'rs above and what we share
 from nature's common gift this vital air
 o trojans take me hence i beg no more
 but bear me far from this unhappy shore
 't is true i am a greek and farther own
 among your foes besieg'd th' imperial town
 for such demerits if my death be due
 no more for this abandon'd life i sue
 this only favor let my tears obtain
 to throw me headlong in the rapid main
 since nothing more than death my crime demands
 i die content to die by human hands'
 he said and on his knees my knees embrac'd
 i bade him boldly tell his fortune past
 his present state his lineage and his name
 th' occasion of his fears and whence he came
 the good anchises rais'd him with his hand
 who thus encourag'd answer'd our demand
 'from ithaca my native soil i came
 to troy and achaemenides my name
 me my poor father with ulysses sent
 o had i stay'd with poverty content
 but fearful for themselves my countrymen
 left me forsaken in the cyclops' den
 the cave tho' large was dark the dismal floor
 was pav'd with mangled limbs and putrid gore
 our monstrous host of more than human size
 erects his head and stares within the skies
 bellowing his voice and horrid is his hue
 ye gods remove this plague from mortal view
 the joints of slaughter'd wretches are his food
 and for his wine he quaffs the streaming blood
 these eyes beheld when with his spacious hand
 he seiz'd two captives of our grecian band
 stretch'd on his back he dash'd against the stones
 their broken bodies and their crackling bones
 with spouting blood the purple pavement swims
 while the dire glutton grinds the trembling limbs

 "'not unreveng'd ulysses bore their fate
 nor thoughtless of his own unhappy state
 for gorg'd with flesh and drunk with human wine
 while fast asleep the giant lay supine
 snoring aloud and belching from his maw
 his indigested foam and morsels raw
 we pray we cast the lots and then surround
 the monstrous body stretch'd along the ground
 each as he could approach him lends a hand
 to bore his eyeball with a flaming brand
 beneath his frowning forehead lay his eye
 for only one did the vast frame supply
 but that a globe so large his front it fill'd
 like the sun's disk or like a grecian shield
 the stroke succeeds and down the pupil bends
 this vengeance follow'd for our slaughter'd friends
 but haste unhappy wretches haste to fly
 your cables cut and on your oars rely
 such and so vast as polypheme appears
 a hundred more this hated island bears
 like him in caves they shut their woolly sheep
 like him their herds on tops of mountains keep
 like him with mighty strides they stalk from steep to steep
 and now three moons their sharpen'd horns renew
 since thus in woods and wilds obscure from view
 i drag my loathsome days with mortal fright
 and in deserted caverns lodge by night
 oft from the rocks a dreadful prospect see
 of the huge cyclops like a walking tree
 from far i hear his thund'ring voice resound
 and trampling feet that shake the solid ground
 cornels and salvage berries of the wood
 and roots and herbs have been my meager food
 while all around my longing eyes i cast
 i saw your happy ships appear at last
 on those i fix'd my hopes to these i run
 't is all i ask this cruel race to shun
 what other death you please yourselves bestow'

 "scarce had he said when on the mountain's brow
 we saw the giant shepherd stalk before
 his following flock and leading to the shore
 a monstrous bulk deform'd depriv'd of sight
 his staff a trunk of pine to guide his steps aright
 his pond'rous whistle from his neck descends
 his woolly care their pensive lord attends
 this only solace his hard fortune sends
 soon as he reach'd the shore and touch'd the waves
 from his bor'd eye the gutt'ring blood he laves
 he gnash'd his teeth and groan'd thro' seas he strides
 and scarce the topmost billows touch'd his sides

 "seiz'd with a sudden fear we run to sea
 the cables cut and silent haste away
 the welldeserving stranger entertain
 then buckling to the work our oars divide the main
 the giant harken'd to the dashing sound
 but when our vessels out of reach he found
 he strided onward and in vain essay'd
 th' ionian deep and durst no farther wade
 with that he roar'd aloud the dreadful cry
 shakes earth and air and seas the billows fly
 before the bellowing noise to distant italy
 the neigh'ring aetna trembling all around
 the winding caverns echo to the sound
 his brother cyclops hear the yelling roar
 and rushing down the mountains crowd the shore
 we saw their stern distorted looks from far
 and oneeyed glance that vainly threaten'd war
 a dreadful council with their heads on high
 the misty clouds about their foreheads fly
 not yielding to the tow'ring tree of jove
 or tallest cypress of diana's grove
 new pangs of mortal fear our minds assail
 we tug at ev'ry oar and hoist up ev'ry sail
 and take th' advantage of the friendly gale
 forewarn'd by helenus we strive to shun
 charybdis' gulf nor dare to scylla run
 an equal fate on either side appears
 we tacking to the left are free from fears
 for from pelorus' point the north arose
 and drove us back where swift pantagias flows
 his rocky mouth we pass and make our way
 by thapsus and megara's winding bay
 this passage achaemenides had shown
 tracing the course which he before had run

 "right o'er against plemmyrium's wat'ry strand
 there lies an isle once call'd th' ortygian land
 alpheus as old fame reports has found
 from greece a secret passage under ground
 by love to beauteous arethusa led
 and mingling here they roll in the same sacred bed
 as helenus enjoin'd we next adore
 diana's name protectress of the shore
 with prosp'rous gales we pass the quiet sounds
 of still elorus and his fruitful bounds
 then doubling cape pachynus we survey
 the rocky shore extended to the sea
 the town of camarine from far we see
 and fenny lake undrain'd by fate's decree
 in sight of the geloan fields we pass
 and the large walls where mighty gela was
 then agragas with lofty summits crown'd
 long for the race of warlike steeds renown'd
 we pass'd selinus and the palmy land
 and widely shun the lilybaean strand
 unsafe for secret rocks and moving sand
 at length on shore the weary fleet arriv'd
 which drepanum's unhappy port receiv'd
 here after endless labors often toss'd
 by raging storms and driv'n on ev'ry coast
 my dear dear father spent with age i lost
 ease of my cares and solace of my pain
 sav'd thro' a thousand toils but sav'd in vain
 the prophet who my future woes reveal'd
 yet this the greatest and the worst conceal'd
 and dire celaeno whose foreboding skill
 denounc'd all else was silent of the ill
 this my last labor was some friendly god
 from thence convey'd us to your blest abode"

 thus to the list'ning queen the royal guest
 his wand'ring course and all his toils express'd
 and here concluding he retir'd to rest




 book iv

 but anxious cares already seiz'd the queen
 she fed within her veins a flame unseen
 the hero's valor acts and birth inspire
 her soul with love and fan the secret fire
 his words his looks imprinted in her heart
 improve the passion and increase the smart
 now when the purple morn had chas'd away
 the dewy shadows and restor'd the day
 her sister first with early care she sought
 and thus in mournful accents eas'd her thought

 "my dearest anna what new dreams affright
 my lab'ring soul what visions of the night
 disturb my quiet and distract my breast
 with strange ideas of our trojan guest
 his worth his actions and majestic air
 a man descended from the gods declare
 fear ever argues a degenerate kind
 his birth is well asserted by his mind
 then what he suffer'd when by fate betray'd
 what brave attempts for falling troy he made
 such were his looks so gracefully he spoke
 that were i not resolv'd against the yoke
 of hapless marriage never to be curst
 with second love so fatal was my first
 to this one error i might yield again
 for since sichaeus was untimely slain
 this only man is able to subvert
 the fix'd foundations of my stubborn heart
 and to confess my frailty to my shame
 somewhat i find within if not the same
 too like the sparkles of my former flame
 but first let yawning earth a passage rend
 and let me thro' the dark abyss descend
 first let avenging jove with flames from high
 drive down this body to the nether sky
 condemn'd with ghosts in endless night to lie
 before i break the plighted faith i gave
 no he who had my vows shall ever have
 for whom i lov'd on earth i worship in the grave"

 she said the tears ran gushing from her eyes
 and stopp'd her speech her sister thus replies
 "o dearer than the vital air i breathe
 will you to grief your blooming years bequeath
 condemn'd to waste in woes your lonely life
 without the joys of mother or of wife
 think you these tears this pompous train of woe
 are known or valued by the ghosts below
 i grant that while your sorrows yet were green
 it well became a woman and a queen
 the vows of tyrian princes to neglect
 to scorn hyarbas and his love reject
 with all the libyan lords of mighty name
 but will you fight against a pleasing flame
 this little spot of land which heav'n bestows
 on ev'ry side is hemm'd with warlike foes
 gaetulian cities here are spread around
 and fierce numidians there your frontiers bound
 here lies a barren waste of thirsty land
 and there the syrtes raise the moving sand
 barcaean troops besiege the narrow shore
 and from the sea pygmalion threatens more
 propitious heav'n and gracious juno lead
 this wand'ring navy to your needful aid
 how will your empire spread your city rise
 from such a union and with such allies
 implore the favor of the pow'rs above
 and leave the conduct of the rest to love
 continue still your hospitable way
 and still invent occasions of their stay
 till storms and winter winds shall cease to threat
 and planks and oars repair their shatter'd fleet"

 these words which from a friend and sister came
 with ease resolv'd the scruples of her fame
 and added fury to the kindled flame
 inspir'd with hope the project they pursue
 on ev'ry altar sacrifice renew
 a chosen ewe of two years old they pay
 to ceres bacchus and the god of day
 preferring juno's pow'r for juno ties
 the nuptial knot and makes the marriage joys
 the beauteous queen before her altar stands
 and holds the golden goblet in her hands
 a milkwhite heifer she with flow'rs adorns
 and pours the ruddy wine betwixt her horns
 and while the priests with pray'r the gods invoke
 she feeds their altars with sabaean smoke
 with hourly care the sacrifice renews
 and anxiously the panting entrails views
 what priestly rites alas what pious art
 what vows avail to cure a bleeding heart
 a gentle fire she feeds within her veins
 where the soft god secure in silence reigns

 sick with desire and seeking him she loves
 from street to street the raving dido roves
 so when the watchful shepherd from the blind
 wounds with a random shaft the careless hind
 distracted with her pain she flies the woods
 bounds o'er the lawn and seeks the silent floods
 with fruitless care for still the fatal dart
 sticks in her side and rankles in her heart
 and now she leads the trojan chief along
 the lofty walls amidst the busy throng
 displays her tyrian wealth and rising town
 which love without his labor makes his own
 this pomp she shows to tempt her wand'ring guest
 her falt'ring tongue forbids to speak the rest
 when day declines and feasts renew the night
 still on his face she feeds her famish'd sight
 she longs again to hear the prince relate
 his own adventures and the trojan fate
 he tells it o'er and o'er but still in vain
 for still she begs to hear it once again
 the hearer on the speaker's mouth depends
 and thus the tragic story never ends

 then when they part when phoebe's paler light
 withdraws and falling stars to sleep invite
 she last remains when ev'ry guest is gone
 sits on the bed he press'd and sighs alone
 absent her absent hero sees and hears
 or in her bosom young ascanius bears
 and seeks the father's image in the child
 if love by likeness might be so beguil'd

 meantime the rising tow'rs are at a stand
 no labors exercise the youthful band
 nor use of arts nor toils of arms they know
 the mole is left unfinish'd to the foe
 the mounds the works the walls neglected lie
 short of their promis'd heighth that seem'd to threat the sky

 but when imperial juno from above
 saw dido fetter'd in the chains of love
 hot with the venom which her veins inflam'd
 and by no sense of shame to be reclaim'd
 with soothing words to venus she begun
 "high praises endless honors you have won
 and mighty trophies with your worthy son
 two gods a silly woman have undone
 nor am i ignorant you both suspect
 this rising city which my hands erect
 but shall celestial discord never cease
 't is better ended in a lasting peace
 you stand possess'd of all your soul desir'd
 poor dido with consuming love is fir'd
 your trojan with my tyrian let us join
 so dido shall be yours aeneas mine
 one common kingdom one united line
 eliza shall a dardan lord obey
 and lofty carthage for a dow'r convey"
 then venus who her hidden fraud descried
 which would the scepter of the world misguide
 to libyan shores thus artfully replied
 "who but a fool would wars with juno choose
 and such alliance and such gifts refuse
 if fortune with our joint desires comply
 the doubt is all from jove and destiny
 lest he forbid with absolute command
 to mix the people in one common land
 or will the trojan and the tyrian line
 in lasting leagues and sure succession join
 but you the partner of his bed and throne
 may move his mind my wishes are your own"

 "mine" said imperial juno "be the care
 time urges now to perfect this affair
 attend my counsel and the secret share
 when next the sun his rising light displays
 and gilds the world below with purple rays
 the queen aeneas and the tyrian court
 shall to the shady woods for sylvan game resort
 there while the huntsmen pitch their toils around
 and cheerful horns from side to side resound
 a pitchy cloud shall cover all the plain
 with hail and thunder and tempestuous rain
 the fearful train shall take their speedy flight
 dispers'd and all involv'd in gloomy night
 one cave a grateful shelter shall afford
 to the fair princess and the trojan lord
 i will myself the bridal bed prepare
 if you to bless the nuptials will be there
 so shall their loves be crown'd with due delights
 and hymen shall be present at the rites"
 the queen of love consents and closely smiles
 at her vain project and discover'd wiles

 the rosy morn was risen from the main
 and horns and hounds awake the princely train
 they issue early thro' the city gate
 where the more wakeful huntsmen ready wait
 with nets and toils and darts beside the force
 of spartan dogs and swift massylian horse
 the tyrian peers and officers of state
 for the slow queen in antechambers wait
 her lofty courser in the court below
 who his majestic rider seems to know
 proud of his purple trappings paws the ground
 and champs the golden bit and spreads the foam around
 the queen at length appears on either hand
 the brawny guards in martial order stand
 a flow'r'd simar with golden fringe she wore
 and at her back a golden quiver bore
 her flowing hair a golden caul restrains
 a golden clasp the tyrian robe sustains
 then young ascanius with a sprightly grace
 leads on the trojan youth to view the chase
 but far above the rest in beauty shines
 the great aeneas the troop he joins
 like fair apollo when he leaves the frost
 of wint'ry xanthus and the lycian coast
 when to his native delos he resorts
 ordains the dances and renews the sports
 where painted scythians mix'd with cretan bands
 before the joyful altars join their hands
 himself on cynthus walking sees below
 the merry madness of the sacred show
 green wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose
 a golden fillet binds his awful brows
 his quiver sounds not less the prince is seen
 in manly presence or in lofty mien

 now had they reach'd the hills and storm'd the seat
 of salvage beasts in dens their last retreat
 the cry pursues the mountain goats they bound
 from rock to rock and keep the craggy ground
 quite otherwise the stags a trembling train
 in herds unsingled scour the dusty plain
 and a long chase in open view maintain
 the glad ascanius as his courser guides
 spurs thro' the vale and these and those outrides
 his horse's flanks and sides are forc'd to feel
 the clanking lash and goring of the steel
 impatiently he views the feeble prey
 wishing some nobler beast to cross his way
 and rather would the tusky boar attend
 or see the tawny lion downward bend

 meantime the gath'ring clouds obscure the skies
 from pole to pole the forky lightning flies
 the rattling thunders roll and juno pours
 a wintry deluge down and sounding show'rs
 the company dispers'd to converts ride
 and seek the homely cots or mountain's hollow side
 the rapid rains descending from the hills
 to rolling torrents raise the creeping rills
 the queen and prince as love or fortune guides
 one common cavern in her bosom hides
 then first the trembling earth the signal gave
 and flashing fires enlighten all the cave
 hell from below and juno from above
 and howling nymphs were conscious of their love
 from this illomen'd hour in time arose
 debate and death and all succeeding woes

 the queen whom sense of honor could not move
 no longer made a secret of her love
 but call'd it marriage by that specious name
 to veil the crime and sanctify the shame

 the loud report thro' libyan cities goes
 fame the great ill from small beginnings grows
 swift from the first and ev'ry moment brings
 new vigor to her flights new pinions to her wings
 soon grows the pigmy to gigantic size
 her feet on earth her forehead in the skies
 inrag'd against the gods revengeful earth
 produc'd her last of the titanian birth
 swift is her walk more swift her winged haste
 a monstrous phantom horrible and vast
 as many plumes as raise her lofty flight
 so many piercing eyes inlarge her sight
 millions of opening mouths to fame belong
 and ev'ry mouth is furnish'd with a tongue
 and round with list'ning ears the flying plague is hung
 she fills the peaceful universe with cries
 no slumbers ever close her wakeful eyes
 by day from lofty tow'rs her head she shews
 and spreads thro' trembling crowds disastrous news
 with court informers haunts and royal spies
 things done relates not done she feigns and mingles truth with lies

 talk is her business and her chief delight
 to tell of prodigies and cause affright
 she fills the people's ears with dido's name
 who lost to honor and the sense of shame
 admits into her throne and nuptial bed
 a wand'ring guest who from his country fled
 whole days with him she passes in delights
 and wastes in luxury long winter nights
 forgetful of her fame and royal trust
 dissolv'd in ease abandon'd to her lust

 the goddess widely spreads the loud report
 and flies at length to king hyarba's court
 when first possess'd with this unwelcome news
 whom did he not of men and gods accuse
 this prince from ravish'd garamantis born
 a hundred temples did with spoils adorn
 in ammon's honor his celestial sire
 a hundred altars fed with wakeful fire
 and thro' his vast dominions priests ordain'd
 whose watchful care these holy rites maintain'd
 the gates and columns were with garlands crown'd
 and blood of victim beasts enrich'd the ground

 he when he heard a fugitive could move
 the tyrian princess who disdain'd his love
 his breast with fury burn'd his eyes with fire
 mad with despair impatient with desire
 then on the sacred altars pouring wine
 he thus with pray'rs implor'd his sire divine
 "great jove propitious to the moorish race
 who feast on painted beds with off'rings grace
 thy temples and adore thy pow'r divine
 with blood of victims and with sparkling wine
 seest thou not this or do we fear in vain
 thy boasted thunder and thy thoughtless reign
 do thy broad hands the forky lightnings lance
 thine are the bolts or the blind work of chance
 a wand'ring woman builds within our state
 a little town bought at an easy rate
 she pays me homage and my grants allow
 a narrow space of libyan lands to plow
 yet scorning me by passion blindly led
 admits a banish'd trojan to her bed
 and now this other paris with his train
 of conquer'd cowards must in afric reign
 whom what they are their looks and garb confess
 their locks with oil perfum'd their lydian dress
 he takes the spoil enjoys the princely dame
 and i rejected i adore an empty name"

 his vows in haughty terms he thus preferr'd
 and held his altar's horns the mighty thund'rer heard
 then cast his eyes on carthage where he found
 the lustful pair in lawless pleasure drown'd
 lost in their loves insensible of shame
 and both forgetful of their better fame
 he calls cyllenius and the god attends
 by whom his menacing command he sends
 "go mount the western winds and cleave the sky
 then with a swift descent to carthage fly
 there find the trojan chief who wastes his days
 in slothful riot and inglorious ease
 nor minds the future city giv'n by fate
 to him this message from my mouth relate
 'not so fair venus hop'd when twice she won
 thy life with pray'rs nor promis'd such a son
 hers was a hero destin'd to command
 a martial race and rule the latian land
 who should his ancient line from teucer draw
 and on the conquer'd world impose the law'
 if glory cannot move a mind so mean
 nor future praise from fading pleasure wean
 yet why should he defraud his son of fame
 and grudge the romans their immortal name
 what are his vain designs what hopes he more
 from his long ling'ring on a hostile shore
 regardless to redeem his honor lost
 and for his race to gain th' ausonian coast
 bid him with speed the tyrian court forsake
 with this command the slumb'ring warrior wake"

 hermes obeys with golden pinions binds
 his flying feet and mounts the western winds
 and whether o'er the seas or earth he flies
 with rapid force they bear him down the skies
 but first he grasps within his awful hand
 the mark of sov'reign pow'r his magic wand
 with this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves
 with this he drives them down the stygian waves
 with this he seals in sleep the wakeful sight
 and eyes tho' clos'd in death restores to light
 thus arm'd the god begins his airy race
 and drives the racking clouds along the liquid space
 now sees the tops of atlas as he flies
 whose brawny back supports the starry skies
 atlas whose head with piny forests crown'd
 is beaten by the winds with foggy vapors bound
 snows hide his shoulders from beneath his chin
 the founts of rolling streams their race begin
 a beard of ice on his large breast depends
 here pois'd upon his wings the god descends
 then rested thus he from the tow'ring height
 plung'd downward with precipitated flight
 lights on the seas and skims along the flood
 as waterfowl who seek their fishy food
 less and yet less to distant prospect show
 by turns they dance aloft and dive below
 like these the steerage of his wings he plies
 and near the surface of the water flies
 till having pass'd the seas and cross'd the sands
 he clos'd his wings and stoop'd on libyan lands
 where shepherds once were hous'd in homely sheds
 now tow'rs within the clouds advance their heads
 arriving there he found the trojan prince
 new ramparts raising for the town's defense
 a purple scarf with gold embroider'd o'er
 queen dido's gift about his waist he wore
 a sword with glitt'ring gems diversified
 for ornament not use hung idly by his side

 then thus with winged words the god began
 resuming his own shape "degenerate man
 thou woman's property what mak'st thou here
 these foreign walls and tyrian tow'rs to rear
 forgetful of thy own allpow'rful jove
 who sways the world below and heav'n above
 has sent me down with this severe command
 what means thy ling'ring in the libyan land
 if glory cannot move a mind so mean
 nor future praise from flitting pleasure wean
 regard the fortunes of thy rising heir
 the promis'd crown let young ascanius wear
 to whom th' ausonian scepter and the state
 of rome's imperial name is ow'd by fate"
 so spoke the god and speaking took his flight
 involv'd in clouds and vanish'd out of sight

 the pious prince was seiz'd with sudden fear
 mute was his tongue and upright stood his hair
 revolving in his mind the stern command
 he longs to fly and loathes the charming land
 what should he say or how should he begin
 what course alas remains to steer between
 th' offended lover and the pow'rful queen
 this way and that he turns his anxious mind
 and all expedients tries and none can find
 fix'd on the deed but doubtful of the means
 after long thought to this advice he leans
 three chiefs he calls commands them to repair
 the fleet and ship their men with silent care
 some plausible pretense he bids them find
 to color what in secret he design'd
 himself meantime the softest hours would choose
 before the lovesick lady heard the news
 and move her tender mind by slow degrees
 to suffer what the sov'reign pow'r decrees
 jove will inspire him when and what to say
 they hear with pleasure and with haste obey

 but soon the queen perceives the thin disguise
 what arts can blind a jealous woman's eyes
 she was the first to find the secret fraud
 before the fatal news was blaz'd abroad
 love the first motions of the lover hears
 quick to presage and ev'n in safety fears
 nor impious fame was wanting to report
 the ships repair'd the trojans' thick resort
 and purpose to forsake the tyrian court
 frantic with fear impatient of the wound
 and impotent of mind she roves the city round
 less wild the bacchanalian dames appear
 when from afar their nightly god they hear
 and howl about the hills and shake the wreathy spear
 at length she finds the dear perfidious man
 prevents his form'd excuse and thus began
 "base and ungrateful could you hope to fly
 and undiscover'd scape a lover's eye
 nor could my kindness your compassion move
 nor plighted vows nor dearer bands of love
 or is the death of a despairing queen
 not worth preventing tho' too well foreseen
 ev'n when the wintry winds command your stay
 you dare the tempests and defy the sea
 false as you are suppose you were not bound
 to lands unknown and foreign coasts to sound
 were troy restor'd and priam's happy reign
 now durst you tempt for troy the raging main
 see whom you fly am i the foe you shun
 now by those holy vows so late begun
 by this right hand since i have nothing more
 to challenge but the faith you gave before
 i beg you by these tears too truly shed
 by the new pleasures of our nuptial bed
 if ever dido when you most were kind
 were pleasing in your eyes or touch'd your mind
 by these my pray'rs if pray'rs may yet have place
 pity the fortunes of a falling race
 for you i have provok'd a tyrant's hate
 incens'd the libyan and the tyrian state
 for you alone i suffer in my fame
 bereft of honor and expos'd to shame
 whom have i now to trust ungrateful guest
 that only name remains of all the rest
 what have i left or whither can i fly
 must i attend pygmalion's cruelty
 or till hyarba shall in triumph lead
 a queen that proudly scorn'd his proffer'd bed
 had you deferr'd at least your hasty flight
 and left behind some pledge of our delight
 some babe to bless the mother's mournful sight
 some young aeneas to supply your place
 whose features might express his father's face
 i should not then complain to live bereft
 of all my husband or be wholly left"

 here paus'd the queen unmov'd he holds his eyes
 by jove's command nor suffer'd love to rise
 tho' heaving in his heart and thus at length replies
 "fair queen you never can enough repeat
 your boundless favors or i own my debt
 nor can my mind forget eliza's name
 while vital breath inspires this mortal frame
 this only let me speak in my defense
 i never hop'd a secret flight from hence
 much less pretended to the lawful claim
 of sacred nuptials or a husband's name
 for if indulgent heav'n would leave me free
 and not submit my life to fate's decree
 my choice would lead me to the trojan shore
 those relics to review their dust adore
 and priam's ruin'd palace to restore
 but now the delphian oracle commands
 and fate invites me to the latian lands
 that is the promis'd place to which i steer
 and all my vows are terminated there
 if you a tyrian and a stranger born
 with walls and tow'rs a libyan town adorn
 why may not we like you a foreign race
 like you seek shelter in a foreign place
 as often as the night obscures the skies
 with humid shades or twinkling stars arise
 anchises' angry ghost in dreams appears
 chides my delay and fills my soul with fears
 and young ascanius justly may complain
 of his defrauded and destin'd reign
 ev'n now the herald of the gods appear'd
 waking i saw him and his message heard
 from jove he came commission'd heav'nly bright
 with radiant beams and manifest to sight
 the sender and the sent i both attest
 these walls he enter'd and those words express'd
 fair queen oppose not what the gods command
 forc'd by my fate i leave your happy land"

 thus while he spoke already she began
 with sparkling eyes to view the guilty man
 from head to foot survey'd his person o'er
 nor longer these outrageous threats forebore
 "false as thou art and more than false forsworn
 not sprung from noble blood nor goddessborn
 but hewn from harden'd entrails of a rock
 and rough hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck
 why should i fawn what have i worse to fear
 did he once look or lent a list'ning ear
 sigh'd when i sobb'd or shed one kindly tear
 all symptoms of a base ungrateful mind
 so foul that which is worse 'tis hard to find
 of man's injustice why should i complain
 the gods and jove himself behold in vain
 triumphant treason yet no thunder flies
 nor juno views my wrongs with equal eyes
 faithless is earth and faithless are the skies
 justice is fled and truth is now no more
 i sav'd the shipwrack'd exile on my shore
 with needful food his hungry trojans fed
 i took the traitor to my throne and bed
 fool that i was 't is little to repeat
 the rest i stor'd and rigg'd his ruin'd fleet
 i rave i rave a god's command he pleads
 and makes heav'n accessary to his deeds
 now lycian lots and now the delian god
 now hermes is employ'd from jove's abode
 to warn him hence as if the peaceful state
 of heav'nly pow'rs were touch'd with human fate
 but go thy flight no longer i detain
 go seek thy promis'd kingdom thro' the main
 yet if the heav'ns will hear my pious vow
 the faithless waves not half so false as thou
 or secret sands shall sepulchers afford
 to thy proud vessels and their perjur'd lord
 then shalt thou call on injur'd dido's name
 dido shall come in a black sulph'ry flame
 when death has once dissolv'd her mortal frame
 shall smile to see the traitor vainly weep
 her angry ghost arising from the deep
 shall haunt thee waking and disturb thy sleep
 at least my shade thy punishment shall know
 and fame shall spread the pleasing news below"

 abruptly here she stops then turns away
 her loathing eyes and shuns the sight of day
 amaz'd he stood revolving in his mind
 what speech to frame and what excuse to find
 her fearful maids their fainting mistress led
 and softly laid her on her ivory bed

 but good aeneas tho' he much desir'd
 to give that pity which her grief requir'd
 tho' much he mourn'd and labor'd with his love
 resolv'd at length obeys the will of jove
 reviews his forces they with early care
 unmoor their vessels and for sea prepare
 the fleet is soon afloat in all its pride
 and wellcalk'd galleys in the harbor ride
 then oaks for oars they fell'd or as they stood
 of its green arms despoil'd the growing wood
 studious of flight the beach is cover'd o'er
 with trojan bands that blacken all the shore
 on ev'ry side are seen descending down
 thick swarms of soldiers loaden from the town
 thus in battalia march embodied ants
 fearful of winter and of future wants
 t' invade the corn and to their cells convey
 the plunder'd forage of their yellow prey
 the sable troops along the narrow tracks
 scarce bear the weighty burthen on their backs
 some set their shoulders to the pond'rous grain
 some guard the spoil some lash the lagging train
 all ply their sev'ral tasks and equal toil sustain

 what pangs the tender breast of dido tore
 when from the tow'r she saw the cover'd shore
 and heard the shouts of sailors from afar
 mix'd with the murmurs of the wat'ry war
 allpow'rful love what changes canst thou cause
 in human hearts subjected to thy laws
 once more her haughty soul the tyrant bends
 to pray'rs and mean submissions she descends
 no female arts or aids she left untried
 nor counsels unexplor'd before she died
 "look anna look the trojans crowd to sea
 they spread their canvas and their anchors weigh
 the shouting crew their ships with garlands bind
 invoke the sea gods and invite the wind
 could i have thought this threat'ning blow so near
 my tender soul had been forewarn'd to bear
 but do not you my last request deny
 with yon perfidious man your int'rest try
 and bring me news if i must live or die
 you are his fav'rite you alone can find
 the dark recesses of his inmost mind
 in all his trusted secrets you have part
 and know the soft approaches to his heart
 haste then and humbly seek my haughty foe
 tell him i did not with the grecians go
 nor did my fleet against his friends employ
 nor swore the ruin of unhappy troy
 nor mov'd with hands profane his father's dust
 why should he then reject a suit so just
 whom does he shun and whither would he fly
 can he this last this only pray'r deny
 let him at least his dang'rous flight delay
 wait better winds and hope a calmer sea
 the nuptials he disclaims i urge no more
 let him pursue the promis'd latian shore
 a short delay is all i ask him now
 a pause of grief an interval from woe
 till my soft soul be temper'd to sustain
 accustom'd sorrows and inur'd to pain
 if you in pity grant this one request
 my death shall glut the hatred of his breast"
 this mournful message pious anna bears
 and seconds with her own her sister's tears
 but all her arts are still employ'd in vain
 again she comes and is refus'd again
 his harden'd heart nor pray'rs nor threat'nings move
 fate and the god had stopp'd his ears to love

 as when the winds their airy quarrel try
 justling from ev'ry quarter of the sky
 this way and that the mountain oak they bend
 his boughs they shatter and his branches rend
 with leaves and falling mast they spread the ground
 the hollow valleys echo to the sound
 unmov'd the royal plant their fury mocks
 or shaken clings more closely to the rocks
 far as he shoots his tow'ring head on high
 so deep in earth his fix'd foundations lie
 no less a storm the trojan hero bears
 thick messages and loud complaints he hears
 and bandied words still beating on his ears
 sighs groans and tears proclaim his inward pains
 but the firm purpose of his heart remains

 the wretched queen pursued by cruel fate
 begins at length the light of heav'n to hate
 and loathes to live then dire portents she sees
 to hasten on the death her soul decrees
 strange to relate for when before the shrine
 she pours in sacrifice the purple wine
 the purple wine is turn'd to putrid blood
 and the white offer'd milk converts to mud
 this dire presage to her alone reveal'd
 from all and ev'n her sister she conceal'd
 a marble temple stood within the grove
 sacred to death and to her murther'd love
 that honor'd chapel she had hung around
 with snowy fleeces and with garlands crown'd
 oft when she visited this lonely dome
 strange voices issued from her husband's tomb
 she thought she heard him summon her away
 invite her to his grave and chide her stay
 hourly 't is heard when with a boding note
 the solitary screech owl strains her throat
 and on a chimney's top or turret's height
 with songs obscene disturbs the silence of the night
 besides old prophecies augment her fears
 and stern aeneas in her dreams appears
 disdainful as by day she seems alone
 to wander in her sleep thro' ways unknown
 guideless and dark or in a desart plain
 to seek her subjects and to seek in vain
 like pentheus when distracted with his fear
 he saw two suns and double thebes appear
 or mad orestes when his mother's ghost
 full in his face infernal torches toss'd
 and shook her snaky locks he shuns the sight
 flies o'er the stage surpris'd with mortal fright
 the furies guard the door and intercept his flight

 now sinking underneath a load of grief
 from death alone she seeks her last relief
 the time and means resolv'd within her breast
 she to her mournful sister thus address'd
 dissembling hope her cloudy front she clears
 and a false vigor in her eyes appears
 "rejoice" she said "instructed from above
 my lover i shall gain or lose my love
 nigh rising atlas next the falling sun
 long tracts of ethiopian climates run
 there a massylian priestess i have found
 honor'd for age for magic arts renown'd
 th' hesperian temple was her trusted care
 't was she supplied the wakeful dragon's fare
 she poppy seeds in honey taught to steep
 reclaim'd his rage and sooth'd him into sleep
 she watch'd the golden fruit her charms unbind
 the chains of love or fix them on the mind
 she stops the torrents leaves the channel dry
 repels the stars and backward bears the sky
 the yawning earth rebellows to her call
 pale ghosts ascend and mountain ashes fall
 witness ye gods and thou my better part
 how loth i am to try this impious art
 within the secret court with silent care
 erect a lofty pile expos'd in air
 hang on the topmost part the trojan vest
 spoils arms and presents of my faithless guest
 next under these the bridal bed be plac'd
 where i my ruin in his arms embrac'd
 all relics of the wretch are doom'd to fire
 for so the priestess and her charms require"

 thus far she said and farther speech forbears
 a mortal paleness in her face appears
 yet the mistrustless anna could not find
 the secret fun'ral in these rites design'd
 nor thought so dire a rage possess'd her mind
 unknowing of a train conceal'd so well
 she fear'd no worse than when sichaeus fell
 therefore obeys the fatal pile they rear
 within the secret court expos'd in air
 the cloven holms and pines are heap'd on high
 and garlands on the hollow spaces lie
 sad cypress vervain yew compose the wreath
 and ev'ry baleful green denoting death
 the queen determin'd to the fatal deed
 the spoils and sword he left in order spread
 and the man's image on the nuptial bed

 and now the sacred altars plac'd around
 the priestess enters with her hair unbound
 and thrice invokes the pow'rs below the ground
 night erebus and chaos she proclaims
 and threefold hecate with her hundred names
 and three dianas next she sprinkles round
 with feign'd avernian drops the hallow'd ground
 culls hoary simples found by phoebe's light
 with brazen sickles reap'd at noon of night
 then mixes baleful juices in the bowl
 and cuts the forehead of a newborn foal
 robbing the mother's love the destin'd queen
 observes assisting at the rites obscene
 a leaven'd cake in her devoted hands
 she holds and next the highest altar stands
 one tender foot was shod her other bare
 girt was her gather'd gown and loose her hair
 thus dress'd she summon'd with her dying breath
 the heav'ns and planets conscious of her death
 and ev'ry pow'r if any rules above
 who minds or who revenges injur'd love

 "'t was dead of night when weary bodies close
 their eyes in balmy sleep and soft repose
 the winds no longer whisper thro' the woods
 nor murm'ring tides disturb the gentle floods
 the stars in silent order mov'd around
 and peace with downy wings was brooding on the ground
 the flocks and herds and partycolor'd fowl
 which haunt the woods or swim the weedy pool
 stretch'd on the quiet earth securely lay
 forgetting the past labors of the day
 all else of nature's common gift partake
 unhappy dido was alone awake
 nor sleep nor ease the furious queen can find
 sleep fled her eyes as quiet fled her mind
 despair and rage and love divide her heart
 despair and rage had some but love the greater part

 then thus she said within her secret mind
 "what shall i do what succor can i find
 become a suppliant to hyarba's pride
 and take my turn to court and be denied
 shall i with this ungrateful trojan go
 forsake an empire and attend a foe
 himself i refug'd and his train reliev'd
 't is true but am i sure to be receiv'd
 can gratitude in trojan souls have place
 laomedon still lives in all his race
 then shall i seek alone the churlish crew
 or with my fleet their flying sails pursue
 what force have i but those whom scarce before
 i drew reluctant from their native shore
 will they again embark at my desire
 once more sustain the seas and quit their second tyre
 rather with steel thy guilty breast invade
 and take the fortune thou thyself hast made
 your pity sister first seduc'd my mind
 or seconded too well what i design'd
 these dearbought pleasures had i never known
 had i continued free and still my own
 avoiding love i had not found despair
 but shar'd with salvage beasts the common air
 like them a lonely life i might have led
 not mourn'd the living nor disturb'd the dead"
 these thoughts she brooded in her anxious breast
 on board the trojan found more easy rest
 resolv'd to sail in sleep he pass'd the night
 and order'd all things for his early flight

 to whom once more the winged god appears
 his former youthful mien and shape he wears
 and with this new alarm invades his ears
 "sleep'st thou o goddessborn and canst thou drown
 thy needful cares so near a hostile town
 beset with foes nor hear'st the western gales
 invite thy passage and inspire thy sails
 she harbors in her heart a furious hate
 and thou shalt find the dire effects too late
 fix'd on revenge and obstinate to die
 haste swiftly hence while thou hast pow'r to fly
 the sea with ships will soon be cover'd o'er
 and blazing firebrands kindle all the shore
 prevent her rage while night obscures the skies
 and sail before the purple morn arise
 who knows what hazards thy delay may bring
 woman's a various and a changeful thing"
 thus hermes in the dream then took his flight
 aloft in air unseen and mix'd with night

 twice warn'd by the celestial messenger
 the pious prince arose with hasty fear
 then rous'd his drowsy train without delay
 "haste to your banks your crooked anchors weigh
 and spread your flying sails and stand to sea
 a god commands he stood before my sight
 and urg'd us once again to speedy flight
 o sacred pow'r what pow'r soe'er thou art
 to thy blest orders i resign my heart
 lead thou the way protect thy trojan bands
 and prosper the design thy will commands"
 he said and drawing forth his flaming sword
 his thund'ring arm divides the manytwisted cord
 an emulating zeal inspires his train
 they run they snatch they rush into the main
 with headlong haste they leave the desert shores
 and brush the liquid seas with lab'ring oars

 aurora now had left her saffron bed
 and beams of early light the heav'ns o'erspread
 when from a tow'r the queen with wakeful eyes
 saw day point upward from the rosy skies
 she look'd to seaward but the sea was void
 and scarce in ken the sailing ships descried
 stung with despite and furious with despair
 she struck her trembling breast and tore her hair
 "and shall th' ungrateful traitor go" she said
 "my land forsaken and my love betray'd
 shall we not arm not rush from ev'ry street
 to follow sink and burn his perjur'd fleet
 haste haul my galleys out pursue the foe
 bring flaming brands set sail and swiftly row
 what have i said where am i fury turns
 my brain and my distemper'd bosom burns
 then when i gave my person and my throne
 this hate this rage had been more timely shown
 see now the promis'd faith the vaunted name
 the pious man who rushing thro' the flame
 preserv'd his gods and to the phrygian shore
 the burthen of his feeble father bore
 i should have torn him piecemeal strow'd in floods
 his scatter'd limbs or left expos'd in woods
 destroy'd his friends and son and from the fire
 have set the reeking boy before the sire
 events are doubtful which on battles wait
 yet where's the doubt to souls secure of fate
 my tyrians at their injur'd queen's command
 had toss'd their fires amid the trojan band
 at once extinguish'd all the faithless name
 and i myself in vengeance of my shame
 had fall'n upon the pile to mend the fun'ral flame
 thou sun who view'st at once the world below
 thou juno guardian of the nuptial vow
 thou hecate hearken from thy dark abodes
 ye furies fiends and violated gods
 all pow'rs invok'd with dido's dying breath
 attend her curses and avenge her death
 if so the fates ordain jove commands
 th' ungrateful wretch should find the latian lands
 yet let a race untam'd and haughty foes
 his peaceful entrance with dire arms oppose
 oppress'd with numbers in th' unequal field
 his men discourag'd and himself expell'd
 let him for succor sue from place to place
 torn from his subjects and his son's embrace
 first let him see his friends in battle slain
 and their untimely fate lament in vain
 and when at length the cruel war shall cease
 on hard conditions may he buy his peace
 nor let him then enjoy supreme command
 but fall untimely by some hostile hand
 and lie unburied on the barren sand
 these are my pray'rs and this my dying will
 and you my tyrians ev'ry curse fulfil
 perpetual hate and mortal wars proclaim
 against the prince the people and the name
 these grateful off'rings on my grave bestow
 nor league nor love the hostile nations know
 now and from hence in ev'ry future age
 when rage excites your arms and strength supplies the rage
 rise some avenger of our libyan blood
 with fire and sword pursue the perjur'd brood
 our arms our seas our shores oppos'd to theirs
 and the same hate descend on all our heirs"

 this said within her anxious mind she weighs
 the means of cutting short her odious days
 then to sichaeus' nurse she briefly said
 for when she left her country hers was dead
 "go barce call my sister let her care
 the solemn rites of sacrifice prepare
 the sheep and all th' atoning off'rings bring
 sprinkling her body from the crystal spring
 with living drops then let her come and thou
 with sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow
 thus will i pay my vows to stygian jove
 and end the cares of my disastrous love
 then cast the trojan image on the fire
 and as that burns my passions shall expire"

 the nurse moves onward with officious care
 and all the speed her aged limbs can bear
 but furious dido with dark thoughts involv'd
 shook at the mighty mischief she resolv'd
 with livid spots distinguish'd was her face
 red were her rolling eyes and discompos'd her pace
 ghastly she gaz'd with pain she drew her breath
 and nature shiver'd at approaching death

 then swiftly to the fatal place she pass'd
 and mounts the fun'ral pile with furious haste
 unsheathes the sword the trojan left behind
 not for so dire an enterprise design'd
 but when she view'd the garments loosely spread
 which once he wore and saw the conscious bed
 she paus'd and with a sigh the robes embrac'd
 then on the couch her trembling body cast
 repress'd the ready tears and spoke her last
 "dear pledges of my love while heav'n so pleas'd
 receive a soul of mortal anguish eas'd
 my fatal course is finish'd and i go
 a glorious name among the ghosts below
 a lofty city by my hands is rais'd
 pygmalion punish'd and my lord appeas'd
 what could my fortune have afforded more
 had the false trojan never touch'd my shore"
 then kiss'd the couch and "must i die" she said
 "and unreveng'd 't is doubly to be dead
 yet ev'n this death with pleasure i receive
 on any terms 't is better than to live
 these flames from far may the false trojan view
 these boding omens his base flight pursue"

 she said and struck deep enter'd in her side
 the piercing steel with reeking purple dyed
 clogg'd in the wound the cruel weapon stands
 the spouting blood came streaming on her hands
 her sad attendants saw the deadly stroke
 and with loud cries the sounding palace shook
 distracted from the fatal sight they fled
 and thro' the town the dismal rumor spread
 first from the frighted court the yell began
 redoubled thence from house to house it ran
 the groans of men with shrieks laments and cries
 of mixing women mount the vaulted skies
 not less the clamor than if ancient tyre
 or the new carthage set by foes on fire
 the rolling ruin with their lov'd abodes
 involv'd the blazing temples of their gods

 her sister hears and furious with despair
 she beats her breast and rends her yellow hair
 and calling on eliza's name aloud
 runs breathless to the place and breaks the crowd
 "was all that pomp of woe for this prepar'd
 these fires this fun'ral pile these altars rear'd
 was all this train of plots contriv'd" said she
 "all only to deceive unhappy me
 which is the worst didst thou in death pretend
 to scorn thy sister or delude thy friend
 thy summon'd sister and thy friend had come
 one sword had serv'd us both one common tomb
 was i to raise the pile the pow'rs invoke
 not to be present at the fatal stroke
 at once thou hast destroy'd thyself and me
 thy town thy senate and thy colony
 bring water bathe the wound while i in death
 lay close my lips to hers and catch the flying breath"
 this said she mounts the pile with eager haste
 and in her arms the gasping queen embrac'd
 her temples chaf'd and her own garments tore
 to stanch the streaming blood and cleanse the gore
 thrice dido tried to raise her drooping head
 and fainting thrice fell grov'ling on the bed
 thrice op'd her heavy eyes and sought the light
 but having found it sicken'd at the sight
 and clos'd her lids at last in endless night

 then juno grieving that she should sustain
 a death so ling'ring and so full of pain
 sent iris down to free her from the strife
 of lab'ring nature and dissolve her life
 for since she died not doom'd by heav'n's decree
 or her own crime but human casualty
 and rage of love that plung'd her in despair
 the sisters had not cut the topmost hair
 which proserpine and they can only know
 nor made her sacred to the shades below
 downward the various goddess took her flight
 and drew a thousand colors from the light
 then stood above the dying lover's head
 and said "i thus devote thee to the dead
 this off'ring to th' infernal gods i bear"
 thus while she spoke she cut the fatal hair
 the struggling soul was loos'd and life dissolv'd in air




 book v

 meantime the trojan cuts his wat'ry way
 fix'd on his voyage thro' the curling sea
 then casting back his eyes with dire amaze
 sees on the punic shore the mounting blaze
 the cause unknown yet his presaging mind
 the fate of dido from the fire divin'd
 he knew the stormy souls of womankind
 what secret springs their eager passions move
 how capable of death for injur'd love
 dire auguries from hence the trojans draw
 till neither fires nor shining shores they saw
 now seas and skies their prospect only bound
 an empty space above a floating field around
 but soon the heav'ns with shadows were o'erspread
 a swelling cloud hung hov'ring o'er their head
 livid it look'd the threat'ning of a storm
 then night and horror ocean's face deform
 the pilot palinurus cried aloud
 "what gusts of weather from that gath'ring cloud
 my thoughts presage ere yet the tempest roars
 stand to your tackle mates and stretch your oars
 contract your swelling sails and luff to wind"
 the frighted crew perform the task assign'd
 then to his fearless chief "not heav'n" said he
 "tho' jove himself should promise italy
 can stem the torrent of this raging sea
 mark how the shifting winds from west arise
 and what collected night involves the skies
 nor can our shaken vessels live at sea
 much less against the tempest force their way
 't is fate diverts our course and fate we must obey
 not far from hence if i observ'd aright
 the southing of the stars and polar light
 sicilia lies whose hospitable shores
 in safety we may reach with struggling oars"
 aeneas then replied "too sure i find
 we strive in vain against the seas and wind
 now shift your sails what place can please me more
 than what you promise the sicilian shore
 whose hallow'd earth anchises' bones contains
 and where a prince of trojan lineage reigns"
 the course resolv'd before the western wind
 they scud amain and make the port assign'd
 meantime acestes from a lofty stand
 beheld the fleet descending on the land
 and not unmindful of his ancient race
 down from the cliff he ran with eager pace
 and held the hero in a strict embrace
 of a rough libyan bear the spoils he wore
 and either hand a pointed jav'lin bore
 his mother was a dame of dardan blood
 his sire crinisus a sicilian flood
 he welcomes his returning friends ashore
 with plenteous country cates and homely store

 now when the following morn had chas'd away
 the flying stars and light restor'd the day
 aeneas call'd the trojan troops around
 and thus bespoke them from a rising ground
 "offspring of heav'n divine dardanian race
 the sun revolving thro' th' ethereal space
 the shining circle of the year has fill'd
 since first this isle my father's ashes held
 and now the rising day renews the year
 a day for ever sad for ever dear
 this would i celebrate with annual games
 with gifts on altars pil'd and holy flames
 tho' banish'd to gaetulia's barren sands
 caught on the grecian seas or hostile lands
 but since this happy storm our fleet has driv'n
 not as i deem without the will of heav'n
 upon these friendly shores and flow'ry plains
 which hide anchises and his blest remains
 let us with joy perform his honors due
 and pray for prosp'rous winds our voyage to renew
 pray that in towns and temples of our own
 the name of great anchises may be known
 and yearly games may spread the gods' renown
 our sports acestes of the trojan race
 with royal gifts ordain'd is pleas'd to grace
 two steers on ev'ry ship the king bestows
 his gods and ours shall share your equal vows
 besides if nine days hence the rosy morn
 shall with unclouded light the skies adorn
 that day with solemn sports i mean to grace
 light galleys on the seas shall run a wat'ry race
 some shall in swiftness for the goal contend
 and others try the twanging bow to bend
 the strong with iron gauntlets arm'd shall stand
 oppos'd in combat on the yellow sand
 let all be present at the games prepar'd
 and joyful victors wait the just reward
 but now assist the rites with garlands crown'd"
 he said and first his brows with myrtle bound
 then helymus by his example led
 and old acestes each adorn'd his head
 thus young ascanius with a sprightly grace
 his temples tied and all the trojan race
 aeneas then advanc'd amidst the train
 by thousands follow'd thro' the flow'ry plain
 to great anchises' tomb which when he found
 he pour'd to bacchus on the hallow'd ground
 two bowls of sparkling wine of milk two more
 and two from offer'd bulls of purple gore
 with roses then the sepulcher he strow'd
 and thus his father's ghost bespoke aloud
 "hail o ye holy manes hail again
 paternal ashes now review'd in vain
 the gods permitted not that you with me
 should reach the promis'd shores of italy
 or tiber's flood what flood soe'er it be"
 scarce had he finish'd when with speckled pride
 a serpent from the tomb began to glide
 his hugy bulk on sev'n high volumes roll'd
 blue was his breadth of back but streak'd with scaly gold
 thus riding on his curls he seem'd to pass
 a rolling fire along and singe the grass
 more various colors thro' his body run
 than iris when her bow imbibes the sun
 betwixt the rising altars and around
 the sacred monster shot along the ground
 with harmless play amidst the bowls he pass'd
 and with his lolling tongue assay'd the taste
 thus fed with holy food the wondrous guest
 within the hollow tomb retir'd to rest
 the pious prince surpris'd at what he view'd
 the fun'ral honors with more zeal renew'd
 doubtful if this place's genius were
 or guardian of his father's sepulcher
 five sheep according to the rites he slew
 as many swine and steers of sable hue
 new gen'rous wine he from the goblets pour'd
 and call'd his father's ghost from hell restor'd
 the glad attendants in long order come
 off'ring their gifts at great anchises' tomb
 some add more oxen some divide the spoil
 some place the chargers on the grassy soil
 some blow the fires and offered entrails broil

 now came the day desir'd the skies were bright
 with rosy luster of the rising light
 the bord'ring people rous'd by sounding fame
 of trojan feasts and great acestes' name
 the crowded shore with acclamations fill
 part to behold and part to prove their skill
 and first the gifts in public view they place
 green laurel wreaths and palm the victors' grace
 within the circle arms and tripods lie
 ingots of gold and silver heap'd on high
 and vests embroider'd of the tyrian dye
 the trumpet's clangor then the feast proclaims
 and all prepare for their appointed games
 four galleys first which equal rowers bear
 advancing in the wat'ry lists appear
 the speedy dolphin that outstrips the wind
 bore mnestheus author of the memmian kind
 gyas the vast chimaera's bulk commands
 which rising like a tow'ring city stands
 three trojans tug at ev'ry lab'ring oar
 three banks in three degrees the sailors bore
 beneath their sturdy strokes the billows roar
 sergesthus who began the sergian race
 in the great centaur took the leading place
 cloanthus on the seagreen scylla stood
 from whom cluentius draws his trojan blood

 far in the sea against the foaming shore
 there stands a rock the raging billows roar
 above his head in storms but when 't is clear
 uncurl their ridgy backs and at his foot appear
 in peace below the gentle waters run
 the cormorants above lie basking in the sun
 on this the hero fix'd an oak in sight
 the mark to guide the mariners aright
 to bear with this the seamen stretch their oars
 then round the rock they steer and seek the former shores
 the lots decide their place above the rest
 each leader shining in his tyrian vest
 the common crew with wreaths of poplar boughs
 their temples crown and shade their sweaty brows
 besmear'd with oil their naked shoulders shine
 all take their seats and wait the sounding sign
 they gripe their oars and ev'ry panting breast
 is rais'd by turns with hope by turns with fear depress'd
 the clangor of the trumpet gives the sign
 at once they start advancing in a line
 with shouts the sailors rend the starry skies
 lash'd with their oars the smoky billows rise
 sparkles the briny main and the vex'd ocean fries
 exact in time with equal strokes they row
 at once the brushing oars and brazen prow
 dash up the sandy waves and ope the depths below
 not fiery coursers in a chariot race
 invade the field with half so swift a pace
 not the fierce driver with more fury lends
 the sounding lash and ere the stroke descends
 low to the wheels his pliant body bends
 the partial crowd their hopes and fears divide
 and aid with eager shouts the favor'd side
 cries murmurs clamors with a mixing sound
 from woods to woods from hills to hills rebound

 amidst the loud applauses of the shore
 gyas outstripp'd the rest and sprung before
 cloanthus better mann'd pursued him fast
 but his o'ermasted galley check'd his haste
 the centaur and the dolphin brush the brine
 with equal oars advancing in a line
 and now the mighty centaur seems to lead
 and now the speedy dolphin gets ahead
 now board to board the rival vessels row
 the billows lave the skies and ocean groans below
 they reach'd the mark proud gyas and his train
 in triumph rode the victors of the main
 but steering round he charg'd his pilot stand
 more close to shore and skim along the sand
 "let others bear to sea" menoetes heard
 but secret shelves too cautiously he fear'd
 and fearing sought the deep and still aloof he steer'd
 with louder cries the captain call'd again
 "bear to the rocky shore and shun the main"
 he spoke and speaking at his stern he saw
 the bold cloanthus near the shelvings draw
 betwixt the mark and him the scylla stood
 and in a closer compass plow'd the flood
 he pass'd the mark and wheeling got before
 gyas blasphem'd the gods devoutly swore
 cried out for anger and his hair he tore
 mindless of others' lives so high was grown
 his rising rage and careless of his own
 the trembling dotard to the deck he drew
 then hoisted up and overboard he threw
 this done he seiz'd the helm his fellows cheer'd
 turn'd short upon the shelfs and madly steer'd

 hardly his head the plunging pilot rears
 clogg'd with his clothes and cumber'd with his years
 now dropping wet he climbs the cliff with pain
 the crowd that saw him fall and float again
 shout from the distant shore and loudly laugh'd
 to see his heaving breast disgorge the briny draught
 the following centaur and the dolphin's crew
 their vanish'd hopes of victory renew
 while gyas lags they kindle in the race
 to reach the mark sergesthus takes the place
 mnestheus pursues and while around they wind
 comes up not half his galley's length behind
 then on the deck amidst his mates appear'd
 and thus their drooping courage he cheer'd
 "my friends and hector's followers heretofore
 exert your vigor tug the lab'ring oar
 stretch to your strokes my still unconquer'd crew
 whom from the flaming walls of troy i drew
 in this our common int'rest let me find
 that strength of hand that courage of the mind
 as when you stemm'd the strong malean flood
 and o'er the syrtes' broken billows row'd
 i seek not now the foremost palm to gain
 tho' yet but ah that haughty wish is vain
 let those enjoy it whom the gods ordain
 but to be last the lags of all the race
 redeem yourselves and me from that disgrace"
 now one and all they tug amain they row
 at the full stretch and shake the brazen prow
 the sea beneath 'em sinks their lab'ring sides
 are swell'd and sweat runs gutt'ring down in tides
 chance aids their daring with unhop'd success
 sergesthus eager with his beak to press
 betwixt the rival galley and the rock
 shuts up th' unwieldly centaur in the lock
 the vessel struck and with the dreadful shock
 her oars she shiver'd and her head she broke
 the trembling rowers from their banks arise
 and anxious for themselves renounce the prize
 with iron poles they heave her off the shores
 and gather from the sea their floating oars
 the crew of mnestheus with elated minds
 urge their success and call the willing winds
 then ply their oars and cut their liquid way
 in larger compass on the roomy sea
 as when the dove her rocky hold forsakes
 rous'd in a fright her sounding wings she shakes
 the cavern rings with clatt'ring out she flies
 and leaves her callow care and cleaves the skies
 at first she flutters but at length she springs
 to smoother flight and shoots upon her wings
 so mnestheus in the dolphin cuts the sea
 and flying with a force that force assists his way
 sergesthus in the centaur soon he pass'd
 wedg'd in the rocky shoals and sticking fast
 in vain the victor he with cries implores
 and practices to row with shatter'd oars
 then mnestheus bears with gyas and outflies
 the ship without a pilot yields the prize
 unvanquish'd scylla now alone remains
 her he pursues and all his vigor strains
 shouts from the fav'ring multitude arise
 applauding echo to the shouts replies
 shouts wishes and applause run rattling thro' the skies
 these clamors with disdain the scylla heard
 much grudg'd the praise but more the robb'd reward
 resolv'd to hold their own they mend their pace
 all obstinate to die or gain the race
 rais'd with success the dolphin swiftly ran
 for they can conquer who believe they can
 both urge their oars and fortune both supplies
 and both perhaps had shar'd an equal prize
 when to the seas cloanthus holds his hands
 and succor from the wat'ry pow'rs demands
 "gods of the liquid realms on which i row
 if giv'n by you the laurel bind my brow
 assist to make me guilty of my vow
 a snowwhite bull shall on your shore be slain
 his offer'd entrails cast into the main
 and ruddy wine from golden goblets thrown
 your grateful gift and my return shall own"
 the choir of nymphs and phorcus from below
 with virgin panopea heard his vow
 and old portunus with his breadth of hand
 push'd on and sped the galley to the land
 swift as a shaft or winged wind she flies
 and darting to the port obtains the prize

 the herald summons all and then proclaims
 cloanthus conqu'ror of the naval games
 the prince with laurel crowns the victor's head
 and three fat steers are to his vessel led
 the ship's reward with gen'rous wine beside
 and sums of silver which the crew divide
 the leaders are distinguish'd from the rest
 the victor honor'd with a nobler vest
 where gold and purple strive in equal rows
 and needlework its happy cost bestows
 there ganymede is wrought with living art
 chasing thro' ida's groves the trembling hart
 breathless he seems yet eager to pursue
 when from aloft descends in open view
 the bird of jove and sousing on his prey
 with crooked talons bears the boy away
 in vain with lifted hands and gazing eyes
 his guards behold him soaring thro' the skies
 and dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries

 mnestheus the second victor was declar'd
 and summon'd there the second prize he shard
 a coat of mail brave demoleus bore
 more brave aeneas from his shoulders tore
 in single combat on the trojan shore
 this was ordain'd for mnestheus to possess
 in war for his defense for ornament in peace
 rich was the gift and glorious to behold
 but yet so pond'rous with its plates of gold
 that scarce two servants could the weight sustain
 yet loaded thus demoleus o'er the plain
 pursued and lightly seiz'd the trojan train
 the third succeeding to the last reward
 two goodly bowls of massy silver shar'd
 with figures prominent and richly wrought
 and two brass caldrons from dodona brought

 thus all rewarded by the hero's hands
 their conqu'ring temples bound with purple bands
 and now sergesthus clearing from the rock
 brought back his galley shatter'd with the shock
 forlorn she look'd without an aiding oar
 and houted by the vulgar made to shore
 as when a snake surpris'd upon the road
 is crush'd athwart her body by the load
 of heavy wheels or with a mortal wound
 her belly bruis'd and trodden to the ground
 in vain with loosen'd curls she crawls along
 yet fierce above she brandishes her tongue
 glares with her eyes and bristles with her scales
 but groveling in the dust her parts unsound she trails
 so slowly to the port the centaur tends
 but what she wants in oars with sails amends
 yet for his galley sav'd the grateful prince
 is pleas'd th' unhappy chief to recompense
 pholoe the cretan slave rewards his care
 beauteous herself with lovely twins as fair

 from thence his way the trojan hero bent
 into the neighb'ring plain with mountains pent
 whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood
 full in the midst of this fair valley stood
 a native theater which rising slow
 by just degrees o'erlook'd the ground below
 high on a sylvan throne the leader sate
 a num'rous train attend in solemn state
 here those that in the rapid course delight
 desire of honor and the prize invite
 the rival runners without order stand
 the trojans mix'd with the sicilian band
 first nisus with euryalus appears
 euryalus a boy of blooming years
 with sprightly grace and equal beauty crown'd
 nisus for friendship to the youth renown'd
 diores next of priam's royal race
 then salius joined with patron took their place
 but patron in arcadia had his birth
 and salius his from arcananian earth
 then two sicilian youths the names of these
 swift helymus and lovely panopes
 both jolly huntsmen both in forest bred
 and owning old acestes for their head
 with sev'ral others of ignobler name
 whom time has not deliver'd o'er to fame

 to these the hero thus his thoughts explain'd
 in words which gen'ral approbation gain'd
 "one common largess is for all design'd
 the vanquish'd and the victor shall be join'd
 two darts of polish'd steel and gnosian wood
 a silverstudded ax alike bestow'd
 the foremost three have olive wreaths decreed
 the first of these obtains a stately steed
 adorn'd with trappings and the next in fame
 the quiver of an amazonian dame
 with feather'd thracian arrows well supplied
 a golden belt shall gird his manly side
 which with a sparkling diamond shall be tied
 the third this grecian helmet shall content"
 he said to their appointed base they went
 with beating hearts th' expected sign receive
 and starting all at once the barrier leave
 spread out as on the winged winds they flew
 and seiz'd the distant goal with greedy view
 shot from the crowd swift nisus all o'erpass'd
 nor storms nor thunder equal half his haste
 the next but tho' the next yet far disjoin'd
 came salius and euryalus behind
 then helymus whom young diores plied
 step after step and almost side by side
 his shoulders pressing and in longer space
 had won or left at least a dubious race

 now spent the goal they almost reach at last
 when eager nisus hapless in his haste
 slipp'd first and slipping fell upon the plain
 soak'd with the blood of oxen newly slain
 the careless victor had not mark'd his way
 but treading where the treach'rous puddle lay
 his heels flew up and on the grassy floor
 he fell besmear'd with filth and holy gore
 not mindless then euryalus of thee
 nor of the sacred bonds of amity
 he strove th' immediate rival's hope to cross
 and caught the foot of salius as he rose
 so salius lay extended on the plain
 euryalus springs out the prize to gain
 and leaves the crowd applauding peals attend
 the victor to the goal who vanquish'd by his friend
 next helymus and then diores came
 by two misfortunes made the third in fame

 but salius enters and exclaiming loud
 for justice deafens and disturbs the crowd
 urges his cause may in the court be heard
 and pleads the prize is wrongfully conferr'd
 but favor for euryalus appears
 his blooming beauty with his tender tears
 had brib'd the judges for the promis'd prize
 besides diores fills the court with cries
 who vainly reaches at the last reward
 if the first palm on salius be conferr'd
 then thus the prince "let no disputes arise
 where fortune plac'd it i award the prize
 but fortune's errors give me leave to mend
 at least to pity my deserving friend"
 he said and from among the spoils he draws
 pond'rous with shaggy mane and golden paws
 a lion's hide to salius this he gives
 nisus with envy sees the gift and grieves
 "if such rewards to vanquish'd men are due"
 he said "and falling is to rise by you
 what prize may nisus from your bounty claim
 who merited the first rewards and fame
 in falling both an equal fortune tried
 would fortune for my fall so well provide"
 with this he pointed to his face and show'd
 his hand and all his habit smear'd with blood
 th' indulgent father of the people smil'd
 and caus'd to be produc'd an ample shield
 of wondrous art by didymaon wrought
 long since from neptune's bars in triumph brought
 this giv'n to nisus he divides the rest
 and equal justice in his gifts express'd

 the race thus ended and rewards bestow'd
 once more the prince bespeaks th' attentive crowd
 "if there he here whose dauntless courage dare
 in gauntletfight with limbs and body bare
 his opposite sustain in open view
 stand forth the champion and the games renew
 two prizes i propose and thus divide
 a bull with gilded horns and fillets tied
 shall be the portion of the conqu'ring chief
 a sword and helm shall cheer the loser's grief"

 then haughty dares in the lists appears
 stalking he strides his head erected bears
 his nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield
 and loud applauses echo thro' the field
 dares alone in combat us'd to stand
 the match of mighty paris hand to hand
 the same at hector's fun'rals undertook
 gigantic butes of th' amycian stock
 and by the stroke of his resistless hand
 stretch'd the vast bulk upon the yellow sand
 such dares was and such he strode along
 and drew the wonder of the gazing throng
 his brawny back and ample breast he shows
 his lifted arms around his head he throws
 and deals in whistling air his empty blows
 his match is sought but thro' the trembling band
 not one dares answer to the proud demand
 presuming of his force with sparkling eyes
 already he devours the promis'd prize
 he claims the bull with awless insolence
 and having seiz'd his horns accosts the prince
 "if none my matchless valor dares oppose
 how long shall dares wait his dastard foes
 permit me chief permit without delay
 to lead this uncontended gift away"
 the crowd assents and with redoubled cries
 for the proud challenger demands the prize

 acestes fir'd with just disdain to see
 the palm usurp'd without a victory
 reproach'd entellus thus who sate beside
 and heard and saw unmov'd the trojan's pride
 "once but in vain a champion of renown
 so tamely can you bear the ravish'd crown
 a prize in triumph borne before your sight
 and shun for fear the danger of the fight
 where is our eryx now the boasted name
 the god who taught your thund'ring arm the game
 where now your baffled honor where the spoil
 that fill'd your house and fame that fill'd our isle"
 entellus thus "my soul is still the same
 unmov'd with fear and mov'd with martial fame
 but my chill blood is curdled in my veins
 and scarce the shadow of a man remains
 o could i turn to that fair prime again
 that prime of which this boaster is so vain
 the brave who this decrepid age defies
 should feel my force without the promis'd prize"

 he said and rising at the word he threw
 two pond'rous gauntlets down in open view
 gauntlets which eryx wont in fight to wield
 and sheathe his hands with in the listed field
 with fear and wonder seiz'd the crowd beholds
 the gloves of death with sev'n distinguish'd folds
 of tough bull hides the space within is spread
 with iron or with loads of heavy lead
 dares himself was daunted at the sight
 renounc'd his challenge and refus'd to fight
 astonish'd at their weight the hero stands
 and pois'd the pond'rous engines in his hands
 "what had your wonder" said entellus "been
 had you the gauntlets of alcides seen
 or view'd the stern debate on this unhappy green
 these which i bear your brother eryx bore
 still mark'd with batter'd brains and mingled gore
 with these he long sustain'd th' herculean arm
 and these i wielded while my blood was warm
 this languish'd frame while better spirits fed
 ere age unstrung my nerves or time o'ersnow'd my head
 but if the challenger these arms refuse
 and cannot wield their weight or dare not use
 if great aeneas and acestes join
 in his request these gauntlets i resign
 let us with equal arms perform the fight
 and let him leave to fear since i resign my right"

 this said entellus for the strife prepares
 stripp'd of his quilted coat his body bares
 compos'd of mighty bones and brawn he stands
 a goodly tow'ring object on the sands
 then just aeneas equal arms supplied
 which round their shoulders to their wrists they tied
 both on the tiptoe stand at full extent
 their arms aloft their bodies inly bent
 their heads from aiming blows they bear afar
 with clashing gauntlets then provoke the war
 one on his youth and pliant limbs relies
 one on his sinews and his giant size
 the last is stiff with age his motion slow
 he heaves for breath he staggers to and fro
 and clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils loudly blow
 yet equal in success they ward they strike
 their ways are diff'rent but their art alike
 before behind the blows are dealt around
 their hollow sides the rattling thumps resound
 a storm of strokes well meant with fury flies
 and errs about their temples ears and eyes
 nor always errs for oft the gauntlet draws
 a sweeping stroke along the crackling jaws
 heavy with age entellus stands his ground
 but with his warping body wards the wound
 his hand and watchful eye keep even pace
 while dares traverses and shifts his place
 and like a captain who beleaguers round
 some strongbuilt castle on a rising ground
 views all th' approaches with observing eyes
 this and that other part in vain he tries
 and more on industry than force relies
 with hands on high entellus threats the foe
 but dares watch'd the motion from below
 and slipp'd aside and shunn'd the long descending blow
 entellus wastes his forces on the wind
 and thus deluded of the stroke design'd
 headlong and heavy fell his ample breast
 and weighty limbs his ancient mother press'd
 so falls a hollow pine that long had stood
 on ida's height or erymanthus' wood
 torn from the roots the diff'ring nations rise
 and shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies
 acestus runs with eager haste to raise
 the fall'n companion of his youthful days
 dauntless he rose and to the fight return'd
 with shame his glowing cheeks his eyes with fury burn'd
 disdain and conscious virtue fir'd his breast
 and with redoubled force his foe he press'd
 he lays on load with either hand amain
 and headlong drives the trojan o'er the plain
 nor stops nor stays nor rest nor breath allows
 but storms of strokes descend about his brows
 a rattling tempest and a hail of blows
 but now the prince who saw the wild increase
 of wounds commands the combatants to cease
 and bounds entellus' wrath and bids the peace
 first to the trojan spent with toil he came
 and sooth'd his sorrow for the suffer'd shame
 "what fury seiz'd my friend the gods" said he
 "to him propitious and averse to thee
 have giv'n his arm superior force to thine
 't is madness to contend with strength divine"
 the gauntlet fight thus ended from the shore
 his faithful friends unhappy dares bore
 his mouth and nostrils pour'd a purple flood
 and pounded teeth came rushing with his blood
 faintly he stagger'd thro' the hissing throng
 and hung his head and trail'd his legs along
 the sword and casque are carried by his train
 but with his foe the palm and ox remain

 the champion then before aeneas came
 proud of his prize but prouder of his fame
 "o goddessborn and you dardanian host
 mark with attention and forgive my boast
 learn what i was by what remains and know
 from what impending fate you sav'd my foe"
 sternly he spoke and then confronts the bull
 and on his ample forehead aiming full
 the deadly stroke descending pierc'd the skull
 down drops the beast nor needs a second wound
 but sprawls in pangs of death and spurns the ground
 then thus "in dares' stead i offer this
 eryx accept a nobler sacrifice
 take the last gift my wither'd arms can yield
 thy gauntlets i resign and here renounce the field"

 this done aeneas orders for the close
 the strife of archers with contending bows
 the mast sergesthus' shatter'd galley bore
 with his own hands he raises on the shore
 a flutt'ring dove upon the top they tie
 the living mark at which their arrows fly
 the rival archers in a line advance
 their turn of shooting to receive from chance
 a helmet holds their names the lots are drawn
 on the first scroll was read hippocoon
 the people shout upon the next was found
 young mnestheus late with naval honors crown'd
 the third contain'd eurytion's noble name
 thy brother pandarus and next in fame
 whom pallas urg'd the treaty to confound
 and send among the greeks a feather'd wound
 acestes in the bottom last remain'd
 whom not his age from youthful sports restrain'd
 soon all with vigor bend their trusty bows
 and from the quiver each his arrow chose
 hippocoon's was the first with forceful sway
 it flew and whizzing cut the liquid way
 fix'd in the mast the feather'd weapon stands
 the fearful pigeon flutters in her bands
 and the tree trembled and the shouting cries
 of the pleas'd people rend the vaulted skies
 then mnestheus to the head his arrow drove
 with lifted eyes and took his aim above
 but made a glancing shot and missed the dove
 yet miss'd so narrow that he cut the cord
 which fasten'd by the foot the flitting bird
 the captive thus releas'd away she flies
 and beats with clapping wings the yielding skies
 his bow already bent eurytion stood
 and having first invok'd his brother god
 his winged shaft with eager haste he sped
 the fatal message reach'd her as she fled
 she leaves her life aloft she strikes the ground
 and renders back the weapon in the wound
 acestes grudging at his lot remains
 without a prize to gratify his pains
 yet shooting upward sends his shaft to show
 an archer's art and boast his twanging bow
 the feather'd arrow gave a dire portent
 and latter augurs judge from this event
 chaf'd by the speed it fir'd and as it flew
 a trail of following flames ascending drew
 kindling they mount and mark the shiny way
 across the skies as falling meteors play
 and vanish into wind or in a blaze decay
 the trojans and sicilians wildly stare
 and trembling turn their wonder into pray'r
 the dardan prince put on a smiling face
 and strain'd acestes with a close embrace
 then hon'ring him with gifts above the rest
 turn'd the bad omen nor his fears confess'd
 "the gods" said he "this miracle have wrought
 and order'd you the prize without the lot
 accept this goblet rough with figur'd gold
 which thracian cisseus gave my sire of old
 this pledge of ancient amity receive
 which to my second sire i justly give"
 he said and with the trumpets' cheerful sound
 proclaim'd him victor and with laurelcrown'd
 nor good eurytion envied him the prize
 tho' he transfix'd the pigeon in the skies
 who cut the line with second gifts was grac'd
 the third was his whose arrow pierc'd the mast

 the chief before the games were wholly done
 call'd periphantes tutor to his son
 and whisper'd thus "with speed ascanius find
 and if his childish troop be ready join'd
 on horseback let him grace his grandsire's day
 and lead his equals arm'd in just array"
 he said and calling out the cirque he clears
 the crowd withdrawn an open plain appears
 and now the noble youths of form divine
 advance before their fathers in a line
 the riders grace the steeds the steeds with glory shine

 thus marching on in military pride
 shouts of applause resound from side to side
 their casques adorn'd with laurel wreaths they wear
 each brandishing aloft a cornel spear
 some at their backs their gilded quivers bore
 their chains of burnish'd gold hung down before
 three graceful troops they form'd upon the green
 three graceful leaders at their head were seen
 twelve follow'd ev'ry chief and left a space between
 the first young priam led a lovely boy
 whose grandsire was th' unhappy king of troy
 his race in after times was known to fame
 new honors adding to the latian name
 and well the royal boy his thracian steed became
 white were the fetlocks of his feet before
 and on his front a snowy star he bore
 then beauteous atys with iulus bred
 of equal age the second squadron led
 the last in order but the first in place
 first in the lovely features of his face
 rode fair ascanius on a fiery steed
 queen dido's gift and of the tyrian breed
 sure coursers for the rest the king ordains
 with golden bits adorn'd and purple reins

 the pleas'd spectators peals of shouts renew
 and all the parents in the children view
 their make their motions and their sprightly grace
 and hopes and fears alternate in their face

 th' unfledg'd commanders and their martial train
 first make the circuit of the sandy plain
 around their sires and at th' appointed sign
 drawn up in beauteous order form a line
 the second signal sounds the troop divides
 in three distinguish'd parts with three distinguish'd guides
 again they close and once again disjoin
 in troop to troop oppos'd and line to line
 they meet they wheel they throw their darts afar
 with harmless rage and welldissembled war
 then in a round the mingled bodies run
 flying they follow and pursuing shun
 broken they break and rallying they renew
 in other forms the military shew
 at last in order undiscern'd they join
 and march together in a friendly line
 and as the cretan labyrinth of old
 with wand'ring ways and many a winding fold
 involv'd the weary feet without redress
 in a round error which denied recess
 so fought the trojan boys in warlike play
 turn'd and return'd and still a diff'rent way
 thus dolphins in the deep each other chase
 in circles when they swim around the wat'ry race
 this game these carousels ascanius taught
 and building alba to the latins brought
 shew'd what he learn'd the latin sires impart
 to their succeeding sons the graceful art
 from these imperial rome receiv'd the game
 which troy the youths the trojan troop they name

 thus far the sacred sports they celebrate
 but fortune soon resum'd her ancient hate
 for while they pay the dead his annual dues
 those envied rites saturnian juno views
 and sends the goddess of the various bow
 to try new methods of revenge below
 supplies the winds to wing her airy way
 where in the port secure the navy lay
 swiftly fair iris down her arch descends
 and undiscern'd her fatal voyage ends
 she saw the gath'ring crowd and gliding thence
 the desart shore and fleet without defense
 the trojan matrons on the sands alone
 with sighs and tears anchises' death bemoan
 then turning to the sea their weeping eyes
 their pity to themselves renews their cries
 "alas" said one "what oceans yet remain
 for us to sail what labors to sustain"
 all take the word and with a gen'ral groan
 implore the gods for peace and places of their own

 the goddess great in mischief views their pains
 and in a woman's form her heav'nly limbs restrains
 in face and shape old beroe she became
 doryclus' wife a venerable dame
 once blest with riches and a mother's name
 thus chang'd amidst the crying crowd she ran
 mix'd with the matrons and these words began
 "o wretched we whom not the grecian pow'r
 nor flames destroy'd in troy's unhappy hour
 o wretched we reserv'd by cruel fate
 beyond the ruins of the sinking state
 now sev'n revolving years are wholly run
 since this improsp'rous voyage we begun
 since toss'd from shores to shores from lands to lands
 inhospitable rocks and barren sands
 wand'ring in exile thro' the stormy sea
 we search in vain for flying italy
 now cast by fortune on this kindred land
 what should our rest and rising walls withstand
 or hinder here to fix our banish'd band
 o country lost and gods redeem'd in vain
 if still in endless exile we remain
 shall we no more the trojan walls renew
 or streams of some dissembled simois view
 haste join with me th' unhappy fleet consume
 cassandra bids and i declare her doom
 in sleep i saw her she supplied my hands
 for this i more than dreamt with flaming brands
 'with these' said she 'these wand'ring ships destroy
 these are your fatal seats and this your troy'
 time calls you now the precious hour employ
 slack not the good presage while heav'n inspires
 our minds to dare and gives the ready fires
 see neptune's altars minister their brands
 the god is pleas'd the god supplies our hands"
 then from the pile a flaming fire she drew
 and toss'd in air amidst the galleys threw

 wrapp'd in amaze the matrons wildly stare
 then pyrgo reverenc'd for her hoary hair
 pyrgo the nurse of priam's num'rous race
 "no beroe this tho' she belies her face
 what terrors from her frowning front arise
 behold a goddess in her ardent eyes
 what rays around her heav'nly face are seen
 mark her majestic voice and more than mortal mien
 beroe but now i left whom pin'd with pain
 her age and anguish from these rites detain"
 she said the matrons seiz'd with new amaze
 roll their malignant eyes and on the navy gaze
 they fear and hope and neither part obey
 they hope the fated land but fear the fatal way
 the goddess having done her task below
 mounts up on equal wings and bends her painted bow
 struck with the sight and seiz'd with rage divine
 the matrons prosecute their mad design
 they shriek aloud they snatch with impious hands
 the food of altars fires and flaming brands
 green boughs and saplings mingled in their haste
 and smoking torches on the ships they cast
 the flame unstopp'd at first more fury gains
 and vulcan rides at large with loosen'd reins
 triumphant to the painted sterns he soars
 and seizes in this way the banks and crackling oars
 eumelus was the first the news to bear
 while yet they crowd the rural theater
 then what they hear is witness'd by their eyes
 a storm of sparkles and of flames arise
 ascanius took th' alarm while yet he led
 his early warriors on his prancing steed
 and spurring on his equals soon o'erpass'd
 nor could his frighted friends reclaim his haste
 soon as the royal youth appear'd in view
 he sent his voice before him as he flew
 "what madness moves you matrons to destroy
 the last remainders of unhappy troy
 not hostile fleets but your own hopes you burn
 and on your friends your fatal fury turn
 behold your own ascanius" while he said
 he drew his glitt'ring helmet from his head
 in which the youths to sportful arms he led
 by this aeneas and his train appear
 and now the women seiz'd with shame and fear
 dispers'd to woods and caverns take their flight
 abhor their actions and avoid the light
 their friends acknowledge and their error find
 and shake the goddess from their alter'd mind

 not so the raging fires their fury cease
 but lurking in the seams with seeming peace
 work on their way amid the smold'ring tow
 sure in destruction but in motion slow
 the silent plague thro' the green timber eats
 and vomits out a tardy flame by fits
 down to the keels and upward to the sails
 the fire descends or mounts but still prevails
 nor buckets pour'd nor strength of human hand
 can the victorious element withstand

 the pious hero rends his robe and throws
 to heav'n his hands and with his hands his vows
 "o jove" he cried "if pray'rs can yet have place
 if thou abhorr'st not all the dardan race
 if any spark of pity still remain
 if gods are gods and not invok'd in vain
 yet spare the relics of the trojan train
 yet from the flames our burning vessels free
 or let thy fury fall alone on me
 at this devoted head thy thunder throw
 and send the willing sacrifice below"

 scarce had he said when southern storms arise
 from pole to pole the forky lightning flies
 loud rattling shakes the mountains and the plain
 heav'n bellies downward and descends in rain
 whole sheets of water from the clouds are sent
 which hissing thro' the planks the flames prevent
 and stop the fiery pest four ships alone
 burn to the waist and for the fleet atone

 but doubtful thoughts the hero's heart divide
 if he should still in sicily reside
 forgetful of his fates or tempt the main
 in hope the promis'd italy to gain
 then nautes old and wise to whom alone
 the will of heav'n by pallas was foreshown
 vers'd in portents experienc'd and inspir'd
 to tell events and what the fates requir'd
 thus while he stood to neither part inclin'd
 with cheerful words reliev'd his lab'ring mind
 "o goddessborn resign'd in ev'ry state
 with patience bear with prudence push your fate
 by suff'ring well our fortune we subdue
 fly when she frowns and when she calls pursue
 your friend acestes is of trojan kind
 to him disclose the secrets of your mind
 trust in his hands your old and useless train
 too num'rous for the ships which yet remain
 the feeble old indulgent of their ease
 the dames who dread the dangers of the seas
 with all the dastard crew who dare not stand
 the shock of battle with your foes by land
 here you may build a common town for all
 and from acestes' name acesta call"
 the reasons with his friend's experience join'd
 encourag'd much but more disturb'd his mind

 't was dead of night when to his slumb'ring eyes
 his father's shade descended from the skies
 and thus he spoke "o more than vital breath
 lov'd while i liv'd and dear ev'n after death
 o son in various toils and troubles toss'd
 the king of heav'n employs my careful ghost
 on his commands the god who sav'd from fire
 your flaming fleet and heard your just desire
 the wholesome counsel of your friend receive
 and here the coward train and woman leave
 the chosen youth and those who nobly dare
 transport to tempt the dangers of the war
 the stern italians will their courage try
 rough are their manners and their minds are high
 but first to pluto's palace you shall go
 and seek my shade among the blest below
 for not with impious ghosts my soul remains
 nor suffers with the damn'd perpetual pains
 but breathes the living air of soft elysian plains
 the chaste sibylla shall your steps convey
 and blood of offer'd victims free the way
 there shall you know what realms the gods assign
 and learn the fates and fortunes of your line
 but now farewell i vanish with the night
 and feel the blast of heav'n's approaching light"
 he said and mix'd with shades and took his airy flight
 "whither so fast" the filial duty cried
 "and why ah why the wish'd embrace denied"

 he said and rose as holy zeal inspires
 he rakes hot embers and renews the fires
 his country gods and vesta then adores
 with cakes and incense and their aid implores
 next for his friends and royal host he sent
 reveal'd his vision and the gods' intent
 with his own purpose all without delay
 the will of jove and his desires obey
 they list with women each degenerate name
 who dares not hazard life for future fame
 these they cashier the brave remaining few
 oars banks and cables half consum'd renew
 the prince designs a city with the plow
 the lots their sev'ral tenements allow
 this part is nam'd from ilium that from troy
 and the new king ascends the throne with joy
 a chosen senate from the people draws
 appoints the judges and ordains the laws
 then on the top of eryx they begin
 a rising temple to the paphian queen
 anchises last is honor'd as a god
 a priest is added annual gifts bestow'd
 and groves are planted round his blest abode
 nine days they pass in feasts their temples crown'd
 and fumes of incense in the fanes abound
 then from the south arose a gentle breeze
 that curl'd the smoothness of the glassy seas
 the rising winds a ruffling gale afford
 and call the merry mariners aboard

 now loud laments along the shores resound
 of parting friends in close embraces bound
 the trembling women the degenerate train
 who shunn'd the frightful dangers of the main
 ev'n those desire to sail and take their share
 of the rough passage and the promis'd war
 whom good aeneas cheers and recommends
 to their new master's care his fearful friends
 on eryx's altars three fat calves he lays
 a lamb newfallen to the stormy seas
 then slips his haulsers and his anchors weighs
 high on the deck the godlike hero stands
 with olive crown'd a charger in his hands
 then cast the reeking entrails in the brine
 and pour'd the sacrifice of purple wine
 fresh gales arise with equal strokes they vie
 and brush the buxom seas and o'er the billows fly

 meantime the mother goddess full of fears
 to neptune thus address'd with tender tears
 "the pride of jove's imperious queen the rage
 the malice which no suff'rings can assuage
 compel me to these pray'rs since neither fate
 nor time nor pity can remove her hate
 ev'n jove is thwarted by his haughty wife
 still vanquish'd yet she still renews the strife
 as if 't were little to consume the town
 which aw'd the world and wore th' imperial crown
 she prosecutes the ghost of troy with pains
 and gnaws ev'n to the bones the last remains
 let her the causes of her hatred tell
 but you can witness its effects too well
 you saw the storm she rais'd on libyan floods
 that mix'd the mounting billows with the clouds
 when bribing aeolus she shook the main
 and mov'd rebellion in your wat'ry reign
 with fury she possess'd the dardan dames
 to burn their fleet with execrable flames
 and forc'd aeneas when his ships were lost
 to leave his foll'wers on a foreign coast
 for what remains your godhead i implore
 and trust my son to your protecting pow'r
 if neither jove's nor fate's decree withstand
 secure his passage to the latian land"

 then thus the mighty ruler of the main
 "what may not venus hope from neptune's reign
 my kingdom claims your birth my late defense
 of your indanger'd fleet may claim your confidence
 nor less by land than sea my deeds declare
 how much your lov'd aeneas is my care
 thee xanthus and thee simois i attest
 your trojan troops when proud achilles press'd
 and drove before him headlong on the plain
 and dash'd against the walls the trembling train
 when floods were fill'd with bodies of the slain
 when crimson xanthus doubtful of his way
 stood up on ridges to behold the sea
 new heaps came tumbling in and chok'd his way
 when your aeneas fought but fought with odds
 of force unequal and unequal gods
 i spread a cloud before the victor's sight
 sustain'd the vanquish'd and secur'd his flight
 ev'n then secur'd him when i sought with joy
 the vow'd destruction of ungrateful troy
 my will's the same fair goddess fear no more
 your fleet shall safely gain the latian shore
 their lives are giv'n one destin'd head alone
 shall perish and for multitudes atone"
 thus having arm'd with hopes her anxious mind
 his finny team saturnian neptune join'd
 then adds the foamy bridle to their jaws
 and to the loosen'd reins permits the laws
 high on the waves his azure car he guides
 its axles thunder and the sea subsides
 and the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides
 the tempests fly before their father's face
 trains of inferior gods his triumph grace
 and monster whales before their master play
 and choirs of tritons crowd the wat'ry way
 the marshal'd pow'rs in equal troops divide
 to right and left the gods his better side
 inclose and on the worse the nymphs and nereids ride

 now smiling hope with sweet vicissitude
 within the hero's mind his joys renew'd
 he calls to raise the masts the sheets display
 the cheerful crew with diligence obey
 they scud before the wind and sail in open sea
 ahead of all the master pilot steers
 and as he leads the following navy veers
 the steeds of night had travel'd half the sky
 the drowsy rowers on their benches lie
 when the soft god of sleep with easy flight
 descends and draws behind a trail of light
 thou palinurus art his destin'd prey
 to thee alone he takes his fatal way
 dire dreams to thee and iron sleep he bears
 and lighting on thy prow the form of phorbas wears
 then thus the traitor god began his tale
 "the winds my friend inspire a pleasing gale
 the ships without thy care securely sail
 now steal an hour of sweet repose and i
 will take the rudder and thy room supply"
 to whom the yawning pilot half asleep
 "me dost thou bid to trust the treach'rous deep
 the harlot smiles of her dissembling face
 and to her faith commit the trojan race
 shall i believe the siren south again
 and oft betray'd not know the monster main"
 he said his fasten'd hands the rudder keep
 and fix'd on heav'n his eyes repel invading sleep
 the god was wroth and at his temples threw
 a branch in lethe dipp'd and drunk with stygian dew
 the pilot vanquish'd by the pow'r divine
 soon clos'd his swimming eyes and lay supine
 scarce were his limbs extended at their length
 the god insulting with superior strength
 fell heavy on him plung'd him in the sea
 and with the stern the rudder tore away
 headlong he fell and struggling in the main
 cried out for helping hands but cried in vain
 the victor daemon mounts obscure in air
 while the ship sails without the pilot's care
 on neptune's faith the floating fleet relies
 but what the man forsook the god supplies
 and o'er the dang'rous deep secure the navy flies
 glides by the sirens' cliffs a shelfy coast
 long infamous for ships and sailors lost
 and white with bones th' impetuous ocean roars
 and rocks rebellow from the sounding shores
 the watchful hero felt the knocks and found
 the tossing vessel sail'd on shoaly ground
 sure of his pilot's loss he takes himself
 the helm and steers aloof and shuns the shelf
 inly he griev'd and groaning from the breast
 deplor'd his death and thus his pain express'd
 "for faith repos'd on seas and on the flatt'ring sky
 thy naked corpse is doom'd on shores unknown to lie"




 book vi

 he said and wept then spread his sails before
 the winds and reach'd at length the cumaean shore
 their anchors dropp'd his crew the vessels moor
 they turn their heads to sea their sterns to land
 and greet with greedy joy th' italian strand
 some strike from clashing flints their fiery seed
 some gather sticks the kindled flames to feed
 or search for hollow trees and fell the woods
 or trace thro' valleys the discover'd floods
 thus while their sev'ral charges they fulfil
 the pious prince ascends the sacred hill
 where phoebus is ador'd and seeks the shade
 which hides from sight his venerable maid
 deep in a cave the sibyl makes abode
 thence full of fate returns and of the god
 thro' trivia's grove they walk and now behold
 and enter now the temple roof'd with gold
 when daedalus to fly the cretan shore
 his heavy limbs on jointed pinions bore
 the first who sail'd in air 't is sung by fame
 to the cumaean coast at length he came
 and here alighting built this costly frame
 inscrib'd to phoebus here he hung on high
 the steerage of his wings that cut the sky
 then o'er the lofty gate his art emboss'd
 androgeos' death and off'rings to his ghost
 sev'n youths from athens yearly sent to meet
 the fate appointed by revengeful crete
 and next to those the dreadful urn was plac'd
 in which the destin'd names by lots were cast
 the mournful parents stand around in tears
 and rising crete against their shore appears
 there too in living sculpture might be seen
 the mad affection of the cretan queen
 then how she cheats her bellowing lover's eye
 the rushing leap the doubtful progeny
 the lower part a beast a man above
 the monument of their polluted love
 not far from thence he grav'd the wondrous maze
 a thousand doors a thousand winding ways
 here dwells the monster hid from human view
 not to be found but by the faithful clew
 till the kind artist mov'd with pious grief
 lent to the loving maid this last relief
 and all those erring paths describ'd so well
 that theseus conquer'd and the monster fell
 here hapless icarus had found his part
 had not the father's grief restrain'd his art
 he twice assay'd to cast his son in gold
 twice from his hands he dropp'd the forming mold

 all this with wond'ring eyes aeneas view'd
 each varying object his delight renew'd
 eager to read the rest achates came
 and by his side the mad divining dame
 the priestess of the god deiphobe her name
 "time suffers not" she said "to feed your eyes
 with empty pleasures haste the sacrifice
 sev'n bullocks yet unyok'd for phoebus choose
 and for diana sev'n unspotted ewes"
 this said the servants urge the sacred rites
 while to the temple she the prince invites
 a spacious cave within its farmost part
 was hew'd and fashion'd by laborious art
 thro' the hill's hollow sides before the place
 a hundred doors a hundred entries grace
 as many voices issue and the sound
 of sybil's words as many times rebound
 now to the mouth they come aloud she cries
 "this is the time enquire your destinies
 he comes behold the god" thus while she said
 and shiv'ring at the sacred entry stay'd
 her color chang'd her face was not the same
 and hollow groans from her deep spirit came
 her hair stood up convulsive rage possess'd
 her trembling limbs and heav'd her lab'ring breast
 greater than humankind she seem'd to look
 and with an accent more than mortal spoke
 her staring eyes with sparkling fury roll
 when all the god came rushing on her soul
 swiftly she turn'd and foaming as she spoke
 "why this delay" she cried "the pow'rs invoke
 thy pray'rs alone can open this abode
 else vain are my demands and dumb the god"

 she said no more the trembling trojans hear
 o'erspread with a damp sweat and holy fear
 the prince himself with awful dread possess'd
 his vows to great apollo thus address'd
 "indulgent god propitious pow'r to troy
 swift to relieve unwilling to destroy
 directed by whose hand the dardan dart
 pierc'd the proud grecian's only mortal part
 thus far by fate's decrees and thy commands
 thro' ambient seas and thro' devouring sands
 our exil'd crew has sought th' ausonian ground
 and now at length the flying coast is found
 thus far the fate of troy from place to place
 with fury has pursued her wand'ring race
 here cease ye pow'rs and let your vengeance end
 troy is no more and can no more offend
 and thou o sacred maid inspir'd to see
 th' event of things in dark futurity
 give me what heav'n has promis'd to my fate
 to conquer and command the latian state
 to fix my wand'ring gods and find a place
 for the long exiles of the trojan race
 then shall my grateful hands a temple rear
 to the twin gods with vows and solemn pray'r
 and annual rites and festivals and games
 shall be perform'd to their auspicious names
 nor shalt thou want thy honors in my land
 for there thy faithful oracles shall stand
 preserv'd in shrines and ev'ry sacred lay
 which by thy mouth apollo shall convey
 all shall be treasur'd by a chosen train
 of holy priests and ever shall remain
 but o commit not thy prophetic mind
 to flitting leaves the sport of ev'ry wind
 lest they disperse in air our empty fate
 write not but what the pow'rs ordain relate"

 struggling in vain impatient of her load
 and lab'ring underneath the pond'rous god
 the more she strove to shake him from her breast
 with more and far superior force he press'd
 commands his entrance and without control
 usurps her organs and inspires her soul
 now with a furious blast the hundred doors
 ope of themselves a rushing whirlwind roars
 within the cave and sibyl's voice restores
 "escap'd the dangers of the wat'ry reign
 yet more and greater ills by land remain
 the coast so long desir'd nor doubt th' event
 thy troops shall reach but having reach'd repent
 wars horrid wars i view a field of blood
 and tiber rolling with a purple flood
 simois nor xanthus shall be wanting there
 a new achilles shall in arms appear
 and he too goddessborn fierce juno's hate
 added to hostile force shall urge thy fate
 to what strange nations shalt not thou resort
 driv'n to solicit aid at ev'ry court
 the cause the same which ilium once oppress'd
 a foreign mistress and a foreign guest
 but thou secure of soul unbent with woes
 the more thy fortune frowns the more oppose
 the dawnings of thy safety shall be shown
 from whence thou least shalt hope a grecian town"

 thus from the dark recess the sibyl spoke
 and the resisting air the thunder broke
 the cave rebellow'd and the temple shook
 th' ambiguous god who rul'd her lab'ring breast
 in these mysterious words his mind express'd
 some truths reveal'd in terms involv'd the rest
 at length her fury fell her foaming ceas'd
 and ebbing in her soul the god decreas'd
 then thus the chief "no terror to my view
 no frightful face of danger can be new
 inur'd to suffer and resolv'd to dare
 the fates without my pow'r shall be without my care
 this let me crave since near your grove the road
 to hell lies open and the dark abode
 which acheron surrounds th' innavigable flood
 conduct me thro' the regions void of light
 and lead me longing to my father's sight
 for him a thousand dangers i have sought
 and rushing where the thickest grecians fought
 safe on my back the sacred burthen brought
 he for my sake the raging ocean tried
 and wrath of heav'n my still auspicious guide
 and bore beyond the strength decrepid age supplied
 oft since he breath'd his last in dead of night
 his reverend image stood before my sight
 enjoin'd to seek below his holy shade
 conducted there by your unerring aid
 but you if pious minds by pray'rs are won
 oblige the father and protect the son
 yours is the pow'r nor proserpine in vain
 has made you priestess of her nightly reign
 if orpheus arm'd with his enchanting lyre
 the ruthless king with pity could inspire
 and from the shades below redeem his wife
 if pollux off'ring his alternate life
 could free his brother and can daily go
 by turns aloft by turns descend below
 why name i theseus or his greater friend
 who trod the downward path and upward could ascend
 not less than theirs from jove my lineage came
 my mother greater my descent the same"
 so pray'd the trojan prince and while he pray'd
 his hand upon the holy altar laid

 then thus replied the prophetess divine
 "o goddessborn of great anchises' line
 the gates of hell are open night and day
 smooth the descent and easy is the way
 but to return and view the cheerful skies
 in this the task and mighty labor lies
 to few great jupiter imparts this grace
 and those of shining worth and heav'nly race
 betwixt those regions and our upper light
 deep forests and impenetrable night
 possess the middle space th' infernal bounds
 cocytus with his sable waves surrounds
 but if so dire a love your soul invades
 as twice below to view the trembling shades
 if you so hard a toil will undertake
 as twice to pass th' innavigable lake
 receive my counsel in the neighb'ring grove
 there stands a tree the queen of stygian jove
 claims it her own thick woods and gloomy night
 conceal the happy plant from human sight
 one bough it bears but wondrous to behold
 the ductile rind and leaves of radiant gold
 this from the vulgar branches must be torn
 and to fair proserpine the present borne
 ere leave be giv'n to tempt the nether skies
 the first thus rent a second will arise
 and the same metal the same room supplies
 look round the wood with lifted eyes to see
 the lurking gold upon the fatal tree
 then rend it off as holy rites command
 the willing metal will obey thy hand
 following with ease if favor'd by thy fate
 thou art foredoom'd to view the stygian state
 if not no labor can the tree constrain
 and strength of stubborn arms and steel are vain
 besides you know not while you here attend
 th' unworthy fate of your unhappy friend
 breathless he lies and his unburied ghost
 depriv'd of fun'ral rites pollutes your host
 pay first his pious dues and for the dead
 two sable sheep around his hearse be led
 then living turfs upon his body lay
 this done securely take the destin'd way
 to find the regions destitute of day"

 she said and held her peace aeneas went
 sad from the cave and full of discontent
 unknowing whom the sacred sibyl meant
 achates the companion of his breast
 goes grieving by his side with equal cares oppress'd
 walking they talk'd and fruitlessly divin'd
 what friend the priestess by those words design'd
 but soon they found an object to deplore
 misenus lay extended on the shore
 son of the god of winds none so renown'd
 the warrior trumpet in the field to sound
 with breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms
 and rouse to dare their fate in honorable arms
 he serv'd great hector and was ever near
 not with his trumpet only but his spear
 but by pelides' arms when hector fell
 he chose aeneas and he chose as well
 swoln with applause and aiming still at more
 he now provokes the sea gods from the shore
 with envy triton heard the martial sound
 and the bold champion for his challenge drown'd
 then cast his mangled carcass on the strand
 the gazing crowd around the body stand
 all weep but most aeneas mourns his fate
 and hastens to perform the funeral state
 in altarwise a stately pile they rear
 the basis broad below and top advanc'd in air
 an ancient wood fit for the work design'd
 the shady covert of the salvage kind
 the trojans found the sounding ax is plied
 firs pines and pitch trees and the tow'ring pride
 of forest ashes feel the fatal stroke
 and piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak
 huge trunks of trees fell'd from the steepy crown
 of the bare mountains roll with ruin down
 arm'd like the rest the trojan prince appears
 and by his pious labor urges theirs

 thus while he wrought revolving in his mind
 the ways to compass what his wish design'd
 he cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove
 and then with vows implor'd the queen of love
 "o may thy pow'r propitious still to me
 conduct my steps to find the fatal tree
 in this deep forest since the sibyl's breath
 foretold alas too true misenus' death"
 scarce had he said when full before his sight
 two doves descending from their airy flight
 secure upon the grassy plain alight
 he knew his mother's birds and thus he pray'd
 "be you my guides with your auspicious aid
 and lead my footsteps till the branch be found
 whose glitt'ring shadow gilds the sacred ground
 and thou great parent with celestial care
 in this distress be present to my pray'r"
 thus having said he stopp'd with watchful sight
 observing still the motions of their flight
 what course they took what happy signs they shew
 they fed and flutt'ring by degrees withdrew
 still farther from the place but still in view
 hopping and flying thus they led him on
 to the slow lake whose baleful stench to shun
 they wing'd their flight aloft then stooping low
 perch'd on the double tree that bears the golden bough
 thro' the green leafs the glitt'ring shadows glow
 as on the sacred oak the wintry mistletoe
 where the proud mother views her precious brood
 and happier branches which she never sow'd
 such was the glitt'ring such the ruddy rind
 and dancing leaves that wanton'd in the wind
 he seiz'd the shining bough with griping hold
 and rent away with ease the ling'ring gold
 then to the sibyl's palace bore the prize
 meantime the trojan troops with weeping eyes
 to dead misenus pay his obsequies
 first from the ground a lofty pile they rear
 of pitch trees oaks and pines and unctuous fir
 the fabric's front with cypress twigs they strew
 and stick the sides with boughs of baleful yew
 the topmost part his glitt'ring arms adorn
 warm waters then in brazen caldrons borne
 are pour'd to wash his body joint by joint
 and fragrant oils the stiffen'd limbs anoint
 with groans and cries misenus they deplore
 then on a bier with purple cover'd o'er
 the breathless body thus bewail'd they lay
 and fire the pile their faces turn'd away
 such reverend rites their fathers us'd to pay
 pure oil and incense on the fire they throw
 and fat of victims which his friends bestow
 these gifts the greedy flames to dust devour
 then on the living coals red wine they pour
 and last the relics by themselves dispose
 which in a brazen urn the priests inclose
 old corynaeus compass'd thrice the crew
 and dipp'd an olive branch in holy dew
 which thrice he sprinkled round and thrice aloud
 invok'd the dead and then dismissed the crowd
 but good aeneas order'd on the shore
 a stately tomb whose top a trumpet bore
 a soldier's fauchion and a seaman's oar
 thus was his friend interr'd and deathless fame
 still to the lofty cape consigns his name
 these rites perform'd the prince without delay
 hastes to the nether world his destin'd way
 deep was the cave and downward as it went
 from the wide mouth a rocky rough descent
 and here th' access a gloomy grove defends
 and there th' unnavigable lake extends
 o'er whose unhappy waters void of light
 no bird presumes to steer his airy flight
 such deadly stenches from the depths arise
 and steaming sulphur that infects the skies
 from hence the grecian bards their legends make
 and give the name avernus to the lake
 four sable bullocks in the yoke untaught
 for sacrifice the pious hero brought
 the priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns
 then cuts the curling hair that first oblation burns
 invoking hecate hither to repair
 a pow'rful name in hell and upper air
 the sacred priests with ready knives bereave
 the beasts of life and in full bowls receive
 the streaming blood a lamb to hell and night
 the sable wool without a streak of white
 aeneas offers and by fate's decree
 a barren heifer proserpine to thee
 with holocausts he pluto's altar fills
 sev'n brawny bulls with his own hand he kills
 then on the broiling entrails oil he pours
 which ointed thus the raging flame devours
 late the nocturnal sacrifice begun
 nor ended till the next returning sun
 then earth began to bellow trees to dance
 and howling dogs in glimm'ring light advance
 ere hecate came "far hence be souls profane"
 the sibyl cried "and from the grove abstain
 now trojan take the way thy fates afford
 assume thy courage and unsheathe thy sword"
 she said and pass'd along the gloomy space
 the prince pursued her steps with equal pace

 ye realms yet unreveal'd to human sight
 ye gods who rule the regions of the night
 ye gliding ghosts permit me to relate
 the mystic wonders of your silent state

 obscure they went thro' dreary shades that led
 along the waste dominions of the dead
 thus wander travelers in woods by night
 by the moon's doubtful and malignant light
 when jove in dusky clouds involves the skies
 and the faint crescent shoots by fits before their eyes

 just in the gate and in the jaws of hell
 revengeful cares and sullen sorrows dwell
 and pale diseases and repining age
 want fear and famine's unresisted rage
 here toils and death and death's halfbrother sleep
 forms terrible to view their sentry keep
 with anxious pleasures of a guilty mind
 deep frauds before and open force behind
 the furies' iron beds and strife that shakes
 her hissing tresses and unfolds her snakes
 full in the midst of this infernal road
 an elm displays her dusky arms abroad
 the god of sleep there hides his heavy head
 and empty dreams on ev'ry leaf are spread
 of various forms unnumber'd specters more
 centaurs and double shapes besiege the door
 before the passage horrid hydra stands
 and briareus with all his hundred hands
 gorgons geryon with his triple frame
 and vain chimaera vomits empty flame
 the chief unsheath'd his shining steel prepar'd
 tho' seiz'd with sudden fear to force the guard
 off'ring his brandish'd weapon at their face
 had not the sibyl stopp'd his eager pace
 and told him what those empty phantoms were
 forms without bodies and impassive air
 hence to deep acheron they take their way
 whose troubled eddies thick with ooze and clay
 are whirl'd aloft and in cocytus lost
 there charon stands who rules the dreary coast
 a sordid god down from his hoary chin
 a length of beard descends uncomb'd unclean
 his eyes like hollow furnaces on fire
 a girdle foul with grease binds his obscene attire
 he spreads his canvas with his pole he steers
 the freights of flitting ghosts in his thin bottom bears
 he look'd in years yet in his years were seen
 a youthful vigor and autumnal green
 an airy crowd came rushing where he stood
 which fill'd the margin of the fatal flood
 husbands and wives boys and unmarried maids
 and mighty heroes' more majestic shades
 and youths intomb'd before their fathers' eyes
 with hollow groans and shrieks and feeble cries
 thick as the leaves in autumn strow the woods
 or fowls by winter forc'd forsake the floods
 and wing their hasty flight to happier lands
 such and so thick the shiv'ring army stands
 and press for passage with extended hands
 now these now those the surly boatman bore
 the rest he drove to distance from the shore
 the hero who beheld with wond'ring eyes
 the tumult mix'd with shrieks laments and cries
 ask'd of his guide what the rude concourse meant
 why to the shore the thronging people bent
 what forms of law among the ghosts were us'd
 why some were ferried o'er and some refus'd

 "son of anchises offspring of the gods"
 the sibyl said "you see the stygian floods
 the sacred stream which heav'n's imperial state
 attests in oaths and fears to violate
 the ghosts rejected are th' unhappy crew
 depriv'd of sepulchers and fun'ral due
 the boatman charon those the buried host
 he ferries over to the farther coast
 nor dares his transport vessel cross the waves
 with such whose bones are not compos'd in graves
 a hundred years they wander on the shore
 at length their penance done are wafted o'er"
 the trojan chief his forward pace repress'd
 revolving anxious thoughts within his breast
 he saw his friends who whelm'd beneath the waves
 their fun'ral honors claim'd and ask'd their quiet graves
 the lost leucaspis in the crowd he knew
 and the brave leader of the lycian crew
 whom on the tyrrhene seas the tempests met
 the sailors master'd and the ship o'erset

 amidst the spirits palinurus press'd
 yet fresh from life a newadmitted guest
 who while he steering view'd the stars and bore
 his course from afric to the latian shore
 fell headlong down the trojan fix'd his view
 and scarcely thro' the gloom the sullen shadow knew
 then thus the prince "what envious pow'r o friend
 brought your lov'd life to this disastrous end
 for phoebus ever true in all he said
 has in your fate alone my faith betray'd
 the god foretold you should not die before
 you reach'd secure from seas th' italian shore
 is this th' unerring pow'r" the ghost replied
 "nor phoebus flatter'd nor his answers lied
 nor envious gods have sent me to the deep
 but while the stars and course of heav'n i keep
 my wearied eyes were seiz'd with fatal sleep
 i fell and with my weight the helm constrain'd
 was drawn along which yet my gripe retain'd
 now by the winds and raging waves i swear
 your safety more than mine was then my care
 lest of the guide bereft the rudder lost
 your ship should run against the rocky coast
 three blust'ring nights borne by the southern blast
 i floated and discover'd land at last
 high on a mounting wave my head i bore
 forcing my strength and gath'ring to the shore
 panting but past the danger now i seiz'd
 the craggy cliffs and my tir'd members eas'd
 while cumber'd with my dropping clothes i lay
 the cruel nation covetous of prey
 stain'd with my blood th' unhospitable coast
 and now by winds and waves my lifeless limbs are toss'd
 which o avert by yon ethereal light
 which i have lost for this eternal night
 or if by dearer ties you may be won
 by your dead sire and by your living son
 redeem from this reproach my wand'ring ghost
 or with your navy seek the velin coast
 and in a peaceful grave my corpse compose
 or if a nearer way your mother shows
 without whose aid you durst not undertake
 this frightful passage o'er the stygian lake
 lend to this wretch your hand and waft him o'er
 to the sweet banks of yon forbidden shore"
 scarce had he said the prophetess began
 "what hopes delude thee miserable man
 think'st thou thus unintomb'd to cross the floods
 to view the furies and infernal gods
 and visit without leave the dark abodes
 attend the term of long revolving years
 fate and the dooming gods are deaf to tears
 this comfort of thy dire misfortune take
 the wrath of heav'n inflicted for thy sake
 with vengeance shall pursue th' inhuman coast
 till they propitiate thy offended ghost
 and raise a tomb with vows and solemn pray'r
 and palinurus' name the place shall bear"
 this calm'd his cares sooth'd with his future fame
 and pleas'd to hear his propagated name

 now nearer to the stygian lake they draw
 whom from the shore the surly boatman saw
 observ'd their passage thro' the shady wood
 and mark'd their near approaches to the flood
 then thus he call'd aloud inflam'd with wrath
 "mortal whate'er who this forbidden path
 in arms presum'st to tread i charge thee stand
 and tell thy name and bus'ness in the land
 know this the realm of night the stygian shore
 my boat conveys no living bodies o'er
 nor was i pleas'd great theseus once to bear
 who forc'd a passage with his pointed spear
 nor strong alcides men of mighty fame
 and from th' immortal gods their lineage came
 in fetters one the barking porter tied
 and took him trembling from his sov'reign's side
 two sought by force to seize his beauteous bride"
 to whom the sibyl thus "compose thy mind
 nor frauds are here contriv'd nor force design'd
 still may the dog the wand'ring troops constrain
 of airy ghosts and vex the guilty train
 and with her grisly lord his lovely queen remain
 the trojan chief whose lineage is from jove
 much fam'd for arms and more for filial love
 is sent to seek his sire in your elysian grove
 if neither piety nor heav'n's command
 can gain his passage to the stygian strand
 this fatal present shall prevail at least"
 then shew'd the shining bough conceal'd within her vest
 no more was needful for the gloomy god
 stood mute with awe to see the golden rod
 admir'd the destin'd off'ring to his queen
 a venerable gift so rarely seen
 his fury thus appeas'd he puts to land
 the ghosts forsake their seats at his command
 he clears the deck receives the mighty freight
 the leaky vessel groans beneath the weight
 slowly she sails and scarcely stems the tides
 the pressing water pours within her sides
 his passengers at length are wafted o'er
 expos'd in muddy weeds upon the miry shore

 no sooner landed in his den they found
 the triple porter of the stygian sound
 grim cerberus who soon began to rear
 his crested snakes and arm'd his bristling hair
 the prudent sibyl had before prepar'd
 a sop in honey steep'd to charm the guard
 which mix'd with pow'rful drugs she cast before
 his greedy grinning jaws just op'd to roar
 with three enormous mouths he gapes and straight
 with hunger press'd devours the pleasing bait
 long draughts of sleep his monstrous limbs enslave
 he reels and falling fills the spacious cave
 the keeper charm'd the chief without delay
 pass'd on and took th' irremeable way
 before the gates the cries of babes new born
 whom fate had from their tender mothers torn
 assault his ears then those whom form of laws
 condemn'd to die when traitors judg'd their cause
 nor want they lots nor judges to review
 the wrongful sentence and award a new
 minos the strict inquisitor appears
 and lives and crimes with his assessors hears
 round in his urn the blended balls he rolls
 absolves the just and dooms the guilty souls
 the next in place and punishment are they
 who prodigally throw their souls away
 fools who repining at their wretched state
 and loathing anxious life suborn'd their fate
 with late repentance now they would retrieve
 the bodies they forsook and wish to live
 their pains and poverty desire to bear
 to view the light of heav'n and breathe the vital air
 but fate forbids the stygian floods oppose
 and with circling streams the captive souls inclose

 not far from thence the mournful fields appear
 so call'd from lovers that inhabit there
 the souls whom that unhappy flame invades
 in secret solitude and myrtle shades
 make endless moans and pining with desire
 lament too late their unextinguish'd fire
 here procris eriphyle here he found
 baring her breast yet bleeding with the wound
 made by her son he saw pasiphae there
 with phaedra's ghost a foul incestuous pair
 there laodamia with evadne moves
 unhappy both but loyal in their loves
 caeneus a woman once and once a man
 but ending in the sex she first began
 not far from these phoenician dido stood
 fresh from her wound her bosom bath'd in blood
 whom when the trojan hero hardly knew
 obscure in shades and with a doubtful view
 doubtful as he who sees thro' dusky night
 or thinks he sees the moon's uncertain light
 with tears he first approach'd the sullen shade
 and as his love inspir'd him thus he said
 "unhappy queen then is the common breath
 of rumor true in your reported death
 and i alas the cause by heav'n i vow
 and all the pow'rs that rule the realms below
 unwilling i forsook your friendly state
 commanded by the gods and forc'd by fate
 those gods that fate whose unresisted might
 have sent me to these regions void of light
 thro' the vast empire of eternal night
 nor dar'd i to presume that press'd with grief
 my flight should urge you to this dire relief
 stay stay your steps and listen to my vows
 't is the last interview that fate allows"
 in vain he thus attempts her mind to move
 with tears and pray'rs and laterepenting love
 disdainfully she look'd then turning round
 but fix'd her eyes unmov'd upon the ground
 and what he says and swears regards no more
 than the deaf rocks when the loud billows roar
 but whirl'd away to shun his hateful sight
 hid in the forest and the shades of night
 then sought sichaeus thro' the shady grove
 who answer'd all her cares and equal'd all her love

 some pious tears the pitying hero paid
 and follow'd with his eyes the flitting shade
 then took the forward way by fate ordain'd
 and with his guide the farther fields attain'd
 where sever'd from the rest the warrior souls remain'd
 tydeus he met with meleager's race
 the pride of armies and the soldiers' grace
 and pale adrastus with his ghastly face
 of trojan chiefs he view'd a num'rous train
 all much lamented all in battle slain
 glaucus and medon high above the rest
 antenor's sons and ceres' sacred priest
 and proud idaeus priam's charioteer
 who shakes his empty reins and aims his airy spear
 the gladsome ghosts in circling troops attend
 and with unwearied eyes behold their friend
 delight to hover near and long to know
 what bus'ness brought him to the realms below
 but argive chiefs and agamemnon's train
 when his refulgent arms flash'd thro' the shady plain
 fled from his wellknown face with wonted fear
 as when his thund'ring sword and pointed spear
 drove headlong to their ships and glean'd the routed rear
 they rais'd a feeble cry with trembling notes
 but the weak voice deceiv'd their gasping throats

 here priam's son deiphobus he found
 whose face and limbs were one continued wound
 dishonest with lopp'd arms the youth appears
 spoil'd of his nose and shorten'd of his ears
 he scarcely knew him striving to disown
 his blotted form and blushing to be known
 and therefore first began "o teucer's race
 who durst thy faultless figure thus deface
 what heart could wish what hand inflict this dire disgrace
 'twas fam'd that in our last and fatal night
 your single prowess long sustain'd the fight
 till tir'd not forc'd a glorious fate you chose
 and fell upon a heap of slaughter'd foes
 but in remembrance of so brave a deed
 a tomb and fun'ral honors i decreed
 thrice call'd your manes on the trojan plains
 the place your armor and your name retains
 your body too i sought and had i found
 design'd for burial in your native ground"

 the ghost replied "your piety has paid
 all needful rites to rest my wand'ring shade
 but cruel fate and my more cruel wife
 to grecian swords betray'd my sleeping life
 these are the monuments of helen's love
 the shame i bear below the marks i bore above
 you know in what deluding joys we pass'd
 the night that was by heav'n decreed our last
 for when the fatal horse descending down
 pregnant with arms o'erwhelm'd th' unhappy town
 she feign'd nocturnal orgies left my bed
 and mix'd with trojan dames the dances led
 then waving high her torch the signal made
 which rous'd the grecians from their ambuscade
 with watching overworn with cares oppress'd
 unhappy i had laid me down to rest
 and heavy sleep my weary limbs possess'd
 meantime my worthy wife our arms mislaid
 and from beneath my head my sword convey'd
 the door unlatch'd and with repeated calls
 invites her former lord within my walls
 thus in her crime her confidence she plac'd
 and with new treasons would redeem the past
 what need i more into the room they ran
 and meanly murther'd a defenseless man
 ulysses basely born first led the way
 avenging pow'rs with justice if i pray
 that fortune be their own another day
 but answer you and in your turn relate
 what brought you living to the stygian state
 driv'n by the winds and errors of the sea
 or did you heav'n's superior doom obey
 or tell what other chance conducts your way
 to view with mortal eyes our dark retreats
 tumults and torments of th' infernal seats"

 while thus in talk the flying hours they pass
 the sun had finish'd more than half his race
 and they perhaps in words and tears had spent
 the little time of stay which heav'n had lent
 but thus the sibyl chides their long delay
 "night rushes down and headlong drives the day
 't is here in different paths the way divides
 the right to pluto's golden palace guides
 the left to that unhappy region tends
 which to the depth of tartarus descends
 the seat of night profound and punish'd fiends"
 then thus deiphobus "o sacred maid
 forbear to chide and be your will obey'd
 lo to the secret shadows i retire
 to pay my penance till my years expire
 proceed auspicious prince with glory crown'd
 and born to better fates than i have found"
 he said and while he said his steps he turn'd
 to secret shadows and in silence mourn'd

 the hero looking on the left espied
 a lofty tow'r and strong on ev'ry side
 with treble walls which phlegethon surrounds
 whose fiery flood the burning empire bounds
 and press'd betwixt the rocks the bellowing noise resounds
 wide is the fronting gate and rais'd on high
 with adamantine columns threats the sky
 vain is the force of man and heav'n's as vain
 to crush the pillars which the pile sustain
 sublime on these a tow'r of steel is rear'd
 and dire tisiphone there keeps the ward
 girt in her sanguine gown by night and day
 observant of the souls that pass the downward way
 from hence are heard the groans of ghosts the pains
 of sounding lashes and of dragging chains
 the trojan stood astonish'd at their cries
 and ask'd his guide from whence those yells arise
 and what the crimes and what the tortures were
 and loud laments that rent the liquid air

 she thus replied "the chaste and holy race
 are all forbidden this polluted place
 but hecate when she gave to rule the woods
 then led me trembling thro' these dire abodes
 and taught the tortures of th' avenging gods
 these are the realms of unrelenting fate
 and awful rhadamanthus rules the state
 he hears and judges each committed crime
 enquires into the manner place and time
 the conscious wretch must all his acts reveal
 loth to confess unable to conceal
 from the first moment of his vital breath
 to his last hour of unrepenting death
 straight o'er the guilty ghost the fury shakes
 the sounding whip and brandishes her snakes
 and the pale sinner with her sisters takes
 then of itself unfolds th' eternal door
 with dreadful sounds the brazen hinges roar
 you see before the gate what stalking ghost
 commands the guard what sentries keep the post
 more formidable hydra stands within
 whose jaws with iron teeth severely grin
 the gaping gulf low to the center lies
 and twice as deep as earth is distant from the skies
 the rivals of the gods the titan race
 here sing'd with lightning roll within th' unfathom'd space
 here lie th' alaean twins i saw them both
 enormous bodies of gigantic growth
 who dar'd in fight the thund'rer to defy
 affect his heav'n and force him from the sky
 salmoneus suff'ring cruel pains i found
 for emulating jove the rattling sound
 of mimic thunder and the glitt'ring blaze
 of pointed lightnings and their forky rays
 thro' elis and the grecian towns he flew
 th' audacious wretch four fiery coursers drew
 he wav'd a torch aloft and madly vain
 sought godlike worship from a servile train
 ambitious fool with horny hoofs to pass
 o'er hollow arches of resounding brass
 to rival thunder in its rapid course
 and imitate inimitable force
 but he the king of heav'n obscure on high
 bar'd his red arm and launching from the sky
 his writhen bolt not shaking empty smoke
 down to the deep abyss the flaming felon strook
 there tityus was to see who took his birth
 from heav'n his nursing from the foodful earth
 here his gigantic limbs with large embrace
 infold nine acres of infernal space
 a rav'nous vulture in his open'd side
 her crooked beak and cruel talons tried
 still for the growing liver digg'd his breast
 the growing liver still supplied the feast
 still are his entrails fruitful to their pains
 th' immortal hunger lasts th' immortal food remains
 ixion and perithous i could name
 and more thessalian chiefs of mighty fame
 high o'er their heads a mold'ring rock is plac'd
 that promises a fall and shakes at ev'ry blast
 they lie below on golden beds display'd
 and genial feasts with regal pomp are made
 the queen of furies by their sides is set
 and snatches from their mouths th' untasted meat
 which if they touch her hissing snakes she rears
 tossing her torch and thund'ring in their ears
 then they who brothers' better claim disown
 expel their parents and usurp the throne
 defraud their clients and to lucre sold
 sit brooding on unprofitable gold
 who dare not give and ev'n refuse to lend
 to their poor kindred or a wanting friend
 vast is the throng of these nor less the train
 of lustful youths for foul adult'ry slain
 hosts of deserters who their honor sold
 and basely broke their faith for bribes of gold
 all these within the dungeon's depth remain
 despairing pardon and expecting pain
 ask not what pains nor farther seek to know
 their process or the forms of law below
 some roll a weighty stone some laid along
 and bound with burning wires on spokes of wheels are hung
 unhappy theseus doom'd for ever there
 is fix'd by fate on his eternal chair
 and wretched phlegyas warns the world with cries
 could warning make the world more just or wise
 'learn righteousness and dread th' avenging deities'
 to tyrants others have their country sold
 imposing foreign lords for foreign gold
 some have old laws repeal'd new statutes made
 not as the people pleas'd but as they paid
 with incest some their daughters' bed profan'd
 all dar'd the worst of ills and what they dar'd attain'd
 had i a hundred mouths a hundred tongues
 and throats of brass inspir'd with iron lungs
 i could not half those horrid crimes repeat
 nor half the punishments those crimes have met
 but let us haste our voyage to pursue
 the walls of pluto's palace are in view
 the gate and iron arch above it stands
 on anvils labor'd by the cyclops' hands
 before our farther way the fates allow
 here must we fix on high the golden bough"

 she said and thro' the gloomy shades they pass'd
 and chose the middle path arriv'd at last
 the prince with living water sprinkled o'er
 his limbs and body then approach'd the door
 possess'd the porch and on the front above
 he fix'd the fatal bough requir'd by pluto's love
 these holy rites perform'd they took their way
 where long extended plains of pleasure lay
 the verdant fields with those of heav'n may vie
 with ether vested and a purple sky
 the blissful seats of happy souls below
 stars of their own and their own suns they know
 their airy limbs in sports they exercise
 and on the green contend the wrestler's prize
 some in heroic verse divinely sing
 others in artful measures led the ring
 the thracian bard surrounded by the rest
 there stands conspicuous in his flowing vest
 his flying fingers and harmonious quill
 strikes sev'n distinguish'd notes and sev'n at once they fill
 here found they teucer's old heroic race
 born better times and happier years to grace
 assaracus and ilus here enjoy
 perpetual fame with him who founded troy
 the chief beheld their chariots from afar
 their shining arms and coursers train'd to war
 their lances fix'd in earth their steeds around
 free from their harness graze the flow'ry ground
 the love of horses which they had alive
 and care of chariots after death survive
 some cheerful souls were feasting on the plain
 some did the song and some the choir maintain
 beneath a laurel shade where mighty po
 mounts up to woods above and hides his head below
 here patriots live who for their country's good
 in fighting fields were prodigal of blood
 priests of unblemish'd lives here make abode
 and poets worthy their inspiring god
 and searching wits of more mechanic parts
 who grac'd their age with newinvented arts
 those who to worth their bounty did extend
 and those who knew that bounty to commend
 the heads of these with holy fillets bound
 and all their temples were with garlands crown'd

 to these the sibyl thus her speech address'd
 and first to him surrounded by the rest
 tow'ring his height and ample was his breast
 "say happy souls divine musaeus say
 where lives anchises and where lies our way
 to find the hero for whose only sake
 we sought the dark abodes and cross'd the bitter lake"
 to this the sacred poet thus replied
 "in no fix'd place the happy souls reside
 in groves we live and lie on mossy beds
 by crystal streams that murmur thro' the meads
 but pass yon easy hill and thence descend
 the path conducts you to your journey's end"
 this said he led them up the mountain's brow
 and shews them all the shining fields below
 they wind the hill and thro' the blissful meadows go

 but old anchises in a flow'ry vale
 review'd his muster'd race and took the tale
 those happy spirits which ordain'd by fate
 for future beings and new bodies wait
 with studious thought observ'd th' illustrious throng
 in nature's order as they pass'd along
 their names their fates their conduct and their care
 in peaceful senates and successful war
 he when aeneas on the plain appears
 meets him with open arms and falling tears
 "welcome" he said "the gods' undoubted race
 o long expected to my dear embrace
 once more 't is giv'n me to behold your face
 the love and pious duty which you pay
 have pass'd the perils of so hard a way
 't is true computing times i now believ'd
 the happy day approach'd nor are my hopes deceiv'd
 what length of lands what oceans have you pass'd
 what storms sustain'd and on what shores been cast
 how have i fear'd your fate but fear'd it most
 when love assail'd you on the libyan coast"
 to this the filial duty thus replies
 "your sacred ghost before my sleeping eyes
 appear'd and often urg'd this painful enterprise
 after long tossing on the tyrrhene sea
 my navy rides at anchor in the bay
 but reach your hand o parent shade nor shun
 the dear embraces of your longing son"
 he said and falling tears his face bedew
 then thrice around his neck his arms he threw
 and thrice the flitting shadow slipp'd away
 like winds or empty dreams that fly the day

 now in a secret vale the trojan sees
 a sep'rate grove thro' which a gentle breeze
 plays with a passing breath and whispers thro' the trees
 and just before the confines of the wood
 the gliding lethe leads her silent flood
 about the boughs an airy nation flew
 thick as the humming bees that hunt the golden dew
 in summer's heat on tops of lilies feed
 and creep within their bells to suck the balmy seed
 the winged army roams the fields around
 the rivers and the rocks remurmur to the sound
 aeneas wond'ring stood then ask'd the cause
 which to the stream the crowding people draws
 then thus the sire "the souls that throng the flood
 are those to whom by fate are other bodies ow'd
 in lethe's lake they long oblivion taste
 of future life secure forgetful of the past
 long has my soul desir'd this time and place
 to set before your sight your glorious race
 that this presaging joy may fire your mind
 to seek the shores by destiny design'd"
 "o father can it be that souls sublime
 return to visit our terrestrial clime
 and that the gen'rous mind releas'd by death
 can covet lazy limbs and mortal breath"

 anchises then in order thus begun
 to clear those wonders to his godlike son
 "know first that heav'n and earth's compacted frame
 and flowing waters and the starry flame
 and both the radiant lights one common soul
 inspires and feeds and animates the whole
 this active mind infus'd thro' all the space
 unites and mingles with the mighty mass
 hence men and beasts the breath of life obtain
 and birds of air and monsters of the main
 th' ethereal vigor is in all the same
 and every soul is fill'd with equal flame
 as much as earthy limbs and gross allay
 of mortal members subject to decay
 blunt not the beams of heav'n and edge of day
 from this coarse mixture of terrestrial parts
 desire and fear by turns possess their hearts
 and grief and joy nor can the groveling mind
 in the dark dungeon of the limbs confin'd
 assert the native skies or own its heav'nly kind
 nor death itself can wholly wash their stains
 but longcontracted filth ev'n in the soul remains
 the relics of inveterate vice they wear
 and spots of sin obscene in ev'ry face appear
 for this are various penances enjoin'd
 and some are hung to bleach upon the wind
 some plung'd in waters others purg'd in fires
 till all the dregs are drain'd and all the rust expires
 all have their manes and those manes bear
 the few so cleans'd to these abodes repair
 and breathe in ample fields the soft elysian air
 then are they happy when by length of time
 the scurf is worn away of each committed crime
 no speck is left of their habitual stains
 but the pure ether of the soul remains
 but when a thousand rolling years are past
 so long their punishments and penance last
 whole droves of minds are by the driving god
 compell'd to drink the deep lethaean flood
 in large forgetful draughts to steep the cares
 of their past labors and their irksome years
 that unrememb'ring of its former pain
 the soul may suffer mortal flesh again"

 thus having said the father spirit leads
 the priestess and his son thro' swarms of shades
 and takes a rising ground from thence to see
 the long procession of his progeny
 "survey" pursued the sire "this airy throng
 as offer'd to thy view they pass along
 these are th' italian names which fate will join
 with ours and graff upon the trojan line
 observe the youth who first appears in sight
 and holds the nearest station to the light
 already seems to snuff the vital air
 and leans just forward on a shining spear
 silvius is he thy lastbegotten race
 but first in order sent to fill thy place
 an alban name but mix'd with dardan blood
 born in the covert of a shady wood
 him fair lavinia thy surviving wife
 shall breed in groves to lead a solitary life
 in alba he shall fix his royal seat
 and born a king a race of kings beget
 then procas honor of the trojan name
 capys and numitor of endless fame
 a second silvius after these appears
 silvius aeneas for thy name he bears
 for arms and justice equally renown'd
 who late restor'd in alba shall be crown'd
 how great they look how vig'rously they wield
 their weighty lances and sustain the shield
 but they who crown'd with oaken wreaths appear
 shall gabian walls and strong fidena rear
 nomentum bola with pometia found
 and raise collatian tow'rs on rocky ground
 all these shall then be towns of mighty fame
 tho' now they lie obscure and lands without a name
 see romulus the great born to restore
 the crown that once his injur'd grandsire wore
 this prince a priestess of your blood shall bear
 and like his sire in arms he shall appear
 two rising crests his royal head adorn
 born from a god himself to godhead born
 his sire already signs him for the skies
 and marks the seat amidst the deities
 auspicious chief thy race in times to come
 shall spread the conquests of imperial rome
 rome whose ascending tow'rs shall heav'n invade
 involving earth and ocean in her shade
 high as the mother of the gods in place
 and proud like her of an immortal race
 then when in pomp she makes the phrygian round
 with golden turrets on her temples crown'd
 a hundred gods her sweeping train supply
 her offspring all and all command the sky

 "now fix your sight and stand intent to see
 your roman race and julian progeny
 the mighty caesar waits his vital hour
 impatient for the world and grasps his promis'd pow'r
 but next behold the youth of form divine
 ceasar himself exalted in his line
 augustus promis'd oft and long foretold
 sent to the realm that saturn rul'd of old
 born to restore a better age of gold
 afric and india shall his pow'r obey
 he shall extend his propagated sway
 beyond the solar year without the starry way
 where atlas turns the rolling heav'ns around
 and his broad shoulders with their lights are crown'd
 at his foreseen approach already quake
 the caspian kingdoms and maeotian lake
 their seers behold the tempest from afar
 and threat'ning oracles denounce the war
 nile hears him knocking at his sev'nfold gates
 and seeks his hidden spring and fears his nephew's fates
 nor hercules more lands or labors knew
 not tho' the brazenfooted hind he slew
 freed erymanthus from the foaming boar
 and dipp'd his arrows in lernaean gore
 nor bacchus turning from his indian war
 by tigers drawn triumphant in his car
 from nisus' top descending on the plains
 with curling vines around his purple reins
 and doubt we yet thro' dangers to pursue
 the paths of honor and a crown in view
 but what's the man who from afar appears
 his head with olive crown'd his hand a censer bears
 his hoary beard and holy vestments bring
 his lost idea back i know the roman king
 he shall to peaceful rome new laws ordain
 call'd from his mean abode a scepter to sustain
 him tullus next in dignity succeeds
 an active prince and prone to martial deeds
 he shall his troops for fighting fields prepare
 disus'd to toils and triumphs of the war
 by dint of sword his crown he shall increase
 and scour his armor from the rust of peace
 whom ancus follows with a fawning air
 but vain within and proudly popular
 next view the tarquin kings th' avenging sword
 of brutus justly drawn and rome restor'd
 he first renews the rods and ax severe
 and gives the consuls royal robes to wear
 his sons who seek the tyrant to sustain
 and long for arbitrary lords again
 with ignominy scourg'd in open sight
 he dooms to death deserv'd asserting public right
 unhappy man to break the pious laws
 of nature pleading in his children's cause

 and next the two devoted decii view
 the drusian line camillus loaded home
 with standards well redeem'd and foreign foes o'ercome
 the pair you see in equal armor shine
 now friends below in close embraces join
 but when they leave the shady realms of night
 and cloth'd in bodies breathe your upper light
 with mortal hate each other shall pursue
 what wars what wounds what slaughter shall ensue
 from alpine heights the father first descends
 his daughter's husband in the plain attends
 his daughter's husband arms his eastern friends
 embrace again my sons be foes no more
 nor stain your country with her children's gore
 and thou the first lay down thy lawless claim
 thou of my blood who bearist the julian name
 another comes who shall in triumph ride
 and to the capitol his chariot guide
 from conquer'd corinth rich with grecian spoils
 and yet another fam'd for warlike toils
 on argos shall impose the roman laws
 and on the greeks revenge the trojan cause
 shall drag in chains their achillean race
 shall vindicate his ancestors' disgrace
 and pallas for her violated place
 great cato there for gravity renown'd
 and conqu'ring cossus goes with laurels crown'd
 who can omit the gracchi who declare
 the scipios' worth those thunderbolts of war
 the double bane of carthage who can see
 without esteem for virtuous poverty
 severe fabricius or can cease t' admire
 the plowman consul in his coarse attire
 tir'd as i am my praise the fabii claim
 and thou great hero greatest of thy name
 ordain'd in war to save the sinking state
 and by delays to put a stop to fate
 let others better mold the running mass
 of metals and inform the breathing brass
 and soften into flesh a marble face
 plead better at the bar describe the skies
 and when the stars descend and when they rise
 but rome 't is thine alone with awful sway
 to rule mankind and make the world obey
 disposing peace and war by thy own majestic way
 to tame the proud the fetter'd slave to free
 these are imperial arts and worthy thee"

 he paus'd and while with wond'ring eyes they view'd
 the passing spirits thus his speech renew'd
 "see great marcellus how untir'd in toils
 he moves with manly grace how rich with regal spoils
 he when his country threaten'd with alarms
 requires his courage and his conqu'ring arms
 shall more than once the punic bands affright
 shall kill the gaulish king in single fight
 then to the capitol in triumph move
 and the third spoils shall grace feretrian jove"
 aeneas here beheld of form divine
 a godlike youth in glitt'ring armor shine
 with great marcellus keeping equal pace
 but gloomy were his eyes dejected was his face
 he saw and wond'ring ask'd his airy guide
 what and of whence was he who press'd the hero's side
 "his son or one of his illustrious name
 how like the former and almost the same
 observe the crowds that compass him around
 all gaze and all admire and raise a shouting sound
 but hov'ring mists around his brows are spread
 and night with sable shades involves his head"
 "seek not to know" the ghost replied with tears
 "the sorrows of thy sons in future years
 this youth the blissful vision of a day
 shall just be shown on earth and snatch'd away
 the gods too high had rais'd the roman state
 were but their gifts as permanent as great
 what groans of men shall fill the martian field
 how fierce a blaze his flaming pile shall yield
 what fun'ral pomp shall floating tiber see
 when rising from his bed he views the sad solemnity
 no youth shall equal hopes of glory give
 no youth afford so great a cause to grieve
 the trojan honor and the roman boast
 admir'd when living and ador'd when lost
 mirror of ancient faith in early youth
 undaunted worth inviolable truth
 no foe unpunish'd in the fighting field
 shall dare thee foot to foot with sword and shield
 much less in arms oppose thy matchless force
 when thy sharp spurs shall urge thy foaming horse
 ah couldst thou break thro' fate's severe decree
 a new marcellus shall arise in thee
 full canisters of fragrant lilies bring
 mix'd with the purple roses of the spring
 let me with fun'ral flow'rs his body strow
 this gift which parents to their children owe
 this unavailing gift at least i may bestow"
 thus having said he led the hero round
 the confines of the blest elysian ground
 which when anchises to his son had shown
 and fir'd his mind to mount the promis'd throne
 he tells the future wars ordain'd by fate
 the strength and customs of the latian state
 the prince and people and forearms his care
 with rules to push his fortune or to bear

 two gates the silent house of sleep adorn
 of polish'd ivory this that of transparent horn
 true visions thro' transparent horn arise
 thro' polish'd ivory pass deluding lies
 of various things discoursing as he pass'd
 anchises hither bends his steps at last
 then thro' the gate of iv'ry he dismiss'd
 his valiant offspring and divining guest
 straight to the ships aeneas his way
 embark'd his men and skimm'd along the sea
 still coasting till he gain'd cajeta's bay
 at length on oozy ground his galleys moor
 their heads are turn'd to sea their sterns to shore




 book vii

 and thou o matron of immortal fame
 here dying to the shore hast left thy name
 cajeta still the place is call'd from thee
 the nurse of great aeneas' infancy
 here rest thy bones in rich hesperia's plains
 thy name 't is all a ghost can have remains

 now when the prince her fun'ral rites had paid
 he plow'd the tyrrhene seas with sails display'd
 from land a gentle breeze arose by night
 serenely shone the stars the moon was bright
 and the sea trembled with her silver light
 now near the shelves of circe's shores they run
 circe the rich the daughter of the sun
 a dang'rous coast the goddess wastes her days
 in joyous songs the rocks resound her lays
 in spinning or the loom she spends the night
 and cedar brands supply her father's light
 from hence were heard rebellowing to the main
 the roars of lions that refuse the chain
 the grunts of bristled boars and groans of bears
 and herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors' ears
 these from their caverns at the close of night
 fill the sad isle with horror and affright
 darkling they mourn their fate whom circe's pow'r
 that watch'd the moon and planetary hour
 with words and wicked herbs from humankind
 had alter'd and in brutal shapes confin'd
 which monsters lest the trojans' pious host
 should bear or touch upon th' inchanted coast
 propitious neptune steer'd their course by night
 with rising gales that sped their happy flight
 supplied with these they skim the sounding shore
 and hear the swelling surges vainly roar
 now when the rosy morn began to rise
 and wav'd her saffron streamer thro' the skies
 when thetis blush'd in purple not her own
 and from her face the breathing winds were blown
 a sudden silence sate upon the sea
 and sweeping oars with struggling urge their way
 the trojan from the main beheld a wood
 which thick with shades and a brown horror stood
 betwixt the trees the tiber took his course
 with whirlpools dimpled and with downward force
 that drove the sand along he took his way
 and roll'd his yellow billows to the sea
 about him and above and round the wood
 the birds that haunt the borders of his flood
 that bath'd within or basked upon his side
 to tuneful songs their narrow throats applied
 the captain gives command the joyful train
 glide thro' the gloomy shade and leave the main

 now erato thy poet's mind inspire
 and fill his soul with thy celestial fire
 relate what latium was her ancient kings
 declare the past and state of things
 when first the trojan fleet ausonia sought
 and how the rivals lov'd and how they fought
 these are my theme and how the war began
 and how concluded by the godlike man
 for i shall sing of battles blood and rage
 which princes and their people did engage
 and haughty souls that mov'd with mutual hate
 in fighting fields pursued and found their fate
 that rous'd the tyrrhene realm with loud alarms
 and peaceful italy involv'd in arms
 a larger scene of action is display'd
 and rising hence a greater work is weigh'd

 latinus old and mild had long possess'd
 the latin scepter and his people blest
 his father faunus a laurentian dame
 his mother fair marica was her name
 but faunus came from picus picus drew
 his birth from saturn if records be true
 thus king latinus in the third degree
 had saturn author of his family
 but this old peaceful prince as heav'n decreed
 was blest with no male issue to succeed
 his sons in blooming youth were snatch'd by fate
 one only daughter heir'd the royal state
 fir'd with her love and with ambition led
 the neighb'ring princes court her nuptial bed
 among the crowd but far above the rest
 young turnus to the beauteous maid address'd
 turnus for high descent and graceful mien
 was first and favor'd by the latian queen
 with him she strove to join lavinia's hand
 but dire portents the purpos'd match withstand

 deep in the palace of long growth there stood
 a laurel's trunk a venerable wood
 where rites divine were paid whose holy hair
 was kept and cut with superstitious care
 this plant latinus when his town he wall'd
 then found and from the tree laurentum call'd
 and last in honor of his new abode
 he vow'd the laurel to the laurel's god
 it happen'd once a boding prodigy
 a swarm of bees that cut the liquid sky
 unknown from whence they took their airy flight
 upon the topmost branch in clouds alight
 there with their clasping feet together clung
 and a long cluster from the laurel hung
 an ancient augur prophesied from hence
 "behold on latian shores a foreign prince
 from the same parts of heav'n his navy stands
 to the same parts on earth his army lands
 the town he conquers and the tow'r commands"

 yet more when fair lavinia fed the fire
 before the gods and stood beside her sire
 strange to relate the flames involv'd in smoke
 of incense from the sacred altar broke
 caught her dishevel'd hair and rich attire
 her crown and jewels crackled in the fire
 from thence the fuming trail began to spread
 and lambent glories danc'd about her head
 this new portent the seer with wonder views
 then pausing thus his prophecy renews
 "the nymph who scatters flaming fires around
 shall shine with honor shall herself be crown'd
 but caus'd by her irrevocable fate
 war shall the country waste and change the state"

 latinus frighted with this dire ostent
 for counsel to his father faunus went
 and sought the shades renown'd for prophecy
 which near albunea's sulph'rous fountain lie
 to these the latian and the sabine land
 fly when distress'd and thence relief demand
 the priest on skins of off'rings takes his ease
 and nightly visions in his slumber sees
 a swarm of thin aerial shapes appears
 and flutt'ring round his temples deafs his ears
 these he consults the future fates to know
 from pow'rs above and from the fiends below
 here for the gods' advice latinus flies
 off'ring a hundred sheep for sacrifice
 their woolly fleeces as the rites requir'd
 he laid beneath him and to rest retir'd
 no sooner were his eyes in slumber bound
 when from above a more than mortal sound
 invades his ears and thus the vision spoke
 "seek not my seed in latian bands to yoke
 our fair lavinia nor the gods provoke
 a foreign son upon thy shore descends
 whose martial fame from pole to pole extends
 his race in arms and arts of peace renown'd
 not latium shall contain nor europe bound
 't is theirs whate'er the sun surveys around"
 these answers in the silent night receiv'd
 the king himself divulg'd the land believ'd
 the fame thro' all the neighb'ring nations flew
 when now the trojan navy was in view

 beneath a shady tree the hero spread
 his table on the turf with cakes of bread
 and with his chiefs on forest fruits he fed
 they sate and not without the god's command
 their homely fare dispatch'd the hungry band
 invade their trenchers next and soon devour
 to mend the scanty meal their cakes of flour
 ascanius this observ'd and smiling said
 "see we devour the plates on which we fed"
 the speech had omen that the trojan race
 should find repose and this the time and place
 aeneas took the word and thus replies
 confessing fate with wonder in his eyes
 "all hail o earth all hail my household gods
 behold the destin'd place of your abodes
 for thus anchises prophesied of old
 and this our fatal place of rest foretold
 'when on a foreign shore instead of meat
 by famine forc'd your trenchers you shall eat
 then ease your weary trojans will attend
 and the long labors of your voyage end
 remember on that happy coast to build
 and with a trench inclose the fruitful field'
 this was that famine this the fatal place
 which ends the wand'ring of our exil'd race
 then on tomorrow's dawn your care employ
 to search the land and where the cities lie
 and what the men but give this day to joy
 now pour to jove and after jove is blest
 call great anchises to the genial feast
 crown high the goblets with a cheerful draught
 enjoy the present hour adjourn the future thought"

 thus having said the hero bound his brows
 with leafy branches then perform'd his vows
 adoring first the genius of the place
 then earth the mother of the heav'nly race
 the nymphs and native godheads yet unknown
 and night and all the stars that gild her sable throne
 and ancient cybel and idaean jove
 and last his sire below and mother queen above
 then heav'n's high monarch thunder'd thrice aloud
 and thrice he shook aloft a golden cloud
 soon thro' the joyful camp a rumor flew
 the time was come their city to renew
 then ev'ry brow with cheerful green is crown'd
 the feasts are doubled and the bowls go round

 when next the rosy morn disclos'd the day
 the scouts to sev'ral parts divide their way
 to learn the natives' names their towns explore
 the coasts and trendings of the crooked shore
 here tiber flows and here numicus stands
 here warlike latins hold the happy lands
 the pious chief who sought by peaceful ways
 to found his empire and his town to raise
 a hundred youths from all his train selects
 and to the latian court their course directs
 the spacious palace where their prince resides
 and all their heads with wreaths of olive hides
 they go commission'd to require a peace
 and carry presents to procure access
 thus while they speed their pace the prince designs
 his newelected seat and draws the lines
 the trojans round the place a rampire cast
 and palisades about the trenches plac'd

 meantime the train proceeding on their way
 from far the town and lofty tow'rs survey
 at length approach the walls without the gate
 they see the boys and latian youth debate
 the martial prizes on the dusty plain
 some drive the cars and some the coursers rein
 some bend the stubborn bow for victory
 and some with darts their active sinews try
 a posting messenger dispatch'd from hence
 of this fair troop advis'd their aged prince
 that foreign men of mighty stature came
 uncouth their habit and unknown their name
 the king ordains their entrance and ascends
 his regal seat surrounded by his friends

 the palace built by picus vast and proud
 supported by a hundred pillars stood
 and round incompass'd with a rising wood
 the pile o'erlook'd the town and drew the sight
 surpris'd at once with reverence and delight
 there kings receiv'd the marks of sov'reign pow'r
 in state the monarchs march'd the lictors bore
 their awful axes and the rods before
 here the tribunal stood the house of pray'r
 and here the sacred senators repair
 all at large tables in long order set
 a ram their off'ring and a ram their meat
 above the portal carv'd in cedar wood
 plac'd in their ranks their godlike grandsires stood
 old saturn with his crooked scythe on high
 and italus that led the colony
 and ancient janus with his double face
 and bunch of keys the porter of the place
 there good sabinus planter of the vines
 on a short pruning hook his head reclines
 and studiously surveys his gen'rous wines
 then warlike kings who for their country fought
 and honorable wounds from battle brought
 around the posts hung helmets darts and spears
 and captive chariots axes shields and bars
 and broken beaks of ships the trophies of their wars
 above the rest as chief of all the band
 was picus plac'd a buckler in his hand
 his other wav'd a long divining wand
 girt in his gabin gown the hero sate
 yet could not with his art avoid his fate
 for circe long had lov'd the youth in vain
 till love refus'd converted to disdain
 then mixing pow'rful herbs with magic art
 she chang'd his form who could not change his heart
 constrain'd him in a bird and made him fly
 with partycolor'd plumes a chatt'ring pie

 in this high temple on a chair of state
 the seat of audience old latinus sate
 then gave admission to the trojan train
 and thus with pleasing accents he began
 "tell me ye trojans for that name you own
 nor is your course upon our coasts unknown
 say what you seek and whither were you bound
 were you by stress of weather cast aground
 such dangers as on seas are often seen
 and oft befall to miserable men
 or come your shipping in our ports to lay
 spent and disabled in so long a way
 say what you want the latians you shall find
 not forc'd to goodness but by will inclin'd
 for since the time of saturn's holy reign
 his hospitable customs we retain
 i call to mind but time the tale has worn
 th' arunci told that dardanus tho' born
 on latian plains yet sought the phrygian shore
 and samothracia samos call'd before
 from tuscan coritum he claim'd his birth
 but after when exempt from mortal earth
 from thence ascended to his kindred skies
 a god and as a god augments their sacrifice"

 he said ilioneus made this reply
 "o king of faunus' royal family
 nor wintry winds to latium forc'd our way
 nor did the stars our wand'ring course betray
 willing we sought your shores and hither bound
 the port so long desir'd at length we found
 from our sweet homes and ancient realms expell'd
 great as the greatest that the sun beheld
 the god began our line who rules above
 and as our race our king descends from jove
 and hither are we come by his command
 to crave admission in your happy land
 how dire a tempest from mycenae pour'd
 our plains our temples and our town devour'd
 what was the waste of war what fierce alarms
 shook asia's crown with european arms
 ev'n such have heard if any such there be
 whose earth is bounded by the frozen sea
 and such as born beneath the burning sky
 and sultry sun betwixt the tropics lie
 from that dire deluge thro' the wat'ry waste
 such length of years such various perils past
 at last escap'd to latium we repair
 to beg what you without your want may spare
 the common water and the common air
 sheds which ourselves will build and mean abodes
 fit to receive and serve our banish'd gods
 nor our admission shall your realm disgrace
 nor length of time our gratitude efface
 besides what endless honor you shall gain
 to save and shelter troy's unhappy train
 now by my sov'reign and his fate i swear
 renown'd for faith in peace for force in war
 oft our alliance other lands desir'd
 and what we seek of you of us requir'd
 despite not then that in our hands we bear
 these holy boughs sue with words of pray'r
 fate and the gods by their supreme command
 have doom'd our ships to seek the latian land
 to these abodes our fleet apollo sends
 here dardanus was born and hither tends
 where tuscan tiber rolls with rapid force
 and where numicus opes his holy source
 besides our prince presents with his request
 some small remains of what his sire possess'd
 this golden charger snatch'd from burning troy
 anchises did in sacrifice employ
 this royal robe and this tiara wore
 old priam and this golden scepter bore
 in full assemblies and in solemn games
 these purple vests were weav'd by dardan dames"

 thus while he spoke latinus roll'd around
 his eyes and fix'd a while upon the ground
 intent he seem'd and anxious in his breast
 not by the scepter mov'd or kingly vest
 but pond'ring future things of wondrous weight
 succession empire and his daughter's fate
 on these he mus'd within his thoughtful mind
 and then revolv'd what faunus had divin'd
 this was the foreign prince by fate decreed
 to share his scepter and lavinia's bed
 this was the race that sure portents foreshew
 to sway the world and land and sea subdue
 at length he rais'd his cheerful head and spoke
 "the pow'rs" said he "the pow'rs we both invoke
 to you and yours and mine propitious be
 and firm our purpose with their augury
 have what you ask your presents i receive
 land where and when you please with ample leave
 partake and use my kingdom as your own
 all shall be yours while i command the crown
 and if my wish'd alliance please your king
 tell him he should not send the peace but bring
 then let him not a friend's embraces fear
 the peace is made when i behold him here
 besides this answer tell my royal guest
 i add to his commands my own request
 one only daughter heirs my crown and state
 whom not our oracles nor heav'n nor fate
 nor frequent prodigies permit to join
 with any native of th' ausonian line
 a foreign soninlaw shall come from far
 such is our doom a chief renown'd in war
 whose race shall bear aloft the latian name
 and thro' the conquer'd world diffuse our fame
 himself to be the man the fates require
 i firmly judge and what i judge desire"

 he said and then on each bestow'd a steed
 three hundred horses in high stables fed
 stood ready shining all and smoothly dress'd
 of these he chose the fairest and the best
 to mount the trojan troop at his command
 the steeds caparison'd with purple stand
 with golden trappings glorious to behold
 and champ betwixt their teeth the foaming gold
 then to his absent guest the king decreed
 a pair of coursers born of heav'nly breed
 who from their nostrils breath'd ethereal fire
 whom circe stole from her celestial sire
 by substituting mares produc'd on earth
 whose wombs conceiv'd a more than mortal birth
 these draw the chariot which latinus sends
 and the rich present to the prince commends
 sublime on stately steeds the trojans borne
 to their expecting lord with peace return

 but jealous juno from pachynus' height
 as she from argos took her airy flight
 beheld with envious eyes this hateful sight
 she saw the trojan and his joyful train
 descend upon the shore desert the main
 design a town and with unhop'd success
 th' embassadors return with promis'd peace
 then pierc'd with pain she shook her haughty head
 sigh'd from her inward soul and thus she said
 "o hated offspring of my phrygian foes
 o fates of troy which juno's fates oppose
 could they not fall unpitied on the plain
 but slain revive and taken scape again
 when execrable troy in ashes lay
 thro' fires and swords and seas they forc'd their way
 then vanquish'd juno must in vain contend
 her rage disarm'd her empire at an end
 breathless and tir'd is all my fury spent
 or does my glutted spleen at length relent
 as if 't were little from their town to chase
 i thro' the seas pursued their exil'd race
 ingag'd the heav'ns oppos'd the stormy main
 but billows roar'd and tempests rag'd in vain
 what have my scyllas and my syrtes done
 when these they overpass and those they shun
 on tiber's shores they land secure of fate
 triumphant o'er the storms and juno's hate
 mars could in mutual blood the centaurs bathe
 and jove himself gave way to cynthia's wrath
 who sent the tusky boar to calydon
 what great offense had either people done
 but i the consort of the thunderer
 have wag'd a long and unsuccessful war
 with various arts and arms in vain have toil'd
 and by a mortal man at length am foil'd
 if native pow'r prevail not shall i doubt
 to seek for needful succor from without
 if jove and heav'n my just desires deny
 hell shall the pow'r of heav'n and jove supply
 grant that the fates have firm'd by their decree
 the trojan race to reign in italy
 at least i can defer the nuptial day
 and with protracted wars the peace delay
 with blood the dear alliance shall be bought
 and both the people near destruction brought
 so shall the soninlaw and father join
 with ruin war and waste of either line
 o fatal maid thy marriage is endow'd
 with phrygian latian and rutulian blood
 bellona leads thee to thy lover's hand
 another queen brings forth another brand
 to burn with foreign fires another land
 a second paris diff'ring but in name
 shall fire his country with a second flame"

 thus having said she sinks beneath the ground
 with furious haste and shoots the stygian sound
 to rouse alecto from th' infernal seat
 of her dire sisters and their dark retreat
 this fury fit for her intent she chose
 one who delights in wars and human woes
 ev'n pluto hates his own misshapen race
 her sister furies fly her hideous face
 so frightful are the forms the monster takes
 so fierce the hissings of her speckled snakes
 her juno finds and thus inflames her spite
 "o virgin daughter of eternal night
 give me this once thy labor to sustain
 my right and execute my just disdain
 let not the trojans with a feign'd pretense
 of proffer'd peace delude the latian prince
 expel from italy that odious name
 and let not juno suffer in her fame
 't is thine to ruin realms o'erturn a state
 betwixt the dearest friends to raise debate
 and kindle kindred blood to mutual hate
 thy hand o'er towns the fun'ral torch displays
 and forms a thousand ills ten thousand ways
 now shake out thy fruitful breast the seeds
 of envy discord and of cruel deeds
 confound the peace establish'd and prepare
 their souls to hatred and their hands to war"

 smear'd as she was with black gorgonian blood
 the fury sprang above the stygian flood
 and on her wicker wings sublime thro' night
 she to the latian palace took her flight
 there sought the queen's apartment stood before
 the peaceful threshold and besieg'd the door
 restless amata lay her swelling breast
 fir'd with disdain for turnus dispossess'd
 and the new nuptials of the trojan guest
 from her black bloody locks the fury shakes
 her darling plague the fav'rite of her snakes
 with her full force she threw the poisonous dart
 and fix'd it deep within amata's heart
 that thus envenom'd she might kindle rage
 and sacrifice to strife her house husband's age
 unseen unfelt the fiery serpent skims
 betwixt her linen and her naked limbs
 his baleful breath inspiring as he glides
 now like a chain around her neck he rides
 now like a fillet to her head repairs
 and with his circling volumes folds her hairs
 at first the silent venom slid with ease
 and seiz'd her cooler senses by degrees
 then ere th' infected mass was fir'd too far
 in plaintive accents she began the war
 and thus bespoke her husband "shall" she said
 "a wand'ring prince enjoy lavinia's bed
 if nature plead not in a parent's heart
 pity my tears and pity her desert
 i know my dearest lord the time will come
 you in vain reverse your cruel doom
 the faithless pirate soon will set to sea
 and bear the royal virgin far away
 a guest like him a trojan guest before
 in shew of friendship sought the spartan shore
 and ravish'd helen from her husband bore
 think on a king's inviolable word
 and think on turnus her once plighted lord
 to this false foreigner you give your throne
 and wrong a friend a kinsman and a son
 resume your ancient care and if the god
 your sire and you resolve on foreign blood
 know all are foreign in a larger sense
 not born your subjects or deriv'd from hence
 then if the line of turnus you retrace
 he springs from inachus of argive race"

 but when she saw her reasons idly spent
 and could not move him from his fix'd intent
 she flew to rage for now the snake possess'd
 her vital parts and poison'd all her breast
 she raves she runs with a distracted pace
 and fills with horrid howls the public place
 and as young striplings whip the top for sport
 on the smooth pavement of an empty court
 the wooden engine flies and whirls about
 admir'd with clamors of the beardless rout
 they lash aloud each other they provoke
 and lend their little souls at ev'ry stroke
 thus fares the queen and thus her fury blows
 amidst the crowd and kindles as she goes
 nor yet content she strains her malice more
 and adds new ills to those contriv'd before
 she flies the town and mixing with a throng
 of madding matrons bears the bride along
 wand'ring thro' woods and wilds and devious ways
 and with these arts the trojan match delays
 she feign'd the rites of bacchus cried aloud
 and to the buxom god the virgin vow'd
 "evoe o bacchus" thus began the song
 and "evoe" answer'd all the female throng
 "o virgin worthy thee alone" she cried
 "o worthy thee alone" the crew replied
 "for thee she feeds her hair she leads thy dance
 and with thy winding ivy wreathes her lance"
 like fury seiz'd the rest the progress known
 all seek the mountains and forsake the town
 all clad in skins of beasts the jav'lin bear
 give to the wanton winds their flowing hair
 and shrieks and shoutings rend the suff'ring air
 the queen herself inspir'd with rage divine
 shook high above her head a flaming pine
 then roll'd her haggard eyes around the throng
 and sung in turnus' name the nuptial song
 "io ye latian dames if any here
 hold your unhappy queen amata dear
 if there be here" she said "who dare maintain
 my right nor think the name of mother vain
 unbind your fillets loose your flowing hair
 and orgies and nocturnal rites prepare"

 amata's breast the fury thus invades
 and fires with rage amid the sylvan shades
 then when she found her venom spread so far
 the royal house embroil'd in civil war
 rais'd on her dusky wings she cleaves the skies
 and seeks the palace where young turnus lies
 his town as fame reports was built of old
 by danae pregnant with almighty gold
 who fled her father's rage and with a train
 of following argives thro' the stormy main
 driv'n by the southern blasts was fated here to reign
 't was ardua once now ardea's name it bears
 once a fair city now consum'd with years
 here in his lofty palace turnus lay
 betwixt the confines of the night and day
 secure in sleep the fury laid aside
 her looks and limbs and with new methods tried
 the foulness of th' infernal form to hide
 propp'd on a staff she takes a trembling mien
 her face is furrow'd and her front obscene
 deepdinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws
 sunk are her eyes and toothless are her jaws
 her hoary hair with holy fillets bound
 her temples with an olive wreath are crown'd
 old chalybe who kept the sacred fane
 of juno now she seem'd and thus began
 appearing in a dream to rouse the careless man
 "shall turnus then such endless toil sustain
 in fighting fields and conquer towns in vain
 win for a trojan head to wear the prize
 usurp thy crown enjoy thy victories
 the bride and scepter which thy blood has bought
 the king transfers and foreign heirs are sought
 go now deluded man and seek again
 new toils new dangers on the dusty plain
 repel the tuscan foes their city seize
 protect the latians in luxurious ease
 this dream allpow'rful juno sends i bear
 her mighty mandates and her words you hear
 haste arm your ardeans issue to the plain
 with fate to friend assault the trojan train
 their thoughtless chiefs their painted ships that lie
 in tiber's mouth with fire and sword destroy
 the latian king unless he shall submit
 own his old promise and his new forget
 let him in arms the pow'r of turnus prove
 and learn to fear whom he disdains to love
 for such is heav'n's command" the youthful prince
 with scorn replied and made this bold defense
 "you tell me mother what i knew before
 the phrygian fleet is landed on the shore
 i neither fear nor will provoke the war
 my fate is juno's most peculiar care
 but time has made you dote and vainly tell
 of arms imagin'd in your lonely cell
 go be the temple and the gods your care
 permit to men the thought of peace and war"

 these haughty words alecto's rage provoke
 and frighted turnus trembled as she spoke
 her eyes grow stiffen'd and with sulphur burn
 her hideous looks and hellish form return
 her curling snakes with hissings fill the place
 and open all the furies of her face
 then darting fire from her malignant eyes
 she cast him backward as he strove to rise
 and ling'ring sought to frame some new replies
 high on her head she rears two twisted snakes
 her chains she rattles and her whip she shakes
 and churning bloody foam thus loudly speaks
 "behold whom time has made to dote and tell
 of arms imagin'd in her lonely cell
 behold the fates' infernal minister
 war death destruction in my hand i bear"

 thus having said her smold'ring torch impress'd
 with her full force she plung'd into his breast
 aghast he wak'd and starting from his bed
 cold sweat in clammy drops his limbs o'erspread
 "arms arms" he cries "my sword and shield prepare"
 he breathes defiance blood and mortal war
 so when with crackling flames a caldron fries
 the bubbling waters from the bottom rise
 above the brims they force their fiery way
 black vapors climb aloft and cloud the day

 the peace polluted thus a chosen band
 he first commissions to the latian land
 in threat'ning embassy then rais'd the rest
 to meet in arms th' intruding trojan guest
 to force the foes from the lavinian shore
 and italy's indanger'd peace restore
 himself alone an equal match he boasts
 to fight the phrygian and ausonian hosts
 the gods invok'd the rutuli prepare
 their arms and warn each other to the war
 his beauty these and those his blooming age
 the rest his house and his own fame ingage

 while turnus urges thus his enterprise
 the stygian fury to the trojans flies
 new frauds invents and takes a steepy stand
 which overlooks the vale with wide command
 where fair ascanius and his youthful train
 with horns and hounds a hunting match ordain
 and pitch their toils around the shady plain
 the fury fires the pack they snuff they vent
 and feed their hungry nostrils with the scent
 'twas of a wellgrown stag whose antlers rise
 high o'er his front his beams invade the skies
 from this light cause th' infernal maid prepares
 the country churls to mischief hate and wars

 the stately beast the two tyrrhidae bred
 snatch'd from his dams and the tame youngling fed
 their father tyrrheus did his fodder bring
 tyrrheus chief ranger to the latian king
 their sister silvia cherish'd with her care
 the little wanton and did wreaths prepare
 to hang his budding horns with ribbons tied
 his tender neck and comb'd his silken hide
 and bathed his body patient of command
 in time he grew and growing us'd to hand
 he waited at his master's board for food
 then sought his salvage kindred in the wood
 where grazing all the day at night he came
 to his known lodgings and his country dame

 this household beast that us'd the woodland grounds
 was view'd at first by the young hero's hounds
 as down the stream he swam to seek retreat
 in the cool waters and to quench his heat
 ascanius young and eager of his game
 soon bent his bow uncertain in his aim
 but the dire fiend the fatal arrow guides
 which pierc'd his bowels thro' his panting sides
 the bleeding creature issues from the floods
 possess'd with fear and seeks his known abodes
 his old familiar hearth and household gods
 he falls he fills the house with heavy groans
 implores their pity and his pain bemoans
 young silvia beats her breast and cries aloud
 for succor from the clownish neighborhood
 the churls assemble for the fiend who lay
 in the close woody covert urg'd their way
 one with a brand yet burning from the flame
 arm'd with a knotty club another came
 whate'er they catch or find without their care
 their fury makes an instrument of war
 tyrrheus the foster father of the beast
 then clench'd a hatchet in his horny fist
 but held his hand from the descending stroke
 and left his wedge within the cloven oak
 to whet their courage and their rage provoke
 and now the goddess exercis'd in ill
 who watch'd an hour to work her impious will
 ascends the roof and to her crooked horn
 such as was then by latian shepherds borne
 adds all her breath the rocks and woods around
 and mountains tremble at th' infernal sound
 the sacred lake of trivia from afar
 the veline fountains and sulphureous nar
 shake at the baleful blast the signal of the war
 young mothers wildly stare with fear possess'd
 and strain their helpless infants to their breast

 the clowns a boist'rous rude ungovern'd crew
 with furious haste to the loud summons flew
 the pow'rs of troy then issuing on the plain
 with fresh recruits their youthful chief sustain
 not theirs a raw and unexperienc'd train
 but a firm body of embattled men
 at first while fortune favor'd neither side
 the fight with clubs and burning brands was tried
 but now both parties reinforc'd the fields
 are bright with flaming swords and brazen shields
 a shining harvest either host displays
 and shoots against the sun with equal rays
 thus when a blackbrow'd gust begins to rise
 white foam at first on the curl'd ocean fries
 then roars the main the billows mount the skies
 till by the fury of the storm full blown
 the muddy bottom o'er the clouds is thrown
 first almon falls old tyrrheus' eldest care
 pierc'd with an arrow from the distant war
 fix'd in his throat the flying weapon stood
 and stopp'd his breath and drank his vital blood
 huge heaps of slain around the body rise
 among the rest the rich galesus lies
 a good old man while peace he preach'd in vain
 amidst the madness of th' unruly train
 five herds five bleating flocks his pastures fill'd
 his lands a hundred yoke of oxen till'd

 thus while in equal scales their fortune stood
 the fury bath'd them in each other's blood
 then having fix'd the fight exulting flies
 and bears fulfill'd her promise to the skies
 to juno thus she speaks "behold it is done
 the blood already drawn the war begun
 the discord is complete nor can they cease
 the dire debate nor you command the peace
 now since the latian and the trojan brood
 have tasted vengeance and the sweets of blood
 speak and my pow'r shall add this office more
 the neighb'ing nations of th' ausonian shore
 shall hear the dreadful rumor from afar
 of arm'd invasion and embrace the war"
 then juno thus "the grateful work is done
 the seeds of discord sow'd the war begun
 frauds fears and fury have possess'd the state
 and fix'd the causes of a lasting hate
 a bloody hymen shall th' alliance join
 betwixt the trojan and ausonian line
 but thou with speed to night and hell repair
 for not the gods nor angry jove will bear
 thy lawless wand'ring walks in upper air
 leave what remains to me" saturnia said
 the sullen fiend her sounding wings display'd
 unwilling left the light and sought the nether shade

 in midst of italy well known to fame
 there lies a lake amsanctus is the name
 below the lofty mounts on either side
 thick forests the forbidden entrance hide
 full in the center of the sacred wood
 an arm arises of the stygian flood
 which breaking from beneath with bellowing sound
 whirls the black waves and rattling stones around
 here pluto pants for breath from out his cell
 and opens wide the grinning jaws of hell
 to this infernal lake the fury flies
 here hides her hated head and frees the lab'ring skies

 saturnian juno now with double care
 attends the fatal process of the war
 the clowns return'd from battle bear the slain
 implore the gods and to their king complain
 the corps of almon and the rest are shown
 shrieks clamors murmurs fill the frighted town
 ambitious turnus in the press appears
 and aggravating crimes augments their fears
 proclaims his private injuries aloud
 a solemn promise made and disavow'd
 a foreign son is sought and a mix'd mungril brood
 then they whose mothers frantic with their fear
 in woods and wilds the flags of bacchus bear
 and lead his dances with dishevel'd hair
 increase the clamor and the war demand
 such was amata's interest in the land
 against the public sanctions of the peace
 against all omens of their ill success
 with fates averse the rout in arms resort
 to force their monarch and insult the court
 but like a rock unmov'd a rock that braves
 the raging tempest and the rising waves
 propp'd on himself he stands his solid sides
 wash off the seaweeds and the sounding tides
 so stood the pious prince unmov'd and long
 sustain'd the madness of the noisy throng
 but when he found that juno's pow'r prevail'd
 and all the methods of cool counsel fail'd
 he calls the gods to witness their offense
 disclaims the war asserts his innocence
 "hurried by fate" he cries "and borne before
 a furious wind we have the faithful shore
 o more than madmen you yourselves shall bear
 the guilt of blood and sacrilegious war
 thou turnus shalt atone it by thy fate
 and pray to heav'n for peace but pray too late
 for me my stormy voyage at an end
 i to the port of death securely tend
 the fun'ral pomp which to your kings you pay
 is all i want and all you take away"
 he said no more but in his walls confin'd
 shut out the woes which he too well divin'd
 nor with the rising storm would vainly strive
 but left the helm and let the vessel drive

 a solemn custom was observ'd of old
 which latium held and now the romans hold
 their standard when in fighting fields they rear
 against the fierce hyrcanians or declare
 the scythian indian or arabian war
 or from the boasting parthians would regain
 their eagles lost in carrhae's bloody plain
 two gates of steel the name of mars they bear
 and still are worship'd with religious fear
 before his temple stand the dire abode
 and the fear'd issues of the furious god
 are fenc'd with brazen bolts without the gates
 the wary guardian janus doubly waits
 then when the sacred senate votes the wars
 the roman consul their decree declares
 and in his robes the sounding gates unbars
 the youth in military shouts arise
 and the loud trumpets break the yielding skies
 these rites of old by sov'reign princes us'd
 were the king's office but the king refus'd
 deaf to their cries nor would the gates unbar
 of sacred peace or loose th' imprison'd war
 but hid his head and safe from loud alarms
 abhorr'd the wicked ministry of arms
 then heav'n's imperious queen shot down from high
 at her approach the brazen hinges fly
 the gates are forc'd and ev'ry falling bar
 and like a tempest issues out the war

 the peaceful cities of th' ausonian shore
 lull'd in their ease and undisturb'd before
 are all on fire and some with studious care
 their restiff steeds in sandy plains prepare
 some their soft limbs in painful marches try
 and war is all their wish and arms the gen'ral cry
 part scour the rusty shields with seam and part
 new grind the blunted ax and point the dart
 with joy they view the waving ensigns fly
 and hear the trumpet's clangor pierce the sky
 five cities forge their arms th' atinian pow'rs
 antemnae tibur with her lofty tow'rs
 ardea the proud the crustumerian town
 all these of old were places of renown
 some hammer helmets for the fighting field
 some twine young sallows to support the shield
 the croslet some and some the cuishes mold
 with silver plated and with ductile gold
 the rustic honors of the scythe and share
 give place to swords and plumes the pride of war
 old fauchions are new temper'd in the fires
 the sounding trumpet ev'ry soul inspires
 the word is giv'n with eager speed they lace
 the shining headpiece and the shield embrace
 the neighing steeds are to the chariot tied
 the trusty weapon sits on ev'ry side

 and now the mighty labor is begun
 ye muses open all your helicon
 sing you the chiefs that sway'd th' ausonian land
 their arms and armies under their command
 what warriors in our ancient clime were bred
 what soldiers follow'd and what heroes led
 for well you know and can record alone
 what fame to future times conveys but darkly down
 mezentius first appear'd upon the plain
 scorn sate upon his brows and sour disdain
 defying earth and heav'n etruria lost
 he brings to turnus' aid his baffled host
 the charming lausus full of youthful fire
 rode in the rank and next his sullen sire
 to turnus only second in the grace
 of manly mien and features of the face
 a skilful horseman and a huntsman bred
 with fates averse a thousand men he led
 his sire unworthy of so brave a son
 himself well worthy of a happier throne

 next aventinus drives his chariot round
 the latian plains with palms and laurels crown'd
 proud of his steeds he smokes along the field
 his father's hydra fills his ample shield
 a hundred serpents hiss about the brims
 the son of hercules he justly seems
 by his broad shoulders and gigantic limbs
 of heav'nly part and part of earthly blood
 a mortal woman mixing with a god
 for strong alcides after he had slain
 the triple geryon drove from conquer'd spain
 his captive herds and thence in triumph led
 on tuscan tiber's flow'ry banks they fed
 then on mount aventine the son of jove
 the priestess rhea found and forc'd to love
 for arms his men long piles and jav'lins bore
 and poles with pointed steel their foes in battle gore
 like hercules himself his son appears
 in salvage pomp a lion's hide he wears
 about his shoulders hangs the shaggy skin
 the teeth and gaping jaws severely grin
 thus like the god his father homely dress'd
 he strides into the hall a horrid guest

 then two twin brothers from fair tibur came
 which from their brother tiburs took the name
 fierce coras and catillus void of fear
 arm'd argive horse they led and in the front appear
 like cloudborn centaurs from the mountain's height
 with rapid course descending to the fight
 they rush along the rattling woods give way
 the branches bend before their sweepy sway

 nor was praeneste's founder wanting there
 whom fame reports the son of mulciber
 found in the fire and foster'd in the plains
 a shepherd and a king at once he reigns
 and leads to turnus' aid his country swains
 his own praeneste sends a chosen band
 with those who plow saturnia's gabine land
 besides the succor which cold anien yields
 the rocks of hernicus and dewy fields
 anagnia fat and father amasene
 a num'rous rout but all of naked men
 nor arms they wear nor swords and bucklers wield
 nor drive the chariot thro' the dusty field
 but whirl from leathern slings huge balls of lead
 and spoils of yellow wolves adorn their head
 the left foot naked when they march to fight
 but in a bull's raw hide they sheathe the right
 messapus next great neptune was his sire
 secure of steel and fated from the fire
 in pomp appears and with his ardor warms
 a heartless train unexercis'd in arms
 the just faliscans he to battle brings
 and those who live where lake ciminia springs
 and where feronia's grove and temple stands
 who till fescennian or flavinian lands
 all these in order march and marching sing
 the warlike actions of their seaborn king
 like a long team of snowy swans on high
 which clap their wings and cleave the liquid sky
 when homeward from their wat'ry pastures borne
 they sing and asia's lakes their notes return
 not one who heard their music from afar
 would think these troops an army train'd to war
 but flocks of fowl that when the tempests roar
 with their hoarse gabbling seek the silent shore

 then clausus came who led a num'rous band
 of troops embodied from the sabine land
 and in himself alone an army brought
 't was he the noble claudian race begot
 the claudian race ordain'd in times to come
 to share the greatness of imperial rome
 he led the cures forth of old renown
 mutuscans from their olivebearing town
 and all th' eretian pow'rs besides a band
 that follow'd from velinum's dewy land
 and amiternian troops of mighty fame
 and mountaineers that from severus came
 and from the craggy cliffs of tetrica
 and those where yellow tiber takes his way
 and where himella's wanton waters play
 casperia sends her arms with those that lie
 by fabaris and fruitful foruli
 the warlike aids of horta next appear
 and the cold nursians come to close the rear
 mix'd with the natives born of latine blood
 whom allia washes with her fatal flood
 not thicker billows beat the libyan main
 when pale orion sets in wintry rain
 nor thicker harvests on rich hermus rise
 or lycian fields when phoebus burns the skies
 than stand these troops their bucklers ring around
 their trampling turns the turf and shakes the solid ground

 high in his chariot then halesus came
 a foe by birth to troy's unhappy name
 from agamemnon born to turnus' aid
 a thousand men the youthful hero led
 who till the massic soil for wine renown'd
 and fierce auruncans from their hilly ground
 and those who live by sidicinian shores
 and where with shoaly fords vulturnus roars
 cales' and osca's old inhabitants
 and rough saticulans inur'd to wants
 light demilances from afar they throw
 fasten'd with leathern thongs to gall the foe
 short crooked swords in closer fight they wear
 and on their warding arm light bucklers bear

 nor oebalus shalt thou be left unsung
 from nymph semethis and old telon sprung
 who then in teleboan capri reign'd
 but that short isle th' ambitious youth disdain'd
 and o'er campania stretch'd his ample sway
 where swelling sarnus seeks the tyrrhene sea
 o'er batulum and where abella sees
 from her high tow'rs the harvest of her trees
 and these as was the teuton use of old
 wield brazen swords and brazen bucklers hold
 sling weighty stones when from afar they fight
 their casques are cork a covering thick and light

 next these in rank the warlike ufens went
 and led the mountain troops that nursia sent
 the rude equicolae his rule obey'd
 hunting their sport and plund'ring was their trade
 in arms they plow'd to battle still prepar'd
 their soil was barren and their hearts were hard

 umbro the priest the proud marrubians led
 by king archippus sent to turnus' aid
 and peaceful olives crown'd his hoary head
 his wand and holy words the viper's rage
 and venom'd wounds of serpents could assuage
 he when he pleas'd with powerful juice to steep
 their temples shut their eyes in pleasing sleep
 but vain were marsian herbs and magic art
 to cure the wound giv'n by the dardan dart
 yet his untimely fate th' angitian woods
 in sighs remurmur'd to the fucine floods

 the son of fam'd hippolytus was there
 fam'd as his sire and as his mother fair
 whom in egerian groves aricia bore
 and nurs'd his youth along the marshy shore
 where great diana's peaceful altars flame
 in fruitful fields and virbius was his name
 hippolytus as old records have said
 was by his stepdam sought to share her bed
 but when no female arts his mind could move
 she turn'd to furious hate her impious love
 torn by wild horses on the sandy shore
 another's crimes th' unhappy hunter bore
 glutting his father's eyes with guiltless gore
 but chaste diana who his death deplor'd
 with aesculapian herbs his life restor'd
 then jove who saw from high with just disdain
 the dead inspir'd with vital breath again
 struck to the center with his flaming dart
 th' unhappy founder of the godlike art
 but trivia kept in secret shades alone
 her care hippolytus to fate unknown
 and call'd him virbius in th' egerian grove
 where then he liv'd obscure but safe from jove
 for this from trivia's temple and her wood
 are coursers driv'n who shed their master's blood
 affrighted by the monsters of the flood
 his son the second virbius yet retain'd
 his father's art and warrior steeds he rein'd

 amid the troops and like the leading god
 high o'er the rest in arms the graceful turnus rode
 a triple of plumes his crest adorn'd
 on which with belching flames chimaera burn'd
 the more the kindled combat rises high'r
 the more with fury burns the blazing fire
 fair io grac'd his shield but io now
 with horns exalted stands and seems to low
 a noble charge her keeper by her side
 to watch her walks his hundred eyes applied
 and on the brims her sire the wat'ry god
 roll'd from a silver urn his crystal flood
 a cloud of foot succeeds and fills the fields
 with swords and pointed spears and clatt'ring shields
 of argives and of old sicanian bands
 and those who plow the rich rutulian lands
 auruncan youth and those sacrana yields
 and the proud labicans with painted shields
 and those who near numician streams reside
 and those whom tiber's holy forests hide
 or circe's hills from the main land divide
 where ufens glides along the lowly lands
 or the black water of pomptina stands

 last from the volscians fair camilla came
 and led her warlike troops a warrior dame
 unbred to spinning in the loom unskill'd
 she chose the nobler pallas of the field
 mix'd with the first the fierce virago fought
 sustain'd the toils of arms the danger sought
 outstripp'd the winds in speed upon the plain
 flew o'er the fields nor hurt the bearded grain
 she swept the seas and as she skimm'd along
 her flying feet unbath'd on billows hung
 men boys and women stupid with surprise
 where'er she passes fix their wond'ring eyes
 longing they look and gaping at the sight
 devour her o'er and o'er with vast delight
 her purple habit sits with such a grace
 on her smooth shoulders and so suits her face
 her head with ringlets of her hair is crown'd
 and in a golden caul the curls are bound
 she shakes her myrtle jav'lin and behind
 her lycian quiver dances in the wind




 book viii

 when turnus had assembled all his pow'rs
 his standard planted on laurentum's tow'rs
 when now the sprightly trumpet from afar
 had giv'n the signal of approaching war
 had rous'd the neighing steeds to scour the fields
 while the fierce riders clatter'd on their shields
 trembling with rage the latian youth prepare
 to join th' allies and headlong rush to war
 fierce ufens and messapus led the crowd
 with bold mezentius who blasphem'd aloud
 these thro' the country took their wasteful course
 the fields to forage and to gather force
 then venulus to diomede they send
 to beg his aid ausonia to defend
 declare the common danger and inform
 the grecian leader of the growing storm
 aeneas landed on the latian coast
 with banish'd gods and with a baffled host
 yet now aspir'd to conquest of the state
 and claim'd a title from the gods and fate
 what num'rous nations in his quarrel came
 and how they spread his formidable name
 what he design'd what mischief might arise
 if fortune favor'd his first enterprise
 was left for him to weigh whose equal fears
 and common interest was involv'd in theirs

 while turnus and th' allies thus urge the war
 the trojan floating in a flood of care
 beholds the tempest which his foes prepare
 this way and that he turns his anxious mind
 thinks and rejects the counsels he design'd
 explores himself in vain in ev'ry part
 and gives no rest to his distracted heart
 so when the sun by day or moon by night
 strike on the polish'd brass their trembling light
 the glitt'ring species here and there divide
 and cast their dubious beams from side to side
 now on the walls now on the pavement play
 and to the ceiling flash the glaring day

 't was night and weary nature lull'd asleep
 the birds of air and fishes of the deep
 and beasts and mortal men the trojan chief
 was laid on tiber's banks oppress'd with grief
 and found in silent slumber late relief
 then thro' the shadows of the poplar wood
 arose the father of the roman flood
 an azure robe was o'er his body spread
 a wreath of shady reeds adorn'd his head
 thus manifest to sight the god appear'd
 and with these pleasing words his sorrow cheer'd
 "undoubted offspring of ethereal race
 o long expected in this promis'd place
 who thro' the foes hast borne thy banish'd gods
 restor'd them to their hearths and old abodes
 this is thy happy home the clime where fate
 ordains thee to restore the trojan state
 fear not the war shall end in lasting peace
 and all the rage of haughty juno cease
 and that this nightly vision may not seem
 th' effect of fancy or an idle dream
 a sow beneath an oak shall lie along
 all white herself and white her thirty young
 when thirty rolling years have run their race
 thy son ascanius on this empty space
 shall build a royal town of lasting fame
 which from this omen shall receive the name
 time shall approve the truth for what remains
 and how with sure success to crown thy pains
 with patience next attend a banish'd band
 driv'n with evander from th' arcadian land
 have planted here and plac'd on high their walls
 their town the founder pallanteum calls
 deriv'd from pallas his greatgrandsire's name
 but the fierce latians old possession claim
 with war infesting the new colony
 these make thy friends and on their aid rely
 to thy free passage i submit my streams
 wake son of venus from thy pleasing dreams
 and when the setting stars are lost in day
 to juno's pow'r thy just devotion pay
 with sacrifice the wrathful queen appease
 her pride at length shall fall her fury cease
 when thou return'st victorious from the war
 perform thy vows to me with grateful care
 the god am i whose yellow water flows
 around these fields and fattens as it goes
 tiber my name among the rolling floods
 renown'd on earth esteem'd among the gods
 this is my certain seat in times to come
 my waves shall wash the walls of mighty rome"

 he said and plung'd below while yet he spoke
 his dream aeneas and his sleep forsook
 he rose and looking up beheld the skies
 with purple blushing and the day arise
 then water in his hollow palm he took
 from tiber's flood and thus the pow'rs bespoke
 "laurentian nymphs by whom the streams are fed
 and father tiber in thy sacred bed
 receive aeneas and from danger keep
 whatever fount whatever holy deep
 conceals thy wat'ry stores where'er they rise
 and bubbling from below salute the skies
 thou king of horned floods whose plenteous urn
 suffices fatness to the fruitful corn
 for this thy kind compassion of our woes
 shalt share my morning song and ev'ning vows
 but o be present to thy people's aid
 and firm the gracious promise thou hast made"
 thus having said two galleys from his stores
 with care he chooses mans and fits with oars
 now on the shore the fatal swine is found
 wondrous to tell she lay along the ground
 her wellfed offspring at her udders hung
 she white herself and white her thirty young
 aeneas takes the mother and her brood
 and all on juno's altar are bestow'd

 the foll'wing night and the succeeding day
 propitious tiber smooth'd his wat'ry way
 he roll'd his river back and pois'd he stood
 a gentle swelling and a peaceful flood
 the trojans mount their ships they put from shore
 borne on the waves and scarcely dip an oar
 shouts from the land give omen to their course
 and the pitch'd vessels glide with easy force
 the woods and waters wonder at the gleam
 of shields and painted ships that stem the stream
 one summer's night and one whole day they pass
 betwixt the greenwood shades and cut the liquid glass
 the fiery sun had finish'd half his race
 look'd back and doubted in the middle space
 when they from far beheld the rising tow'rs
 the tops of sheds and shepherds' lowly bow'rs
 thin as they stood which then of homely clay
 now rise in marble from the roman sway
 these cots evander's kingdom mean and poor
 the trojan saw and turn'd his ships to shore
 't was on a solemn day th' arcadian states
 the king and prince without the city gates
 then paid their off'rings in a sacred grove
 to hercules the warrior son of jove
 thick clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies
 and fat of entrails on his altar fries

 but when they saw the ships that stemm'd the flood
 and glitter'd thro' the covert of the wood
 they rose with fear and left th' unfinish'd feast
 till dauntless pallas reassur'd the rest
 to pay the rites himself without delay
 a jav'lin seiz'd and singly took his way
 then gain'd a rising ground and call'd from far
 "resolve me strangers whence and what you are
 your bus'ness here and bring you peace or war"
 high on the stern aeneas his stand
 and held a branch of olive in his hand
 while thus he spoke "the phrygians' arms you see
 expell'd from troy provok'd in italy
 by latian foes with war unjustly made
 at first affianc'd and at last betray'd
 this message bear 'the trojans and their chief
 bring holy peace and beg the king's relief'
 struck with so great a name and all on fire
 the youth replies "whatever you require
 your fame exacts upon our shores descend
 a welcome guest and what you wish a friend"
 he said and downward hasting to the strand
 embrac'd the stranger prince and join'd his hand

 conducted to the grove aeneas broke
 the silence first and thus the king bespoke
 "best of the greeks to whom by fate's command
 i bear these peaceful branches in my hand
 undaunted i approach you tho' i know
 your birth is grecian and your land my foe
 from atreus tho' your ancient lineage came
 and both the brother kings your kindred claim
 yet my selfconscious worth your high renown
 your virtue thro' the neighb'ring nations blown
 our fathers' mingled blood apollo's voice
 have led me hither less by need than choice
 our founder dardanus as fame has sung
 and greeks acknowledge from electra sprung
 electra from the loins of atlas came
 atlas whose head sustains the starry frame
 your sire is mercury whom long before
 on cold cyllene's top fair maia bore
 maia the fair on fame if we rely
 was atlas' daughter who sustains the sky
 thus from one common source our streams divide
 ours is the trojan yours th' arcadian side
 rais'd by these hopes i sent no news before
 nor ask'd your leave nor did your faith implore
 but come without a pledge my own ambassador
 the same rutulians who with arms pursue
 the trojan race are equal foes to you
 our host expell'd what farther force can stay
 the victor troops from universal sway
 then will they stretch their pow'r athwart the land
 and either sea from side to side command
 receive our offer'd faith and give us thine
 ours is a gen'rous and experienc'd line
 we want not hearts nor bodies for the war
 in council cautious and in fields we dare"

 he said and while spoke with piercing eyes
 evander view'd the man with vast surprise
 pleas'd with his action ravish'd with his face
 then answer'd briefly with a royal grace
 "o valiant leader of the trojan line
 in whom the features of thy father shine
 how i recall anchises how i see
 his motions mien and all my friend in thee
 long tho' it be 't is fresh within my mind
 when priam to his sister's court design'd
 a welcome visit with a friendly stay
 and thro' th' arcadian kingdom took his way
 then past a boy the callow down began
 to shade my chin and call me first a man
 i saw the shining train with vast delight
 and priam's goodly person pleas'd my sight
 but great anchises far above the rest
 with awful wonder fir'd my youthful breast
 i long'd to join in friendship's holy bands
 our mutual hearts and plight our mutual hands
 i first accosted him i sued i sought
 and with a loving force to pheneus brought
 he gave me when at length constrain'd to go
 a lycian quiver and a gnossian bow
 a vest embroider'd glorious to behold
 and two rich bridles with their bits of gold
 which my son's coursers in obedience hold
 the league you ask i offer as your right
 and when tomorrow's sun reveals the light
 with swift supplies you shall be sent away
 now celebrate with us this solemn day
 whose holy rites admit no long delay
 honor our annual feast and take your seat
 with friendly welcome at a homely treat"
 thus having said the bowls remov'd for fear
 the youths replac'd and soon restor'd the cheer
 on sods of turf he set the soldiers round
 a maple throne rais'd higher from the ground
 receiv'd the trojan chief and o'er the bed
 a lion's shaggy hide for ornament they spread
 the loaves were serv'd in canisters the wine
 in bowls the priest renew'd the rites divine
 broil'd entrails are their food and beef's continued chine

 but when the rage of hunger was repress'd
 thus spoke evander to his royal guest
 "these rites these altars and this feast o king
 from no vain fears or superstition spring
 or blind devotion or from blinder chance
 or heady zeal or brutal ignorance
 but sav'd from danger with a grateful sense
 the labors of a god we recompense
 see from afar yon rock that mates the sky
 about whose feet such heaps of rubbish lie
 such indigested ruin bleak and bare
 how desart now it stands expos'd in air
 't was once a robber's den inclos'd around
 with living stone and deep beneath the ground
 the monster cacus more than half a beast
 this hold impervious to the sun possess'd
 the pavement ever foul with human gore
 heads and their mangled members hung the door
 vulcan this plague begot and like his sire
 black clouds he belch'd and flakes of livid fire
 time long expected eas'd us of our load
 and brought the needful presence of a god
 th' avenging force of hercules from spain
 arriv'd in triumph from geryon slain
 thrice liv'd the giant and thrice liv'd in vain
 his prize the lowing herds alcides drove
 near tiber's bank to graze the shady grove
 allur'd with hope of plunder and intent
 by force to rob by fraud to circumvent
 the brutal cacus as by chance they stray'd
 four oxen thence and four fair kine convey'd
 and lest the printed footsteps might be seen
 he dragg'd 'em backwards to his rocky den
 the tracks averse a lying notice gave
 and led the searcher backward from the cave

 "meantime the herdsman hero shifts his place
 to find fresh pasture and untrodden grass
 the beasts who miss'd their mates fill'd all around
 with bellowings and the rocks restor'd the sound
 one heifer who had heard her love complain
 roar'd from the cave and made the project vain
 alcides found the fraud with rage he shook
 and toss'd about his head his knotted oak
 swift as the winds or scythian arrows' flight
 he clomb with eager haste th' aerial height
 then first we saw the monster mend his pace
 fear his eyes and paleness in his face
 confess'd the god's approach trembling he springs
 as terror had increas'd his feet with wings
 nor stay'd for stairs but down the depth he threw
 his body on his back the door he drew
 the door a rib of living rock with pains
 his father hew'd it out and bound with iron chains
 he broke the heavy links the mountain clos'd
 and bars and levers to his foe oppos'd
 the wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast
 the fierce avenger came with bounding haste
 survey'd the mouth of the forbidden hold
 and here and there his raging eyes he roll'd
 he gnash'd his teeth and thrice he compass'd round
 with winged speed the circuit of the ground
 thrice at the cavern's mouth he pull'd in vain
 and panting thrice desisted from his pain
 a pointed flinty rock all bare and black
 grew gibbous from behind the mountain's back
 owls ravens all ill omens of the night
 here built their nests and hither wing'd their flight
 the leaning head hung threat'ning o'er the flood
 and nodded to the left the hero stood
 adverse with planted feet and from the right
 tugg'd at the solid stone with all his might
 thus heav'd the fix'd foundations of the rock
 gave way heav'n echo'd at the rattling shock
 tumbling it chok'd the flood on either side
 the banks leap backward and the streams divide
 the sky shrunk upward with unusual dread
 and trembling tiber div'd beneath his bed
 the court of cacus stands reveal'd to sight
 the cavern glares with newadmitted light
 so the pent vapors with a rumbling sound
 heave from below and rend the hollow ground
 a sounding flaw succeeds and from on high
 the gods with hate beheld the nether sky
 the ghosts repine at violated night
 and curse th' invading sun and sicken at the sight
 the graceless monster caught in open day
 inclos'd and in despair to fly away
 howls horrible from underneath and fills
 his hollow palace with unmanly yells
 the hero stands above and from afar
 plies him with darts and stones and distant war
 he from his nostrils huge mouth expires
 black clouds of smoke amidst his father's fires
 gath'ring with each repeated blast the night
 to make uncertain aim and erring sight
 the wrathful god then plunges from above
 and where in thickest waves the sparkles drove
 there lights and wades thro' fumes and gropes his way
 half sing'd half stifled till he grasps his prey
 the monster spewing fruitless flames he found
 he squeez'd his throat he writh'd his neck around
 and in a knot his crippled members bound
 then from their sockets tore his burning eyes
 roll'd on a heap the breathless robber lies
 the doors unbarr'd receive the rushing day
 and thoro' lights disclose the ravish'd prey
 the bulls redeem'd breathe open air again
 next by the feet they drag him from his den
 the wond'ring neighborhood with glad surprise
 behold his shagged breast his giant size
 his mouth that flames no more and his extinguish'd eyes
 from that auspicious day with rites divine
 we worship at the hero's holy shrine
 potitius first ordain'd these annual vows
 as priests were added the pinarian house
 who rais'd this altar in the sacred shade
 where honors ever due for ever shall be paid
 for these deserts and this high virtue shown
 ye warlike youths your heads with garlands crown
 fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood
 and with deep draughts invoke our common god"

 this said a double wreath evander twin'd
 and poplars black and white his temples bind
 then brims his ample bowl with like design
 the rest invoke the gods with sprinkled wine
 meantime the sun descended from the skies
 and the bright evening star began to rise
 and now the priests potitius at their head
 in skins of beasts involv'd the long procession led
 held high the flaming tapers in their hands
 as custom had prescrib'd their holy bands
 then with a second course the tables load
 and with full chargers offer to the god
 the salii sing and cense his altars round
 with saban smoke their heads with poplar bound
 one choir of old another of the young
 to dance and bear the burthen of the song
 the lay records the labors and the praise
 and all th' immortal acts of hercules
 first how the mighty babe when swath'd in bands
 the serpents strangled with his infant hands
 then as in years and matchless force he grew
 th' oechalian walls and trojan overthrew
 besides a thousand hazards they relate
 procur'd by juno's and eurystheus' hate
 "thy hands unconquer'd hero could subdue
 the cloudborn centaurs and the monster crew
 nor thy resistless arm the bull withstood
 nor he the roaring terror of the wood
 the triple porter of the stygian seat
 with lolling tongue lay fawning at thy feet
 and seiz'd with fear forgot his mangled meat
 th' infernal waters trembled at thy sight
 thee god no face of danger could affright
 not huge typhoeus nor th' unnumber'd snake
 increas'd with hissing heads in lerna's lake
 hail jove's undoubted son an added grace
 to heav'n and the great author of thy race
 receive the grateful off'rings which we pay
 and smile propitious on thy solemn day"
 in numbers thus they sung above the rest
 the den and death of cacus crown the feast
 the woods to hollow vales convey the sound
 the vales to hills and hills the notes rebound
 the rites perform'd the cheerful train retire

 betwixt young pallas and his aged sire
 the trojan pass'd the city to survey
 and pleasing talk beguil'd the tedious way
 the stranger cast around his curious eyes
 new objects viewing still with new surprise
 with greedy joy enquires of various things
 and acts and monuments of ancient kings
 then thus the founder of the roman tow'rs
 "these woods were first the seat of sylvan pow'rs
 of nymphs and fauns and salvage men who took
 their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak
 nor laws they knew nor manners nor the care
 of lab'ring oxen or the shining share
 nor arts of gain nor what they gain'd to spare
 their exercise the chase the running flood
 supplied their thirst the trees supplied their food
 then saturn came who fled the pow'r of jove
 robb'd of his realms and banish'd from above
 the men dispers'd on hills to towns he brought
 and laws ordain'd and civil customs taught
 and latium call'd the land where safe he lay
 from his unduteous son and his usurping sway
 with his mild empire peace and plenty came
 and hence the golden times deriv'd their name
 a more degenerate and discolor'd age
 succeeded this with avarice and rage
 th' ausonians then and bold sicanians came
 and saturn's empire often chang'd the name
 then kings gigantic tybris and the rest
 with arbitrary sway the land oppress'd
 for tiber's flood was albula before
 till from the tyrant's fate his name it bore
 i last arriv'd driv'n from my native home
 by fortune's pow'r and fate's resistless doom
 long toss'd on seas i sought this happy land
 warn'd by my mother nymph and call'd by heav'n's command"

 thus walking on he spoke and shew'd the gate
 since call'd carmental by the roman state
 where stood an altar sacred to the name
 of old carmenta the prophetic dame
 who to her son foretold th' aenean race
 sublime in fame and rome's imperial place
 then shews the forest which in after times
 fierce romulus for perpetrated crimes
 a sacred refuge made with this the shrine
 where pan below the rock had rites divine
 then tells of argus' death his murder'd guest
 whose grave and tomb his innocence attest
 thence to the steep tarpeian rock he leads
 now roof'd with gold then thatch'd with homely reeds
 a reverent fear such superstition reigns
 among the rude ev'n then possess'd the swains
 some god they knew what god they could not tell
 did there amidst the sacred horror dwell
 th' arcadians thought him jove and said they saw
 the mighty thund'rer with majestic awe
 who took his shield and dealt his bolts around
 and scatter'd tempests on the teeming ground
 then saw two heaps of ruins once they stood
 two stately towns on either side the flood
 saturnia's and janicula's remains
 and either place the founder's name retains
 discoursing thus together they resort
 where poor evander kept his country court
 they view'd the ground of rome's litigious hall
 once oxen low'd where now the lawyers bawl
 then stooping thro' the narrow gate they press'd
 when thus the king bespoke his trojan guest
 "mean as it is this palace and this door
 receiv'd alcides then a conqueror
 dare to be poor accept our homely food
 which feasted him and emulate a god"
 then underneath a lowly roof he led
 the weary prince and laid him on a bed
 the stuffing leaves with hides of bears o'erspread
 now night had shed her silver dews around
 and with her sable wings embrac'd the ground
 when love's fair goddess anxious for her son
 new tumults rising and new wars begun
 couch'd with her husband in his golden bed
 with these alluring words invokes his aid
 and that her pleasing speech his mind may move
 inspires each accent with the charms of love
 "while cruel fate conspir'd with grecian pow'rs
 to level with the ground the trojan tow'rs
 i ask'd not aid th' unhappy to restore
 nor did the succor of thy skill implore
 nor urg'd the labors of my lord in vain
 a sinking empire longer to sustain
 tho'much i ow'd to priam's house and more
 the dangers of aeneas did deplore
 but now by jove's command and fate's decree
 his race is doom'd to reign in italy
 with humble suit i beg thy needful art
 o still propitious pow'r that rules my heart
 a mother kneels a suppliant for her son
 by thetis and aurora thou wert won
 to forge impenetrable shields and grace
 with fated arms a less illustrious race
 behold what haughty nations are combin'd
 against the relics of the phrygian kind
 with fire and sword my people to destroy
 and conquer venus twice in conqu'ring troy"
 she said and straight her arms of snowy hue
 about her unresolving husband threw
 her soft embraces soon infuse desire
 his bones and marrow sudden warmth inspire
 and all the godhead feels the wonted fire
 not half so swift the rattling thunder flies
 or forky lightnings flash along the skies
 the goddess proud of her successful wiles
 and conscious of her form in secret smiles

 then thus the pow'r obnoxious to her charms
 panting and half dissolving in her arms
 "why seek you reasons for a cause so just
 or your own beauties or my love distrust
 long since had you requir'd my helpful hand
 th' artificer and art you might command
 to labor arms for troy nor jove nor fate
 confin'd their empire to so short a date
 and if you now desire new wars to wage
 my skill i promise and my pains engage
 whatever melting metals can conspire
 or breathing bellows or the forming fire
 is freely yours your anxious fears remove
 and think no task is difficult to love"
 trembling he spoke and eager of her charms
 he snatch'd the willing goddess to his arms
 till in her lap infus'd he lay possess'd
 of full desire and sunk to pleasing rest
 now when the night her middle race had rode
 and his first slumber had refresh'd the god
 the time when early housewives leave the bed
 when living embers on the hearth they spread
 supply the lamp and call the maids to rise
 with yawning mouths and with halfopen'd eyes
 they ply the distaff by the winking light
 and to their daily labor add the night
 thus frugally they earn their children's bread
 and uncorrupted keep the nuptial bed
 not less concern'd nor at a later hour
 rose from his downy couch the forging pow'r

 sacred to vulcan's name an isle there lay
 betwixt sicilia's coasts and lipare
 rais'd high on smoking rocks and deep below
 in hollow caves the fires of aetna glow
 the cyclops here their heavy hammers deal
 loud strokes and hissings of tormented steel
 are heard around the boiling waters roar
 and smoky flames thro' fuming tunnels soar
 hether the father of the fire by night
 thro' the brown air precipitates his flight
 on their eternal anvils here he found
 the brethren beating and the blows go round
 a load of pointless thunder now there lies
 before their hands to ripen for the skies
 these darts for angry jove they daily cast
 consum'd on mortals with prodigious waste
 three rays of writhen rain of fire three more
 of winged southern winds and cloudy store
 as many parts the dreadful mixture frame
 and fears are added and avenging flame
 inferior ministers for mars repair
 his broken axletrees and blunted war
 and send him forth again with furbish'd arms
 to wake the lazy war with trumpets' loud alarms
 the rest refresh the scaly snakes that fold
 the shield of pallas and renew their gold
 full on the crest the gorgon's head they place
 with eyes that roll in death and with distorted face

 "my sons" said vulcan "set your tasks aside
 your strength and masterskill must now be tried
 arms for a hero forge arms that require
 your force your speed and all your forming fire"
 he said they set their former work aside
 and their new toils with eager haste divide
 a flood of molten silver brass and gold
 and deadly steel in the large furnace roll'd
 of this their artful hands a shield prepare
 alone sufficient to sustain the war
 sev'n orbs within a spacious round they close
 one stirs the fire and one the bellows blows
 the hissing steel is in the smithy drown'd
 the grot with beaten anvils groans around
 by turns their arms advance in equal time
 by turns their hands descend and hammers chime
 they turn the glowing mass with crooked tongs
 the fiery work proceeds with rustic songs

 while at the lemnian god's command they urge
 their labors thus and ply th' aeolian forge
 the cheerful morn salutes evander's eyes
 and songs of chirping birds invite to rise
 he leaves his lowly bed his buskins meet
 above his ankles sandals sheathe his feet
 he sets his trusty sword upon his side
 and o'er his shoulder throws a panther's hide
 two menial dogs before their master press'd
 thus clad and guarded thus he seeks his kingly guest
 mindful of promis'd aid he mends his pace
 but meets aeneas in the middle space
 young pallas did his father's steps attend
 and true achates waited on his friend
 they join their hands a secret seat they choose
 th' arcadian first their former talk renews
 "undaunted prince i never can believe
 the trojan empire lost while you survive
 command th' assistance of a faithful friend
 but feeble are the succors i can send
 our narrow kingdom here the tiber bounds
 that other side the latian state surrounds
 insults our walls and wastes our fruitful grounds
 but mighty nations i prepare to join
 their arms with yours and aid your just design
 you come as by your better genius sent
 and fortune seems to favor your intent
 not far from hence there stands a hilly town
 of ancient building and of high renown
 torn from the tuscans by the lydian race
 who gave the name of caere to the place
 once agyllina call'd it flourish'd long
 in pride of wealth and warlike people strong
 till curs'd mezentius in a fatal hour
 assum'd the crown with arbitrary pow'r
 what words can paint those execrable times
 the subjects' suff'rings and the tyrant's crimes
 that blood those murthers o ye gods replace
 on his own head and on his impious race
 the living and the dead at his command
 were coupled face to face and hand to hand
 till chok'd with stench in loath'd embraces tied
 the ling'ring wretches pin'd away and died
 thus plung'd in ills and meditating more
 the people's patience tir'd no longer bore
 the raging monster but with arms beset
 his house and vengeance and destruction threat
 they fire his palace while the flame ascends
 they force his guards and execute his friends
 he cleaves the crowd and favor'd by the night
 to turnus' friendly court directs his flight
 by just revenge the tuscans set on fire
 with arms their king to punishment require
 their num'rous troops now muster'd on the strand
 my counsel shall submit to your command
 their navy swarms upon the coasts they cry
 to hoist their anchors but the gods deny
 an ancient augur skill'd in future fate
 with these foreboding words restrains their hate
 'ye brave in arms ye lydian blood the flow'r
 of tuscan youth and choice of all their pow'r
 whom just revenge against mezentius arms
 to seek your tyrant's death by lawful arms
 know this no native of our land may lead
 this pow'rful people seek a foreign head'
 aw'd with these words in camps they still abide
 and wait with longing looks their promis'd guide
 tarchon the tuscan chief to me has sent
 their crown and ev'ry regal ornament
 the people join their own with his desire
 and all my conduct as their king require
 but the chill blood that creeps within my veins
 and age and listless limbs unfit for pains
 and a soul conscious of its own decay
 have forc'd me to refuse imperial sway
 my pallas were more fit to mount the throne
 and should but he's a sabine mother's son
 and half a native but in you combine
 a manly vigor and a foreign line
 where fate and smiling fortune shew the way
 pursue the ready path to sov'reign sway
 the staff of my declining days my son
 shall make your good or ill success his own
 in fighting fields from you shall learn to dare
 and serve the hard apprenticeship of war
 your matchless courage and your conduct view
 and early shall begin t' admire and copy you
 besides two hundred horse he shall command
 tho' few a warlike and wellchosen band
 these in my name are listed and my son
 as many more has added in his own"

 scarce had he said achates and his guest
 with downcast eyes their silent grief express'd
 who short of succors and in deep despair
 shook at the dismal prospect of the war
 but his bright mother from a breaking cloud
 to cheer her issue thunder'd thrice aloud
 thrice forky lightning flash'd along the sky
 and tyrrhene trumpets thrice were heard on high
 then gazing up repeated peals they hear
 and in a heav'n serene refulgent arms appear
 redd'ning the skies and glitt'ring all around
 the temper'd metals clash and yield a silver sound
 the rest stood trembling struck with awe divine
 aeneas only conscious to the sign
 presag'd th' event and joyful view'd above
 th' accomplish'd promise of the queen of love
 then to th' arcadian king "this prodigy
 dismiss your fear belongs alone to me
 heav'n calls me to the war th' expected sign
 is giv'n of promis'd aid and arms divine
 my goddess mother whose indulgent care
 foresaw the dangers of the growing war
 this omen gave when bright vulcanian arms
 fated from force of steel by stygian charms
 suspended shone on high she then foreshow'd
 approaching fights and fields to float in blood
 turnus shall dearly pay for faith forsworn
 and corps and swords and shields on tiber borne
 shall choke his flood now sound the loud alarms
 and latian troops prepare your perjur'd arms"

 he said and rising from his homely throne
 the solemn rites of hercules begun
 and on his altars wak'd the sleeping fires
 then cheerful to his household gods retires
 there offers chosen sheep th' arcadian king
 and trojan youth the same oblations bring
 next of his men and ships he makes review
 draws out the best and ablest of the crew
 down with the falling stream the refuse run
 to raise with joyful news his drooping son
 steeds are prepar'd to mount the trojan band
 who wait their leader to the tyrrhene land
 a sprightly courser fairer than the rest
 the king himself presents his royal guest
 a lion's hide his back and limbs infold
 precious with studded work and paws of gold
 fame thro' the little city spreads aloud
 th' intended march amid the fearful crowd
 the matrons beat their breasts dissolve in tears
 and double their devotion in their fears
 the war at hand appears with more affright
 and rises ev'ry moment to the sight

 then old evander with a close embrace
 strain'd his departing friend and tears o'erflow his face
 "would heav'n" said he "my strength and youth recall
 such as i was beneath praeneste's wall
 then when i made the foremost foes retire
 and set whole heaps of conquer'd shields on fire
 when herilus in single fight i slew
 whom with three lives feronia did endue
 and thrice i sent him to the stygian shore
 till the last ebbing soul return'd no more
 such if i stood renew'd not these alarms
 nor death should rend me from my pallas' arms
 nor proud mezentius thus unpunish'd boast
 his rapes and murthers on the tuscan coast
 ye gods and mighty jove in pity bring
 relief and hear a father and a king
 if fate and you reserve these eyes to see
 my son return with peace and victory
 if the lov'd boy shall bless his father's sight
 if we shall meet again with more delight
 then draw my life in length let me sustain
 in hopes of his embrace the worst of pain
 but if your hard decrees which o i dread
 have doom'd to death his undeserving head
 this o this very moment let me die
 while hopes and fears in equal balance lie
 while yet possess'd of all his youthful charms
 i strain him close within these aged arms
 before that fatal news my soul shall wound"
 he said and swooning sunk upon the ground
 his servants bore him off and softly laid
 his languish'd limbs upon his homely bed

 the horsemen march the gates are open'd wide
 aeneas at their head achates by his side
 next these the trojan leaders rode along
 last follows in the rear th' arcadian throng
 young pallas shone conspicuous o'er the rest
 gilded his arms embroider'd was his vest
 so from the seas exerts his radiant head
 the star by whom the lights of heav'n are led
 shakes from his rosy locks the pearly dews
 dispels the darkness and the day renews
 the trembling wives the walls and turrets crowd
 and follow with their eyes the dusty cloud
 which winds disperse by fits and shew from far
 the blaze of arms and shields and shining war
 the troops drawn up in beautiful array
 o'er heathy plains pursue the ready way
 repeated peals of shouts are heard around
 the neighing coursers answer to the sound
 and shake with horny hoofs the solid ground

 a greenwood shade for long religion known
 stands by the streams that wash the tuscan town
 incompass'd round with gloomy hills above
 which add a holy horror to the grove
 the first inhabitants of grecian blood
 that sacred forest to silvanus vow'd
 the guardian of their flocks and fields and pay
 their due devotions on his annual day
 not far from hence along the river's side
 in tents secure the tuscan troops abide
 by tarchon led now from a rising ground
 aeneas cast his wond'ring eyes around
 and all the tyrrhene army had in sight
 stretch'd on the spacious plain from left to right
 thether his warlike train the trojan led
 refresh'd his men and wearied horses fed

 meantime the mother goddess crown'd with charms
 breaks thro' the clouds and brings the fated arms
 within a winding vale she finds her son
 on the cool river's banks retir'd alone
 she shews her heav'nly form without disguise
 and gives herself to his desiring eyes
 "behold" she said "perform'd in ev'ry part
 my promise made and vulcan's labor'd art
 now seek secure the latian enemy
 and haughty turnus to the field defy"
 she said and having first her son embrac'd
 the radiant arms beneath an oak she plac'd
 proud of the gift he roll'd his greedy sight
 around the work and gaz'd with vast delight
 he lifts he turns he poises and admires
 the crested helm that vomits radiant fires
 his hands the fatal sword and corslet hold
 one keen with temper'd steel one stiff with gold
 both ample flaming both and beamy bright
 so shines a cloud when edg'd with adverse light
 he shakes the pointed spear and longs to try
 the plated cuishes on his manly thigh
 but most admires the shield's mysterious mold
 and roman triumphs rising on the gold
 for these emboss'd the heav'nly smith had wrought
 not in the rolls of future fate untaught
 the wars in order and the race divine
 of warriors issuing from the julian line
 the cave of mars was dress'd with mossy greens
 there by the wolf were laid the martial twins
 intrepid on her swelling dugs they hung
 the foster dam loll'd out her fawning tongue
 they suck'd secure while bending back her head
 she lick'd their tender limbs and form'd them as they fed
 not far from thence new rome appears with games
 projected for the rape of sabine dames
 the pit resounds with shrieks a war succeeds
 for breach of public faith and unexampled deeds
 here for revenge the sabine troops contend
 the romans there with arms the prey defend
 wearied with tedious war at length they cease
 and both the kings and kingdoms plight the peace
 the friendly chiefs before jove's altar stand
 both arm'd with each a charger in his hand
 a fatted sow for sacrifice is led
 with imprecations on the perjur'd head
 near this the traitor metius stretch'd between
 four fiery steeds is dragg'd along the green
 by tullus' doom the brambles drink his blood
 and his torn limbs are left the vulture's food
 there porsena to rome proud tarquin brings
 and would by force restore the banish'd kings
 one tyrant for his fellowtyrant fights
 the roman youth assert their native rights
 before the town the tuscan army lies
 to win by famine or by fraud surprise
 their king halfthreat'ning halfdisdaining stood
 while cocles broke the bridge and stemm'd the flood
 the captive maids there tempt the raging tide
 scap'd from their chains with cloelia for their guide
 high on a rock heroic manlius stood
 to guard the temple and the temple's god
 then rome was poor and there you might behold
 the palace thatch'd with straw now roof'd with gold
 the silver goose before the shining gate
 there flew and by her cackle sav'd the state
 she told the gauls' approach th' approaching gauls
 obscure in night ascend and seize the walls
 the gold dissembled well their yellow hair
 and golden chains on their white necks they wear
 gold are their vests long alpine spears they wield
 and their left arm sustains a length of shield
 hard by the leaping salian priests advance
 and naked thro' the streets the mad luperci dance
 in caps of wool the targets dropp'd from heav'n
 here modest matrons in soft litters driv'n
 to pay their vows in solemn pomp appear
 and odorous gums in their chaste hands they bear
 far hence remov'd the stygian seats are seen
 pains of the damn'd and punish'd catiline
 hung on a rock the traitor and around
 the furies hissing from the nether ground
 apart from these the happy souls he draws
 and cato's holy ghost dispensing laws

 betwixt the quarters flows a golden sea
 but foaming surges there in silver play
 the dancing dolphins with their tails divide
 the glitt'ring waves and cut the precious tide
 amid the main two mighty fleets engage
 their brazen beaks oppos'd with equal rage
 actium surveys the welldisputed prize
 leucate's wat'ry plain with foamy billows fries
 young caesar on the stern in armor bright
 here leads the romans and their gods to fight
 his beamy temples shoot their flames afar
 and o'er his head is hung the julian star
 agrippa seconds him with prosp'rous gales
 and with propitious gods his foes assails
 a naval crown that binds his manly brows
 the happy fortune of the fight foreshows
 rang'd on the line oppos'd antonius brings
 barbarian aids and troops of eastern kings
 th' arabians near and bactrians from afar
 of tongues discordant and a mingled war
 and rich in gaudy robes amidst the strife
 his ill fate follows him th' egyptian wife
 moving they fight with oars and forky prows
 the froth is gather'd and the water glows
 it seems as if the cyclades again
 were rooted up and justled in the main
 or floating mountains floating mountains meet
 such is the fierce encounter of the fleet
 fireballs are thrown and pointed jav'lins fly
 the fields of neptune take a purple dye
 the queen herself amidst the loud alarms
 with cymbals toss'd her fainting soldiers warms
 fool as she was who had not yet divin'd
 her cruel fate nor saw the snakes behind
 her country gods the monsters of the sky
 great neptune pallas and love's queen defy
 the dog anubis barks but barks in vain
 nor longer dares oppose th' ethereal train
 mars in the middle of the shining shield
 is grav'd and strides along the liquid field
 the dirae souse from heav'n with swift descent
 and discord dyed in blood with garments rent
 divides the prease her steps bellona treads
 and shakes her iron rod above their heads
 this seen apollo from his actian height
 pours down his arrows at whose winged flight
 the trembling indians and egyptians yield
 and soft sabaeans quit the wat'ry field
 the fatal mistress hoists her silken sails
 and shrinking from the fight invokes the gales
 aghast she looks and heaves her breast for breath
 panting and pale with fear of future death
 the god had figur'd her as driv'n along
 by winds and waves and scudding thro' the throng
 just opposite sad nilus opens wide
 his arms and ample bosom to the tide
 and spreads his mantle o'er the winding coast
 in which he wraps his queen and hides the flying host
 the victor to the gods his thanks express'd
 and rome triumphant with his presence bless'd
 three hundred temples in the town he plac'd
 with spoils and altars ev'ry temple grac'd
 three shining nights and three succeeding days
 the fields resound with shouts the streets with praise
 the domes with songs the theaters with plays
 all altars flame before each altar lies
 drench'd in his gore the destin'd sacrifice
 great caesar sits sublime upon his throne
 before apollo's porch of parian stone
 accepts the presents vow'd for victory
 and hangs the monumental crowns on high
 vast crowds of vanquish'd nations march along
 various in arms in habit and in tongue
 here mulciber assigns the proper place
 for carians and th' ungirt numidian race
 then ranks the thracians in the second row
 with scythians expert in the dart and bow
 and here the tam'd euphrates humbly glides
 and there the rhine submits her swelling tides
 and proud araxes whom no bridge could bind
 the danes' unconquer'd offspring march behind
 and morini the last of humankind

 these figures on the shield divinely wrought
 by vulcan labor'd and by venus brought
 with joy and wonder fill the hero's thought
 unknown the names he yet admires the grace
 and bears aloft the fame and fortune of his race




 book ix

 while these affairs in distant places pass'd
 the various iris juno sends with haste
 to find bold turnus who with anxious thought
 the secret shade of his great grandsire sought
 retir'd alone she found the daring man
 and op'd her rosy lips and thus began
 "what none of all the gods could grant thy vows
 that turnus this auspicious day bestows
 aeneas gone to seek th' arcadian prince
 has left the trojan camp without defense
 and short of succors there employs his pains
 in parts remote to raise the tuscan swains
 now snatch an hour that favors thy designs
 unite thy forces and attack their lines"
 this said on equal wings she pois'd her weight
 and form'd a radiant rainbow in her flight

 the daunian hero lifts his hands eyes
 and thus invokes the goddess as she flies
 "iris the grace of heav'n what pow'r divine
 has sent thee down thro' dusky clouds to shine
 see they divide immortal day appears
 and glitt'ring planets dancing in their spheres
 with joy these happy omens i obey
 and follow to the war the god that leads the way"
 thus having said as by the brook he stood
 he scoop'd the water from the crystal flood
 then with his hands the drops to heav'n he throws
 and loads the pow'rs above with offer'd vows

 now march the bold confed'rates thro' the plain
 well hors'd well clad a rich and shining train
 messapus leads the van and in the rear
 the sons of tyrrheus in bright arms appear
 in the main battle with his flaming crest
 the mighty turnus tow'rs above the rest
 silent they move majestically slow
 like ebbing nile or ganges in his flow
 the trojans view the dusty cloud from far
 and the dark menace of the distant war
 caicus from the rampire saw it rise
 black'ning the fields and thick'ning thro' the skies
 then to his fellows thus aloud he calls
 "what rolling clouds my friends approach the walls
 arm arm and man the works prepare your spears
 and pointed darts the latian host appears"

 thus warn'd they shut their gates with shouts ascend
 the bulwarks and secure their foes attend
 for their wise gen'ral with foreseeing care
 had charg'd them not to tempt the doubtful war
 nor tho' provok'd in open fields advance
 but close within their lines attend their chance
 unwilling yet they keep the strict command
 and sourly wait in arms the hostile band
 the fiery turnus flew before the rest
 a piebald steed of thracian strain he press'd
 his helm of massy gold and crimson was his crest
 with twenty horse to second his designs
 an unexpected foe he fac'd the lines
 "is there" he said "in arms who bravely dare
 his leader's honor and his danger share"
 then spurring on his brandish'd dart he threw
 in sign of war applauding shouts ensue

 amaz'd to find a dastard race that run
 behind the rampires and the battle shun
 he rides around the camp with rolling eyes
 and stops at ev'ry post and ev'ry passage tries
 so roams the nightly wolf about the fold
 wet with descending show'rs and stiff with cold
 he howls for hunger and he grins for pain
 his gnashing teeth are exercis'd in vain
 and impotent of anger finds no way
 in his distended paws to grasp the prey
 the mothers listen but the bleating lambs
 securely swig the dug beneath the dams
 thus ranges eager turnus o'er the plain
 sharp with desire and furious with disdain
 surveys each passage with a piercing sight
 to force his foes in equal field to fight
 thus while he gazes round at length he spies
 where fenc'd with strong redoubts their navy lies
 close underneath the walls the washing tide
 secures from all approach this weaker side
 he takes the wish'd occasion fills his hand
 with ready fires and shakes a flaming brand
 urg'd by his presence ev'ry soul is warm'd
 and ev'ry hand with kindled firs is arm'd
 from the fir'd pines the scatt'ring sparkles fly
 fat vapors mix'd with flames involve the sky
 what pow'r o muses could avert the flame
 which threaten'd in the fleet the trojan name
 tell for the fact thro' length of time obscure
 is hard to faith yet shall the fame endure

 't is said that when the chief prepar'd his flight
 and fell'd his timber from mount ida's height
 the grandam goddess then approach'd her son
 and with a mother's majesty begun
 "grant me" she said "the sole request i bring
 since conquer'd heav'n has own'd you for its king
 on ida's brows for ages past there stood
 with firs and maples fill'd a shady wood
 and on the summit rose a sacred grove
 where i was worship'd with religious love
 those woods that holy grove my long delight
 i gave the trojan prince to speed his flight
 now fill'd with fear on their behalf i come
 let neither winds o'erset nor waves intomb
 the floating forests of the sacred pine
 but let it be their safety to be mine"
 then thus replied her awful son who rolls
 the radiant stars and heav'n and earth controls
 "how dare you mother endless date demand
 for vessels molded by a mortal hand
 what then is fate shall bold aeneas ride
 of safety certain on th' uncertain tide
 yet what i can i grant when wafted o'er
 the chief is landed on the latian shore
 whatever ships escape the raging storms
 at my command shall change their fading forms
 to nymphs divine and plow the wat'ry way
 like dotis and the daughters of the sea"
 to seal his sacred vow by styx he swore
 the lake of liquid pitch the dreary shore
 and phlegethon's innavigable flood
 and the black regions of his brother god
 he said and shook the skies with his imperial nod

 and now at length the number'd hours were come
 prefix'd by fate's irrevocable doom
 when the great mother of the gods was free
 to save her ships and finish jove's decree
 first from the quarter of the morn there sprung
 a light that sign'd the heav'ns and shot along
 then from a cloud fring'd round with golden fires
 were timbrels heard and berecynthian choirs
 and last a voice with more than mortal sounds
 both hosts in arms oppos'd with equal horror wounds
 "o trojan race your needless aid forbear
 and know my ships are my peculiar care
 with greater ease the bold rutulian may
 with hissing brands attempt to burn the sea
 than singe my sacred pines but you my charge
 loos'd from your crooked anchors launch at large
 exalted each a nymph forsake the sand
 and swim the seas at cybele's command"
 no sooner had the goddess ceas'd to speak
 when lo th' obedient ships their haulsers break
 and strange to tell like dolphins in the main
 they plunge their prows and dive and spring again
 as many beauteous maids the billows sweep
 as rode before tall vessels on the deep

 the foes surpris'd with wonder stood aghast
 messapus curb'd his fiery courser's haste
 old tiber roar'd and raising up his head
 call'd back his waters to their oozy bed
 turnus alone undaunted bore the shock
 and with these words his trembling troops bespoke
 "these monsters for the trojans' fate are meant
 and are by jove for black presages sent
 he takes the cowards' last relief away
 for fly they cannot and constrain'd to stay
 must yield unfought a base inglorious prey
 the liquid half of all the globe is lost
 heav'n shuts the seas and we secure the coast
 theirs is no more than that small spot of ground
 which myriads of our martial men surround
 their fates i fear not or vain oracles
 't was giv'n to venus they should cross the seas
 and land secure upon the latian plains
 their promis'd hour is pass'd and mine remains
 't is in the fate of turnus to destroy
 with sword and fire the faithless race of troy
 shall such affronts as these alone inflame
 the grecian brothers and the grecian name
 my cause and theirs is one a fatal strife
 and final ruin for a ravish'd wife
 was 't not enough that punish'd for the crime
 they fell but will they fall a second time
 one would have thought they paid enough before
 to curse the costly sex and durst offend no more
 can they securely trust their feeble wall
 a slight partition a thin interval
 betwixt their fate and them when troy tho' built
 by hands divine yet perish'd by their guilt
 lend me for once my friends your valiant hands
 to force from out their lines these dastard bands
 less than a thousand ships will end this war
 nor vulcan needs his fated arms prepare
 let all the tuscans all th' arcadians join
 nor these nor those shall frustrate my design
 let them not fear the treasons of the night
 the robb'd palladium the pretended flight
 our onset shall be made in open light
 no wooden engine shall their town betray
 fires they shall have around but fires by day
 no grecian babes before their camp appear
 whom hector's arms detain'd to the tenth tardy year
 now since the sun is rolling to the west
 give we the silent night to needful rest
 refresh your bodies and your arms prepare
 the morn shall end the small remains of war"

 the post of honor to messapus falls
 to keep the nightly guard to watch the walls
 to pitch the fires at distances around
 and close the trojans in their scanty ground
 twice seven rutulian captains ready stand
 and twice seven hundred horse these chiefs command
 all clad in shining arms the works invest
 each with a radiant helm and waving crest
 stretch'd at their length they press the grassy ground
 they laugh they sing the jolly bowls go round
 with lights and cheerful fires renew the day
 and pass the wakeful night in feasts and play

 the trojans from above their foes beheld
 and with arm'd legions all the rampires fill'd
 seiz'd with affright their gates they first explore
 join works to works with bridges tow'r to tow'r
 thus all things needful for defense abound
 mnestheus and brave seresthus walk the round
 commission'd by their absent prince to share
 the common danger and divide the care
 the soldiers draw their lots and as they fall
 by turns relieve each other on the wall

 nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance
 to watch the gate was warlike nisus' chance
 his father hyrtacus of noble blood
 his mother was a huntress of the wood
 and sent him to the wars well could he bear
 his lance in fight and dart the flying spear
 but better skill'd unerring shafts to send
 beside him stood euryalus his friend
 euryalus than whom the trojan host
 no fairer face or sweeter air could boast
 scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun
 one was their care and their delight was one
 one common hazard in the war they shar'd
 and now were both by choice upon the guard

 then nisus thus "or do the gods inspire
 this warmth or make we gods of our desire
 a gen'rous ardor boils within my breast
 eager of action enemy to rest
 this urges me to fight and fires my mind
 to leave a memorable name behind
 thou see'st the foe secure how faintly shine
 their scatter'd fires the most in sleep supine
 along the ground an easy conquest lie
 the wakeful few the fuming flagon ply
 all hush'd around now hear what i revolve
 a thought unripe and scarcely yet resolve
 our absent prince both camp and council mourn
 by message both would hasten his return
 if they confer what i demand on thee
 for fame is recompense enough for me
 methinks beneath yon hill i have espied
 a way that safely will my passage guide"

 euryalus stood list'ning while he spoke
 with love of praise and noble envy struck
 then to his ardent friend expos'd his mind
 "all this alone and leaving me behind
 am i unworthy nisus to be join'd
 thinkist thou i can my share of glory yield
 or send thee unassisted to the field
 not so my father taught my childhood arms
 born in a siege and bred among alarms
 nor is my youth unworthy of my friend
 nor of the heav'nborn hero i attend
 the thing call'd life with ease i can disclaim
 and think it oversold to purchase fame"

 then nisus thus "alas thy tender years
 would minister new matter to my fears
 so may the gods who view this friendly strife
 restore me to thy lov'd embrace with life
 condemn'd to pay my vows as sure i trust
 this thy request is cruel and unjust
 but if some chance as many chances are
 and doubtful hazards in the deeds of war
 if one should reach my head there let it fall
 and spare thy life i would not perish all
 thy bloomy youth deserves a longer date
 live thou to mourn thy love's unhappy fate
 to bear my mangled body from the foe
 or buy it back and fun'ral rites bestow
 or if hard fortune shall those dues deny
 thou canst at least an empty tomb supply
 o let not me the widow's tears renew
 nor let a mother's curse my name pursue
 thy pious parent who for love of thee
 forsook the coasts of friendly sicily
 her age committing to the seas and wind
 when ev'ry weary matron stay'd behind"
 to this euryalus "you plead in vain
 and but protract the cause you cannot gain
 no more delays but haste" with that he wakes
 the nodding watch each to his office takes
 the guard reliev'd the gen'rous couple went
 to find the council at the royal tent

 all creatures else forgot their daily care
 and sleep the common gift of nature share
 except the trojan peers who wakeful sate
 in nightly council for th' indanger'd state
 they vote a message to their absent chief
 shew their distress and beg a swift relief
 amid the camp a silent seat they chose
 remote from clamor and secure from foes
 on their left arms their ample shields they bear
 the right reclin'd upon the bending spear
 now nisus and his friend approach the guard
 and beg admission eager to be heard
 th' affair important not to be deferr'd
 ascanius bids 'em be conducted in
 ord'ring the more experienc'd to begin
 then nisus thus "ye fathers lend your ears
 nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years
 the foe securely drench'd in sleep and wine
 neglect their watch the fires but thinly shine
 and where the smoke in cloudy vapors flies
 cov'ring the plain and curling to the skies
 betwixt two paths which at the gate divide
 close by the sea a passage we have spied
 which will our way to great aeneas guide
 expect each hour to see him safe again
 loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain
 snatch we the lucky minute while we may
 nor can we be mistaken in the way
 for hunting in the vale we both have seen
 the rising turrets and the stream between
 and know the winding course with ev'ry ford"

 he ceas'd and old alethes took the word
 "our country gods in whom our trust we place
 will yet from ruin save the trojan race
 while we behold such dauntless worth appear
 in dawning youth and souls so void of fear"
 then into tears of joy the father broke
 each in his longing arms by turns he took
 panted and paus'd and thus again he spoke
 "ye brave young men what equal gifts can we
 in recompense of such desert decree
 the greatest sure and best you can receive
 the gods and your own conscious worth will give
 the rest our grateful gen'ral will bestow
 and young ascanius till his manhood owe"

 "and i whose welfare in my father lies"
 ascanius adds "by the great deities
 by my dear country by my household gods
 by hoary vesta's rites and dark abodes
 adjure you both on you my fortune stands
 that and my faith i plight into your hands
 make me but happy in his safe return
 whose wanted presence i can only mourn
 your common gift shall two large goblets be
 of silver wrought with curious imagery
 and high emboss'd which when old priam reign'd
 my conqu'ring sire at sack'd arisba gain'd
 and more two tripods cast in antic mold
 with two great talents of the finest gold
 beside a costly bowl ingrav'd with art
 which dido gave when first she gave her heart
 but if in conquer'd italy we reign
 when spoils by lot the victor shall obtain
 thou saw'st the courser by proud turnus press'd
 that nisus and his arms and nodding crest
 and shield from chance exempt shall be thy share
 twelve lab'ring slaves twelve handmaids young and fair
 all clad in rich attire and train'd with care
 and last a latian field with fruitful plains
 and a large portion of the king's domains
 but thou whose years are more to mine allied
 no fate my vow'd affection shall divide
 from thee heroic youth be wholly mine
 take full possession all my soul is thine
 one faith one fame one fate shall both attend
 my life's companion and my bosom friend
 my peace shall be committed to thy care
 and to thy conduct my concerns in war"

 then thus the young euryalus replied
 "whatever fortune good or bad betide
 the same shall be my age as now my youth
 no time shall find me wanting to my truth
 this only from your goodness let me gain
 and this ungranted all rewards are vain
 of priam's royal race my mother came
 and sure the best that ever bore the name
 whom neither troy nor sicily could hold
 from me departing but o'erspent and old
 my fate she follow'd ignorant of this
 whatever danger neither parting kiss
 nor pious blessing taken her i leave
 and in this only act of all my life deceive
 by this right hand and conscious night i swear
 my soul so sad a farewell could not bear
 be you her comfort fill my vacant place
 permit me to presume so great a grace
 support her age forsaken and distress'd
 that hope alone will fortify my breast
 against the worst of fortunes and of fears"
 he said the mov'd assistants melt in tears

 then thus ascanius wonderstruck to see
 that image of his filial piety
 "so great beginnings in so green an age
 exact the faith which i again ingage
 thy mother all the dues shall justly claim
 creusa had and only want the name
 whate'er event thy bold attempt shall have
 't is merit to have borne a son so brave
 now by my head a sacred oath i swear
 my father us'd it what returning here
 crown'd with success i for thyself prepare
 that if thou fail shall thy lov'd mother share"

 he said and weeping while he spoke the word
 from his broad belt he drew a shining sword
 magnificent with gold lycaon made
 and in an ivory scabbard sheath'd the blade
 this was his gift great mnestheus gave his friend
 a lion's hide his body to defend
 and good alethes furnish'd him beside
 with his own trusty helm of temper tried

 thus arm'd they went the noble trojans wait
 their issuing forth and follow to the gate
 with prayers and vows above the rest appears
 ascanius manly far beyond his years
 and messages committed to their care
 which all in winds were lost and flitting air

 the trenches first they pass'd then took their way
 where their proud foes in pitch'd pavilions lay
 to many fatal ere themselves were slain
 they found the careless host dispers'd upon the plain
 who gorg'd and drunk with wine supinely snore
 unharness'd chariots stand along the shore
 amidst the wheels and reins the goblet by
 a medley of debauch and war they lie
 observing nisus shew'd his friend the sight
 "behold a conquest gain'd without a fight
 occasion offers and i stand prepar'd
 there lies our way be thou upon the guard
 and look around while i securely go
 and hew a passage thro' the sleeping foe"
 softly he spoke then striding took his way
 with his drawn sword where haughty rhamnes lay
 his head rais'd high on tapestry beneath
 and heaving from his breast he drew his breath
 a king and prophet by king turnus lov'd
 but fate by prescience cannot be remov'd
 him and his sleeping slaves he slew then spies
 where remus with his rich retinue lies
 his armorbearer first and next he kills
 his charioteer intrench'd betwixt the wheels
 and his lov'd horses last invades their lord
 full on his neck he drives the fatal sword
 the gasping head flies off a purple flood
 flows from the trunk that welters in the blood
 which by the spurning heels dispers'd around
 the bed besprinkles and bedews the ground
 lamus the bold and lamyrus the strong
 he slew and then serranus fair and young
 from dice and wine the youth retir'd to rest
 and puff'd the fumy god from out his breast
 ev'n then he dreamt of drink and lucky play
 more lucky had it lasted till the day
 the famish'd lion thus with hunger bold
 o'erleaps the fences of the nightly fold
 and tears the peaceful flocks with silent awe
 trembling they lie and pant beneath his paw

 nor with less rage euryalus employs
 the wrathful sword or fewer foes destroys
 but on th' ignoble crowd his fury flew
 he fadus hebesus and rhoetus slew
 oppress'd with heavy sleep the former fell
 but rhoetus wakeful and observing all
 behind a spacious jar he slink'd for fear
 the fatal iron found and reach'd him there
 for as he rose it pierc'd his naked side
 and reeking thence return'd in crimson dyed
 the wound pours out a stream of wine and blood
 the purple soul comes floating in the flood

 now where messapus quarter'd they arrive
 the fires were fainting there and just alive
 the warriorhorses tied in order fed
 nisus observ'd the discipline and said
 "our eager thirst of blood may both betray
 and see the scatter'd streaks of dawning day
 foe to nocturnal thefts no more my friend
 here let our glutted execution end
 a lane thro' slaughter'd bodies we have made"
 the bold euryalus tho' loth obey'd
 of arms and arras and of plate they find
 a precious load but these they leave behind
 yet fond of gaudy spoils the boy would stay
 to make the rich caparison his prey
 which on the steed of conquer'd rhamnes lay
 nor did his eyes less longingly behold
 the girdlebelt with nails of burnish'd gold
 this present caedicus the rich bestow'd
 on remulus when friendship first they vow'd
 and absent join'd in hospitable ties
 he dying to his heir bequeath'd the prize
 till by the conqu'ring ardean troops oppress'd
 he fell and they the glorious gift possess'd
 these glitt'ring spoils now made the victor's gain
 he to his body suits but suits in vain
 messapus' helm he finds among the rest
 and laces on and wears the waving crest
 proud of their conquest prouder of their prey
 they leave the camp and take the ready way

 but far they had not pass'd before they spied
 three hundred horse with volscens for their guide
 the queen a legion to king turnus sent
 but the swift horse the slower foot prevent
 and now advancing sought the leader's tent
 they saw the pair for thro' the doubtful shade
 his shining helm euryalus betray'd
 on which the moon with full reflection play'd
 "'t is not for naught" cried volscens from the crowd
 "these men go there" then rais'd his voice aloud
 "stand stand why thus in arms and whither bent
 from whence to whom and on what errand sent"
 silent they scud away and haste their flight
 to neighb'ring woods and trust themselves to night
 the speedy horse all passages belay
 and spur their smoking steeds to cross their way
 and watch each entrance of the winding wood
 black was the forest thick with beech it stood
 horrid with fern and intricate with thorn
 few paths of human feet or tracks of beasts were worn
 the darkness of the shades his heavy prey
 and fear misled the younger from his way
 but nisus hit the turns with happier haste
 and thoughtless of his friend the forest pass'd
 and alban plains from alba's name so call'd
 where king latinus then his oxen stall'd
 till turning at the length he stood his ground
 and miss'd his friend and cast his eyes around
 "ah wretch" he cried "where have i left behind
 th' unhappy youth where shall i hope to find
 or what way take" again he ventures back
 and treads the mazes of his former track
 he winds the wood and list'ning hears the noise
 of tramping coursers and the riders' voice
 the sound approach'd and suddenly he view'd
 the foes inclosing and his friend pursued
 forelaid and taken while he strove in vain
 the shelter of the friendly shades to gain
 what should he next attempt what arms employ
 what fruitless force to free the captive boy
 or desperate should he rush and lose his life
 with odds oppress'd in such unequal strife

 resolv'd at length his pointed spear he shook
 and casting on the moon a mournful look
 "guardian of groves and goddess of the night
 fair queen" he said "direct my dart aright
 if e'er my pious father for my sake
 did grateful off'rings on thy altars make
 or i increas'd them with my sylvan toils
 and hung thy holy roofs with savage spoils
 give me to scatter these" then from his ear
 he pois'd and aim'd and launch'd the trembling spear
 the deadly weapon hissing from the grove
 impetuous on the back of sulmo drove
 pierc'd his thin armor drank his vital blood
 and in his body left the broken wood
 he staggers round his eyeballs roll in death
 and with short sobs he gasps away his breath
 all stand amaz'd a second jav'lin flies
 with equal strength and quivers thro' the skies
 this thro' thy temples tagus forc'd the way
 and in the brainpan warmly buried lay
 fierce volscens foams with rage and gazing round
 descried not him who gave the fatal wound
 nor knew to fix revenge "but thou" he cries
 "shalt pay for both" and at the pris'ner flies
 with his drawn sword then struck with deep despair
 that cruel sight the lover could not bear
 but from his covert rush'd in open view
 and sent his voice before him as he flew
 "me me" he cried "turn all your swords alone
 on me the fact confess'd the fault my own
 he neither could nor durst the guiltless youth
 ye moon and stars bear witness to the truth
 his only crime if friendship can offend
 is too much love to his unhappy friend"
 too late he speaks the sword which fury guides
 driv'n with full force had pierc'd his tender sides
 down fell the beauteous youth the yawning wound
 gush'd out a purple stream and stain'd the ground
 his snowy neck reclines upon his breast
 like a fair flow'r by the keen share oppress'd
 like a white poppy sinking on the plain
 whose heavy head is overcharg'd with rain
 despair and rage and vengeance justly vow'd
 drove nisus headlong on the hostile crowd
 volscens he seeks on him alone he bends
 borne back and bor'd by his surrounding friends
 onward he press'd and kept him still in sight
 then whirl'd aloft his sword with all his might
 th' unerring steel descended while he spoke
 piered his wide mouth and thro' his weazon broke
 dying he slew and stagg'ring on the plain
 with swimming eyes he sought his lover slain
 then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell
 content in death to be reveng'd so well

 o happy friends for if my verse can give
 immortal life your fame shall ever live
 fix'd as the capitol's foundation lies
 and spread where'er the roman eagle flies

 the conqu'ring party first divide the prey
 then their slain leader to the camp convey
 with wonder as they went the troops were fill'd
 to see such numbers whom so few had kill'd
 serranus rhamnes and the rest they found
 vast crowds the dying and the dead surround
 and the yet reeking blood o'erflows the ground
 all knew the helmet which messapus lost
 but mourn'd a purchase that so dear had cost
 now rose the ruddy morn from tithon's bed
 and with the dawn of day the skies o'erspread
 nor long the sun his daily course withheld
 but added colors to the world reveal'd
 when early turnus wak'ning with the light
 all clad in armor calls his troops to fight
 his martial men with fierce harangue he fir'd
 and his own ardor in their souls inspir'd
 this done to give new terror to his foes
 the heads of nisus and his friend he shows
 rais'd high on pointed spears a ghastly sight
 loud peals of shouts ensue and barbarous delight

 meantime the trojans run where danger calls
 they line their trenches and they man their walls
 in front extended to the left they stood
 safe was the right surrounded by the flood
 but casting from their tow'rs a frightful view
 they saw the faces which too well they knew
 tho' then disguis'd in death and smear'd all o'er
 with filth obscene and dropping putrid gore
 soon hasty fame thro' the sad city bears
 the mournful message to the mother's ears
 an icy cold benumbs her limbs she shakes
 her cheeks the blood her hand the web forsakes
 she runs the rampires round amidst the war
 nor fears the flying darts she rends her hair
 and fills with loud laments the liquid air
 "thus then my lov'd euryalus appears
 thus looks the prop my declining years
 was't on this face my famish'd eyes i fed
 ah how unlike the living is the dead
 and could'st thou leave me cruel thus alone
 not one kind kiss from a departing son
 no look no last adieu before he went
 in an illboding hour to slaughter sent
 cold on the ground and pressing foreign clay
 to latian dogs and fowls he lies a prey
 nor was i near to close his dying eyes
 to wash his wounds to weep his obsequies
 to call about his corpse his crying friends
 or spread the mantle made for other ends
 on his dear body which i wove with care
 nor did my daily pains or nightly labor spare
 where shall i find his corpse what earth sustains
 his trunk dismember'd and his cold remains
 for this alas i left my needful ease
 expos'd my life to winds and winter seas
 if any pity touch rutulian hearts
 here empty all your quivers all your darts
 or if they fail thou jove conclude my woe
 and send me thunderstruck to shades below"
 her shrieks and clamors pierce the trojans' ears
 unman their courage and augment their fears
 nor young ascanius could the sight sustain
 nor old ilioneus his tears restrain
 but actor and idaeus jointly sent
 to bear the madding mother to her tent

 and now the trumpets terribly from far
 with rattling clangor rouse the sleepy war
 the soldiers' shouts succeed the brazen sounds
 and heav'n from pole to pole the noise rebounds
 the volscians bear their shields upon their head
 and rushing forward form a moving shed
 these fill the ditch those pull the bulwarks down
 some raise the ladders others scale the town
 but where void spaces on the walls appear
 or thin defense they pour their forces there
 with poles and missive weapons from afar
 the trojans keep aloof the rising war
 taught by their ten years' siege defensive fight
 they roll down ribs of rocks an unresisted weight
 to break the penthouse with the pond'rous blow
 which yet the patient volscians undergo
 but could not bear th' unequal combat long
 for where the trojans find the thickest throng
 the ruin falls their shatter'd shields give way
 and their crush'd heads become an easy prey
 they shrink for fear abated of their rage
 nor longer dare in a blind fight engage
 contented now to gall them from below
 with darts and slings and with the distant bow

 elsewhere mezentius terrible to view
 a blazing pine within the trenches threw
 but brave messapus neptune's warlike son
 broke down the palisades the trenches won
 and loud for ladders calls to scale the town

 calliope begin ye sacred nine
 inspire your poet in his high design
 to sing what slaughter manly turnus made
 what souls he sent below the stygian shade
 what fame the soldiers with their captain share
 and the vast circuit of the fatal war
 for you in singing martial facts excel
 you best remember and alone can tell

 there stood a tow'r amazing to the sight
 built up of beams and of stupendous height
 art and the nature of the place conspir'd
 to furnish all the strength that war requir'd
 to level this the bold italians join
 the wary trojans obviate their design
 with weighty stones o'erwhelm their troops below
 shoot thro' the loopholes and sharp jav'lins throw
 turnus the chief toss'd from his thund'ring hand
 against the wooden walls a flaming brand
 it stuck the fiery plague the winds were high
 the planks were season'd and the timber dry
 contagion caught the posts it spread along
 scorch'd and to distance drove the scatter'd throng
 the trojans fled the fire pursued amain
 still gath'ring fast upon the trembling train
 till crowding to the corners of the wall
 down the defense and the defenders fall
 the mighty flaw makes heav'n itself resound
 the dead and dying trojans strew the ground
 the tow'r that follow'd on the fallen crew
 whelm'd o'er their heads and buried whom it slew
 some stuck upon the darts themselves had sent
 all the same equal ruin underwent

 young lycus and helenor only scape
 sav'd how they know not from the steepy leap
 helenor elder of the two by birth
 on one side royal one a son of earth
 whom to the lydian king licymnia bare
 and sent her boasted bastard to the war
 a privilege which none but freemen share
 slight were his arms a sword and silver shield
 no marks of honor charg'd its empty field
 light as he fell so light the youth arose
 and rising found himself amidst his foes
 nor flight was left nor hopes to force his way
 embolden'd by despair he stood at bay
 and like a stag whom all the troop surrounds
 of eager huntsmen and invading hounds
 resolv'd on death he dissipates his fears
 and bounds aloft against the pointed spears
 so dares the youth secure of death and throws
 his dying body on his thickest foes
 but lycus swifter of his feet by far
 runs doubles winds and turns amidst the war
 springs to the walls and leaves his foes behind
 and snatches at the beam he first can find
 looks up and leaps aloft at all the stretch
 in hopes the helping hand of some kind friend to reach
 but turnus follow'd hard his hunted prey
 his spear had almost reach'd him in the way
 short of his reins and scarce a span behind
 "fool" said the chief "tho' fleeter than the wind
 couldst thou presume to scape when i pursue"
 he said and downward by the feet he drew
 the trembling dastard at the tug he falls
 vast ruins come along rent from the smoking walls
 thus on some silver swan or tim'rous hare
 jove's bird comes sousing down from upper air
 her crooked talons truss the fearful prey
 then out of sight she soars and wings her way
 so seizes the grim wolf the tender lamb
 in vain lamented by the bleating dam

 then rushing onward with a barb'rous cry
 the troops of turnus to the combat fly
 the ditch with fagots fill'd the daring foe
 toss'd firebrands to the steepy turrets throw

 ilioneus as bold lucetius came
 to force the gate and feed the kindling flame
 roll'd down the fragment of a rock so right
 it crush'd him double underneath the weight
 two more young liger and asylas slew
 to bend the bow young liger better knew
 asylas best the pointed jav'lin threw
 brave caeneus laid ortygius on the plain
 the victor caeneus was by turnus slain
 by the same hand clonius and itys fall
 sagar and ida standing on the wall
 from capys' arms his fate privernus found
 hurt by themilla firstbut slight the wound
 his shield thrown by to mitigate the smart
 he clapp'd his hand upon the wounded part
 the second shaft came swift and unespied
 and pierc'd his hand and nail'd it to his side
 transfix'd his breathing lungs and beating heart
 the soul came issuing out and hiss'd against the dart

 the son of arcens shone amid the rest
 in glitt'ring armor and a purple vest
 fair was his face his eyes inspiring love
 bred by his father in the martian grove
 where the fat altars of palicus flame
 and send in arms to purchase early fame
 him when he spied from far the tuscan king
 laid by the lance and took him to the sling
 thrice whirl'd the thong around his head and threw
 the heated lead half melted as it flew
 it pierc'd his hollow temples and his brain
 the youth came tumbling down and spurn'd the plain

 then young ascanius who before this day
 was wont in woods to shoot the savage prey
 first bent in martial strife the twanging bow
 and exercis'd against a human foe
 with this bereft numanus of his life
 who turnus' younger sister took to wife
 proud of his realm and of his royal bride
 vaunting before his troops and lengthen'd with a stride
 in these insulting terms the trojans he defied

 "twiceconquer'd cowards now your shame is shown
 coop'd up a second time within your town
 who dare not issue forth in open field
 but hold your walls before you for a shield
 thus threat you war thus our alliance force
 what gods what madness hether steer'd your course
 you shall not find the sons of atreus here
 nor need the frauds of sly ulysses fear
 strong from the cradle of a sturdy brood
 we bear our newborn infants to the flood
 there bath'd amid the stream our boys we hold
 with winter harden'd and inur'd to cold
 they wake before the day to range the wood
 kill ere they eat nor taste unconquer'd food
 no sports but what belong to war they know
 to break the stubborn colt to bend the bow
 our youth of labor patient earn their bread
 hardly they work with frugal diet fed
 from plows and harrows sent to seek renown
 they fight in fields and storm the shaken town
 no part of life from toils of war is free
 no change in age or diff'rence in degree
 we plow and till in arms our oxen feel
 instead of goads the spur and pointed steel
 th' inverted lance makes furrows in the plain
 ev'n time that changes all yet changes us in vain
 the body not the mind nor can control
 th' immortal vigor or abate the soul
 our helms defend the young disguise the gray
 we live by plunder and delight in prey
 your vests embroider'd with rich purple shine
 in sloth you glory and in dances join
 your vests have sweeping sleeves with female pride
 your turbants underneath your chins are tied
 go phrygians to your dindymus again
 go less than women in the shapes of men
 go mix'd with eunuchs in the mother's rites
 where with unequal sound the flute invites
 sing dance and howl by turns in ida's shade
 resign the war to men who know the martial trade"

 this foul reproach ascanius could not hear
 with patience or a vow'd revenge forbear
 at the full stretch of both his hands he drew
 and almost join'd the horns of the tough yew
 but first before the throne of jove he stood
 and thus with lifted hands invok'd the god
 "my first attempt great jupiter succeed
 an annual off'ring in thy grove shall bleed
 a snowwhite steer before thy altar led
 who like his mother bears aloft his head
 butts with his threat'ning brows and bellowing stands
 and dares the fight and spurns the yellow sands"

 jove bow'd the heav'ns and lent a gracious ear
 and thunder'd on the left amidst the clear
 sounded at once the bow and swiftly flies
 the feather'd death and hisses thro' the skies
 the steel thro' both his temples forc'd the way
 extended on the ground numanus lay
 "go now vain boaster and true valor scorn
 the phrygians twice subdued yet make this third return"
 ascanius said no more the trojans shake
 the heav'ns with shouting and new vigor take

 apollo then bestrode a golden cloud
 to view the feats of arms and fighting crowd
 and thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud
 "advance illustrious youth increase in fame
 and wide from east to west extend thy name
 offspring of gods thyself and rome shall owe
 to thee a race of demigods below
 this is the way to heav'n the pow'rs divine
 from this beginning date the julian line
 to thee to them and their victorious heirs
 the conquer'd war is due and the vast world is theirs
 troy is too narrow for thy name" he said
 and plunging downward shot his radiant head
 dispell'd the breathing air that broke his flight
 shorn of his beams a man to mortal sight
 old butes' form he took anchises' squire
 now left to rule ascanius by his sire
 his wrinkled visage and his hoary hairs
 his mien his habit and his arms he wears
 and thus salutes the boy too forward for his years
 "suffice it thee thy father's worthy son
 the warlike prize thou hast already won
 the god of archers gives thy youth a part
 of his own praise nor envies equal art
 now tempt the war no more" he said and flew
 obscure in air and vanish'd from their view
 the trojans by his arms their patron know
 and hear the twanging of his heav'nly bow
 then duteous force they use and phoebus' name
 to keep from fight the youth too fond of fame
 undaunted they themselves no danger shun
 from wall to wall the shouts and clamors run
 they bend their bows they whirl their slings around
 heaps of spent arrows fall and strew the ground
 and helms and shields and rattling arms resound
 the combat thickens like the storm that flies
 from westward when the show'ry kids arise
 or patt'ring hail comes pouring on the main
 when jupiter descends in harden'd rain
 or bellowing clouds burst with a stormy sound
 and with an armed winter strew the ground

 pand'rus and bitias thunderbolts of war
 whom hiera to bold alcanor bare
 on ida's top two youths of height and size
 like firs that on their mother mountain rise
 presuming on their force the gates unbar
 and of their own accord invite the war
 with fates averse against their king's command
 arm'd on the right and on the left they stand
 and flank the passage shining steel they wear
 and waving crests above their heads appear
 thus two tall oaks that padus' banks adorn
 lift up to heav'n their leafy heads unshorn
 and overpress'd with nature's heavy load
 dance to the whistling winds and at each other nod
 in flows a tide of latians when they see
 the gate set open and the passage free
 bold quercens with rash tmarus rushing on
 equicolus that in bright armor shone
 and haemon first but soon repuls'd they fly
 or in the welldefended pass they die
 these with success are fir'd and those with rage
 and each on equal terms at length ingage
 drawn from their lines and issuing on the plain
 the trojans hand to hand the fight maintain

 fierce turnus in another quarter fought
 when suddenly th' unhop'dfor news was brought
 the foes had left the fastness of their place
 prevail'd in fight and had his men in chase
 he quits th' attack and to prevent their fate
 runs where the giant brothers guard the gate
 the first he met antiphates the brave
 but basebegotten on a theban slave
 sarpedon's son he slew the deadly dart
 found passage thro' his breast and pierc'd his heart
 fix'd in the wound th' italian cornel stood
 warm'd in his lungs and in his vital blood
 aphidnus next and erymanthus dies
 and meropes and the gigantic size
 of bitias threat'ning with his ardent eyes
 not by the feeble dart he fell oppress'd
 a dart were lost within that roomy breast
 but from a knotted lance large heavy strong
 which roar'd like thunder as it whirl'd along
 not two bull hides th' impetuous force withhold
 nor coat of double mail with scales of gold
 down sunk the monster bulk and press'd the ground
 his arms and clatt'ring shield on the vast body sound
 not with less ruin than the bajan mole
 rais'd on the seas the surges to control
 at once comes tumbling down the rocky wall
 prone to the deep the stones disjointed fall
 of the vast pile the scatter'd ocean flies
 black sands discolor'd froth and mingled mud arise
 the frighted billows roll and seek the shores
 then trembles prochyta then ischia roars
 typhoeus thrown beneath by jove's command
 astonish'd at the flaw that shakes the land
 soon shifts his weary side and scarce awake
 with wonder feels the weight press lighter on his back

 the warrior god the latian troops inspir'd
 new strung their sinews and their courage fir'd
 but chills the trojan hearts with cold affright
 then black despair precipitates their flight

 when pandarus beheld his brother kill'd
 the town with fear and wild confusion fill'd
 he turns the hinges of the heavy gate
 with both his hands and adds his shoulders to the weight
 some happier friends within the walls inclos'd
 the rest shut out to certain death expos'd
 fool as he was and frantic in his care
 t' admit young turnus and include the war
 he thrust amid the crowd securely bold
 like a fierce tiger pent amid the fold
 too late his blazing buckler they descry
 and sparkling fires that shot from either eye
 his mighty members and his ample breast
 his rattling armor and his crimson crest

 far from that hated face the trojans fly
 all but the fool who sought his destiny
 mad pandarus steps forth with vengeance vow'd
 for bitias' death and threatens thus aloud
 "these are not ardea's walls nor this the town
 amata proffers with lavinia's crown
 't is hostile earth you tread of hope bereft
 no means of safe return by flight are left"
 to whom with count'nance calm and soul sedate
 thus turnus "then begin and try thy fate
 my message to the ghost of priam bear
 tell him a new achilles sent thee there"

 a lance of tough ground ash the trojan threw
 rough in the rind and knotted as it grew
 with his full force he whirl'd it first around
 but the soft yielding air receiv'd the wound
 imperial juno turn'd the course before
 and fix'd the wand'ring weapon in the door

 "but hope not thou" said turnus "when i strike
 to shun thy fate our force is not alike
 nor thy steel temper'd by the lemnian god"
 then rising on his utmost stretch he stood
 and aim'd from high the full descending blow
 cleaves the broad front and beardless cheeks in two
 down sinks the giant with a thund'ring sound
 his pond'rous limbs oppress the trembling ground
 blood brains and foam gush from the gaping wound
 scalp face and shoulders the keen steel divides
 and the shar'd visage hangs on equal sides
 the trojans fly from their approaching fate
 and had the victor then secur'd the gate
 and to his troops without unclos'd the bars
 one lucky day had ended all his wars
 but boiling youth and blind desire of blood
 push'd on his fury to pursue the crowd
 hamstring'd behind unhappy gyges died
 then phalaris is added to his side
 the pointed jav'lins from the dead he drew
 and their friends' arms against their fellows threw
 strong halys stands in vain weak phlegys flies
 saturnia still at hand new force and fire supplies
 then halius prytanis alcander fall
 ingag'd against the foes who scal'd the wall
 but whom they fear'd without they found within
 at last tho' late by lynceus he was seen
 he calls new succors and assaults the prince
 but weak his force and vain is their defense
 turn'd to the right his sword the hero drew
 and at one blow the bold aggressor slew
 he joints the neck and with a stroke so strong
 the helm flies off and bears the head along
 next him the huntsman amycus he kill'd
 in darts invenom'd and in poison skill'd
 then clytius fell beneath his fatal spear
 and creteus whom the muses held so dear
 he fought with courage and he sung the fight
 arms were his bus'ness verses his delight

 the trojan chiefs behold with rage and grief
 their slaughter'd friends and hasten their relief
 bold mnestheus rallies first the broken train
 whom brave seresthus and his troop sustain
 to save the living and revenge the dead
 against one warrior's arms all troy they led
 "o void of sense and courage" mnestheus cried
 "where can you hope your coward heads to hide
 ah where beyond these rampires can you run
 one man and in your camp inclos'd you shun
 shall then a single sword such slaughter boast
 and pass unpunish'd from a num'rous host
 forsaking honor and renouncing fame
 your gods your country and your king you shame"
 this just reproach their virtue does excite
 they stand they join they thicken to the fight

 now turnus doubts and yet disdains to yield
 but with slow paces measures back the field
 and inches to the walls where tiber's tide
 washing the camp defends the weaker side
 the more he loses they advance the more
 and tread in ev'ry step he trod before
 they shout they bear him back and whom by might
 they cannot conquer they oppress with weight

 as compass'd with a wood of spears around
 the lordly lion still maintains his ground
 grins horrible retires and turns again
 threats his distended paws and shakes his mane
 he loses while in vain he presses on
 nor will his courage let him dare to run
 so turnus fares and unresolved of flight
 moves tardy back and just recedes from fight
 yet twice inrag'd the combat he renews
 twice breaks and twice his broken foes pursues
 but now they swarm and with fresh troops supplied
 come rolling on and rush from ev'ry side
 nor juno who sustain'd his arms before
 dares with new strength suffice th' exhausted store
 for jove with sour commands sent iris down
 to force th' invader from the frighted town

 with labor spent no longer can he wield
 the heavy fanchion or sustain the shield
 o'erwhelm'd with darts which from afar they fling
 the weapons round his hollow temples ring
 his golden helm gives way with stony blows
 batter'd and flat and beaten to his brows
 his crest is rash'd away his ample shield
 is falsified and round with jav'lins fill'd

 the foe now faint the trojans overwhelm
 and mnestheus lays hard load upon his helm
 sick sweat succeeds he drops at ev'ry pore
 with driving dust his cheeks are pasted o'er
 shorter and shorter ev'ry gasp he takes
 and vain efforts and hurtless blows he makes
 plung'd in the flood and made the waters fly
 the yellow god the welcome burthen bore
 and wip'd the sweat and wash'd away the gore
 then gently wafts him to the farther coast
 and sends him safe to cheer his anxious host




 book x

 the gates of heav'n unfold jove summons all
 the gods to council in the common hall
 sublimely seated he surveys from far
 the fields the camp the fortune of the war
 and all th' inferior world from first to last
 the sov'reign senate in degrees are plac'd

 then thus th' almighty sire began "ye gods
 natives or denizens of blest abodes
 from whence these murmurs and this change of mind
 this backward fate from what was first design'd
 why this protracted war when my commands
 pronounc'd a peace and gave the latian lands
 what fear or hope on either part divides
 our heav'ns and arms our powers on diff'rent sides
 a lawful time of war at length will come
 nor need your haste anticipate the doom
 when carthage shall contend the world with rome
 shall force the rigid rocks and alpine chains
 and like a flood come pouring on the plains
 then is your time for faction and debate
 for partial favor and permitted hate
 let now your immature dissension cease
 sit quiet and compose your souls to peace"

 thus jupiter in few unfolds the charge
 but lovely venus thus replies at large
 "o pow'r immense eternal energy
 for to what else protection can we fly
 seest thou the proud rutulians how they dare
 in fields unpunish'd and insult my care
 how lofty turnus vaunts amidst his train
 in shining arms triumphant on the plain
 ev'n in their lines and trenches they contend
 and scarce their walls the trojan troops defend
 the town is fill'd with slaughter and o'erfloats
 with a red deluge their increasing moats
 aeneas ignorant and far from thence
 has left a camp expos'd without defense
 this endless outrage shall they still sustain
 shall troy renew'd be forc'd and fir'd again
 a second siege my banish'd issue fears
 and a new diomede in arms appears
 one more audacious mortal will be found
 and i thy daughter wait another wound
 yet if with fates averse without thy leave
 the latian lands my progeny receive
 bear they the pains of violated law
 and thy protection from their aid withdraw
 but if the gods their sure success foretell
 if those of heav'n consent with those of hell
 to promise italy who dare debate
 the pow'r of jove or fix another fate
 what should i tell of tempests on the main
 of aeolus usurping neptune's reign
 of iris sent with bacchanalian heat
 t' inspire the matrons and destroy the fleet
 now juno to the stygian sky descends
 solicits hell for aid and arms the fiends
 that new example wanted yet above
 an act that well became the wife of jove
 alecto rais'd by her with rage inflames
 the peaceful bosoms of the latian dames
 imperial sway no more exalts my mind
 such hopes i had indeed while heav'n was kind
 now let my happier foes possess my place
 whom jove prefers before the trojan race
 and conquer they whom you with conquest grace
 since you can spare from all your wide command
 no spot of earth no hospitable land
 which may my wand'ring fugitives receive
 since haughty juno will not give you leave
 then father if i still may use that name
 by ruin'd troy yet smoking from the flame
 i beg you let ascanius by my care
 be freed from danger and dismiss'd the war
 inglorious let him live without a crown
 the father may be cast on coasts unknown
 struggling with fate but let me save the son
 mine is cythera mine the cyprian tow'rs
 in those recesses and those sacred bow'rs
 obscurely let him rest his right resign
 to promis'd empire and his julian line
 then carthage may th' ausonian towns destroy
 nor fear the race of a rejected boy
 what profits it my son to scape the fire
 arm'd with his gods and loaded with his sire
 to pass the perils of the seas and wind
 evade the greeks and leave the war behind
 to reach th' italian shores if after all
 our second pergamus is doom'd to fall
 much better had he curb'd his high desires
 and hover'd o'er his illextinguish'd fires
 to simois' banks the fugitives restore
 and give them back to war and all the woes before"

 deep indignation swell'd saturnia's heart
 "and must i own" she said "my secret smart
 what with more decence were in silence kept
 and but for this unjust reproach had slept
 did god or man your fav'rite son advise
 with war unhop'd the latians to surprise
 by fate you boast and by the gods' decree
 he left his native land for italy
 confess the truth by mad cassandra more
 than heav'n inspir'd he sought a foreign shore
 did i persuade to trust his second troy
 to the raw conduct of a beardless boy
 with walls unfinish'd which himself forsakes
 and thro' the waves a wand'ring voyage takes
 when have i urg'd him meanly to demand
 the tuscan aid and arm a quiet land
 did i or iris give this mad advice
 or made the fool himself the fatal choice
 you think it hard the latians should destroy
 with swords your trojans and with fires your troy
 hard and unjust indeed for men to draw
 their native air nor take a foreign law
 that turnus is permitted still to live
 to whom his birth a god and goddess give
 but yet is just and lawful for your line
 to drive their fields and force with fraud to join
 realms not your own among your clans divide
 and from the bridegroom tear the promis'd bride
 petition while you public arms prepare
 pretend a peace and yet provoke a war
 't was giv'n to you your darling son to shroud
 to draw the dastard from the fighting crowd
 and for a man obtend an empty cloud
 from flaming fleets you turn'd the fire away
 and chang'd the ships to daughters of the sea
 but is my crime the queen of heav'n offends
 if she presume to save her suff'ring friends
 your son not knowing what his foes decree
 you say is absent absent let him be
 yours is cythera yours the cyprian tow'rs
 the soft recesses and the sacred bow'rs
 why do you then these needless arms prepare
 and thus provoke a people prone to war
 did i with fire the trojan town deface
 or hinder from return your exil'd race
 was i the cause of mischief or the man
 whose lawless lust the fatal war began
 think on whose faith th' adult'rous youth relied
 who promis'd who procur'd the spartan bride
 when all th' united states of greece combin'd
 to purge the world of the perfidious kind
 then was your time to fear the trojan fate
 your quarrels and complaints are now too late"

 thus juno murmurs rise with mix'd applause
 just as they favor or dislike the cause
 so winds when yet unfledg'd in woods they lie
 in whispers first their tender voices try
 then issue on the main with bellowing rage
 and storms to trembling mariners presage

 then thus to both replied th' imperial god
 who shakes heav'n's axles with his awful nod
 when he begins the silent senate stand
 with rev'rence list'ning to the dread command
 the clouds dispel the winds their breath restrain
 and the hush'd waves lie flatted on the main
 "celestials your attentive ears incline
 since" said the god "the trojans must not join
 in wish'd alliance with the latian line
 since endless jarrings and immortal hate
 tend but to discompose our happy state
 the war henceforward be resign'd to fate
 each to his proper fortune stand or fall
 equal and unconcern'd i look on all
 rutulians trojans are the same to me
 and both shall draw the lots their fates decree
 let these assault if fortune be their friend
 and if she favors those let those defend
 the fates will find their way" the thund'rer said
 and shook the sacred honors of his head
 attesting styx th' inviolable flood
 and the black regions of his brother god
 trembled the poles of heav'n and earth confess'd the nod
 this end the sessions had the senate rise
 and to his palace wait their sov'reign thro' the skies

 meantime intent upon their siege the foes
 within their walls the trojan host inclose
 they wound they kill they watch at ev'ry gate
 renew the fires and urge their happy fate

 th' aeneans wish in vain their wanted chief
 hopeless of flight more hopeless of relief
 thin on the tow'rs they stand and ev'n those few
 a feeble fainting and dejected crew
 yet in the face of danger some there stood
 the two bold brothers of sarpedon's blood
 asius and acmon both th' assaraci
 young haemon and tho' young resolv'd to die
 with these were clarus and thymoetes join'd
 tibris and castor both of lycian kind
 from acmon's hands a rolling stone there came
 so large it half deserv'd a mountain's name
 strongsinew'd was the youth and big of bone
 his brother mnestheus could not more have done
 or the great father of th' intrepid son
 some firebrands throw some flights of arrows send
 and some with darts and some with stones defend

 amid the press appears the beauteous boy
 the care of venus and the hope of troy
 his lovely face unarm'd his head was bare
 in ringlets o'er his shoulders hung his hair
 his forehead circled with a diadem
 distinguish'd from the crowd he shines a gem
 enchas'd in gold or polish'd iv'ry set
 amidst the meaner foil of sable jet

 nor ismarus was wanting to the war
 directing pointed arrows from afar
 and death with poison arm'd in lydia born
 where plenteous harvests the fat fields adorn
 where proud pactolus floats the fruitful lands
 and leaves a rich manure of golden sands
 there capys author of the capuan name
 and there was mnestheus too increas'd in fame
 since turnus from the camp he cast with shame

 thus mortal war was wag'd on either side
 meantime the hero cuts the nightly tide
 for anxious from evander when he went
 he sought the tyrrhene camp and tarchon's tent
 expos'd the cause of coming to the chief
 his name and country told and ask'd relief
 propos'd the terms his own small strength declar'd
 what vengeance proud mezentius had prepar'd
 what turnus bold and violent design'd
 then shew'd the slipp'ry state of humankind
 and fickle fortune warn'd him to beware
 and to his wholesome counsel added pray'r
 tarchon without delay the treaty signs
 and to the trojan troops the tuscan joins

 they soon set sail nor now the fates withstand
 their forces trusted with a foreign hand
 aeneas leads upon his stern appear
 two lions carv'd which rising ida bear
 ida to wand'ring trojans ever dear
 under their grateful shade aeneas sate
 revolving war's events and various fate
 his left young pallas kept fix'd to his side
 and oft of winds enquir'd and of the tide
 oft of the stars and of their wat'ry way
 and what he suffer'd both by land and sea

 now sacred sisters open all your spring
 the tuscan leaders and their army sing
 which follow'd great aeneas to the war
 their arms their numbers and their names declare

 a thousand youths brave massicus obey
 borne in the tiger thro' the foaming sea
 from asium brought and cosa by his care
 for arms light quivers bows and shafts they bear
 fierce abas next his men bright armor wore
 his stern apollo's golden statue bore
 six hundred populonia sent along
 all skill'd in martial exercise and strong
 three hundred more for battle ilva joins
 an isle renown'd for steel and unexhausted mines
 asylas on his prow the third appears
 who heav'n interprets and the wand'ring stars
 from offer'd entrails prodigies expounds
 and peals of thunder with presaging sounds
 a thousand spears in warlike order stand
 sent by the pisans under his command

 fair astur follows in the wat'ry field
 proud of his manag'd horse and painted shield
 gravisca noisome from the neighb'ring fen
 and his own caere sent three hundred men
 with those which minio's fields and pyrgi gave
 all bred in arms unanimous and brave

 thou muse the name of cinyras renew
 and brave cupavo follow'd but by few
 whose helm confess'd the lineage of the man
 and bore with wings display'd a silver swan
 love was the fault of his fam'd ancestry
 whose forms and fortunes in his ensigns fly
 for cycnus lov'd unhappy phaeton
 and sung his loss in poplar groves alone
 beneath the sister shades to soothe his grief
 heav'n heard his song and hasten'd his relief
 and chang'd to snowy plumes his hoary hair
 and wing'd his flight to chant aloft in air
 his son cupavo brush'd the briny flood
 upon his stern a brawny centaur stood
 who heav'd a rock and threat'ning still to throw
 with lifted hands alarm'd the seas below
 they seem'd to fear the formidable sight
 and roll'd their billows on to speed his flight

 ocnus was next who led his native train
 of hardy warriors thro' the wat'ry plain
 the son of manto by the tuscan stream
 from whence the mantuan town derives the name
 an ancient city but of mix'd descent
 three sev'ral tribes compose the government
 four towns are under each but all obey
 the mantuan laws and own the tuscan sway

 hate to mezentius arm'd five hundred more
 whom mincius from his sire benacus bore
 mincius with wreaths of reeds his forehead cover'd o'er
 these grave auletes leads a hundred sweep
 with stretching oars at once the glassy deep
 him and his martial train the triton bears
 high on his poop the seagreen god appears
 frowning he seems his crooked shell to sound
 and at the blast the billows dance around
 a hairy man above the waist he shows
 a porpoise tail beneath his belly grows
 and ends a fish his breast the waves divides
 and froth and foam augment the murm'ring tides

 full thirty ships transport the chosen train
 for troy's relief and scour the briny main

 now was the world forsaken by the sun
 and phoebe half her nightly race had run
 the careful chief who never clos'd his eyes
 himself the rudder holds the sails supplies
 a choir of nereids meet him on the flood
 once his own galleys hewn from ida's wood
 but now as many nymphs the sea they sweep
 as rode before tall vessels on the deep
 they know him from afar and in a ring
 inclose the ship that bore the trojan king
 cymodoce whose voice excell'd the rest
 above the waves advanc'd her snowy breast
 her right hand stops the stern her left divides
 the curling ocean and corrects the tides
 she spoke for all the choir and thus began
 with pleasing words to warn th' unknowing man
 "sleeps our lov'd lord o goddessborn awake
 spread ev'ry sail pursue your wat'ry track
 and haste your course your navy once were we
 from ida's height descending to the sea
 till turnus as at anchor fix'd we stood
 presum'd to violate our holy wood
 then loos'd from shore we fled his fires profane
 unwillingly we broke our master's chain
 and since have sought you thro' the tuscan main
 the mighty mother chang'd our forms to these
 and gave us life immortal in the seas
 but young ascanius in his camp distress'd
 by your insulting foes is hardly press'd
 th' arcadian horsemen and etrurian host
 advance in order on the latian coast
 to cut their way the daunian chief designs
 before their troops can reach the trojan lines
 thou when the rosy morn restores the light
 first arm thy soldiers for th' ensuing fight
 thyself the fated sword of vulcan wield
 and bear aloft th' impenetrable shield
 tomorrow's sun unless my skill be vain
 shall see huge heaps of foes in battle slain"
 parting she spoke and with immortal force
 push'd on the vessel in her wat'ry course
 for well she knew the way impell'd behind
 the ship flew forward and outstripp'd the wind
 the rest make up unknowing of the cause
 the chief admires their speed and happy omens draws

 then thus he pray'd and fix'd on heav'n his eyes
 "hear thou great mother of the deities
 with turrets crown'd on ida's holy hill
 fierce tigers rein'd and curb'd obey thy will
 firm thy own omens lead us on to fight
 and let thy phrygians conquer in thy right"

 he said no more and now renewing day
 had chas'd the shadows of the night away
 he charg'd the soldiers with preventing care
 their flags to follow and their arms prepare
 warn'd of th' ensuing fight and bade 'em hope the war
 now his lofty poop he view'd below
 his camp incompass'd and th' inclosing foe
 his blazing shield imbrac'd he held on high
 the camp receive the sign and with loud shouts reply
 hope arms their courage from their tow'rs they throw
 their darts with double force and drive the foe
 thus at the signal giv'n the cranes arise
 before the stormy south and blacken all the skies

 king turnus wonder'd at the fight renew'd
 till looking back the trojan fleet he view'd
 the seas with swelling canvas cover'd o'er
 and the swift ships descending on the shore
 the latians saw from far with dazzled eyes
 the radiant crest that seem'd in flames to rise
 and dart diffusive fires around the field
 and the keen glitt'ring of the golden shield
 thus threat'ning comets when by night they rise
 shoot sanguine streams and sadden all the skies
 so sirius flashing forth sinister lights
 pale humankind with plagues and with dry famine fright

 yet turnus with undaunted mind is bent
 to man the shores and hinder their descent
 and thus awakes the courage of his friends
 "what you so long have wish'd kind fortune sends
 in ardent arms to meet th' invading foe
 you find and find him at advantage now
 yours is the day you need but only dare
 your swords will make you masters of the war
 your sires your sons your houses and your lands
 and dearest wifes are all within your hands
 be mindful of the race from whence you came
 and emulate in arms your fathers' fame
 now take the time while stagg'ring yet they stand
 with feet unfirm and prepossess the strand
 fortune befriends the bold" nor more he said
 but balanc'd whom to leave and whom to lead
 then these elects the landing to prevent
 and those he leaves to keep the city pent

 meantime the trojan sends his troops ashore
 some are by boats expos'd by bridges more
 with lab'ring oars they bear along the strand
 where the tide languishes and leap aland
 tarchon observes the coast with careful eyes
 and where no ford he finds no water fries
 nor billows with unequal murmurs roar
 but smoothly slide along and swell the shore
 that course he steer'd and thus he gave command
 "here ply your oars and at all hazard land
 force on the vessel that her keel may wound
 this hated soil and furrow hostile ground
 let me securely land i ask no more
 then sink my ships or shatter on the shore"

 this fiery speech inflames his fearful friends
 they tug at ev'ry oar and ev'ry stretcher bends
 they run their ships aground the vessels knock
 thus forc'd ashore and tremble with the shock
 tarchon's alone was lost that stranded stood
 stuck on a bank and beaten by the flood
 she breaks her back the loosen'd sides give way
 and plunge the tuscan soldiers in the sea
 their broken oars and floating planks withstand
 their passage while they labor to the land
 and ebbing tides bear back upon th' uncertain sand

 now turnus leads his troops without delay
 advancing to the margin of the sea
 the trumpets sound aeneas first assail'd
 the clowns newrais'd and raw and soon prevail'd
 great theron fell an omen of the fight
 great theron large of limbs of giant height
 he first in open field defied the prince
 but armor scal'd with gold was no defense
 against the fated sword which open'd wide
 his plated shield and pierc'd his naked side
 next lichas fell who not like others born
 was from his wretched mother ripp'd and torn
 sacred o phoebus from his birth to thee
 for his beginning life from biting steel was free
 not far from him was gyas laid along
 of monstrous bulk with cisseus fierce and strong
 vain bulk and strength for when the chief assail'd
 nor valor nor herculean arms avail'd
 nor their fam'd father wont in war to go
 with great alcides while he toil'd below
 the noisy pharos next receiv'd his death
 aeneas writh'd his dart and stopp'd his bawling breath
 then wretched cydon had receiv'd his doom
 who courted clytius in his beardless bloom
 and sought with lust obscene polluted joys
 the trojan sword had curd his love of boys
 had not his sev'n bold brethren stopp'd the course
 of the fierce champions with united force
 sev'n darts were thrown at once and some rebound
 from his bright shield some on his helmet sound
 the rest had reach'd him but his mother's care
 prevented those and turn'd aside in air

 the prince then call'd achates to supply
 the spears that knew the way to victory
 "those fatal weapons which inur'd to blood
 in grecian bodies under ilium stood
 not one of those my hand shall toss in vain
 against our foes on this contended plain"
 he said then seiz'd a mighty spear and threw
 which wing'd with fate thro' maeon's buckler flew
 pierc'd all the brazen plates and reach'd his heart
 he stagger'd with intolerable smart
 alcanor saw and reach'd but reach'd in vain
 his helping hand his brother to sustain
 a second spear which kept the former course
 from the same hand and sent with equal force
 his right arm pierc'd and holding on bereft
 his use of both and pinion'd down his left
 then numitor from his dead brother drew
 th' illomen'd spear and at the trojan threw
 preventing fate directs the lance awry
 which glancing only mark'd achates' thigh

 in pride of youth the sabine clausus came
 and from afar at dryops took his aim
 the spear flew hissing thro' the middle space
 and pierc'd his throat directed at his face
 it stopp'd at once the passage of his wind
 and the free soul to flitting air resign'd
 his forehead was the first that struck the ground
 lifeblood and life rush'd mingled thro' the wound
 he slew three brothers of the borean race
 and three whom ismarus their native place
 had sent to war but all the sons of thrace
 halesus next the bold aurunci leads
 the son of neptune to his aid succeeds
 conspicuous on his horse on either hand
 these fight to keep and those to win the land
 with mutual blood th' ausonian soil is dyed
 while on its borders each their claim decide
 as wintry winds contending in the sky
 with equal force of lungs their titles try
 they rage they roar the doubtful rack of heav'n
 stands without motion and the tide undriv'n
 each bent to conquer neither side to yield
 they long suspend the fortune of the field
 both armies thus perform what courage can
 foot set to foot and mingled man to man

 but in another part th' arcadian horse
 with ill success ingage the latin force
 for where th' impetuous torrent rushing down
 huge craggy stones and rooted trees had thrown
 they left their coursers and unus'd to fight
 on foot were scatter'd in a shameful flight
 pallas who with disdain and grief had view'd
 his foes pursuing and his friends pursued
 us'd threat'nings mix'd with pray'rs his last resource
 with these to move their minds with those to fire their force
 "which way companions whether would you run
 by you yourselves and mighty battles won
 by my great sire by his establish'd name
 and early promise of my future fame
 by my youth emulous of equal right
 to share his honors shun ignoble flight
 trust not your feet your hands must hew way
 thro' yon black body and that thick array
 't is thro' that forward path that we must come
 there lies our way and that our passage home
 nor pow'rs above nor destinies below
 oppress our arms with equal strength we go
 with mortal hands to meet a mortal foe
 see on what foot we stand a scanty shore
 the sea behind our enemies before
 no passage left unless we swim the main
 or forcing these the trojan trenches gain"
 this said he strode with eager haste along
 and bore amidst the thickest of the throng
 lagus the first he met with fate to foe
 had heav'd a stone of mighty weight to throw
 stooping the spear descended on his chine
 just where the bone distinguished either loin
 it stuck so fast so deeply buried lay
 that scarce the victor forc'd the steel away
 hisbon came on but while he mov'd too slow
 to wish'd revenge the prince prevents his blow
 for warding his at once at once he press'd
 and plung'd the fatal weapon in his breast
 then lewd anchemolus he laid in dust
 who stain'd his stepdam's bed with impious lust
 and after him the daucian twins were slain
 laris and thymbrus on the latian plain
 so wondrous like in feature shape and size
 as caus'd an error in their parents' eyes
 grateful mistake but soon the sword decides
 the nice distinction and their fate divides
 for thymbrus' head was lopp'd and laris' hand
 dismember'd sought its owner on the strand
 the trembling fingers yet the fauchion strain
 and threaten still th' intended stroke in vain

 now to renew the charge th' arcadians came
 sight of such acts and sense of honest shame
 and grief with anger mix'd their minds inflame
 then with a casual blow was rhoeteus slain
 who chanc'd as pallas threw to cross the plain
 the flying spear was after ilus sent
 but rhoeteus happen'd on a death unmeant
 from teuthras and from tyres while he fled
 the lance athwart his body laid him dead
 roll'd from his chariot with a mortal wound
 and intercepted fate he spurn'd the ground
 as when in summer welcome winds arise
 the watchful shepherd to the forest flies
 and fires the midmost plants contagion spreads
 and catching flames infect the neighb'ring heads
 around the forest flies the furious blast
 and all the leafy nation sinks at last
 and vulcan rides in triumph o'er the waste
 the pastor pleas'd with his dire victory
 beholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the sky
 so pallas' troops their scatter'd strength unite
 and pouring on their foes their prince delight

 halesus came fierce with desire of blood
 but first collected in his arms he stood
 advancing then he plied the spear so well
 ladon demodocus and pheres fell
 around his head he toss'd his glitt'ring brand
 and from strymonius hew'd his better hand
 held up to guard his throat then hurl'd a stone
 at thoas' ample front and pierc'd the bone
 it struck beneath the space of either eye
 and blood and mingled brains together fly
 deep skill'd in future fates halesus' sire
 did with the youth to lonely groves retire
 but when the father's mortal race was run
 dire destiny laid hold upon the son
 and haul'd him to the war to find beneath
 th' evandrian spear a memorable death
 pallas th' encounter seeks but ere he throws
 to tuscan tiber thus address'd his vows
 "o sacred stream direct my flying dart
 and give to pass the proud halesus' heart
 his arms and spoils thy holy oak shall bear"
 pleas'd with the bribe the god receiv'd his pray'r
 for while his shield protects a friend distress'd
 the dart came driving on and pierc'd his breast

 but lausus no small portion of the war
 permits not panic fear to reign too far
 caus'd by the death of so renown'd a knight
 but by his own example cheers the fight
 fierce abas first he slew abas the stay
 of trojan hopes and hindrance of the day
 the phrygian troops escap'd the greeks in vain
 they and their mix'd allies now load the plain
 to the rude shock of war both armies came
 their leaders equal and their strength the same
 the rear so press'd the front they could not wield
 their angry weapons to dispute the field
 here pallas urges on and lausus there
 of equal youth and beauty both appear
 but both by fate forbid to breathe their native air
 their congress in the field great jove withstands
 both doom'd to fall but fall by greater hands

 meantime juturna warns the daunian chief
 of lausus' danger urging swift relief
 with his driv'n chariot he divides the crowd
 and making to his friends thus calls aloud
 "let none presume his needless aid to join
 retire and clear the field the fight is mine
 to this right hand is pallas only due
 o were his father here my just revenge to view"
 from the forbidden space his men retir'd
 pallas their awe and his stern words admir'd
 survey'd him o'er and o'er with wond'ring sight
 struck with his haughty mien and tow'ring height
 then to the king "your empty vaunts forbear
 success i hope and fate i cannot fear
 alive or dead i shall deserve a name
 jove is impartial and to both the same"
 he said and to the void advanc'd his pace
 pale horror sate on each arcadian face
 then turnus from his chariot leaping light
 address'd himself on foot to single fight
 and as a lion when he spies from far
 a bull that seems to meditate the war
 bending his neck and spurning back the sand
 runs roaring downward from his hilly stand
 imagine eager turnus not more slow
 to rush from high on his unequal foe

 young pallas when he saw the chief advance
 within due distance of his flying lance
 prepares to charge him first resolv'd to try
 if fortune would his want of force supply
 and thus to heav'n and hercules address'd
 "alcides once on earth evander's guest
 his son adjures you by those holy rites
 that hospitable board those genial nights
 assist my great attempt to gain this prize
 and let proud turnus view with dying eyes
 his ravish'd spoils" 't was heard the vain request
 alcides mourn'd and stifled sighs within his breast
 then jove to soothe his sorrow thus began
 "short bounds of life are set to mortal man
 't is virtue's work alone to stretch the narrow span
 so many sons of gods in bloody fight
 around the walls of troy have lost the light
 my own sarpedon fell beneath his foe
 nor i his mighty sire could ward the blow
 ev'n turnus shortly shall resign his breath
 and stands already on the verge of death"
 this said the god permits the fatal fight
 but from the latian fields averts his sight

 now with full force his spear young pallas threw
 and having thrown his shining fauchion drew
 the steel just graz'd along the shoulder joint
 and mark'd it slightly with the glancing point
 fierce turnus first to nearer distance drew
 and pois'd his pointed spear before he threw
 then as the winged weapon whizz'd along
 "see now" said he "whose arm is better strung"
 the spear kept on the fatal course unstay'd
 by plates of ir'n which o'er the shield were laid
 thro' folded brass and tough bull hides it pass'd
 his corslet pierc'd and reach'd his heart at last
 in vain the youth tugs at the broken wood
 the soul comes issuing with the vital blood
 he falls his arms upon his body sound
 and with his bloody teeth he bites the ground

 turnus bestrode the corpse "arcadians hear"
 said he "my message to your master bear
 such as the sire deserv'd the son i send
 it costs him dear to be the phrygians' friend
 the lifeless body tell him i bestow
 unask'd to rest his wand'ring ghost below"
 he said and trampled down with all the force
 of his left foot and spurn'd the wretched corse
 then snatch'd the shining belt with gold inlaid
 the belt eurytion's artful hands had made
 where fifty fatal brides express'd to sight
 all in the compass of one mournful night
 depriv'd their bridegrooms of returning light

 in an ill hour insulting turnus tore
 those golden spoils and in a worse he wore
 o mortals blind in fate who never know
 to bear high fortune or endure the low
 the time shall come when turnus but in vain
 shall wish untouch'd the trophies of the slain
 shall wish the fatal belt were far away
 and curse the dire remembrance of the day

 the sad arcadians from th' unhappy field
 bear back the breathless body on a shield
 o grace and grief of war at once restor'd
 with praises to thy sire at once deplor'd
 one day first sent thee to the fighting field
 beheld whole heaps of foes in battle kill'd
 one day beheld thee dead and borne upon thy shield
 this dismal news not from uncertain fame
 but sad spectators to the hero came
 his friends upon the brink of ruin stand
 unless reliev'd by his victorious hand
 he whirls his sword around without delay
 and hews thro' adverse foes an ample way
 to find fierce turnus of his conquest proud
 evander pallas all that friendship ow'd
 to large deserts are present to his eyes
 his plighted hand and hospitable ties

 four sons of sulmo four whom ufens bred
 he took in fight and living victims led
 to please the ghost of pallas and expire
 in sacrifice before his fun'ral fire
 at magus next he threw he stoop'd below
 the flying spear and shunn'd the promis'd blow
 then creeping clasp'd the hero's knees and pray'd
 "by young iulus by thy father's shade
 o spare my life and send me back to see
 my longing sire and tender progeny
 a lofty house i have and wealth untold
 in silver ingots and in bars of gold
 all these and sums besides which see no day
 the ransom of this one poor life shall pay
 if i survive will troy the less prevail
 a single soul's too light to turn the scale"
 he said the hero sternly thus replied
 "thy bars and ingots and the sums beside
 leave for thy children's lot thy turnus broke
 all rules of war by one relentless stroke
 when pallas fell so deems nor deems alone
 my father's shadow but my living son"
 thus having said of kind remorse bereft
 he seiz'd his helm and dragg'd him with his left
 then with his right hand while his neck he wreath'd
 up to the hilts his shining fauchion sheath'd

 apollo's priest emonides was near
 his holy fillets on his front appear
 glitt'ring in arms he shone amidst the crowd
 much of his god more of his purple proud
 him the fierce trojan follow'd thro' the field
 the holy coward fell and forc'd to yield
 the prince stood o'er the priest and at one blow
 sent him an off'ring to the shades below
 his arms seresthus on his shoulders bears
 design'd a trophy to the god of wars

 vulcanian caeculus renews the fight
 and umbro born upon the mountains' height
 the champion cheers his troops t' encounter those
 and seeks revenge himself on other foes
 at anxur's shield he drove and at the blow
 both shield and arm to ground together go
 anxur had boasted much of magic charms
 and thought he wore impenetrable arms
 so made by mutter'd spells and from the spheres
 had life secur'd in vain for length of years
 then tarquitus the field in triumph trod
 a nymph his mother his sire a god
 exulting in bright arms he braves the prince
 with his protended lance he makes defense
 bears back his feeble foe then pressing on
 arrests his better hand and drags him down
 stands o'er the prostrate wretch and as he lay
 vain tales inventing and prepar'd to pray
 mows off his head the trunk a moment stood
 then sunk and roll'd along the sand in blood
 the vengeful victor thus upbraids the slain
 "lie there proud man unpitied on the plain
 lie there inglorious and without a tomb
 far from thy mother and thy native home
 exposed to savage beasts and birds of prey
 or thrown for food to monsters of the sea"

 on lycas and antaeus next he ran
 two chiefs of turnus and who led his van
 they fled for fear with these he chas'd along
 camers the yellowlock'd and numa strong
 both great in arms and both were fair and young
 camers was son to volscens lately slain
 in wealth surpassing all the latian train
 and in amycla fix'd his silent easy reign
 and as aegaeon when with heav'n he strove
 stood opposite in arms to mighty jove
 mov'd all his hundred hands provok'd the war
 defied the forky lightning from afar
 at fifty mouths his flaming breath expires
 and flash for flash returns and fires for fires
 in his right hand as many swords he wields
 and takes the thunder on as many shields
 with strength like his the trojan hero stood
 and soon the fields with falling corps were strow'd
 when once his fauchion found the taste of blood
 with fury scarce to be conceiv'd he flew
 against niphaeus whom four coursers drew
 they when they see the fiery chief advance
 and pushing at their chests his pointed lance
 wheel'd with so swift a motion mad with fear
 they threw their master headlong from the chair
 they stare they start nor stop their course before
 they bear the bounding chariot to the shore

 now lucagus and liger scour the plains
 with two white steeds but liger holds the reins
 and lucagus the lofty seat maintains
 bold brethren both the former wav'd in air
 his flaming sword aeneas couch'd his spear
 unus'd to threats and more unus'd to fear
 then liger thus "thy confidence is vain
 to scape from hence as from the trojan plain
 nor these the steeds which diomede bestrode
 nor this the chariot where achilles rode
 nor venus' veil is here near neptune's shield
 thy fatal hour is come and this the field"
 thus liger vainly vaunts the trojan peer
 return'd his answer with his flying spear
 as lucagus to lash his horses bends
 prone to the wheels and his left foot protends
 prepar'd for fight the fatal dart arrives
 and thro' the borders of his buckler drives
 pass'd thro' and pierc'd his groin the deadly wound
 cast from his chariot roll'd him on the ground
 whom thus the chief upbraids with scornful spite
 "blame not the slowness of your steeds in flight
 vain shadows did not force their swift retreat
 but you yourself forsake your empty seat"
 he said and seiz'd at once the loosen'd rein
 for liger lay already on the plain
 by the same shock then stretching out his hands
 the recreant thus his wretched life demands
 "now by thyself o more than mortal man
 by her and him from whom thy breath began
 who form'd thee thus divine i beg thee spare
 this forfeit life and hear thy suppliant's pray'r"
 thus much he spoke and more he would have said
 but the stern hero turn'd aside his head
 and cut him short "i hear another man
 you talk'd not thus before the fight began
 now take your turn and as a brother should
 attend your brother to the stygian flood"
 then thro' his breast his fatal sword he sent
 and the soul issued at the gaping vent

 as storms the skies and torrents tear the ground
 thus rag'd the prince and scatter'd deaths around
 at length ascanius and the trojan train
 broke from the camp so long besieg'd in vain

 meantime the king of gods and mortal man
 held conference with his queen and thus began
 "my sister goddess and wellpleasing wife
 still think you venus' aid supports the strife
 sustains her trojans or themselves alone
 with inborn valor force their fortune on
 how fierce in fight with courage undecay'd
 judge if such warriors want immortal aid"
 to whom the goddess with the charming eyes
 soft in her tone submissively replies
 "why o my sov'reign lord whose frown i fear
 and cannot unconcern'd your anger bear
 why urge you thus my grief when if i still
 as once i was were mistress of your will
 from your almighty pow'r your pleasing wife
 might gain the grace of length'ning turnus' life
 securely snatch him from the fatal fight
 and give him to his aged father's sight
 now let him perish since you hold it good
 and glut the trojans with his pious blood
 yet from our lineage he derives his name
 and in the fourth degree from god pilumnus came
 yet he devoutly pays you rites divine
 and offers daily incense at your shrine"

 then shortly thus the sov'reign god replied
 "since in my pow'r and goodness you confide
 if for a little space a lengthen'd span
 you beg reprieve for this expiring man
 i grant you leave to take your turnus hence
 from instant fate and can so far dispense
 but if some secret meaning lies beneath
 to save the shortliv'd youth from destin'd death
 or if a farther thought you entertain
 to change the fates you feed your hopes in vain"
 to whom the goddess thus with weeping eyes
 "and what if that request your tongue denies
 your heart should grant and not a short reprieve
 but length of certain life to turnus give
 now speedy death attends the guiltless youth
 if my presaging soul divines with truth
 which o i wish might err thro' causeless fears
 and you for you have pow'r prolong his years"

 thus having said involv'd in clouds she flies
 and drives a storm before her thro' the skies
 swift she descends alighting on the plain
 where the fierce foes a dubious fight maintain
 of air condens'd a specter soon she made
 and what aeneas was such seem'd the shade
 adorn'd with dardan arms the phantom bore
 his head aloft a plumy crest he wore
 this hand appear'd a shining sword to wield
 and that sustain'd an imitated shield
 with manly mien he stalk'd along the ground
 nor wanted voice belied nor vaunting sound
 thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight
 or dreadful visions in our dreams by night
 the specter seems the daunian chief to dare
 and flourishes his empty sword in air
 at this advancing turnus hurl'd his spear
 the phantom wheel'd and seem'd to fly for fear
 deluded turnus thought the trojan fled
 and with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed
 "whether o coward" thus he calls aloud
 nor found he spoke to wind and chas'd a cloud
 "why thus forsake your bride receive from me
 the fated land you sought so long by sea"
 he said and brandishing at once his blade
 with eager pace pursued the flying shade
 by chance a ship was fasten'd to the shore
 which from old clusium king osinius bore
 the plank was ready laid for safe ascent
 for shelter there the trembling shadow bent
 and skipp't and skulk'd and under hatches went
 exulting turnus with regardless haste
 ascends the plank and to the galley pass'd
 scarce had he reach'd the prow saturnia's hand
 the haulsers cuts and shoots the ship from land
 with wind in poop the vessel plows the sea
 and measures back with speed her former way
 meantime aeneas seeks his absent foe
 and sends his slaughter'd troops to shades below

 the guileful phantom now forsook the shroud
 and flew sublime and vanish'd in a cloud
 too late young turnus the delusion found
 far on the sea still making from the ground
 then thankless for a life redeem'd by shame
 with sense of honor stung and forfeit fame
 fearful besides of what in fight had pass'd
 his hands and haggard eyes to heav'n he cast
 "o jove" he cried "for what offense have
 deserv'd to bear this endless infamy
 whence am i forc'd and whether am i borne
 how and with what reproach shall i return
 shall ever i behold the latian plain
 or see laurentum's lofty tow'rs again
 what will they say of their deserting chief
 the war was mine i fly from their relief
 i led to slaughter and in slaughter leave
 and ev'n from hence their dying groans receive
 here overmatch'd in fight in heaps they lie
 there scatter'd o'er the fields ignobly fly
 gape wide o earth and draw me down alive
 or o ye pitying winds a wretch relieve
 on sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive
 or set me shipwrack'd on some desart shore
 where no rutulian eyes may see me more
 unknown to friends or foes or conscious fame
 lest she should follow and my flight proclaim"

 thus turnus rav'd and various fates revolv'd
 the choice was doubtful but the death resolv'd
 and now the sword and now the sea took place
 that to revenge and this to purge disgrace
 sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main
 by stretch of arms the distant shore to gain
 thrice he the sword assay'd and thrice the flood
 but juno mov'd with pity both withstood
 and thrice repress'd his rage strong gales supplied
 and push'd the vessel o'er the swelling tide
 at length she lands him on his native shores
 and to his father's longing arms restores

 meantime by jove's impulse mezentius arm'd
 succeeding turnus with his ardor warm'd
 his fainting friends reproach'd their shameful flight
 repell'd the victors and renew'd the fight
 against their king the tuscan troops conspire
 such is their hate and such their fierce desire
 of wish'd revenge on him and him alone
 all hands employ'd and all their darts are thrown
 he like a solid rock by seas inclos'd
 to raging winds and roaring waves oppos'd
 from his proud summit looking down disdains
 their empty menace and unmov'd remains

 beneath his feet fell haughty hebrus dead
 then latagus and palmus as he fled
 at latagus a weighty stone he flung
 his face was flatted and his helmet rung
 but palmus from behind receives his wound
 hamstring'd he falls and grovels on the ground
 his crest and armor from his body torn
 thy shoulders lausus and thy head adorn
 evas and mimas both of troy he slew
 mimas his birth from fair theano drew
 born on that fatal night when big with fire
 the queen produc'd young paris to his sire
 but paris in the phrygian fields was slain
 unthinking mimas on the latian plain

 and as a savage boar on mountains bred
 with forest mast and fatt'ning marshes fed
 when once he sees himself in toils inclos'd
 by huntsmen and their eager hounds oppos'd
 he whets his tusks and turns and dares the war
 th' invaders dart their jav'lins from afar
 all keep aloof and safely shout around
 but none presumes to give a nearer wound
 he frets and froths erects his bristled hide
 and shakes a grove of lances from his side
 not otherwise the troops with hate inspir'd
 and just revenge against the tyrant fir'd
 their darts with clamor at a distance drive
 and only keep the languish'd war alive

 from coritus came acron to the fight
 who left his spouse betroth'd and unconsummate night
 mezentius sees him thro' the squadrons ride
 proud of the purple favors of his bride
 then as a hungry lion who beholds
 a gamesome goat who frisks about the folds
 or beamy stag that grazes on the plain
 he runs he roars he shakes his rising mane
 he grins and opens wide his greedy jaws
 the prey lies panting underneath his paws
 he fills his famish'd maw his mouth runs o'er
 with unchew'd morsels while he churns the gore
 so proud mezentius rushes on his foes
 and first unhappy acron overthrows
 stretch'd at his length he spurns the swarthy ground
 the lance besmear'd with blood lies broken in the wound
 then with disdain the haughty victor view'd
 orodes flying nor the wretch pursued
 nor thought the dastard's back deserv'd a wound
 but running gain'd th' advantage of the ground
 then turning short he met him face to face
 to give his victor the better grace
 orodes falls in equal fight oppress'd
 mezentius fix'd his foot upon his breast
 and rested lance and thus aloud he cries
 "lo here the champion of my rebels lies"
 the fields around with io paean ring
 and peals of shouts applaud the conqu'ring king
 at this the vanquish'd with his dying breath
 thus faintly spoke and prophesied in death
 "nor thou proud man unpunish'd shalt remain
 like death attends thee on this fatal plain"
 then sourly smiling thus the king replied
 "for what belongs to me let jove provide
 but die thou first whatever chance ensue"
 he said and from the wound the weapon drew
 a hov'ring mist came swimming o'er his sight
 and seal'd his eyes in everlasting night

 by caedicus alcathous was slain
 sacrator laid hydaspes on the plain
 orses the strong to greater strength must yield
 he with parthenius were by rapo kill'd
 then brave messapus ericetes slew
 who from lycaon's blood his lineage drew
 but from his headstrong horse his fate he found
 who threw his master as he made a bound
 the chief alighting stuck him to the ground
 then clonius hand to hand on foot assails
 the trojan sinks and neptune's son prevails
 agis the lycian stepping forth with pride
 to single fight the boldest foe defied
 whom tuscan valerus by force o'ercame
 and not belied his mighty father's fame
 salius to death the great antronius sent
 but the same fate the victor underwent
 slain by nealces' hand wellskill'd to throw
 the flying dart and draw the fardeceiving bow

 thus equal deaths are dealt with equal chance
 by turns they quit their ground by turns advance
 victors and vanquish'd in the various field
 nor wholly overcome nor wholly yield
 the gods from heav'n survey the fatal strife
 and mourn the miseries of human life
 above the rest two goddesses appear
 concern'd for each here venus juno there
 amidst the crowd infernal ate shakes
 her scourge aloft and crest of hissing snakes

 once more the proud mezentius with disdain
 brandish'd his spear and rush'd into the plain
 where tow'ring in the midmost rank she stood
 like tall orion stalking o'er the flood
 when with his brawny breast he cuts the waves
 his shoulders scarce the topmost billow laves
 or like a mountain ash whose roots are spread
 deep fix'd in earth in clouds he hides his head

 the trojan prince beheld him from afar
 and dauntless undertook the doubtful war
 collected in his strength and like a rock
 pois'd on his base mezentius stood the shock
 he stood and measuring first with careful eyes
 the space his spear could reach aloud he cries
 "my strong right hand and sword assist my stroke
 those only gods mezentius will invoke
 his armor from the trojan pirate torn
 by my triumphant lausus shall be worn"
 he said and with his utmost force he threw
 the massy spear which hissing as it flew
 reach'd the celestial shield that stopp'd the course
 but glancing thence the yet unbroken force
 took a new bent obliquely and betwixt
 the side and bowels fam'd anthores fix'd
 anthores had from argos travel'd far
 alcides' friend and brother of the war
 till tir'd with toils fair italy he chose
 and in evander's palace sought repose
 now falling by another's wound his eyes
 he cast to heav'n on argos thinks and dies

 the pious trojan then his jav'lin sent
 the shield gave way thro' treble plates it went
 of solid brass of linen trebly roll'd
 and three bull hides which round the buckler fold
 all these it pass'd resistless in the course
 transpierc'd his thigh and spent its dying force
 the gaping wound gush'd out a crimson flood
 the trojan glad with sight of hostile blood
 his faunchion drew to closer fight address'd
 and with new force his fainting foe oppress'd

 his father's peril lausus view'd with grief
 he sigh'd he wept he ran to his relief
 and here heroic youth 't is here i must
 to thy immortal memory be just
 and sing an act so noble and so new
 posterity will scarce believe 't is true
 pain'd with his wound and useless for the fight
 the father sought to save himself by flight
 incumber'd slow he dragg'd the spear along
 which pierc'd his thigh and in his buckler hung
 the pious youth resolv'd on death below
 the lifted sword springs forth to face the foe
 protects his parent and prevents the blow
 shouts of applause ran ringing thro' the field
 to see the son the vanquish'd father shield
 all fir'd with gen'rous indignation strive
 and with a storm of darts to distance drive
 the trojan chief who held at bay from far
 on his vulcanian orb sustain'd the war

 as when thick hail comes rattling in the wind
 the plowman passenger and lab'ring hind
 for shelter to the neighb'ring covert fly
 or hous'd or safe in hollow caverns lie
 but that o'erblown when heav'n above 'em smiles
 return to travel and renew their toils
 aeneas thus o'erwhelmed on ev'ry side
 the storm of darts undaunted did abide
 and thus to lausus loud with friendly threat'ning cried
 "why wilt thou rush to certain death and rage
 in rash attempts beyond thy tender age
 betray'd by pious love" nor thus forborne
 the youth desists but with insulting scorn
 provokes the ling'ring prince whose patience tir'd
 gave place and all his breast with fury fir'd
 for now the fates prepar'd their sharpen'd shears
 and lifted high the flaming sword appears
 which full descending with a frightful sway
 thro' shield and corslet forc'd th' impetuous way
 and buried deep in his fair bosom lay
 the purple streams thro' the thin armor strove
 and drench'd th' imbroider'd coat his mother wove
 and life at length forsook his heaving heart
 loth from so sweet a mansion to depart

 but when with blood and paleness all o'erspread
 the pious prince beheld young lausus dead
 he griev'd he wept the sight an image brought
 of his own filial love a sadly pleasing thought
 then stretch'd his hand to hold him up and said
 "poor hapless youth what praises can be paid
 to love so great to such transcendent store
 of early worth and sure presage of more
 accept whate'er aeneas can afford
 untouch'd thy arms untaken be thy sword
 and all that pleas'd thee living still remain
 inviolate and sacred to the slain
 thy body on thy parents i bestow
 to rest thy soul at least if shadows know
 or have a sense of human things below
 there to thy fellow ghosts with glory tell
 ''t was by the great aeneas hand i fell'"
 with this his distant friends he beckons near
 provokes their duty and prevents their fear
 himself assists to lift him from the ground
 with clotted locks and blood that well'd from out the wound

 meantime his father now no father stood
 and wash'd his wounds by tiber's yellow flood
 oppress'd with anguish panting and o'erspent
 his fainting limbs against an oak he leant
 a bough his brazen helmet did sustain
 his heavier arms lay scatter'd on the plain
 a chosen train of youth around him stand
 his drooping head was rested on his hand
 his grisly beard his pensive bosom sought
 and all on lausus ran his restless thought
 careful concern'd his danger to prevent
 he much enquir'd and many a message sent
 to warn him from the field alas in vain
 behold his mournful followers bear him slain
 o'er his broad shield still gush'd the yawning wound
 and drew a bloody trail along the ground
 far off he heard their cries far off divin'd
 the dire event with a foreboding mind
 with dust he sprinkled first his hoary head
 then both his lifted hands to heav'n he spread
 last the dear corpse embracing thus he said
 "what joys alas could this frail being give
 that i have been so covetous to live
 to see my son and such a son resign
 his life a ransom for preserving mine
 and am i then preserv'd and art thou lost
 how much too dear has that redemption cost
 't is now my bitter banishment i feel
 this is a wound too deep for time to heal
 my guilt thy growing virtues did defame
 my blackness blotted thy unblemish'd name
 chas'd from a throne abandon'd and exil'd
 for foul misdeeds were punishments too mild
 i ow'd my people these and from their hate
 with less resentment could have borne my fate
 and yet i live and yet sustain the sight
 of hated men and of more hated light
 but will not long" with that he rais'd from ground
 his fainting limbs that stagger'd with his wound
 yet with a mind resolv'd and unappall'd
 with pains or perils for his courser call'd
 wellmouth'd wellmanag'd whom himself did dress
 with daily care and mounted with success
 his aid in arms his ornament in peace

 soothing his courage with a gentle stroke
 the steed seem'd sensible while thus he spoke
 "o rhoebus we have liv'd too long for me
 if life and long were terms that could agree
 this day thou either shalt bring back the head
 and bloody trophies of the trojan dead
 this day thou either shalt revenge my woe
 for murther'd lausus on his cruel foe
 or if inexorable fate deny
 our conquest with thy conquer'd master die
 for after such a lord i rest secure
 thou wilt no foreign reins or trojan load endure"
 he said and straight th' officious courser kneels
 to take his wonted weight his hands he fills
 with pointed jav'lins on his head he lac'd
 his glitt'ring helm which terribly was grac'd
 with waving horsehair nodding from afar
 then spurr'd his thund'ring steed amidst the war
 love anguish wrath and grief to madness wrought
 despair and secret shame and conscious thought
 of inborn worth his lab'ring soul oppress'd
 roll'd in his eyes and rag'd within his breast
 then loud he call'd aeneas thrice by name
 the loud repeated voice to glad aeneas came
 "great jove" he said "and the farshooting god
 inspire thy mind to make thy challenge good"
 he spoke no more but hasten'd void of fear
 and threaten'd with his long protended spear

 to whom mezentius thus "thy vaunts are vain
 my lausus lies extended on the plain
 he's lost thy conquest is already won
 the wretched sire is murther'd in the son
 nor fate i fear but all the gods defy
 forbear thy threats my bus'ness is to die
 but first receive this parting legacy"
 he said and straight a whirling dart he sent
 another after and another went
 round in a spacious ring he rides the field
 and vainly plies th' impenetrable shield
 thrice rode he round and thrice aeneas wheel'd
 turn'd as he turn'd the golden orb withstood
 the strokes and bore about an iron wood
 impatient of delay and weary grown
 still to defend and to defend alone
 to wrench the darts which in his buckler light
 urg'd and o'erlabor'd in unequal fight
 at length resolv'd he throws with all his force
 full at the temples of the warrior horse
 just where the stroke was aim'd th' unerring spear
 made way and stood transfix'd thro' either ear
 seiz'd with unwonted pain surpris'd with fright
 the wounded steed curvets and rais'd upright
 lights on his feet before his hoofs behind
 spring up in air aloft and lash the wind
 down comes the rider headlong from his height
 his horse came after with unwieldy weight
 and flound'ring forward pitching on his head
 his lord's incumber'd shoulder overlaid

 from either host the mingled shouts and cries
 of trojans and rutulians rend the skies
 aeneas hast'ning wav'd his fatal sword
 high o'er his head with this reproachful word
 "now where are now thy vaunts the fierce disdain
 of proud mezentius and the lofty strain"

 struggling and wildly staring on the skies
 with scarce recover'd sight he thus replies
 "why these insulting words this waste of breath
 to souls undaunted and secure of death
 't is no dishonor for the brave to die
 nor came i here with hope victory
 nor ask i life nor fought with that design
 as i had us'd my fortune use thou thine
 my dying son contracted no such band
 the gift is hateful from his murd'rer's hand
 for this this only favor let me sue
 if pity can to conquer'd foes be due
 refuse it not but let my body have
 the last retreat of humankind a grave
 too well i know th' insulting people's hate
 protect me from their vengeance after fate
 this refuge for my poor remains provide
 and lay my muchlov'd lausus by my side"
 he said and to the sword his throat applied
 the crimson stream distain'd his arms around
 and the disdainful soul came rushing thro' the wound




 book xi

 scarce had the rosy morning rais'd her head
 above the waves and left her wat'ry bed
 the pious chief whom double cares attend
 for his unburied soldiers and his friend
 yet first to heav'n perform'd a victor's vows
 he bar'd an ancient oak of all her boughs
 then on a rising ground the trunk he plac'd
 which with the spoils of his dead foe he grac'd
 the coat of arms by proud mezentius worn
 now on a naked snag in triumph borne
 was hung on high and glitter'd from afar
 a trophy sacred to the god of war
 above his arms fix'd on the leafless wood
 appear'd his plumy crest besmear'd with blood
 his brazen buckler on the left was seen
 truncheons of shiver'd lances hung between
 and on the right was placed his corslet bor'd
 and to the neck was tied his unavailing sword

 a crowd of chiefs inclose the godlike man
 who thus conspicuous in the midst began
 "our toils my friends are crown'd with sure success
 the greater part perform'd achieve the less
 now follow cheerful to the trembling town
 press but an entrance and presume it won
 fear is no more for fierce mezentius lies
 as the first fruits of war a sacrifice
 turnus shall fall extended on the plain
 and in this omen is already slain
 prepar'd in arms pursue your happy chance
 that none unwarn'd may plead his ignorance
 and i at heav'n's appointed hour may find
 your warlike ensigns waving in the wind
 meantime the rites and fun'ral pomps prepare
 due to your dead companions of the war
 the last respect the living can bestow
 to shield their shadows from contempt below
 that conquer'd earth be theirs for which they fought
 and which for us with their own blood they bought
 but first the corpse of our unhappy friend
 to the sad city of evander send
 who not inglorious in his age's bloom
 was hurried hence by too severe a doom"

 thus weeping while he spoke he took his way
 where new in death lamented pallas lay
 acoetes watch'd the corpse whose youth deserv'd
 the father's trust and now the son he serv'd
 with equal faith but less auspicious care
 th' attendants of the slain his sorrow share
 a troop of trojans mix'd with these appear
 and mourning matrons with dishevel'd hair
 soon as the prince appears they raise a cry
 all beat their breasts and echoes rend the sky
 they rear his drooping forehead from the ground
 but when aeneas view'd the grisly wound
 which pallas in his manly bosom bore
 and the fair flesh distain'd with purple gore
 first melting into tears the pious man
 deplor'd so sad a sight then thus began
 "unhappy youth when fortune gave the rest
 of my full wishes she refus'd the best
 she came but brought not thee along to bless
 my longing eyes and share in my success
 she grudg'd thy safe return the triumphs due
 to prosp'rous valor in the public view
 not thus i promis'd when thy father lent
 thy needless succor with a sad consent
 embrac'd me parting for th' etrurian land
 and sent me to possess a large command
 he warn'd and from his own experience told
 our foes were warlike disciplin'd and bold
 and now perhaps in hopes of thy return
 rich odors on his loaded altars burn
 while we with vain officious pomp prepare
 to send him back his portion of the war
 a bloody breathless body which can owe
 no farther debt but to the pow'rs below
 the wretched father ere his race is run
 shall view the fun'ral honors of his son
 these are my triumphs of the latian war
 fruits of my plighted faith and boasted care
 and yet unhappy sire thou shalt not see
 a son whose death disgrac'd his ancestry
 thou shalt not blush old man however griev'd
 thy pallas no dishonest wound receiv'd
 he died no death to make thee wish too late
 thou hadst not liv'd to see his shameful fate
 but what a champion has th' ausonian coast
 and what a friend hast thou ascanius lost"

 thus having mourn'd he gave the word around
 to raise the breathless body from the ground
 and chose a thousand horse the flow'r of all
 his warlike troops to wait the funeral
 to bear him back and share evander's grief
 a wellbecoming but a weak relief
 of oaken twigs they twist an easy bier
 then on their shoulders the sad burden rear
 the body on this rural hearse is borne
 strew'd leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn
 all pale he lies and looks a lovely flow'r
 new cropp'd by virgin hands to dress the bow'r
 unfaded yet but yet unfed below
 no more to mother earth or the green stern shall owe
 then two fair vests of wondrous work and cost
 of purple woven and with gold emboss'd
 for ornament the trojan hero brought
 which with her hands sidonian dido wrought
 one vest array'd the corpse and one they spread
 o'er his clos'd eyes and wrapp'd around his head
 that when the yellow hair in flame should fall
 the catching fire might burn the golden caul
 besides the spoils of foes in battle slain
 when he descended on the latian plain
 arms trappings horses by the hearse are led
 in long array th' achievements of the dead
 then pinion'd with their hands behind appear
 th' unhappy captives marching in the rear
 appointed off'rings in the victor's name
 to sprinkle with their blood the fun'ral flame
 inferior trophies by the chiefs are borne
 gauntlets and helms their loaded hands adorn
 and fair inscriptions fix'd and titles read
 of latian leaders conquer'd by the dead

 acoetes on his pupil's corpse attends
 with feeble steps supported by his friends
 pausing at ev'ry pace in sorrow drown'd
 betwixt their arms he sinks upon the ground
 where grov'ling while he lies in deep despair
 he beats his breast and rends his hoary hair
 the champion's chariot next is seen to roll
 besmear'd with hostile blood and honorably foul
 to close the pomp aethon the steed of state
 is led the fun'rals of his lord to wait
 stripp'd of his trappings with a sullen pace
 he walks and the big tears run rolling down his face
 the lance of pallas and the crimson crest
 are borne behind the victor seiz'd the rest
 the march begins the trumpets hoarsely sound
 the pikes and lances trail along the ground
 thus while the trojan and arcadian horse
 to pallantean tow'rs direct their course
 in long procession rank'd the pious chief
 stopp'd in the rear and gave a vent to grief
 "the public care" he said "which war attends
 diverts our present woes at least suspends
 peace with the manes of great pallas dwell
 hail holy relics and a last farewell"
 he said no more but inly thro' he mourn'd
 restrained his tears and to the camp return'd

 now suppliants from laurentum sent demand
 a truce with olive branches in their hand
 obtest his clemency and from the plain
 beg leave to draw the bodies of their slain
 they plead that none those common rites deny
 to conquer'd foes that in fair battle die
 all cause of hate was ended in their death
 nor could he war with bodies void of breath
 a king they hop'd would hear a king's request
 whose son he once was call'd and once his guest

 their suit which was too just to be denied
 the hero grants and farther thus replied
 "o latian princes how severe a fate
 in causeless quarrels has involv'd your state
 and arm'd against an unoffending man
 who sought your friendship ere the war began
 you beg a truce which i would gladly give
 not only for the slain but those who live
 i came not hither but by heav'n's command
 and sent by fate to share the latian land
 nor wage i wars unjust your king denied
 my proffer'd friendship and my promis'd bride
 left me for turnus turnus then should try
 his cause in arms to conquer or to die
 my right and his are in dispute the slain
 fell without fault our quarrel to maintain
 in equal arms let us alone contend
 and let him vanquish whom his fates befriend
 this is the way so tell him to possess
 the royal virgin and restore the peace
 bear this message back with ample leave
 that your slain friends may fun'ral rites receive"

 thus having said th' embassadors amaz'd
 stood mute a while and on each other gaz'd
 drances their chief who harbor'd in his breast
 long hate to turnus as his foe profess'd
 broke silence first and to the godlike man
 with graceful action bowing thus began
 "auspicious prince in arms a mighty name
 but yet whose actions far transcend your fame
 would i your justice or your force express
 thought can but equal and all words are less
 your answer we shall thankfully relate
 and favors granted to the latian state
 if wish'd success our labor shall attend
 think peace concluded and the king your friend
 let turnus leave the realm to your command
 and seek alliance in some other land
 build you the city which your fates assign
 we shall be proud in the great work to join"

 thus drances and his words so well persuade
 the rest impower'd that soon a truce is made
 twelve days the term allow'd and during those
 latians and trojans now no longer foes
 mix'd in the woods for fun'ral piles prepare
 to fell the timber and forget the war
 loud axes thro' the groaning groves resound
 oak mountain ash and poplar spread the ground
 first fall from high and some the trunks receive
 in loaden wains with wedges some they cleave

 and now the fatal news by fame is blown
 thro' the short circuit of th' arcadian town
 of pallas slain by fame which just before
 his triumphs on distended pinions bore
 rushing from out the gate the people stand
 each with a fun'ral flambeau in his hand
 wildly they stare distracted with amaze
 the fields are lighten'd with a fiery blaze
 that cast a sullen splendor on their friends
 the marching troop which their dead prince attends
 both parties meet they raise a doleful cry
 the matrons from the walls with shrieks reply
 and their mix'd mourning rends the vaulted sky
 the town is fill'd with tumult and with tears
 till the loud clamors reach evander's ears
 forgetful of his state he runs along
 with a disorder'd pace and cleaves the throng
 falls on the corpse and groaning there he lies
 with silent grief that speaks but at his eyes
 short sighs and sobs succeed till sorrow breaks
 a passage and at once he weeps and speaks

 "o pallas thou hast fail'd thy plighted word
 to fight with caution not to tempt the sword
 i warn'd thee but in vain for well i knew
 what perils youthful ardor would pursue
 that boiling blood would carry thee too far
 young as thou wert in dangers raw to war
 o curst essay of arms disastrous doom
 prelude of bloody fields and fights to come
 hard elements of unauspicious war
 vain vows to heav'n and unavailing care
 thrice happy thou dear partner of my bed
 whose holy soul the stroke of fortune fled
 praescious of ills and leaving me behind
 to drink the dregs of life by fate assign'd
 beyond the goal of nature i have gone
 my pallas late set out but reach'd too soon
 if for my league against th' ausonian state
 amidst their weapons i had found my fate
 deserv'd from them then i had been return'd
 a breathless victor and my son had mourn'd
 yet will i not my trojan friend upbraid
 nor grudge th' alliance i so gladly made
 't was not his fault my pallas fell so young
 but my own crime for having liv'd too long
 yet since the gods had destin'd him to die
 at least he led the way to victory
 first for his friends he won the fatal shore
 and sent whole herds of slaughter'd foes before
 a death too great too glorious to deplore
 nor will i add new honors to thy grave
 content with those the trojan hero gave
 that funeral pomp thy phrygian friends design'd
 in which the tuscan chiefs and army join'd
 great spoils and trophies gain'd by thee they bear
 then let thy own achievements be thy share
 even thou o turnus hadst a trophy stood
 whose mighty trunk had better grac'd the wood
 if pallas had arriv'd with equal length
 of years to match thy bulk with equal strength
 but why unhappy man dost thou detain
 these troops to view the tears thou shedd'st in vain
 go friends this message to your lord relate
 tell him that if i bear my bitter fate
 and after pallas' death live ling'ring on
 't is to behold his vengeance for my son
 i stay for turnus whose devoted head
 is owing to the living and the dead
 my son and i expect it from his hand
 't is all that he can give or we demand
 joy is no more but i would gladly go
 to greet my pallas with such news below"

 the morn had now dispell'd the shades of night
 restoring toils when she restor'd the light
 the trojan king and tuscan chief command
 to raise the piles along the winding strand
 their friends convey the dead fun'ral fires
 black smold'ring smoke from the green wood expires
 the light of heav'n is chok'd and the new day retires
 then thrice around the kindled piles they go
 for ancient custom had ordain'd it so
 thrice horse and foot about the fires are led
 and thrice with loud laments they hail the dead
 tears trickling down their breasts bedew the ground
 and drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound
 amid the blaze their pious brethren throw
 the spoils in battle taken from the foe
 helms bits emboss'd and swords of shining steel
 one casts a target one a chariot wheel
 some to their fellows their own arms restore
 the fauchions which in luckless fight they bore
 their bucklers pierc'd their darts bestow'd in vain
 and shiver'd lances gather'd from the plain
 whole herds of offer'd bulls about the fire
 and bristled boars and woolly sheep expire
 around the piles a careful troop attends
 to watch the wasting flames and weep their burning friends
 ling'ring along the shore till dewy night
 new decks the face of heav'n with starry light

 the conquer'd latians with like pious care
 piles without number for their dead prepare
 part in the places where they fell are laid
 and part are to the neighb'ring fields convey'd
 the corps of kings and captains of renown
 borne off in state are buried in the town
 the rest unhonor'd and without a name
 are cast a common heap to feed the flame
 trojans and latians vie with like desires
 to make the field of battle shine with fires
 and the promiscuous blaze to heav'n aspires

 now had the morning thrice renew'd the light
 and thrice dispell'd the shadows of the night
 when those who round the wasted fires remain
 perform the last sad office to the slain
 they rake the yet warm ashes from below
 these and the bones unburn'd in earth bestow
 these relics with their country rites they grace
 and raise a mount of turf to mark the place

 but in the palace of the king appears
 a scene more solemn and a pomp of tears
 maids matrons widows mix their common moans
 orphans their sires and sires lament their sons
 all in that universal sorrow share
 and curse the cause of this unhappy war
 a broken league a bride unjustly sought
 a crown usurp'd which with their blood is bought
 these are the crimes with which they load the name
 of turnus and on him alone exclaim
 "let him who lords it o'er th' ausonian land
 engage the trojan hero hand to hand
 his is the gain our lot is but to serve
 't is just the sway he seeks he should deserve"
 this drances aggravates and adds with spite
 "his foe expects and dares him to the fight"
 nor turnus wants a party to support
 his cause and credit in the latian court
 his former acts secure his present fame
 and the queen shades him with her mighty name

 while thus their factious minds with fury burn
 the legates from th' aetolian prince return
 sad news they bring that after all the cost
 and care employ'd their embassy is lost
 that diomedes refus'd his aid in war
 unmov'd with presents and as deaf to pray'r
 some new alliance must elsewhere be sought
 or peace with troy on hard conditions bought

 latinus sunk in sorrow finds too late
 a foreign son is pointed out by fate
 and till aeneas shall lavinia wed
 the wrath of heav'n is hov'ring o'er his head
 the gods he saw espous'd the juster side
 when late their titles in the field were tried
 witness the fresh laments and fun'ral tears undried
 thus full of anxious thought he summons all
 the latian senate to the council hall
 the princes come commanded by their head
 and crowd the paths that to the palace lead
 supreme in pow'r and reverenc'd for his years
 he takes the throne and in the midst appears
 majestically sad he sits in state
 and bids his envoys their success relate

 when venulus began the murmuring sound
 was hush'd and sacred silence reign'd around
 "we have" said he "perform'd your high command
 and pass'd with peril a long tract of land
 we reach'd the place desir'd with wonder fill'd
 the grecian tents and rising tow'rs beheld
 great diomede has compass'd round with walls
 the city which argyripa he calls
 from his own argos nam'd we touch'd with joy
 the royal hand that raz'd unhappy troy
 when introduc'd our presents first we bring
 then crave an instant audience from the king
 his leave obtain'd our native soil we name
 and tell th' important cause for which we came
 attentively he heard us while we spoke
 then with soft accents and a pleasing look
 made this return 'ausonian race of old
 renown'd for peace and for an age of gold
 what madness has your alter'd minds possess'd
 to change for war hereditary rest
 solicit arms unknown and tempt the sword
 a needless ill your ancestors abhorr'd
 we for myself i speak and all the name
 of grecians who to troy's destruction came
 omitting those who were in battle slain
 or borne by rolling simois to the main
 not one but suffer'd and too dearly bought
 the prize of honor which in arms he sought
 some doom'd to death and some in exile driv'n
 outcasts abandon'd by the care of heav'n
 so worn so wretched so despis'd a crew
 as ev'n old priam might with pity view
 witness the vessels by minerva toss'd
 in storms the vengeful capharean coast
 th' euboean rocks the prince whose brother led
 our armies to revenge his injur'd bed
 in egypt lost ulysses with his men
 have seen charybdis and the cyclops' den
 why should i name idomeneus in vain
 restor'd to scepters and expell'd again
 or young achilles by his rival slain
 ev'n he the king of men the foremost name
 of all the greeks and most renown'd by fame
 the proud revenger of another's wife
 yet by his own adult'ress lost his life
 fell at his threshold and the spoils of troy
 the foul polluters of his bed enjoy
 the gods have envied me the sweets of life
 my much lov'd country and my more lov'd wife
 banish'd from both i mourn while in the sky
 transform'd to birds my lost companions fly
 hov'ring about the coasts they make their moan
 and cuff the cliffs with pinions not their own
 what squalid specters in the dead of night
 break my short sleep and skim before my sight
 i might have promis'd to myself those harms
 mad as i was when i with mortal arms
 presum'd against immortal pow'rs to move
 and violate with wounds the queen of love
 such arms this hand shall never more employ
 no hate remains with me to ruin'd troy
 i war not with its dust nor am i glad
 to think of past events or good or bad
 your presents i return whate'er you bring
 to buy my friendship send the trojan king
 we met in fight i know him to my cost
 with what a whirling force his lance he toss'd
 heav'ns what a spring was in his arm to throw
 how high he held his shield and rose at ev'ry blow
 had troy produc'd two more his match in might
 they would have chang'd the fortune of the fight
 th' invasion of the greeks had been return'd
 our empire wasted and our cities burn'd
 the long defense the trojan people made
 the war protracted and the siege delay'd
 were due to hector's and this hero's hand
 both brave alike and equal in command
 aeneas not inferior in the field
 in pious reverence to the gods excell'd
 make peace ye latians and avoid with care
 th' impending dangers of a fatal war'
 he said no more but with this cold excuse
 refus'd th' alliance and advis'd a truce"

 thus venulus concluded his report
 a jarring murmur fill'd the factious court
 as when a torrent rolls with rapid force
 and dashes o'er the stones that stop the course
 the flood constrain'd within a scanty space
 roars horrible along th' uneasy race
 white foam in gath'ring eddies floats around
 the rocky shores rebellow to the sound

 the murmur ceas'd then from his lofty throne
 the king invok'd the gods and thus begun
 "i wish ye latins what we now debate
 had been resolv'd before it was too late
 much better had it been for you and me
 unforc'd by this our last necessity
 to have been earlier wise than now to call
 a council when the foe surrounds the wall
 o citizens we wage unequal war
 with men not only heav'n's peculiar care
 but heav'n's own race unconquer'd in the field
 or conquer'd yet unknowing how to yield
 what hopes you had in diomedes lay down
 our hopes must center on ourselves alone
 yet those how feeble and indeed how vain
 you see too well nor need my words explain
 vanquish'd without resource laid flat by fate
 factions within a foe without the gate
 not but i grant that all perform'd their parts
 with manly force and with undaunted hearts
 with our united strength the war we wag'd
 with equal numbers equal arms engag'd
 you see th' event now hear what i propose
 to save our friends and satisfy our foes
 a tract of land the latins have possess'd
 along the tiber stretching to the west
 which now rutulians and auruncans till
 and their mix'd cattle graze the fruitful hill
 those mountains fill'd with firs that lower land
 if you consent the trojan shall command
 call'd into part of what is ours and there
 on terms agreed the common country share
 there let'em build and settle if they please
 unless they choose once more to cross the seas
 in search of seats remote from italy
 and from unwelcome inmates set us free
 then twice ten galleys let us build with speed
 or twice as many more if more they need
 materials are at hand a wellgrown wood
 runs equal with the margin of the flood
 let them the number and the form assign
 the care and cost of all the stores be mine
 to treat the peace a hundred senators
 shall be commission'd hence with ample pow'rs
 with olive the presents they shall bear
 a purple robe a royal iv'ry chair
 and all the marks of sway that latian monarchs wear
 and sums of gold among yourselves debate
 this great affair and save the sinking state"

 then drances took the word who grudg'd long since
 the rising glories of the daunian prince
 factious and rich bold at the council board
 but cautious in the field he shunn'd the sword
 a close caballer and tonguevaliant lord
 noble his mother was and near the throne
 but what his father's parentage unknown
 he rose and took th' advantage of the times
 to load young turnus with invidious crimes
 "such truths o king" said he "your words contain
 as strike the sense and all replies are vain
 nor are your loyal subjects now to seek
 what common needs require but fear to speak
 let him give leave of speech that haughty man
 whose pride this unauspicious war began
 for whose ambition let me dare to say
 fear set apart tho' death is in my way
 the plains of latium run with blood around
 so many valiant heroes bite the ground
 dejected grief in ev'ry face appears
 a town in mourning and a land in tears
 while he th' undoubted author of our harms
 the man who menaces the gods with arms
 yet after all his boasts forsook the fight
 and sought his safety in ignoble flight
 now best of kings since you propose to send
 such bounteous presents to your trojan friend
 add yet a greater at our joint request
 one which he values more than all the rest
 give him the fair lavinia for his bride
 with that alliance let the league be tied
 and for the bleeding land a lasting peace provide
 let insolence no longer awe the throne
 but with a father's right bestow your own
 for this maligner of the general good
 if still we fear his force he must be woo'd
 his haughty godhead we with pray'rs implore
 your scepter to release and our just rights restore
 o cursed cause of all our ills must we
 wage wars unjust and fall in fight for thee
 what right hast thou to rule the latian state
 and send us out to meet our certain fate
 't is a destructive war from turnus' hand
 our peace and public safety we demand
 let the fair bride to the brave chief remain
 if not the peace without the pledge is vain
 turnus i know you think me not your friend
 nor will i much with your belief contend
 i beg your greatness not to give the law
 in others' realms but beaten to withdraw
 pity your own or pity our estate
 nor twist our fortunes with your sinking fate
 your interest is the war should never cease
 but we have felt enough to wish the peace
 a land exhausted to the last remains
 depopulated towns and driven plains
 yet if desire of fame and thirst of pow'r
 a beauteous princess with a crown in dow'r
 so fire your mind in arms assert your right
 and meet your foe who dares you to the fight
 mankind it seems is made for you alone
 we but the slaves who mount you to the throne
 a base ignoble crowd without a name
 unwept unworthy of the fun'ral flame
 by duty bound to forfeit each his life
 that turnus may possess a royal wife
 permit not mighty man so mean a crew
 should share such triumphs and detain from you
 the post of honor your undoubted due
 rather alone your matchless force employ
 to merit what alone you must enjoy"

 these words so full of malice mix'd with art
 inflam'd with rage the youthful hero's heart
 then groaning from the bottom of his breast
 he heav'd for wind and thus his wrath express'd
 "you drances never want a stream of words
 then when the public need requires our swords
 first in the council hall to steer the state
 and ever foremost in a tonguedebate
 while our strong walls secure us from the foe
 ere yet with blood our ditches overflow
 but let the potent orator declaim
 and with the brand of coward blot my name
 free leave is giv'n him when his fatal hand
 has cover'd with more corps the sanguine strand
 and high as mine his tow'ring trophies stand
 if any doubt remains who dares the most
 let us decide it at the trojan's cost
 and issue both abreast where honor calls
 foes are not far to seek without the walls
 unless his noisy tongue can only fight
 and feet were giv'n him but to speed his flight
 i beaten from the field i forc'd away
 who but so known a dastard dares to say
 had he but ev'n beheld the fight his eyes
 had witness'd for me what his tongue denies
 what heaps of trojans by this hand were slain
 and how the bloody tiber swell'd the main
 all saw but he th' arcadian troops retire
 in scatter'd squadrons and their prince expire
 the giant brothers in their camp have found
 i was not forc'd with ease to quit my ground
 not such the trojans tried me when inclos'd
 i singly their united arms oppos'd
 first forc'd an entrance thro' their thick array
 then glutted with their slaughter freed my way
 't is a destructive war so let it be
 but to the phrygian pirate and to thee
 meantime proceed to fill the people's ears
 with false reports their minds with panic fears
 extol the strength of a twiceconquer'd race
 our foes encourage and our friends debase
 believe thy fables and the trojan town
 triumphant stands the grecians are o'erthrown
 suppliant at hector's feet achilles lies
 and diomede from fierce aeneas flies
 say rapid aufidus with awful dread
 runs backward from the sea and hides his head
 when the great trojan on his bank appears
 for that's as true as thy dissembled fears
 of my revenge dismiss that vanity
 thou drances art below a death from me
 let that vile soul in that vile body rest
 the lodging is well worthy of the guest

 "now royal father to the present state
 of our affairs and of this high debate
 if in your arms thus early you diffide
 and think your fortune is already tried
 if one defeat has brought us down so low
 as never more in fields to meet the foe
 then i conclude for peace 't is time to treat
 and lie like vassals at the victor's feet
 but o if any ancient blood remains
 one drop of all our fathers' in our veins
 that man would i prefer before the rest
 who dar'd his death with an undaunted breast
 who comely fell by no dishonest wound
 to shun that sight and dying gnaw'd the ground
 but if we still have fresh recruits in store
 if our confederates can afford us more
 if the contended field we bravely fought
 and not a bloodless victory was bought
 their losses equal'd ours and for their slain
 with equal fires they fill'd the shining plain
 why thus unforc'd should we so tamely yield
 and ere the trumpet sounds resign the field
 good unexpected evils unforeseen
 appear by turns as fortune shifts the scene
 some rais'd aloft come tumbling down amain
 then fall so hard they bound and rise again
 if diomede refuse his aid to lend
 the great messapus yet remains our friend
 tolumnius who foretells events is ours
 th' italian chiefs and princes join their pow'rs
 nor least in number nor in name the last
 your own brave subjects have your cause embrac'd
 above the rest the volscian amazon
 contains an army in herself alone
 and heads a squadron terrible to sight
 with glitt'ring shields in brazen armor bright
 yet if the foe a single fight demand
 and i alone the public peace withstand
 if you consent he shall not be refus'd
 nor find a hand to victory unus'd
 this new achilles let him take the field
 with fated armor and vulcanian shield
 for you my royal father and my fame
 i turnus not the least of all my name
 devote my soul he calls me hand to hand
 and i alone will answer his demand
 drances shall rest secure and neither share
 the danger nor divide the prize of war"

 while they debate nor these nor those will yield
 aeneas draws his forces to the field
 and moves his camp the scouts with flying speed
 return and thro' the frighted city spread
 th' unpleasing news the trojans are descried
 in battle marching by the river side
 and bending to the town they take th' alarm
 some tremble some are bold all in confusion arm
 th' impetuous youth press forward to the field
 they clash the sword and clatter on the shield
 the fearful matrons raise a screaming cry
 old feeble men with fainter groans reply
 a jarring sound results and mingles in the sky
 like that of swans remurm'ring to the floods
 or birds of diff'ring kinds in hollow woods

 turnus th' occasion takes and cries aloud
 "talk on ye quaint haranguers of the crowd
 declaim in praise of peace when danger calls
 and the fierce foes in arms approach the walls"
 he said and turning short with speedy pace
 casts back a scornful glance and quits the place
 "thou volusus the volscian troops command
 to mount and lead thyself our ardean band
 messapus and catillus post your force
 along the fields to charge the trojan horse
 some guard the passes others man the wall
 drawn up in arms the rest attend my call"

 they swarm from ev'ry quarter of the town
 and with disorder'd haste the rampires crown
 good old latinus when he saw too late
 the gath'ring storm just breaking on the state
 dismiss'd the council till a fitter time
 and own'd his easy temper as his crime
 who forc'd against his reason had complied
 to break the treaty for the promis'd bride

 some help to sink new trenches others aid
 to ram the stones or raise the palisade
 hoarse trumpets sound th' alarm around the walls
 runs a distracted crew whom their last labor calls
 a sad procession in the streets is seen
 of matrons that attend the mother queen
 high in her chair she sits and at her side
 with downcast eyes appears the fatal bride
 they mount the cliff where pallas' temple stands
 pray'rs in their mouths and presents in their hands
 with censers first they fume the sacred shrine
 then in this common supplication join
 "o patroness of arms unspotted maid
 propitious hear and lend thy latins aid
 break short the pirate's lance pronounce his fate
 and lay the phrygian low before the gate"

 now turnus arms for fight his back and breast
 welltemper'd steel and scaly brass invest
 the cuishes which his brawny thighs infold
 are mingled metal damask'd o'er with gold
 his faithful fauchion sits upon his side
 nor casque nor crest his manly features hide
 but bare to view amid surrounding friends
 with godlike grace he from the tow'r descends
 exulting in his strength he seems to dare
 his absent rival and to promise war
 freed from his keepers thus with broken reins
 the wanton courser prances o'er the plains
 or in the pride of youth o'erleaps the mounds
 and snuffs the females in forbidden grounds
 or seeks his wat'ring in the wellknown flood
 to quench his thirst and cool his fiery blood
 he swims luxuriant in the liquid plain
 and o'er his shoulder flows his waving mane
 he neighs he snorts he bears his head on high
 before his ample chest the frothy waters fly

 soon as the prince appears without the gate
 the volscians with their virgin leader wait
 his last commands then with a graceful mien
 lights from her lofty steed the warrior queen
 her squadron imitates and each descends
 whose common suit camilla thus commends
 "if sense of honor if a soul secure
 of inborn worth that can all tests endure
 can promise aught or on itself rely
 greatly to dare to conquer or to die
 then i alone sustain'd by these will meet
 the tyrrhene troops and promise their defeat
 ours be the danger ours the sole renown
 you gen'ral stay behind and guard the town"

 turnus a while stood mute with glad surprise
 and on the fierce virago fix'd his eyes
 then thus return'd "o grace of italy
 with what becoming thanks can i reply
 not only words lie lab'ring in my breast
 but thought itself is by thy praise oppress'd
 yet rob me not of all but let me join
 my toils my hazard and my fame with thine
 the trojan not in stratagem unskill'd
 sends his light horse before to scour the field
 himself thro' steep ascents and thorny brakes
 a larger compass to the city takes
 this news my scouts confirm and i prepare
 to foil his cunning and his force to dare
 with chosen foot his passage to forelay
 and place an ambush in the winding way
 thou with thy volscians face the tuscan horse
 the brave messapus shall thy troops inforce
 with those of tibur and the latian band
 subjected all to thy supreme command"
 this said he warns messapus to the war
 then ev'ry chief exhorts with equal care
 all thus encourag'd his own troops he joins
 and hastes to prosecute his deep designs

 inclos'd with hills a winding valley lies
 by nature form'd for fraud and fitted for surprise
 a narrow track by human steps untrode
 leads thro' perplexing thorns to this obscure abode
 high o'er the vale a steepy mountain stands
 whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands
 the top is level an offensive seat
 of war and from the war a safe retreat
 for on the right and left is room to press
 the foes at hand or from afar distress
 to drive 'em headlong downward and to pour
 on their descending backs a stony show'r
 thither young turnus took the wellknown way
 possess'd the pass and in blind ambush lay

 meantime latonian phoebe from the skies
 beheld th' approaching war with hateful eyes
 and call'd the lightfoot opis to her aid
 her most belov'd and evertrusty maid
 then with a sigh began "camilla goes
 to meet her death amidst her fatal foes
 the nymphs i lov'd of all my mortal train
 invested with diana's arms in vain
 nor is my kindness for the virgin new
 't was born with her and with her years it grew
 her father metabus when forc'd away
 from old privernum for tyrannic sway
 snatch'd up and sav'd from his prevailing foes
 this tender babe companion of his woes
 casmilla was her mother but he drown'd
 one hissing letter in a softer sound
 and call'd camilla thro' the woods he flies
 wrapp'd in his robe the royal infant lies
 his foes in sight he mends his weary pace
 with shout and clamors they pursue the chase
 the banks of amasene at length he gains

 the raging flood his farther flight restrains
 rais'd o'er the borders with unusual rains
 prepar'd to plunge into the stream he fears
 not for himself but for the charge he bears
 anxious he stops a while and thinks in haste
 then desp'rate in distress resolves at last
 a knotty lance of wellboil'd oak he bore
 the middle part with cork he cover'd o'er
 he clos'd the child within the hollow space
 with twigs of bending osier bound the case
 then pois'd the spear heavy with human weight
 and thus invok'd my favor for the freight
 'accept great goddess of the woods' he said
 'sent by her sire this dedicated maid
 thro' air she flies a suppliant to thy shrine
 and the first weapons that she knows are thine'
 he said and with full force the spear he threw
 above the sounding waves camilla flew
 then press'd by foes he stemm'd the stormy tide
 and gain'd by stress of arms the farther side
 his fasten'd spear he pull'd from out the ground
 and victor of his vows his infant nymph unbound
 nor after that in towns which walls inclose
 would trust his hunted life amidst his foes
 but rough in open air he chose to lie
 earth was his couch his cov'ring was the sky
 on hills unshorn or in a desart den
 he shunn'd the dire society of men
 a shepherd's solitary life he led
 his daughter with the milk of mares he fed
 the dugs of bears and ev'ry salvage beast
 he drew and thro' her lips the liquor press'd
 the little amazon could scarcely go
 he loads her with a quiver and a bow
 and that she might her stagg'ring steps command
 he with a slender jav'lin fills her hand
 her flowing hair no golden fillet bound
 nor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground
 instead of these a tiger's hide o'erspread
 her back and shoulders fasten'd to her head
 the flying dart she first attempts to fling
 and round her tender temples toss'd the sling
 then as her strength with years increas'd began
 to pierce aloft in air the soaring swan
 and from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane
 the tuscan matrons with each other vied
 to bless their rival sons with such a bride
 but she disdains their love to share with me
 the sylvan shades and vow'd virginity
 and o i wish contented with my cares
 of salvage spoils she had not sought the wars
 then had she been of my celestial train
 and shunn'd the fate that dooms her to be slain
 but since opposing heav'n's decree she goes
 to find her death among forbidden foes
 haste with these arms and take thy steepy flight
 where with the gods averse the latins fight
 this bow to thee this quiver i bequeath
 this chosen arrow to revenge her death
 by whate'er hand camilla shall be slain
 or of the trojan or italian train
 let him not pass unpunish'd from the plain
 then in a hollow cloud myself will aid
 to bear the breathless body of my maid
 unspoil'd shall be her arms and unprofan'd
 her holy limbs with any human hand
 and in a marble tomb laid in her native land"

 she said the faithful nymph descends from high
 with rapid flight and cuts the sounding sky
 black clouds and stormy winds around her body fly

 by this the trojan and the tuscan horse
 drawn up in squadrons with united force
 approach the walls the sprightly coursers bound
 press forward on their bits and shift their ground
 shields arms and spears flash horribly from far
 and the fields glitter with a waving war
 oppos'd to these come on with furious force
 messapus coras and the latian horse
 these in the body plac'd on either hand
 sustain'd and clos'd by fair camilla's band
 advancing in a line they couch their spears
 and less and less the middle space appears
 thick smoke obscures the field and scarce are seen
 the neighing coursers and the shouting men
 in distance of their darts they stop their course
 then man to man they rush and horse to horse
 the face of heav'n their flying jav'lins hide
 and deaths unseen are dealt on either side
 tyrrhenus and aconteus void of fear
 by mettled coursers borne in full career
 meet first oppos'd and with a mighty shock
 their horses' heads against each other knock
 far from his steed is fierce aconteus cast
 as with an engine's force or lightning's blast
 he rolls along in blood and breathes his last
 the latin squadrons take a sudden fright
 and sling their shields behind to save their backs in flight
 spurring at speed to their own walls they drew
 close in the rear the tuscan troops pursue
 and urge their flight asylas leads the chase
 till seiz'd with shame they wheel about and face
 receive their foes and raise a threat'ning cry
 the tuscans take their turn to fear and fly
 so swelling surges with a thund'ring roar
 driv'n on each other's backs insult the shore
 bound o'er the rocks incroach upon the land
 and far upon the beach eject the sand
 then backward with a swing they take their way
 repuls'd from upper ground and seek their mother sea
 with equal hurry quit th' invaded shore
 and swallow back the sand and stones they spew'd before

 twice were the tuscans masters of the field
 twice by the latins in their turn repell'd
 asham'd at length to the third charge they ran
 both hosts resolv'd and mingled man to man
 now dying groans are heard the fields are strow'd
 with falling bodies and are drunk with blood
 arms horses men on heaps together lie
 confus'd the fight and more confus'd the cry
 orsilochus who durst not press too near
 strong remulus at distance drove his spear
 and stuck the steel beneath his horse's ear
 the fiery steed impatient of the wound
 curvets and springing upward with a bound
 his helpless lord cast backward on the ground
 catillus pierc'd iolas first then drew
 his reeking lance and at herminius threw
 the mighty champion of the tuscan crew
 his neck and throat unarm'd his head was bare
 but shaded with a length of yellow hair
 secure he fought expos'd on ev'ry part
 a spacious mark for swords and for the flying dart
 across the shoulders came the feather'd wound
 transfix'd he fell and doubled to the ground
 the sands with streaming blood are sanguine dyed
 and death with honor sought on either side

 resistless thro' the war camilla rode
 in danger unappall'd and pleas'd with blood
 one side was bare for her exerted breast
 one shoulder with her painted quiver press'd
 now from afar her fatal jav'lins play
 now with her ax's edge she hews her way
 diana's arms upon her shoulder sound
 and when too closely press'd she quits the ground
 from her bent bow she sends a backward wound
 her maids in martial pomp on either side
 larina tulla fierce tarpeia ride
 italians all in peace their queen's delight
 in war the bold companions of the fight
 so march'd the tracian amazons of old
 when thermodon with bloody billows roll'd
 such troops as these in shining arms were seen
 when theseus met in fight their maiden queen
 such to the field penthisilea led
 from the fierce virgin when the grecians fled
 with such return'd triumphant from the war
 her maids with cries attend the lofty car
 they clash with manly force their moony shields
 with female shouts resound the phrygian fields

 who foremost and who last heroic maid
 on the cold earth were by thy courage laid
 thy spear of mountain ash eumenius first
 with fury driv'n from side to side transpierc'd
 a purple stream came spouting from the wound
 bath'd in his blood he lies and bites the ground
 liris and pegasus at once she slew
 the former as the slacken'd reins he drew
 of his faint steed the latter as he stretch'd
 his arm to prop his friend the jav'lin reach'd
 by the same weapon sent from the same hand
 both fall together and both spurn the sand
 amastrus next is added to the slain
 the rest in rout she follows o'er the plain
 tereus harpalycus demophoon
 and chromis at full speed her fury shun
 of all her deadly darts not one she lost
 each was attended with a trojan ghost
 young ornithus bestrode a hunter steed
 swift for the chase and of apulian breed
 him from afar she spied in arms unknown
 o'er his broad back an ox's hide was thrown
 his helm a wolf whose gaping jaws were spread
 a cov'ring for his cheeks and grinn'd around his head
 he clench'd within his hand an iron prong
 and tower'd above the rest conspicuous in the throng
 him soon she singled from the flying train
 and slew with ease then thus insults the slain
 "vain hunter didst thou think thro' woods to chase
 the savage herd a vile and trembling race
 here cease thy vaunts and own my victory
 a woman warrior was too strong for thee
 yet if the ghosts demand the conqu'ror's name
 confessing great camilla save thy shame"
 then butes and orsilochus she slew
 the bulkiest bodies of the trojan crew
 but butes breast to breast the spear descends
 above the gorget where his helmet ends
 and o'er the shield which his left side defends
 orsilochus and she their courses ply
 he seems to follow and she seems to fly
 but in a narrower ring she makes the race
 and then he flies and she pursues the chase
 gath'ring at length on her deluded foe
 she swings her ax and rises to the blow
 full on the helm behind with such a sway
 the weapon falls the riven steel gives way
 he groans he roars he sues in vain for grace
 brains mingled with his blood besmear his face

 astonish'd aunus just arrives by chance
 to see his fall nor farther dares advance
 but fixing on the horrid maid his eye
 he stares and shakes and finds it vain to fly
 yet like a true ligurian born to cheat
 at least while fortune favor'd his deceit
 cries out aloud "what courage have you shown
 who trust your courser's strength and not your own
 forego the vantage of your horse alight
 and then on equal terms begin the fight
 it shall be seen weak woman what you can
 when foot to foot you combat with a man"
 he said she glows with anger and disdain
 dismounts with speed to dare him on the plain
 and leaves her horse at large among her train
 with her drawn sword defies him to the field
 and marching lifts aloft her maiden shield
 the youth who thought his cunning did succeed
 reins round his horse and urges all his speed
 adds the remembrance of the spur and hides
 the goring rowels in his bleeding sides
 "vain fool and coward" cries the lofty maid
 "caught in the train which thou thyself hast laid
 on others practice thy ligurian arts
 thin stratagems and tricks of little hearts
 are lost on me nor shalt thou safe retire
 with vaunting lies to thy fallacious sire"
 at this so fast her flying feet she sped
 that soon she strain'd beyond his horse's head
 then turning short at once she seiz'd the rein
 and laid the boaster grov'ling on the plain
 not with more ease the falcon from above
 trusses in middle air the trembling dove
 then plumes the prey in her strong pounces bound
 the feathers foul with blood come tumbling to the ground

 now mighty jove from his superior height
 with his broad eye surveys th' unequal fight
 he fires the breast of tarchon with disdain
 and sends him to redeem th' abandon'd plain
 betwixt the broken ranks the tuscan rides
 and these encourages and those he chides
 recalls each leader by his name from flight
 renews their ardor and restores the fight
 "what panic fear has seiz'd your souls o shame
 o brand perpetual of th' etrurian name
 cowards incurable a woman's hand
 drives breaks and scatters your ignoble band
 now cast away the sword and quit the shield
 what use of weapons which you dare not wield
 not thus you fly your female foes by night
 nor shun the feast when the full bowls invite
 when to fat off'rings the glad augur calls
 and the shrill hornpipe sounds to bacchanals
 these are your studied cares your lewd delight
 swift to debauch but slow to manly fight"
 thus having said he spurs amid the foes
 not managing the life he meant to lose
 the first he found he seiz'd with headlong haste
 in his strong gripe and clasp'd around the waist
 't was venulus whom from his horse he tore
 and laid athwart his own in triumph bore
 loud shouts ensue the latins turn their eyes
 and view th' unusual sight with vast surprise
 the fiery tarchon flying o'er the plains
 press'd in his arms the pond'rous prey sustains
 then with his shorten'd spear explores around
 his jointed arms to fix a deadly wound
 nor less the captive struggles for his life
 he writhes his body to prolong the strife
 and fencing for his naked throat exerts
 his utmost vigor and the point averts
 so stoops the yellow eagle from on high
 and bears a speckled serpent thro' the sky
 fast'ning his crooked talons on the prey
 the pris'ner hisses thro' the liquid way
 resists the royal hawk and tho' oppress'd
 she fights in volumes and erects her crest
 turn'd to her foe she stiffens ev'ry scale
 and shoots her forky tongue and whisks her threat'ning tail
 against the victor all defense is weak
 th' imperial bird still plies her with his beak
 he tears her bowels and her breast he gores
 then claps his pinions and securely soars
 thus thro' the midst of circling enemies
 strong tarchon snatch'd and bore away his prize
 the tyrrhene troops that shrunk before now press
 the latins and presume the like success

 then aruns doom'd to death his arts assay'd
 to murther unespied the volscian maid
 this way and that his winding course he bends
 and whereso'er she turns her steps attends
 when she retires victorious from the chase
 he wheels about with care and shifts his place
 when rushing on she seeks her foes flight
 he keeps aloof but keeps her still in sight
 he threats and trembles trying ev'ry way
 unseen to kill and safely to betray
 chloreus the priest of cybele from far
 glitt'ring in phrygian arms amidst the war
 was by the virgin view'd the steed he press'd
 was proud with trappings and his brawny chest
 with scales of gilded brass was cover'd o'er
 a robe of tyrian dye the rider wore
 with deadly wounds he gall'd the distant foe
 gnossian his shafts and lycian was his bow
 a golden helm his front and head surrounds
 a gilded quiver from his shoulder sounds
 gold weav'd with linen on his thighs he wore
 with flowers of needlework distinguish'd o'er
 with golden buckles bound and gather'd up before
 him the fierce maid beheld with ardent eyes
 fond and ambitious of so rich a prize
 or that the temple might his trophies hold
 or else to shine herself in trojan gold
 blind in her haste she chases him alone
 and seeks his life regardless of her own

 this lucky moment the sly traitor chose
 then starting from his ambush up he rose
 and threw but first to heav'n address'd his vows
 "o patron of socrates' high abodes
 phoebus the ruling pow'r among the gods
 whom first we serve whole woods of unctuous pine
 are fell'd for thee and to thy glory shine
 by thee protected with our naked soles
 thro' flames unsing'd we march and tread the kindled coals
 give me propitious pow'r to wash away
 the stains of this dishonorable day
 nor spoils nor triumph from the fact i claim
 but with my future actions trust my fame
 let me by stealth this female plague o'ercome
 and from the field return inglorious home"
 apollo heard and granting half his pray'r
 shuffled in winds the rest and toss'd in empty air
 he gives the death desir'd his safe return
 by southern tempests to the seas is borne

 now when the jav'lin whizz'd along the skies
 both armies on camilla turn'd their eyes
 directed by the sound of either host
 th' unhappy virgin tho' concern'd the most
 was only deaf so greedy was she bent
 on golden spoils and on her prey intent
 till in her pap the winged weapon stood
 infix'd and deeply drunk the purple blood
 her sad attendants hasten to sustain
 their dying lady drooping on the plain
 far from their sight the trembling aruns flies
 with beating heart and fear confus'd with joys
 nor dares he farther to pursue his blow
 or ev'n to bear the sight of his expiring foe
 as when the wolf has torn a bullock's hide
 at unawares or ranch'd a shepherd's side
 conscious of his audacious deed he flies
 and claps his quiv'ring tail between his thighs
 so speeding once the wretch no more attends
 but spurring forward herds among his friends

 she wrench'd the jav'lin with her dying hands
 but wedg'd within her breast the weapon stands
 the wood she draws the steely point remains
 she staggers in her seat with agonizing pains
 a gath'ring mist o'erclouds her cheerful eyes
 and from her cheeks the rosy color flies
 then turns to her whom of her female train
 she trusted most and thus she speaks with pain
 "acca 't is past he swims before my sight
 inexorable death and claims his right
 bear my last words to turnus fly with speed
 and bid him timely to my charge succeed
 repel the trojans and the town relieve
 farewell and in this kiss my parting breath receive"
 she said and sliding sunk upon the plain
 dying her open'd hand forsakes the rein
 short and more short she pants by slow degrees
 her mind the passage from her body frees
 she drops her sword she nods her plumy crest
 her drooping head declining on her breast
 in the last sigh her struggling soul expires
 and murm'ring with disdain to stygian sounds retires

 a shout that struck the golden stars ensued
 despair and rage the languish'd fight renew'd
 the trojan troops and tuscans in a line
 advance to charge the mix'd arcadians join

 but cynthia's maid high seated from afar
 surveys the field and fortune of the war
 unmov'd a while till prostrate on the plain
 welt'ring in blood she sees camilla slain
 and round her corpse of friends and foes a fighting train
 then from the bottom of her breast she drew
 a mournful sigh and these sad words ensue
 "too dear a fine ah much lamented maid
 for warring with the trojans thou hast paid
 nor aught avail'd in this unhappy strife
 diana's sacred arms to save thy life
 yet unreveng'd thy goddess will not leave
 her vot'ry's death nor with vain sorrow grieve
 branded the wretch and be his name abhorr'd
 but after ages shall thy praise record
 th' inglorious coward soon shall press the plain
 thus vows thy queen and thus the fates ordain"

 high o'er the field there stood a hilly mound
 sacred the place and spread with oaks around
 where in a marble tomb dercennus lay
 a king that once in latium bore the sway
 the beauteous opis thither bent her flight
 to mark the traitor aruns from the height
 him in refulgent arms she soon espied
 swoln with success and loudly thus she cried
 "thy backward steps vain boaster are too late
 turn like a man at length and meet thy fate
 charg'd with my message to camilla go
 and say i sent thee to the shades below
 an honor undeserv'd from cynthia's bow"

 she said and from her quiver chose with speed
 the winged shaft predestin'd for the deed
 then to the stubborn yew her strength applied
 till the far distant horns approach'd on either side
 the bowstring touch'd her breast so strong she drew
 whizzing in air the fatal arrow flew
 at once the twanging bow and sounding dart
 the traitor heard and felt the point within his heart
 him beating with his heels in pangs of death
 his flying friends to foreign fields bequeath
 the conqu'ring damsel with expanded wings
 the welcome message to her mistress brings

 their leader lost the volscians quit the field
 and unsustain'd the chiefs of turnus yield
 the frighted soldiers when their captains fly
 more on their speed than on their strength rely
 confus'd in flight they bear each other down
 and spur their horses headlong to the town
 driv'n by their foes and to their fears resign'd
 not once they turn but take their wounds behind
 these drop the shield and those the lance forego
 or on their shoulders bear the slacken'd bow
 the hoofs of horses with a rattling sound
 beat short and thick and shake the rotten ground
 black clouds of dust come rolling in the sky
 and o'er the darken'd walls and rampires fly
 the trembling matrons from their lofty stands
 rend heav'n with female shrieks and wring their hands
 all pressing on pursuers and pursued
 are crush'd in crowds a mingled multitude
 some happy few escape the throng too late
 rush on for entrance till they choke the gate
 ev'n in the sight of home the wretched sire
 looks on and sees his helpless son expire
 then in a fright the folding gates they close
 but leave their friends excluded with their foes
 the vanquish'd cry the victors loudly shout
 't is terror all within and slaughter all without
 blind in their fear they bounce against the wall
 or to the moats pursued precipitate their fall

 the latian virgins valiant with despair
 arm'd on the tow'rs the common danger share
 so much of zeal their country's cause inspir'd
 so much camilla's great example fir'd
 poles sharpen'd in the flames from high they throw
 with imitated darts to gall the foe
 their lives for godlike freedom they bequeath
 and crowd each other to be first in death
 meantime to turnus ambush'd in the shade
 with heavy tidings came th' unhappy maid
 "the volscians overthrown camilla kill'd
 the foes entirely masters of the field
 like a resistless flood come rolling on
 the cry goes off the plain and thickens to the town"

 inflam'd with rage for so the furies fire
 the daunian's breast and so the fates require
 he leaves the hilly pass the woods in vain
 possess'd and downward issues on the plain
 scarce was he gone when to the straits now freed
 from secret foes the trojan troops succeed
 thro' the black forest and the ferny brake
 unknowingly secure their way they take
 from the rough mountains to the plain descend
 and there in order drawn their line extend
 both armies now in open fields are seen
 nor far the distance of the space between
 both to the city bend aeneas sees
 thro' smoking fields his hast'ning enemies
 and turnus views the trojans in array
 and hears th' approaching horses proudly neigh
 soon had their hosts in bloody battle join'd
 but westward to the sea the sun declin'd
 intrench'd before the town both armies lie
 while night with sable wings involves the sky




 book xii

 when turnus saw the latins leave the field
 their armies broken and their courage quell'd
 himself become the mark of public spite
 his honor question'd for the promis'd fight
 the more he was with vulgar hate oppress'd
 the more his fury boil'd within his breast
 he rous'd his vigor for the last debate
 and rais'd his haughty soul to meet his fate

 as when the swains the libyan lion chase
 he makes a sour retreat nor mends his pace
 but if the pointed jav'lin pierce his side
 the lordly beast returns with double pride
 he wrenches out the steel he roars for pain
 his sides he lashes and erects his mane
 so turnus fares his eyeballs flash with fire
 thro' his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire

 trembling with rage around the court he ran
 at length approach'd the king and thus began
 "no more excuses or delays i stand
 in arms prepar'd to combat hand to hand
 this base deserter of his native land
 the trojan by his word is bound to take
 the same conditions which himself did make
 renew the truce the solemn rites prepare
 and to my single virtue trust the war
 the latians unconcern'd shall see the fight
 this arm unaided shall assert your right
 then if my prostrate body press the plain
 to him the crown and beauteous bride remain"

 to whom the king sedately thus replied
 "brave youth the more your valor has been tried
 the more becomes it us with due respect
 to weigh the chance of war which you neglect
 you want not wealth or a successive throne
 or cities which your arms have made your own
 my towns and treasures are at your command
 and stor'd with blooming beauties is my land
 laurentum more than one lavinia sees
 unmarried fair of noble families
 now let me speak and you with patience hear
 things which perhaps may grate a lover's ear
 but sound advice proceeding from a heart
 sincerely yours and free from fraudful art
 the gods by signs have manifestly shown
 no prince italian born should heir my throne
 oft have our augurs in prediction skill'd
 and oft our priests foreign son reveal'd
 yet won by worth that cannot be withstood
 brib'd by my kindness to my kindred blood
 urg'd by my wife who would not be denied
 i promis'd my lavinia for your bride
 her from her plighted lord by force i took
 all ties of treaties and of honor broke
 on your account i wag'd an impious war
 with what success 't is needless to declare
 i and my subjects feel and you have had your share
 twice vanquish'd while in bloody fields we strive
 scarce in our walls we keep our hopes alive
 the rolling flood runs warm with human gore
 the bones of latians blanch the neighb'ring shore
 why put i not an end to this debate
 still unresolv'd and still a slave to fate
 if turnus' death a lasting peace can give
 why should i not procure it whilst you live
 should i to doubtful arms your youth betray
 what would my kinsmen the rutulians say
 and should you fall in fight which heav'n defend
 how curse the cause which hasten'd to his end
 the daughter's lover and the father's friend
 weigh in your mind the various chance of war
 pity your parent's age and ease his care"

 such balmy words he pour'd but all in vain
 the proffer'd med'cine but provok'd the pain
 the wrathful youth disdaining the relief
 with intermitting sobs thus vents his grief
 "the care o best of fathers which you take
 for my concerns at my desire forsake
 permit me not to languish out my days
 but make the best exchange of life for praise
 this arm this lance can well dispute the prize
 and the blood follows where the weapon flies
 his goddess mother is not near to shroud
 the flying coward with an empty cloud"

 but now the queen who fear'd for turnus' life
 and loath'd the hard conditions of the strife
 held him by force and dying in his death
 in these sad accents gave her sorrow breath
 "o turnus i adjure thee by these tears
 and whate'er price amata's honor bears
 within thy breast since thou art all my hope
 my sickly mind's repose my sinking age's prop
 since on the safety of thy life alone
 depends latinus and the latian throne
 refuse me not this one this only pray'r
 to waive the combat and pursue the war
 whatever chance attends this fatal strife
 think it includes in thine amata's life
 i cannot live a slave or see my throne
 usurp'd by strangers or a trojan son"

 at this a flood of tears lavinia shed
 a crimson blush her beauteous face o'erspread
 varying her cheeks by turns with white and red
 the driving colors never at a stay
 run here and there and flush and fade away
 delightful change thus indian iv'ry shows
 which with the bord'ring paint of purple glows
 or lilies damask'd by the neighb'ring rose

 the lover gaz'd and burning with desire
 the more he look'd the more he fed the fire
 revenge and jealous rage and secret spite
 roll in his breast and rouse him to the fight
 then fixing on the queen his ardent eyes
 firm to his first intent he thus replies
 "o mother do not by your tears prepare
 such boding omens and prejudge the war
 resolv'd on fight i am no longer free
 to shun my death if heav'n my death decree"
 then turning to the herald thus pursues
 "go greet the trojan with ungrateful news
 denounce from me that when tomorrow's light
 shall gild the heav'ns he need not urge the fight
 the trojan and rutulian troops no more
 shall dye with mutual blood the latian shore
 our single swords the quarrel shall decide
 and to the victor be the beauteous bride"

 he said and striding on with speedy pace
 he sought his coursers of the thracian race
 at his approach they toss their heads on high
 and proudly neighing promise victory
 the sires of these orythia sent from far
 to grace pilumnus when he went to war
 the drifts of thracian snows were scarce so white
 nor northern winds in fleetness match'd their flight
 officious grooms stand ready by his side
 and some with combs their flowing manes divide
 and others stroke their chests and gently soothe their pride

 he sheath'd his limbs in arms a temper'd mass
 of golden metal those and mountain brass
 then to his head his glitt'ring helm he tied
 and girt his faithful fauchion to his side
 in his aetnaean forge the god of fire
 that fauchion labor'd for the hero's sire
 immortal keenness on the blade bestow'd
 and plung'd it hissing in the stygian flood
 propp'd on a pillar which the ceiling bore
 was plac'd the lance auruncan actor wore
 which with such force he brandish'd in his hand
 the tough ash trembled like an osier wand
 then cried "o pond'rous spoil of actor slain
 and never yet by turnus toss'd in vain
 fail not this day thy wonted force but go
 sent by this hand to pierce the trojan foe
 give me to tear his corslet from his breast
 and from that eunuch head to rend the crest
 dragg'd in the dust his frizzled hair to soil
 hot from the vexing ir'n and smear'd with fragrant oil"

 thus while he raves from his wide nostrils flies
 a fiery steam and sparkles from his eyes
 so fares the bull in his lov'd female's sight
 proudly he bellows and preludes the fight
 he tries his goring horns against a tree
 and meditates his absent enemy
 he pushes at the winds he digs the strand
 with his black hoofs and spurns the yellow sand

 nor less the trojan in his lemnian arms
 to future fight his manly courage warms
 he whets his fury and with joy prepares
 to terminate at once the ling'ring wars
 to cheer his chiefs and tender son relates
 what heav'n had promis'd and expounds the fates
 then to the latian king he sends to cease
 the rage of arms and ratify the peace

 the morn ensuing from the mountain's height
 had scarcely spread the skies with rosy light
 th' ethereal coursers bounding from the sea
 from out their flaming nostrils breath'd the day
 when now the trojan and rutulian guard
 in friendly labor join'd the list prepar'd
 beneath the walls they measure out the space
 then sacred altars rear on sods of grass
 where with religious their common gods they place
 in purest white the priests their heads attire
 and living waters bear and holy fire
 and o'er their linen hoods and shaded hair
 long twisted wreaths of sacred veryain wear

 in order issuing from the town appears
 the latin legion arm'd with pointed spears
 and from the fields advancing on a line
 the trojan and the tuscan forces join
 their various arms afford a pleasing sight
 a peaceful train they seem in peace prepar'd for fight
 betwixt the ranks the proud commanders ride
 glitt'ring with gold and vests in purple dyed
 here mnestheus author of the memmian line
 and there messapus born of seed divine
 the sign is giv'n and round the listed space
 each man in order fills his proper place
 reclining on their ample shields they stand
 and fix their pointed lances in the sand
 now studious of the sight a num'rous throng
 of either sex promiscuous old and young
 swarm the town by those who rest behind
 the gates and walls and houses' tops are lin'd
 meantime the queen of heav'n beheld the sight
 with eyes unpleas'd from mount albano's height
 since call'd albano by succeeding fame
 but then an empty hill without a name
 she thence survey'd the field the trojan pow'rs
 the latian squadrons and laurentine tow'rs
 then thus the goddess of the skies bespoke
 with sighs and tears the goddess of the lake
 king turnus' sister once a lovely maid
 ere to the lust of lawless jove betray'd
 compress'd by force but by the grateful god
 now made the nais of the neighb'ring flood
 "o nymph the pride of living lakes" said she
 "o most renown'd and most belov'd by me
 long hast thou known nor need i to record
 the wanton sallies of my wand'ring lord
 of ev'ry latian fair whom jove misled
 to mount by stealth my violated bed
 to thee alone i grudg'd not his embrace
 but gave a part of heav'n and an unenvied place
 now learn from me thy near approaching grief
 nor think my wishes want to thy relief
 while fortune favor'd nor heav'n's king denied
 to lend my succor to the latian side
 i sav'd thy brother and the sinking state
 but now he struggles with unequal fate
 and goes with gods averse o'ermatch'd in might
 to meet inevitable death in fight
 nor must i break the truce nor can sustain the sight
 thou if thou dar'st thy present aid supply
 it well becomes a sister's care to try"

 at this the lovely nymph with grief oppress'd
 thrice tore her hair and beat her comely breast
 to whom saturnia thus "thy tears are late
 haste snatch him if he can be snatch'd from fate
 new tumults kindle violate the truce
 who knows what changeful fortune may produce
 't is not a crime t' attempt what i decree
 or if it were discharge the crime on me"
 she said and sailing on the winged wind
 left the sad nymph suspended in her mind

 and now pomp the peaceful kings appear
 four steeds the chariot of latinus bear
 twelve golden beams around his temples play
 to mark his lineage from the god of day
 two snowy coursers turnus' chariot yoke
 and in his hand two massy spears he shook
 then issued from the camp in arms divine
 aeneas author of the roman line
 and by his side ascanius took his place
 the second hope of rome's immortal race
 adorn'd in white a rev'rend priest appears
 and off'rings to the flaming altars bears
 a porket and a lamb that never suffer'd shears
 then to the rising sun he turns his eyes
 and strews the beasts design'd for sacrifice
 with salt and meal with like officious care
 he marks their foreheads and he clips their hair
 betwixt their horns the purple wine he sheds
 with the same gen'rous juice the flame he feeds

 aeneas then unsheath'd his shining sword
 and thus with pious pray'rs the gods ador'd
 "allseeing sun and thou ausonian soil
 for which i have sustain'd so long a toil
 thou king of heav'n and thou the queen of air
 propitious now and reconcil'd by pray'r
 thou god of war whose unresisted sway
 the labors and events of arms obey
 ye living fountains and ye running floods
 all pow'rs of ocean all ethereal gods
 hear and bear record if i fall in field
 or recreant in the fight to turnus yield
 my trojans shall encrease evander's town
 ascanius shall renounce th' ausonian crown
 all claims all questions of debate shall cease
 nor he nor they with force infringe the peace
 but if my juster arms prevail in fight
 as sure they shall if i divine aright
 my trojans shall not o'er th' italians reign
 both equal both unconquer'd shall remain
 join'd in their laws their lands and their abodes
 i ask but altars for my weary gods
 the care of those religious rites be mine
 the crown to king latinus i resign
 his be the sov'reign sway nor will i share
 his pow'r in peace or his command in war
 for me my friends another town shall frame
 and bless the rising tow'rs with fair lavinia's name"

 thus he then with erected eyes and hands
 the latian king before his altar stands
 "by the same heav'n" said he "and earth and main
 and all the pow'rs that all the three contain
 by hell below and by that upper god
 whose thunder signs the peace who seals it with his nod
 so let latona's double offspring hear
 and doublefronted janus what i swear
 i touch the sacred altars touch the flames
 and all those pow'rs attest and all their names
 whatever chance befall on either side
 no term of time this union shall divide
 no force no fortune shall my vows unbind
 or shake the steadfast tenor of my mind
 not tho' the circling seas should break their bound
 o'erflow the shores or sap the solid ground
 not tho' the lamps of heav'n their spheres forsake
 hurl'd down and hissing in the nether lake
 ev'n as this royal scepter" for he bore
 a scepter in his hand "shall never more
 shoot out in branches or renew the birth
 an orphan now cut from the mother earth
 by the keen ax dishonor'd of its hair
 and cas'd in brass for latian kings to bear"

 when thus in public view the peace was tied
 with solemn vows and sworn on either side
 all dues perform'd which holy rites require
 the victim beasts are slain before the fire
 the trembling entrails from their bodies torn
 and to the fatten'd flames in chargers borne

 already the rutulians deem their man
 o'ermatch'd in arms before the fight began
 first rising fears are whisper'd thro' the crowd
 then gath'ring sound they murmur more aloud
 now side to side they measure with their eyes
 the champions' bulk their sinews and their size
 the nearer they approach the more is known
 th' apparent disadvantage of their own
 turnus himself appears in public sight
 conscious of fate desponding of the fight
 slowly he moves and at his altar stands
 with eyes dejected and with trembling hands
 and while he mutters undistinguish'd pray'rs
 a livid deadness in his cheeks appears

 with anxious pleasure when juturna view'd
 th' increasing fright of the mad multitude
 when their short sighs and thick'ning sobs she heard
 and found their ready minds for change prepar'd
 dissembling her immortal form she took
 camertus' mien his habit and his look
 a chief of ancient blood in arms well known
 was his great sire and he his greater son
 his shape assum'd amid the ranks she ran
 and humoring their first motions thus began
 "for shame rutulians can you bear the sight
 of one expos'd for all in single fight
 can we before the face of heav'n confess
 our courage colder or our numbers less
 view all the trojan host th' arcadian band
 and tuscan army count 'em as they stand
 undaunted to the battle if we go
 scarce ev'ry second man will share a foe
 turnus 't is true in this unequal strife
 shall lose with honor his devoted life
 or change it rather for immortal fame
 succeeding to the gods from whence he came
 but you a servile and inglorious band
 for foreign lords shall sow your native land
 those fruitful fields your fighting fathers gain'd
 which have so long their lazy sons sustain'd"
 with words like these she carried her design
 a rising murmur runs along the line
 then ev'n the city troops and latians tir'd
 with tedious war seem with new souls inspir'd
 their champion's fate with pity they lament
 and of the league so lately sworn repent

 nor fails the goddess to foment the rage
 with lying wonders and a false presage
 but adds a sign which present to their eyes
 inspires new courage and a glad surprise
 for sudden in the fiery tracts above
 appears in pomp th' imperial bird of jove
 a plump of fowl he spies that swim the lakes
 and o'er their heads his sounding pinions shakes
 then stooping on the fairest of the train
 in his strong talons truss'd a silver swan
 th' italians wonder at th' unusual sight
 but while he lags and labors in his flight
 behold the dastard fowl return anew
 and with united force the foe pursue
 clam'rous around the royal hawk they fly
 and thick'ning in a cloud o'ershade the sky
 they cuff they scratch they cross his airy course
 nor can th' incumber'd bird sustain their force
 but vex'd not vanquish'd drops the pond'rous prey
 and lighten'd of his burthen wings his way

 th' ausonian bands with shouts salute the sight
 eager of action and demand the fight
 then king tolumnius vers'd in augurs' arts
 cries out and thus his boasted skill imparts
 "at length 't is granted what i long desir'd
 this this is what my frequent vows requir'd
 ye gods i take your omen and obey
 advance my friends and charge i lead the way
 these are the foreign foes whose impious band
 like that rapacious bird infest our land
 but soon like him they shall be forc'd to sea
 by strength united and forego the prey
 your timely succor to your country bring
 haste to the rescue and redeem your king"

 he said and pressing onward thro' the crew
 pois'd in his lifted arm his lance he threw
 the winged weapon whistling in the wind
 came driving on nor miss'd the mark design'd
 at once the cornel rattled in the skies
 at once tumultuous shouts and clamors rise
 nine brothers in a goodly band there stood
 born of arcadian mix'd with tuscan blood
 gylippus' sons the fatal jav'lin flew
 aim'd at the midmost of the friendly crew
 a passage thro' the jointed arms it found
 just where the belt was to the body bound
 and struck the gentle youth extended on the ground
 then fir'd with pious rage the gen'rous train
 run madly forward to revenge the slain
 and some with eager haste their jav'lins throw
 and some with sword in hand assault the foe

 the wish'd insult the latine troops embrace
 and meet their ardor in the middle space
 the trojans tuscans and arcadian line
 with equal courage obviate their design
 peace leaves the violated fields and hate
 both armies urges to their mutual fate
 with impious haste their altars are o'erturn'd
 the sacrifice halfbroil'd and halfunburn'd
 thick storms of steel from either army fly
 and clouds of clashing darts obscure the sky
 brands from the fire are missive weapons made
 with chargers bowls and all the priestly trade
 latinus frighted hastens from the fray
 and bears his unregarded gods away
 these on their horses vault those yoke the car
 the rest with swords on high run headlong to the war

 messapus eager to confound the peace
 spurr'd his hot courser thro' the fighting prease
 at king aulestes by his purple known
 a tuscan prince and by his regal crown
 and with a shock encount'ring bore him down
 backward he fell and as his fate design'd
 the ruins of an altar were behind
 there pitching on his shoulders and his head
 amid the scatt'ring fires he lay supinely spread
 the beamy spear descending from above
 his cuirass pierc'd and thro' his body drove
 then with a scornful smile the victor cries
 "the gods have found a fitter sacrifice"
 greedy of spoils th' italians strip the dead
 of his rich armor and uncrown his head

 priest corynaeus arm'd his better hand
 from his own altar with a blazing brand
 and as ebusus with a thund'ring pace
 advanc'd to battle dash'd it on his face
 his bristly beard shines out with sudden fires
 the crackling crop a noisome scent expires
 following the blow he seiz'd his curling crown
 with his left hand his other cast him down
 the prostrate body with his knees he press'd
 and plung'd his holy poniard in his breast

 while podalirius with his sword pursued
 the shepherd alsus thro' the flying crowd
 swiftly he turns and aims a deadly blow
 full on the front of his unwary foe
 the broad ax enters with a crashing sound
 and cleaves the chin with one continued wound
 warm blood and mingled brains besmear his arms around
 an iron sleep his stupid eyes oppress'd
 and seal'd their heavy lids in endless rest

 but good aeneas rush'd amid the bands
 bare was his head and naked were his hands
 in sign of truce then thus he cries aloud
 "what sudden rage what new desire of blood
 inflames your alter'd minds o trojans cease
 from impious arms nor violate the peace
 by human sanctions and by laws divine
 the terms are all agreed the war is mine
 dismiss your fears and let the fight ensue
 this hand alone shall right the gods and you
 our injur'd altars and their broken vow
 to this avenging sword the faithless turnus owe"

 thus while he spoke unmindful of defense
 a winged arrow struck the pious prince
 but whether from some human hand it came
 or hostile god is left unknown by fame
 no human hand or hostile god was found
 to boast the triumph of so base a wound

 when turnus saw the trojan quit the plain
 his chiefs dismay'd his troops a fainting train
 th' unhop'd event his heighten'd soul inspires
 at once his arms and coursers he requires
 then with a leap his lofty chariot gains
 and with a ready hand assumes the reins
 he drives impetuous and where'er he goes
 he leaves behind a lane of slaughter'd foes
 these his lance reaches over those he rolls
 his rapid car and crushes out their souls
 in vain the vanquish'd fly the victor sends
 the dead men's weapons at their living friends
 thus on the banks of hebrus' freezing flood
 the god of battles in his angry mood
 clashing his sword against his brazen shield
 let loose the reins and scours along the field
 before the wind his fiery coursers fly
 groans the sad earth resounds the rattling sky
 wrath terror treason tumult and despair
 dire faces and deform'd surround the car
 friends of the god and followers of the war
 with fury not unlike nor less disdain
 exulting turnus flies along the plain
 his smoking horses at their utmost speed
 he lashes on and urges o'er the dead
 their fetlocks run with blood and when they bound
 the gore and gath'ring dust are dash'd around
 thamyris and pholus masters of the war
 he kill'd at hand but sthenelus afar
 from far the sons of imbracus he slew
 glaucus and lades of the lycian crew
 both taught to fight on foot in battle join'd
 or mount the courser that outstrips the wind

 meantime eumedes vaunting in the field
 new fir'd the trojans and their foes repell'd
 this son of dolon bore his grandsire's name
 but emulated more his father's fame
 his guileful father sent a nightly spy
 the grecian camp and order to descry
 hard enterprise and well he might require
 achilles' car and horses for his hire
 but met upon the scout th' aetolian prince
 in death bestow'd a juster recompense
 fierce turnus view'd the trojan from afar
 and launch'd his jav'lin from his lofty car
 then lightly leaping down pursued the blow
 and pressing with his foot his prostrate foe
 wrench'd from his feeble hold the shining sword
 and plung'd it in the bosom of its lord
 "possess" said he "the fruit of all thy pains
 and measure at thy length our latian plains
 thus are my foes rewarded by my hand
 thus may they build their town and thus enjoy the land"

 then dares butes sybaris he slew
 whom o'er his neck his flound'ring courser threw
 as when loud boreas with his blust'ring train
 stoops from above incumbent on the main
 where'er he flies he drives the rack before
 and rolls the billows on th' aegaean shore
 so where resistless turnus takes his course
 the scatter'd squadrons bend before his force
 his crest of horses' hair is blown behind
 by adverse air and rustles in the wind

 this haughty phegeus saw with high disdain
 and as the chariot roll'd along the plain
 light from the ground he leapt and seiz'd the rein
 thus hung in air he still retain'd his hold
 the coursers frighted and their course controll'd
 the lance of turnus reach'd him as he hung
 and pierc'd his plated arms but pass'd along
 and only raz'd the skin he turn'd and held
 against his threat'ning foe his ample shield
 then call'd for aid but while he cried in vain
 the chariot bore him backward on the plain
 he lies revers'd the victor king descends
 and strikes so justly where his helmet ends
 he lops the head the latian fields are drunk
 with streams that issue from the bleeding trunk

 while he triumphs and while the trojans yield
 the wounded prince is forc'd to leave the field
 strong mnestheus and achates often tried
 and young ascanius weeping by his side
 conduct him to his tent scarce can he rear
 his limbs from earth supported on his spear
 resolv'd in mind regardless of the smart
 he tugs with both his hands and breaks the dart
 the steel remains no readier way he found
 to draw the weapon than t' inlarge the wound
 eager of fight impatient of delay
 he begs and his unwilling friends obey

 iapis was at hand to prove his art
 whose blooming youth so fir'd apollo's heart
 that for his love he proffer'd to bestow
 his tuneful harp and his unerring bow
 the pious youth more studious how to save
 his aged sire now sinking to the grave
 preferr'd the pow'r of plants and silent praise
 of healing arts before phoebean bays

 propp'd on his lance the pensive hero stood
 and heard and saw unmov'd the mourning crowd
 the fam'd physician tucks his robes around
 with ready hands and hastens to the wound
 with gentle touches he performs his part
 this way and that soliciting the dart
 and exercises all his heav'nly art
 all soft'ning simples known of sov'reign use
 he presses out and pours their noble juice
 these first infus'd to lenify the pain
 he tugs with pincers but he tugs in vain
 then to the patron of his art he pray'd
 the patron of his art refus'd his aid

 meantime the war approaches to the tents
 th' alarm grows hotter and the noise augments
 the driving dust proclaims the danger near
 and first their friends and then their foes appear
 their friends retreat their foes pursue the rear
 the camp is fill'd with terror and affright
 the hissing shafts within the trench alight
 an undistinguish'd noise ascends the sky
 the shouts of those who kill and groans of those who die

 but now the goddess mother mov'd with grief
 and pierc'd with pity hastens her relief
 a branch of healing dittany she brought
 which in the cretan fields with care she sought
 rough is the stern which woolly leafs surround
 the leafs with flow'rs the flow'rs with purple crown'd
 well known to wounded goats a sure relief
 to draw the pointed steel and ease the grief
 this venus brings in clouds involv'd and brews
 th' extracted liquor with ambrosian dews
 and odorous panacee unseen she stands
 temp'ring the mixture with her heav'nly hands
 and pours it in a bowl already crown'd
 with juice of med'c'nal herbs prepar'd to bathe the wound
 the leech unknowing of superior art
 which aids the cure with this foments the part
 and in a moment ceas'd the raging smart
 stanch'd is the blood and in the bottom stands
 the steel but scarcely touch'd with tender hands
 moves up and follows of its own accord
 and health and vigor are at once restor'd
 iapis first perceiv'd the closing wound
 and first the footsteps of a god he found
 "arms arms" he cries "the sword and shield prepare
 and send the willing chief renew'd to war
 this is no mortal work no cure of mine
 nor art's effect but done by hands divine
 some god our general to the battle sends
 some god preserves his life for greater ends"

 the hero arms in haste his hands infold
 his thighs with cuishes of refulgent gold
 inflam'd to fight and rushing to the field
 that hand sustaining the celestial shield
 this gripes the lance and with such vigor shakes
 that to the rest the beamy weapon quakes
 then with a close embrace he strain'd his son
 and kissing thro' his helmet thus begun
 "my son from my example learn the war
 in camps to suffer and in fields to dare
 but happier chance than mine attend thy care
 this day my hand thy tender age shall shield
 and crown with honors of the conquer'd field
 thou when thy riper years shall send thee forth
 to toils of war be mindful of my worth
 assert thy birthright and in arms be known
 for hector's nephew and aeneas' son"
 he said and striding issued on the plain
 anteus and mnestheus and a num'rous train
 attend his steps the rest their weapons take
 and crowding to the field the camp forsake
 a cloud of blinding dust is rais'd around
 labors beneath their feet the trembling ground

 now turnus posted on a hill from far
 beheld the progress of the moving war
 with him the latins view'd the cover'd plains
 and the chill blood ran backward in their veins
 juturna saw th' advancing troops appear
 and heard the hostile sound and fled for fear
 aeneas leads and draws a sweeping train
 clos'd in their ranks and pouring on the plain
 as when a whirlwind rushing to the shore
 from the mid ocean drives the waves before
 the painful hind with heavy heart foresees
 the flatted fields and slaughter of the trees
 with like impetuous rage the prince appears
 before his doubled front nor less destruction bears
 and now both armies shock in open field
 osiris is by strong thymbraeus kill'd
 archetius ufens epulon are slain
 all fam'd in arms and of the latian train
 by gyas' mnestheus' and achates' hand
 the fatal augur falls by whose command
 the truce was broken and whose lance embrued
 with trojan blood th' unhappy fight renew'd
 loud shouts and clamors rend the liquid sky
 and o'er the field the frighted latins fly
 the prince disdains the dastards to pursue
 nor moves to meet in arms the fighting few
 turnus alone amid the dusky plain
 he seeks and to the combat calls in vain
 juturna heard and seiz'd with mortal fear
 forc'd from the beam her brother's charioteer
 assumes his shape his armor and his mien
 and like metiscus in his seat is seen

 as the black swallow near the palace plies
 o'er empty courts and under arches flies
 now hawks aloft now skims along the flood
 to furnish her loquacious nest with food
 so drives the rapid goddess o'er the plains
 the smoking horses run with loosen'd reins
 she steers a various course among the foes
 now here now there her conqu'ring brother shows
 now with a straight now with a wheeling flight
 she turns and bends but shuns the single fight
 aeneas fir'd with fury breaks the crowd
 and seeks his foe and calls by name aloud
 he runs within a narrower ring and tries
 to stop the chariot but the chariot flies
 if he but gain a glimpse juturna fears
 and far away the daunian hero bears

 what should he do nor arts nor arms avail
 and various cares in vain his mind assail
 the great messapus thund'ring thro' the field
 in his left hand two pointed jav'lins held
 encount'ring on the prince one dart he drew
 and with unerring aim and utmost vigor threw
 aeneas saw it come and stooping low
 beneath his buckler shunn'd the threat'ning blow
 the weapon hiss'd above his head and tore
 the waving plume which on his helm he wore
 forced by this hostile act and fir'd with spite
 that flying turnus still declin'd the fight
 the prince whose piety had long repell'd
 his inborn ardor now invades the field
 invokes the pow'rs of violated peace
 their rites and injur'd altars to redress
 then to his rage abandoning the rein
 with blood and slaughter'd bodies fills the plain

 what god can tell what numbers can display
 the various labors of that fatal day
 what chiefs and champions fell on either side
 in combat slain or by what deaths they died
 whom turnus whom the trojan hero kill'd
 who shar'd the fame and fortune of the field
 jove could'st thou view and not avert thy sight
 two jarring nations join'd in cruel fight
 whom leagues of lasting love so shortly shall unite

 aeneas first rutulian sucro found
 whose valor made the trojans quit their ground
 betwixt his ribs the jav'lin drove so just
 it reach'd his heart nor needs a second thrust
 now turnus at two blows two brethren slew
 first from his horse fierce amycus he threw
 then leaping on the ground on foot assail'd
 diores and in equal fight prevail'd
 their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place
 their heads distilling gore his chariot grace

 three cold on earth the trojan hero threw
 whom without respite at one charge he slew
 cethegus tanais tagus fell oppress'd
 and sad onythes added to the rest
 of theban blood whom peridia bore

 turnus two brothers from the lycian shore
 and from apollo's fane to battle sent
 o'erthrew nor phoebus could their fate prevent
 peaceful menoetes after these he kill'd
 who long had shunn'd the dangers of the field
 on lerna's lake a silent life he led
 and with his nets and angle earn'd his bread
 nor pompous cares nor palaces he knew
 but wisely from th' infectious world withdrew
 poor was his house his father's painful hand
 discharg'd his rent and plow'd another's land

 as flames among the lofty woods are thrown
 on diff'rent sides and both by winds are blown
 the laurels crackle in the sputt'ring fire
 the frighted sylvans from their shades retire
 or as two neighb'ring torrents fall from high
 rapid they run the foamy waters fry
 they roll to sea with unresisted force
 and down the rocks precipitate their course
 not with less rage the rival heroes take
 their diff'rent ways nor less destruction make
 with spears afar with swords at hand they strike
 and zeal of slaughter fires their souls alike
 like them their dauntless men maintain the field
 and hearts are pierc'd unknowing how to yield
 they blow for blow return and wound for wound
 and heaps of bodies raise the level ground

 murranus boasting of his blood that springs
 from a long royal race of latian kings
 is by the trojan from his chariot thrown
 crush'd with the weight of an unwieldy stone
 betwixt the wheels he fell the wheels that bore
 his living load his dying body tore
 his starting steeds to shun the glitt'ring sword
 paw down his trampled limbs forgetful of their lord

 fierce hyllus threaten'd high and face to face
 affronted turnus in the middle space
 the prince encounter'd him in full career
 and at his temples aim'd the deadly spear
 so fatally the flying weapon sped
 that thro' his helm it pierc'd his head
 nor cisseus couldst thou scape from turnus' hand
 in vain the strongest of th' arcadian band
 nor to cupentus could his gods afford
 availing aid against th' aenean sword
 which to his naked heart pursued the course
 nor could his plated shield sustain the force

 iolas fell whom not the grecian pow'rs
 nor great subverter of the trojan tow'rs
 were doom'd to kill while heav'n prolong'd his date
 but who can pass the bounds prefix'd by fate
 in high lyrnessus and in troy he held
 two palaces and was from each expell'd
 of all the mighty man the last remains
 a little spot of foreign earth contains

 and now both hosts their broken troops unite
 in equal ranks and mix in mortal fight
 seresthus and undaunted mnestheus join
 the trojan tuscan and arcadian line
 seaborn messapus with atinas heads
 the latin squadrons and to battle leads
 they strike they push they throng the scanty space
 resolv'd on death impatient of disgrace
 and where one falls another fills his place

 the cyprian goddess now inspires her son
 to leave th' unfinish'd fight and storm the town
 for while he rolls his eyes around the plain
 in quest of turnus whom he seeks in vain
 he views th' unguarded city from afar
 in careless quiet and secure of war
 occasion offers and excites his mind
 to dare beyond the task he first design'd
 resolv'd he calls his chiefs they leave the fight
 attended thus he takes a neighb'ring height
 the crowding troops about their gen'ral stand
 all under arms and wait his high command
 then thus the lofty prince "hear and obey
 ye trojan bands without the least delay
 jove is with us and what i have decreed
 requires our utmost vigor and our speed
 your instant arms against the town prepare
 the source of mischief and the seat of war
 this day the latian tow'rs that mate the sky
 shall level with the plain in ashes lie
 the people shall be slaves unless in time
 they kneel for pardon and repent their crime
 twice have our foes been vanquish'd on the plain
 then shall i wait till turnus will be slain
 your force against the perjur'd city bend
 there it began and there the war shall end
 the peace profan'd our rightful arms requires
 cleanse the polluted place with purging fires"

 he finish'd and one soul inspiring all
 form'd in a wedge the foot approach the wall
 without the town an unprovided train
 of gaping gazing citizens are slain
 some firebrands others scaling ladders bear
 and those they toss aloft and these they rear
 the flames now launch'd the feather'd arrows fly
 and clouds of missive arms obscure the sky
 advancing to the front the hero stands
 and stretching out to heav'n his pious hands
 attests the gods asserts his innocence
 upbraids with breach of faith th' ausonian prince
 declares the royal honor doubly stain'd
 and twice the rites of holy peace profan'd

 dissenting clamors in the town arise
 each will be heard and all at once advise
 one part for peace and one for war contends
 some would exclude their foes and some admit their friends
 the helpless king is hurried in the throng
 and whate'er tide prevails is borne along
 thus when the swain within a hollow rock
 invades the bees with suffocating smoke
 they run around or labor on their wings
 disus'd to flight and shoot their sleepy stings
 to shun the bitter fumes in vain they try
 black vapors issuing from the vent involve the sky

 but fate and envious fortune now prepare
 to plunge the latins in the last despair
 the queen who saw the foes invade the town
 and brands on tops of burning houses thrown
 cast round her eyes distracted with her fear
 no troops of turnus in the field appear
 once more she stares abroad but still in vain
 and then concludes the royal youth is slain
 mad with her anguish impotent to bear
 the mighty grief she loathes the vital air
 she calls herself the cause of all this ill
 and owns the dire effects of her ungovern'd will
 she raves against the gods she beats her breast
 she tears with both her hands her purple vest
 then round a beam a running noose she tied
 and fasten'd by the neck obscenely died

 soon as the fatal news by fame was blown
 and to her dames and to her daughter known
 the sad lavinia rends her yellow hair
 and rosy cheeks the rest her sorrow share
 with shrieks the palace rings and madness of despair
 the spreading rumor fills the public place
 confusion fear distraction and disgrace
 and silent shame are seen in ev'ry face
 latinus tears his garments as he goes
 both for his public and his private woes
 with filth his venerable beard besmears
 and sordid dust deforms his silver hairs
 and much he blames the softness of his mind
 obnoxious to the charms of womankind
 and soon seduc'd to change what he so well design'd
 to break the solemn league so long desir'd
 nor finish what his fates and those of troy requir'd

 now turnus rolls aloof o'er empty plains
 and here and there some straggling foes he gleans
 his flying coursers please him less and less
 asham'd of easy fight and cheap success
 thus halfcontented anxious in his mind
 the distant cries come driving in the wind
 shouts from the walls but shouts in murmurs drown'd
 a jarring mixture and a boding sound
 "alas" said he "what mean these dismal cries
 what doleful clamors from the town arise"
 confus'd he stops and backward pulls the reins
 she who the driver's office now sustains
 replies "neglect my lord these new alarms
 here fight and urge the fortune of your arms
 there want not others to defend the wall
 if by your rival's hand th' italians fall
 so shall your fatal sword his friends oppress
 in honor equal equal in success"

 to this the prince "o sister for i knew
 the peace infring'd proceeded first from you
 i knew you when you mingled first in fight
 and now in vain you would deceive my sight
 why goddess this unprofitable care
 who sent you down from heav'n involv'd in air
 your share of mortal sorrows to sustain
 and see your brother bleeding on the plain
 for to what pow'r can turnus have recourse
 or how resist his fate's prevailing force
 these eyes beheld murranus bite the ground
 mighty the man and mighty was the wound
 i heard my dearest friend with dying breath
 my name invoking to revenge his death
 brave ufens fell with honor on the place
 to shun the shameful sight of my disgrace
 on earth supine a manly corpse he lies
 his vest and armor are the victor's prize
 then shall i see laurentum in a flame
 which only wanted to complete my shame
 how will the latins hoot their champion's flight
 how drances will insult and point them to the sight
 is death so hard to bear ye gods below
 since those above so small compassion show
 receive a soul unsullied yet with shame
 which not belies my great forefather's name"

 he said and while he spoke with flying speed
 came sages urging on his foamy steed
 fix'd on his wounded face a shaft he bore
 and seeking turnus sent his voice before
 "turnus on you on you alone depends
 our last relief compassionate your friends
 like lightning fierce aeneas rolling on
 with arms invests with flames invades the town
 the brands are toss'd on high the winds conspire
 to drive along the deluge of the fire
 all eyes are fix'd on you your foes rejoice
 ev'n the king staggers and suspends his choice
 doubts to deliver or defend the town
 whom to reject or whom to call his son
 the queen on whom your utmost hopes were plac'd
 herself suborning death has breath'd her last
 't is true messapus fearless of his fate
 with fierce atinas' aid defends the gate
 on ev'ry side surrounded by the foe
 the more they kill the greater numbers grow
 an iron harvest mounts and still remains to mow
 you far aloof from your forsaken bands
 your rolling chariot drive o'er empty sands

 stupid he sate his eyes on earth declin'd
 and various cares revolving in his mind
 rage boiling from the bottom of his breast
 and sorrow mix'd with shame his soul oppress'd
 and conscious worth lay lab'ring in his thought
 and love by jealousy to madness wrought
 by slow degrees his reason drove away
 the mists of passion and resum'd her sway
 then rising on his car he turn'd his look
 and saw the town involv'd in fire and smoke
 a wooden tow'r with flames already blaz'd
 which his own hands on beams and rafters rais'd
 and bridges laid above to join the space
 and wheels below to roll from place to place
 "sister the fates have vanquish'd let us go
 the way which heav'n and my hard fortune show
 the fight is fix'd nor shall the branded name
 of a base coward blot your brother's fame
 death is my choice but suffer me to try
 my force and vent my rage before i die"
 he said and leaping down without delay
 thro' crowds of scatter'd foes he freed his way
 striding he pass'd impetuous as the wind
 and left the grieving goddess far behind
 as when a fragment from a mountain torn
 by raging tempests or by torrents borne
 or sapp'd by time or loosen'd from the roots
 prone thro' the void the rocky ruin shoots
 rolling from crag to crag from steep to steep
 down sink at once the shepherds and their sheep
 involv'd alike they rush to nether ground
 stunn'd with the shock they fall and stunn'd from earth rebound
 so turnus hasting headlong to the town
 should'ring and shoving bore the squadrons down
 still pressing onward to the walls he drew
 where shafts and spears and darts promiscuous flew
 and sanguine streams the slipp'ry ground embrue
 first stretching out his arm in sign of peace
 he cries aloud to make the combat cease
 "rutulians hold and latin troops retire
 the fight is mine and me the gods require
 't is just that i should vindicate alone
 the broken truce or for the breach atone
 this day shall free from wars th' ausonian state
 or finish my misfortunes in my fate"

 both armies from their bloody work desist
 and bearing backward form a spacious list
 the trojan hero who receiv'd from fame
 the welcome sound and heard the champion's name
 soon leaves the taken works and mounted walls
 greedy of war where greater glory calls
 he springs to fight exulting in his force
 his jointed armor rattles in the course
 like eryx or like athos great he shows
 or father apennine when white with snows
 his head divine obscure in clouds he hides
 and shakes the sounding forest on his sides
 the nations overaw'd surcease the fight
 immovable their bodies fix'd their sight
 ev'n death stands still nor from above they throw
 their darts nor drive their batt'ringrams below
 in silent order either army stands
 and drop their swords unknowing from their hands
 th' ausonian king beholds with wond'ring sight
 two mighty champions match'd in single fight
 born under climes remote and brought by fate
 with swords to try their titles to the state

 now in clos'd field each other from afar
 they view and rushing on begin the war
 they launch their spears then hand to hand they meet
 the trembling soil resounds beneath their feet
 their bucklers clash thick blows descend from high
 and flakes of fire from their hard helmets fly
 courage conspires with chance and both ingage
 with equal fortune yet and mutual rage
 as when two bulls for their fair female fight
 in sila's shades or on taburnus' height
 with horns adverse they meet the keeper flies
 mute stands the herd the heifers roll their eyes
 and wait th' event which victor they shall bear
 and who shall be the lord to rule the lusty year
 with rage of love the jealous rivals burn
 and push for push and wound for wound return
 their dewlaps gor'd their sides are lav'd in blood
 loud cries and roaring sounds rebellow thro' the wood
 such was the combat in the listed ground
 so clash their swords and so their shields resound

 jove sets the beam in either scale he lays
 the champions' fate and each exactly weighs
 on this side life and lucky chance ascends
 loaded with death that other scale descends
 rais'd on the stretch young turnus aims a blow
 full on the helm of his unguarded foe
 shrill shouts and clamors ring on either side
 as hopes and fears their panting hearts divide
 but all in pieces flies the traitor sword
 and in the middle stroke deserts his lord
 now is but death or flight disarm'd he flies
 when in his hand an unknown hilt he spies
 fame says that turnus when his steeds he join'd
 hurrying to war disorder'd in his mind
 snatch'd the first weapon which his haste could find
 't was not the fated sword his father bore
 but that his charioteer metiscus wore
 this while the trojans fled the toughness held
 but vain against the great vulcanian shield
 the mortaltemper'd steel deceiv'd his hand
 the shiver'd fragments shone amid the sand

 surpris'd with fear he fled along the field
 and now forthright and now in orbits wheel'd
 for here the trojan troops the list surround
 and there the pass is clos'd with pools and marshy ground
 aeneas hastens tho' with heavier pace
 his wound so newly knit retards the chase
 and oft his trembling knees their aid refuse
 yet pressing foot by foot his foe pursues

 thus when a fearful stag is clos'd around
 with crimson toils or in a river found
 high on the bank the deepmouth'd hound appears
 still opening following still where'er he steers
 the persecuted creature to and fro
 turns here and there to scape his umbrian foe
 steep is th' ascent and if he gains the land
 the purple death is pitch'd along the strand
 his eager foe determin'd to the chase
 stretch'd at his length gains ground at ev'ry pace
 now to his beamy head he makes his way
 and now he holds or thinks he holds his prey
 just at the pinch the stag springs out with fear
 he bites the wind and fills his sounding jaws with air
 the rocks the lakes the meadows ring with cries
 the mortal tumult mounts and thunders in the skies
 thus flies the daunian prince and flying blames
 his tardy troops and calling by their names
 demands his trusty sword the trojan threats
 the realm with ruin and their ancient seats
 to lay in ashes if they dare supply
 with arms or aid his vanquish'd enemy
 thus menacing he still pursues the course
 with vigor tho' diminish'd of his force
 ten times already round the listed place
 one chief had fled and t' other giv'n the chase
 no trivial prize is play'd for on the life
 or death of turnus now depends the strife

 within the space an olive tree had stood
 a sacred shade a venerable wood
 for vows to faunus paid the latins' guardian god
 here hung the vests and tablets were ingrav'd
 of sinking mariners from shipwrack sav'd
 with heedless hands the trojans fell'd the tree
 to make the ground inclos'd for combat free
 deep in the root whether by fate or chance
 or erring haste the trojan drove his lance
 then stoop'd and tugg'd with force immense to free
 th' incumber'd spear from the tenacious tree
 that whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain
 his flying weapon might from far attain

 confus'd with fear bereft of human aid
 then turnus to the gods and first to faunus pray'd
 "o faunus pity and thou mother earth
 where i thy foster son receiv'd my birth
 hold fast the steel if my religious hand
 your plant has honor'd which your foes profan'd
 propitious hear my pious pray'r" he said
 nor with successless vows invok'd their aid
 th' incumbent hero wrench'd and pull'd and strain'd
 but still the stubborn earth the steel detain'd
 juturna took her time and while in vain
 he strove assum'd meticus' form again
 and in that imitated shape restor'd
 to the despairing prince his daunian sword
 the queen of love who with disdain and grief
 saw the bold nymph afford this prompt relief
 t' assert her offspring with a greater deed
 from the tough root the ling'ring weapon freed

 once more erect the rival chiefs advance
 one trusts the sword and one the pointed lance
 and both resolv'd alike to try their fatal chance

 meantime imperial jove to juno spoke
 who from a shining cloud beheld the shock
 "what new arrest o queen of heav'n is sent
 to stop the fates now lab'ring in th' event
 what farther hopes are left thee to pursue
 divine aeneas and thou know'st it too
 foredoom'd to these celestial seats are due
 what more attempts for turnus can be made
 that thus thou ling'rest in this lonely shade
 is it becoming of the due respect
 and awful honor of a god elect
 a wound unworthy of our state to feel
 patient of human hands and earthly steel
 or seems it just the sister should restore
 a second sword when one was lost before
 and arm a conquer'd wretch against his conqueror
 for what without thy knowledge and avow
 nay more thy dictate durst juturna do
 at last in deference to my love forbear
 to lodge within thy soul this anxious care
 reclin'd upon my breast thy grief unload
 who should relieve the goddess but the god
 now all things to their utmost issue tend
 push'd by the fates to their appointed
 while leave was giv'n thee and a lawful hour
 for vengeance wrath and unresisted pow'r
 toss'd on the seas thou couldst thy foes distress
 and driv'n ashore with hostile arms oppress
 deform the royal house and from the side
 of the just bridegroom tear the plighted bride
 now cease at my command" the thund'rer said
 and with dejected eyes this answer juno made
 "because your dread decree too well i knew
 from turnus and from earth unwilling i withdrew
 else should you not behold me here alone
 involv'd in empty clouds my friends bemoan
 but girt with vengeful flames in open sight
 engag'd against my foes in mortal fight
 't is true juturna mingled in the strife
 by my command to save her brother's life
 at least to try but by the stygian lake
 the most religious oath the gods can take
 with this restriction not to bend the bow
 or toss the spear or trembling dart to throw
 and now resign'd to your superior might
 and tir'd with fruitless toils i loathe the fight
 this let me beg and this no fates withstand
 both for myself and for your father's land
 that when the nuptial bed shall bind the peace
 which i since you ordain consent to bless
 the laws of either nation be the same
 but let the latins still retain their name
 speak the same language which they spoke before
 wear the same habits which their grandsires wore
 call them not trojans perish the renown
 and name of troy with that detested town
 latium be latium still let alba reign
 and rome's immortal majesty remain"

 then thus the founder of mankind replies
 unruffled was his front serene his eyes
 "can saturn's issue and heav'n's other heir
 such endless anger in her bosom bear
 be mistress and your full desires obtain
 but quench the choler you foment in vain
 from ancient blood th' ausonian people sprung
 shall keep their name their habit and their tongue
 the trojans to their customs shall be tied
 i will myself their common rites provide
 the natives shall command the foreigners subside
 all shall be latium troy without a name
 and her lost sons forget from whence they came
 from blood so mix'd a pious race shall flow
 equal to gods excelling all below
 no nation more respect to you shall pay
 or greater off'rings on your altars lay"
 juno consents well pleas'd that her desires
 had found success and from the cloud retires

 the peace thus made the thund'rer next prepares
 to force the wat'ry goddess from the wars
 deep in the dismal regions void of light
 three daughters at a birth were born to night
 these their brown mother brooding on her care
 indued with windy wings to flit in air
 with serpents girt alike and crown'd with hissing hair
 in heav'n the dirae call'd and still at hand
 before the throne of angry jove they stand
 his ministers of wrath and ready still
 the minds of mortal men with fears to fill
 whene'er the moody sire to wreak his hate
 on realms or towns deserving of their fate
 hurls down diseases death and deadly care
 and terrifies the guilty world with war
 one sister plague if these from heav'n he sent
 to fright juturna with a dire portent
 the pest comes whirling down by far more slow
 springs the swift arrow from the parthian bow
 or cydon yew when traversing the skies
 and drench'd in pois'nous juice the sure destruction flies
 with such a sudden and unseen a flight
 shot thro' the clouds the daughter of the night
 soon as the field inclos'd she had in view
 and from afar her destin'd quarry knew
 contracted to the boding bird she turns
 which haunts the ruin'd piles and hallow'd urns
 and beats about the tombs with nightly wings
 where songs obscene on sepulchers she sings
 thus lessen'd in her form with frightful cries
 the fury round unhappy turnus flies
 flaps on his shield and flutters o'er his eyes

 a lazy chillness crept along his blood
 chok'd was his voice his hair with horror stood
 juturna from afar beheld her fly
 and knew th' ill omen by her screaming cry
 and stridor of her wings amaz'd with fear
 her beauteous breast she beat and rent her flowing hair

 "ah me" she cries "in this unequal strife
 what can thy sister more to save thy life
 weak as i am can i alas contend
 in arms with that inexorable fiend
 now now i quit the field forbear to fright
 my tender soul ye baleful birds of night
 the lashing of your wings i know too well
 the sounding flight and fun'ral screams of hell
 these are the gifts you bring from haughty jove
 the worthy recompense of ravish'd love
 did he for this exempt my life from fate
 o hard conditions of immortal state
 tho' born to death not privileg'd to die
 but forc'd to bear impos'd eternity
 take back your envious bribes and let me go
 companion to my brother's ghost below
 the joys are vanish'd nothing now remains
 of life immortal but immortal pains
 what earth will open her devouring womb
 to rest a weary goddess in the tomb"
 she drew a length of sighs nor more she said
 but in her azure mantle wrapp'd her head
 then plung'd into her stream with deep despair
 and her last sobs came bubbling up in air

 now stern aeneas his weighty spear
 against his foe and thus upbraids his fear
 "what farther subterfuge can turnus find
 what empty hopes are harbor'd in his mind
 't is not thy swiftness can secure thy flight
 not with their feet but hands the valiant fight
 vary thy shape in thousand forms and dare
 what skill and courage can attempt in war
 wish for the wings of winds to mount the sky
 or hid within the hollow earth to lie"
 the champion shook his head and made this short reply
 "no threats of thine my manly mind can move
 't is hostile heav'n i dread and partial jove"
 he said no more but with a sigh repress'd
 the mighty sorrow in his swelling breast

 then as he roll'd his troubled eyes around
 an antique stone he saw the common bound
 of neighb'ring fields and barrier of the ground
 so vast that twelve strong men of modern days
 th' enormous weight from earth could hardly raise
 he heav'd it at a lift and pois'd on high
 ran stagg'ring on against his enemy
 but so disorder'd that he scarcely knew
 his way or what unwieldly weight he threw
 his knocking knees are bent beneath the load
 and shiv'ring cold congeals his vital blood
 the stone drops from his arms and falling short
 for want of vigor mocks his vain effort
 and as when heavy sleep has clos'd the sight
 the sickly fancy labors in the night
 we seem to run and destitute of force
 our sinking limbs forsake us in the course
 in vain we heave for breath in vain we cry
 the nerves unbrac'd their usual strength deny
 and on the tongue the falt'ring accents die
 so turnus far'd whatever means he tried
 all force of arms and points of art employ'd
 the fury flew athwart and made th' endeavor void

 a thousand various thoughts his soul confound
 he star'd about nor aid nor issue found
 his own men stop the pass and his own walls surround
 once more he pauses and looks out again
 and seeks the goddess charioteer in vain
 trembling he views the thund'ring chief advance
 and brandishing aloft the deadly lance
 amaz'd he cow'rs beneath his conqu'ring foe
 forgets to ward and waits the coming blow
 astonish'd while he stands and fix'd with fear
 aim'd at his shield he sees th' impending spear

 the hero measur'd first with narrow view
 the destin'd mark and rising as he threw
 with its full swing the fatal weapon flew
 not with less rage the rattling thunder falls
 or stones from batt'ringengines break the walls
 swift as a whirlwind from an arm so strong
 the lance drove on and bore the death along
 naught could his sev'nfold shield the prince avail
 nor aught beneath his arms the coat of mail
 it pierc'd thro' all and with a grisly wound
 transfix'd his thigh and doubled him to ground
 with groans the latins rend the vaulted sky
 woods hills and valleys to the voice reply

 now low on earth the lofty chief is laid
 with eyes cast upward and with arms display'd
 and recreant thus to the proud victor pray'd
 "i know my death deserv'd nor hope to live
 use what the gods and thy good fortune give
 yet think o think if mercy may be shown
 thou hadst a father once and hast a son
 pity my sire now sinking to the grave
 and for anchises' sake old daunus save
 or if thy vow'd revenge pursue my death
 give to my friends my body void of breath
 the latian chiefs have seen me beg my life
 thine is the conquest thine the royal wife
 against a yielded man 't is mean ignoble strife"

 in deep suspense the trojan seem'd to stand
 and just prepar'd to strike repress'd his hand
 he roll'd his eyes and ev'ry moment felt
 his manly soul with more compassion melt
 when casting down a casual glance he spied
 the golden belt that glitter'd on his side
 the fatal spoils which haughty turnus tore
 from dying pallas and in triumph wore
 then rous'd anew to wrath he loudly cries
 flames while he spoke came flashing from his eyes
 "traitor dost thou dost thou to grace pretend
 clad as thou art in trophies of my friend
 to his sad soul a grateful off'ring go
 't is pallas pallas gives this deadly blow"
 he rais'd his arm aloft and at the word
 deep in his bosom drove the shining sword
 the streaming blood distain'd his arms around
 and the disdainful soul came rushing thro' the wound

 book i

 how agamemnon and achilles fell out at the siege of troy
 and achilles withdrew himself from battle and won from zeus
 a pledge that his wrong should be avenged on agamemnon and
 the achaians

 sing goddess the wrath of achilles peleus' son the ruinous wrath that
 brought on the achaians woes innumerable and hurled down into hades
 many strong souls of heroes and gave their bodies to be a prey to dogs
 and all winged fowls and so the counsel of zeus wrought out its
 accomplishment from the day when first strife parted atreides king of
 men and noble achilles

 who among the gods set the twain at strife and variance apollo the son
 of leto and of zeus for he in anger at the king sent a sore plague upon
 the host so that the folk began to perish because atreides had done
 dishonour to chryses the priest for the priest had come to the
 achaians' fleet ships to win his daughter's freedom and brought a
 ransom beyond telling and bare in his hands the fillet of apollo the
 fardarter upon a golden staff and made his prayer unto all the
 achaians and most of all to the two sons of atreus orderers of the
 host "ye sons of atreus and all ye wellgreaved achaians now may the
 gods that dwell in the mansions of olympus grant you to lay waste the
 city of priam and to fare happily homeward only set ye my dear child
 free and accept the ransom in reverence to the son of zeus fardarting
 apollo"

 then all the other achaians cried assent to reverence the priest and
 accept his goodly ransom yet the thing pleased not the heart of
 agamemnon son of atreus but he roughly sent him away and laid stern
 charge upon him saying "let me not find thee old man amid the hollow
 ships whether tarrying now or returning again hereafter lest the staff
 and fillet of the god avail thee naught and her will i not set free
 nay ere that shall old age come on her in our house in argos far from
 her native land where she shall ply the loom and serve my couch but
 depart provoke me not that thou mayest the rather go in peace"

 so said he and the old man was afraid and obeyed his word and fared
 silently along the shore of the loudsounding sea then went that aged
 man apart and prayed aloud to king apollo whom leto of the fair locks
 bare "hear me god of the silver bow that standest over chryse and
 holy killa and rulest tenedos with might o smintheus if ever i built
 a temple gracious in thine eyes or if ever i burnt to thee fat flesh of
 thighs of bulls or goats fulfil thou this my desire let the danaans
 pay by thine arrows for my tears"

 so spake he in prayer and phoebus apollo heard him and came down from
 the peaks of olympus wroth at heart bearing on his shoulders his bow
 and covered quiver and the arrows clanged upon his shoulders in wrath
 as the god moved and he descended like to night then he sate him aloof
 from the ships and let an arrow fly and there was heard a dread
 clanging of the silver bow first did the assail the mules and fleet
 dogs but afterward aiming at the men his piercing dart he smote and
 the pyres of the dead burnt continually in multitude

 now for nine days ranged the god's shafts through the host but on the
 tenth achilles summoned the folk to assembly for in his mind did
 goddess hera of white arms put the thought because she had pity on the
 danaans when she beheld them perishing now when they had gathered and
 were met in assembly then achilles fleet of foot stood up and spake
 among them "son of atreus now deem i that we shall return wandering
 home againif verily we might escape deathif war at once and
 pestilence must indeed ravage the achaians but come let us now inquire
 of some soothsayer or priest yea or an interpreter of dreamsseeing
 that a dream too is of zeuswho shall say wherefore phoebus apollo is
 so wroth whether he blame us by reason of vow or hecatomb if perchance
 he would accept the savour of lambs or unblemished goats and so would
 take away the pestilence from us"

 so spake he and sate him down and there stood up before them kalchas
 son of thestor most excellent far of augurs who knew both things that
 were and that should be and that had been before and guided the ships
 of the achaians to ilios by his soothsaying that phoebus apollo bestowed
 on him he of good intent made harangue and spake amid them "achilles
 dear to zeus thou biddest me tell the wrath of apollo the king that
 smiteth afar therefore will i speak but do thou make covenant with me
 and swear that verily with all thy heart thou wilt aid me both by word
 and deed for of a truth i deem that i shall provoke one that ruleth all
 the argives with might and whom the achaians obey for a king is more
 of might when he is wroth with a meaner man even though for the one day
 he swallow his anger yet doth he still keep his displeasure thereafter
 in his breast till he accomplish it consider thou then if thou wilt
 hold me safe"

 and achilles fleet of foot made answer and spake to him "yea be of
 good courage speak whatever soothsaying thou knowest for by apollo
 dear to zeus him by whose worship thou o kalchas declarest thy
 soothsaying to the danaans not even if thou mean agamemnon that now
 avoweth him to be greatest far of the achaians"

 then was the noble seer of good courage and spake "neither by reason
 of a vow is he displeased nor for any hecatomb but for his priest's
 sake to whom agamemnon did despite and set not his daughter free and
 accepted not the ransom therefore hath the fardarter brought woes upon
 us yea and will bring nor will he ever remove the loathly pestilence
 from the danaans till we have given the brighteyed damsel to her
 father unbought unransomed and carried a holy hecatomb to chryse
 then might we propitiate him to our prayer"

 so said he and sate him down and there stood up before them the hero
 son of atreus wideruling agamemnon sore displeased and his dark
 heart within him was greatly filled with anger and his eyes were like
 flashing fire to kalchas first spake he with look of ill "thou seer of
 evil never yet hast thou told me the thing that is pleasant evil is
 ever the joy of thy heart to prophesy but never yet didst thou tell any
 good matter nor bring to pass and now with soothsaying thou makest
 harangue among the danaans how that the fardarter bringeth woes upon
 them because forsooth i would not take the goodly ransom of the damsel
 chryseis seeing i am the rather fain to keep her own self within mine
 house yea i prefer her before klytaimnestra my wedded wife in no wise
 is she lacking beside her neither in favour nor stature nor wit nor
 skill yet for all this will i give her back if that is better rather
 would i see my folk whole than perishing only make ye me ready a prize
 of honour forthwith lest i alone of all the argives be disprized which
 thing beseemeth not for ye all behold how my prize is departing from
 me"

 to him then made answer fleetfooted goodly achilles "most noble son of
 atreus of all men most covetous how shall the greathearted achaians
 give thee a meed of honour we know naught of any wealth of common
 store but what spoil soe'er we took from captured cities hath been
 apportioned and it beseemeth not to beg all this back from the folk
 nay yield thou the damsel to the god and we achaians will pay thee
 back threefold and fourfold if ever zeus grant us to sack some
 wellwalled town of troyland"

 to him lord agamemnon made answer and said "not in this wise strong as
 thou art o godlike achilles beguile thou me by craft thou shalt not
 outwit me nor persuade me dost thou wish that thou mayest keep thy
 meed of honour for me to sit idle in bereavement and biddest me give
 her back nay if the greathearted achaians will give me a meed suited
 to my mind that the recompense be equalbut if they give it not then
 i myself will go and take a meed of honour thine be it or aias' or
 odysseus' that i will take unto me wroth shall he be to whomsoever i
 come but for this we will take counsel hereafter now let us launch a
 black ship on the great sea and gather picked oarsmen and set therein
 a hecatomb and embark chryseis of the fair cheeks herself and let one
 of our counsellors be captain aias or idomeneus or goodly odysseus or
 thou peleides most redoubtable of men to do sacrifice for us and
 propitiate the fardarter"

 then achilles fleet of foot looked at him scowling and said "ah me
 thou clothed in shamelessness thou of crafty mind how shall any
 achaian hearken to thy bidding with all his heart be it to go a journey
 or to fight the foe amain not by reason of the trojan spearmen came i
 hither to fight for they have not wronged me never did they harry mine
 oxen nor my horses nor ever waste my harvest in deepsoiled phthia the
 nurse of men seeing there lieth between us long space of shadowy
 mountains and sounding sea but thee thou shameless one followed we
 hither to make thee glad by earning recompense at the trojans' hands
 for menelaos and for thee thou dogface all this thou threatenest
 thyself to take my meed of honour wherefor i travailed much and the
 sons of the achaians gave it me never win i meed like unto thine when
 the achaians sack any populous citadel of trojan men my hands bear the
 brunt of furious war but when the apportioning cometh then is thy meed
 far ampler and i betake me to the ships with some small thing yet my
 own when i have fought to weariness now will i depart to phthia
 seeing it is far better to return home on my beaked ships nor am i
 minded here in dishonour to draw thee thy fill of riches and wealth"

 then agamemnon king of men made answer to him "yea flee if thy soul be
 set thereon it is not i that beseech thee to tarry for my sake i have
 others by my side that shall do me honour and above all zeus lord of
 counsel most hateful art thou to me of all kings fosterlings of zeus
 thou ever lovest strife and wars and fightings though thou be very
 strong yet that i ween is a gift to thee of god go home with thy ships
 and company and lord it among thy myrmidons i reck not aught of thee
 nor care i for thine indignation and all this shall be my threat to
 thee seeing phoebus apollo bereaveth me of chryseis her with my ship
 and my company will i send back and mine own self will i go to thy hut
 and take briseis of the fair cheeks even that thy meed of honour that
 thou mayest well know how far greater i am than thou and so shall
 another hereafter abhor to match his words with mine and rival me to my
 face"

 so said he and grief came upon peleus' son and his heart within his
 shaggy breast was divided in counsel whether to draw his keen blade
 from his thigh and set the company aside and so slay atreides or to
 assuage his anger and curb his soul while yet he doubted thereof in
 heart and soul and was drawing his great sword from his sheath athene
 came to him from heaven sent forth of the whitearmed goddess hera
 whose heart loved both alike and had care for them she stood behind
 peleus' son and caught him by his golden hair to him only visible and
 of the rest no man beheld her then achilles marvelled and turned him
 about and straightway knew pallas athene and terribly shone her eyes
 he spake to her winged words and said "why now art thou come hither
 thou daughter of aegisbearing zeus is it to behold the insolence of
 agamemnon son of atreus yea i will tell thee that i deem shall even
 be brought to pass by his own haughtinesses shall he soon lose his
 life"

 then the brighteyed goddess athene spake to him again "i came from
 heaven to stay thine anger if perchance thou wilt hearken to me being
 sent forth if the whitearmed goddess hera that loveth you twain alike
 and careth for you go to now cease from strife and let not thine hand
 draw the sword yet with words indeed revile him even as it shall come
 to pass for thus will i say to thee and so it shall be fulfilled
 hereafter shall goodly gifts come to thee yea in threefold measure by
 reason of this despite hold thou thine hand and hearken to us"

 and achilles fleet of foot made answer and said to her "goddess needs
 must a man observe the saying of you twain even though he be very wroth
 at heart for so is the better way whosoever obeyeth the gods to him
 they gladly hearken"

 he said and stayed his heavy hand on the silver hilt and thrust the
 great sword back into the sheath and was not disobedient to the saying
 of athene and she forthwith was departed to olympus to the other gods
 in the palace of aegisbearing zeus

 then peleus' son spake again with bitter words to atreus' son and in no
 wise ceased from anger "thou heavy with wine thou with face of dog and
 heart of deer never didst thou take courage to arm for battle among thy
 folk or to lay ambush with the princes of the achaians that to thee
 were even as death far better booteth it for sooth to seize for
 thyself the meed of honour of every man through the wide host of the
 achaians that speaketh contrary to thee folkdevouring king seeing
 thou rulest men of naught else were this despite thou son of atreus
 thy last but i will speak my word to thee and swear a mighty oath
 therewith verily by this staff that shall no more put forth leaf or
 twig seeing it hath for ever left its trunk among the hills neither
 shall it grow green again because the axe hath stripped it of leaves
 and bark and now the sons of the achaians that exercise judgment bear
 it in their hands even they that by zeus' command watch over the
 traditionsso shall this be a mighty oath in thine eyesverily shall
 longing for achilles come hereafter upon the sons of the achaians one
 and all and then wilt thou in no wise avail to save them for all thy
 grief when multitudes fall dying before manslaying hector then shalt
 thou tear thy heart within thee for anger that thou didst in no wise
 honour the best of the achaians"

 so said peleides and dashed to earth the staff studded with golden
 nails and himself sat down and over against him atreides waxed
 furious then in their midst rose up nestor pleasant of speech the
 clearvoiced orator of the pylians he from whose tongue flowed
 discourse sweeter than honey two generations of mortal men already had
 he seen perish that had been of old time born and nurtured with him in
 goodly pylos and he was king among the third he of good intent made
 harangue to them and said "alas of a truth sore lamentation cometh
 upon the land of achaia verily priam would be glad and priam's sons
 and all the trojans would have great joy of heart were they to hear all
 this tale of strife between you twain that are chiefest of the danaans
 in counsel and chiefest in battle nay hearken to me ye are younger
 both than i of old days held i converse with better men even than you
 and never did they make light of me yea i never beheld such warriors
 nor shall behold as were peirithoos and dryas shepherd of the host and
 kaineus and exadios and godlike polyphemos and theseus son of aigeus
 like to the immortals mightiest of growth were they of all men upon
 the earth mightiest they were and with the mightiest fought they even
 the wild tribes of the mountain caves and destroyed them utterly and
 with these held i converse being come from pylos from a distant land
 afar for of themselves they summoned me so i played my part in fight
 and with them could none of men that are now on earth do battle and
 they laid to heart my counsels and hearkened to my voice even so
 hearken ye also for better is it to hearken neither do thou though
 thou art very great seize from him his damsel but leave her as she was
 given at the first by the sons of the achaians to be a meed of honour
 nor do thou son of peleus think to strive with a king might against
 might seeing that no common honour pertaineth to a sceptred king to
 whom zeus apportioneth glory though thou be strong and a goddess
 mother bare thee yet his is the greater place for he is king over
 more and thou atreides abate thy fury nay it is even i that beseech
 thee to let go thine anger with achilles who is made unto all the
 achaians a mighty bulwark of evil war"

 then lord agamemnon answered and said "yea verily old man all this
 thou sayest is according unto right but this fellow would be above all
 others he would be lord of all and king among all and captain to all
 wherein i deem none will hearken to him though the immortal gods made
 him a spearman do they therefore put revilings in his mouth for him to
 utter"

 then goodly achilles brake in on him and answered "yea for i should be
 called coward and man of naught if i yield to thee in every matter
 howsoe'er thou bid to others give now thine orders not to me play
 master for thee i deem that i shall no more obey this moreover will
 i say to thee and do thou lay it to thy heart know that not by
 violence will i strive for the damsel's sake neither with thee nor any
 other ye gave and ye have taken away but of all else that is mine
 beside my fleet black ship thereof shalt thou not take anything or bear
 it away against my will yea go to now make trial that all these may
 see forthwith thy dark blood shall gush about my spear"

 now when the twain had thus finished the battle of violent words they
 stood up and dissolved the assembly beside the achaian ships peleides
 went his way to his huts and trim ships with menoitios' son patroklos
 and his company and atreides launched a fleet ship on the sea and
 picked twenty oarsmen therefor and embarked the hecatomb for the god
 and brought chryseis of the fair cheeks and set her therein and
 odysseus of many devices went to be their captain

 so these embarked and sailed over the wet ways and atreides bade the
 folk purify themselves so they purified themselves and cast the
 defilements into the sea and did sacrifice to apollo even unblemished
 hecatombs of bulls and goats along the shore of the unvintaged sea and
 the sweet savour arose to heaven eddying amid the smoke

 thus were they busied throughout the host but agamemnon ceased not from
 the strife wherewith he threatened achilles at the first he spake to
 talthybios and eurybates that were his heralds and nimble squires "go
 ye to the tent of achilles peleus' son and take briseis of the fair
 cheeks by the hand and lead her hither and if he give her not then
 will i myself go and more with me and seize her and that will be yet
 more grievous for him"

 so saying he sent them forth and laid stern charge upon them
 unwillingly went they along the beach of the unvintaged sea and came to
 the huts and ships of the myrmidons him found they sitting beside his
 hut and black ship nor when he saw them was achilles glad so they in
 dread and reverence of the king stood and spake to him no word nor
 questioned him but he knew in his heart and spake to them "all hail
 ye heralds messengers of zeus and men come near ye are not guilty in
 my sight but agamemnon that sent you for the sake of the damsel
 briseis go now heavensprung patroklos bring forth the damsel and
 give them her to lead away moreover let the twain themselves be my
 witnesses before the face of the blessed gods and mortal men yea and of
 him that king untoward against the day when there cometh need of me
 hereafter to save them all from shameful wreck of a truth he raveth
 with baleful mind and hath not knowledge to look before and after that
 so his achaians might battle in safety beside their ships"

 so said he and patroklos hearkened to his dear comrade and led forth
 from the hut briseis of the fair cheeks and gave them her to lead away
 so these twain took their way back along the achaians' ships and with
 them went the woman all unwilling then achilles wept anon and sat him
 down apart aloof from his comrades on the beach of the grey sea gazing
 across the boundless main he stretched forth his hands and prayed
 instantly to his dear mother "mother seeing thou didst of a truth bear
 me to so brief span of life honour at the least ought the olympian to
 have granted me even zeus that thundereth on high but now doth he not
 honour me no not one whit verily atreus' son wideruling agamemnon
 hath done me dishonour for he hath taken away my meed of honour and
 keepeth her of his own violent deed"

 so spake he weeping and his lady mother heard him as she sate in the
 seadepths beside her aged sire with speed arose she from the grey sea
 like a mist and sate her before the face of her weeping son and
 stroked him with her hand and spake and called on his name "my child
 why weepest thou what sorrow hath entered into they heart speak it
 forth hide it not in thy mind that both may know it"

 then with heavy moan achilles fleet of foot spake to her "thou knowest
 it why should i tell this to thee that knowest all we had fared to
 thebe the holy city of eetion and laid it waste and carried hither all
 the spoils so the sons of the achaians divided among them all aright
 and for atreides they set apart chryseis of the fair cheeks but
 chryses priest of apollo the fardarter came unto the fleet ships of
 the mailclad achaians to win his daughter's freedom and brought a
 ransom beyond telling and bare in his hands the fillet of apollo the
 fardarter upon a golden staff and made his prayer unto all the
 achaians and most of all to the two sons of atreus orderers of the
 host then all the other achaians cried assent to reverence the priest
 and accept his goodly ransom yet the thing pleased not the heart of
 agamemnon son of atreus but he roughly sent him away and laid stern
 charge upon him so the old man went back in anger and apollo heard his
 prayers seeing he loved him greatly and he aimed against the argives
 his deadly darts so the people began to perish in multitudes and the
 god's shafts ranged everywhither throughout the wide host of the
 achaians then of full knowledge the seer declared to us the oracle of
 the fardarter forthwith i first bade propitiate the god but wrath gat
 hold upon atreus' son thereat and anon he stood up and spake a
 threatening word that hath now been accomplished her the glancingeyed
 achaians are bringing on their fleet ship to chryse and bear with
 them offerings to the king and the other but now the heralds went and
 took from my hut even the daughter of briseus whom the sons of the
 achaians gave me thou therefore if indeed thou canst guard thine own
 son betake thee to olympus and beseech zeus by any word whereby thou
 ever didst make glad his heart for oft have i heard thee proclaiming in
 my father's halls and telling that thou alone amid the immortals didst
 save the son of kronos lord of the stormcloud from shameful wreck
 when all the other olympians would have bound him even hera and
 poseidon and pallas athene then didst thou o goddess enter in and
 loose him from his bonds having with speed summoned to high olympus him
 of the hundred arms whom gods call briareus but all men call aigaion
 for he is mightier even than his fatherso he sate him by kronion's
 side rejoicing in his triumph and the blessed gods feared him withal
 and bound not zeus this bring thou to his remembrance and sit by him
 and clasp his knees if perchance he will give succour to the trojans
 and for the achaians hem them among their ships' sterns about the bay
 given over to slaughter that they may make trial of their king and
 that even atreides wideruling agamemnon may perceive his blindness
 in that he honoured not at all the best of the achaians"

 then thetis weeping made answer to him "ah me my child why reared i
 thee cursed in my motherhood would thou hadst been left tearless and
 griefless amid the ships seeing thy lot is very brief and endureth no
 long while but now art thou made shortlived alike and lamentable
 beyond all men in an evil hour i bare thee in our halls but i will go
 myself to snowclad olympus to tell this thy saying to zeus whose joy
 is in the thunder perhaps rather "hurler of the thunderbolt" if
 perchance he may hearken to me but tarry thou now amid thy fleetfaring
 ships and continue wroth with the achaians and refrain utterly from
 battle for zeus went yesterday to okeanos unto the noble ethiopians
 for a feast and all the gods followed with him but on the twelfth day
 will he return to olympus and then will i fare to zeus' palace of the
 bronze threshold and will kneel to him and think to win him"

 so saying she went her way and left him there vexed in spirit for the
 fairgirdled woman's sake whom they had taken perforce despite his
 will and meanwhile odysseus came to chryse with the holy hecatomb when
 they were now entered within the deep haven they furled their sails and
 laid them in the black ship and lowered the mast by the forestays and
 brought it to the crutch with speed and rowed her with oars to the
 anchorage then they cast out the mooring stones and made fast the
 hawsers and so themselves went forth on to the seabeach and forth
 they brought the hecatomb for the fardarter apollo and forth came
 chryseis withal from the seafaring ship then odysseus of many counsels
 brought her to the altar and gave her into her father's arms and spake
 unto him "chryses agamemnon king of men sent me hither to bring thee
 thy daughter and to offer to phoebus a holy hecatomb on the danaans'
 behalf wherewith to propitiate the king that hath now brought sorrow
 and lamentation on the argives"

 so saying he gave her to his arms and he gladly took his dear child
 and anon they set in order for the god the holy hecatomb about his
 wellbuilded altar next washed they their hands and took up the barley
 meal then chryses lifted up his hands and prayed aloud for them
 "hearken to me god of the silver bow that standest over chryse and holy
 killa and rulest tenedos with might even as erst thou heardest my
 prayer and didst me honour and mightily afflictest the people of the
 achaians even so now fulfil me this my desire remove thou from the
 danaans forthwith the loathly pestilence"

 so spake he in prayer and phoebus apollo heard him now when they had
 prayed and sprinkled the barley meal first they drew back the victims'
 heads and slaughtered them and flayed them and cut slices from the
 thighs and wrapped them in fat making a double fold and laid raw
 collops thereon and the old man burnt them on cleft wood and made
 libation over them of gleaming wine and at his side the young men in
 their hands held fivepronged forks now when the thighs were burnt and
 they had tasted the vitals then sliced they all the rest and pierced it
 through with spits and roasted it carefully and drew all off again so
 when they had rest from the task and had made ready the banquet they
 feasted nor was their heart aught stinted of the fair banquet but when
 they had put away from them the desire of meat and drink the young men
 crowned the bowls with wine and gave each man his portion after the
 drinkoffering had been poured into the cups so all day long worshipped
 they the god with music singing the beautiful paean the sons of the
 achaians making music to the fardarter or "the averter" of
 pestilence and his heart was glad to hear and when the sun went down
 and darkness came on them they laid them to sleep beside the ship's
 hawsers and when rosyfingered dawn appeared the child of morning
 then set they sail for the wide camp of the achaians and apollo the
 fardarter sent them a favouring gale they set up their mast and spread
 the white sails forth and the wind filled the sail's belly and the dark
 wave sang loud about the stem as the ship made way and she sped across
 the wave accomplishing her journey so when they were now come to the
 wide camp of the achaians they drew up their black ship to land high
 upon the sands and set in line the long props beneath her and
 themselves were scattered amid their huts and ships

 but he sat by his swiftfaring ships still wroth even the heavensprung
 son of peleus achilles fleet of foot he betook him neither to the
 assembly that is the hero's glory neither to war but consumed his
 heart in tarrying in his place and yearned for the warcry and for
 battle

 now when the twelfth morn thereafter was come then the gods that are
 for ever fared to olympus all in company led of zeus and thetis forgat
 not her son's charge but rose up from the seawave and at early morn
 mounted up to great heaven and olympus there found she kronos' son of
 the farsounding voice sitting apart from all on the topmost peak of
 manyridged olympus so she sat before his face and with her left hand
 clasped his knees and with her right touched him beneath his chin and
 spake in prayer to king zeus son of kronos "father zeus if ever i gave
 thee aid amid the immortal gods whether by word or deed fulfil thou
 this my desire do honour to my son that is doomed to earliest death of
 all men now hath agamemnon king of men done him dishonour for he hath
 taken away his meed of honour and keepeth her of his own violent deed
 but honour thou him zeus of olympus lord of counsel grant thou
 victory to the trojans the while until the achaians do my son honour and
 exalt him with recompense"

 so spake she but zeus the cloudgatherer said no word to her and sat
 long time in silence but even as thetis had clasped his knees so held
 she by him clinging and questioned him yet a second time "promise me
 now this thing verily and bow thy head thereto or else deny me seeing
 there is naught for thee to fear that i may know full well how i among
 all gods am least in honour"

 then zeus the cloudgatherer sore troubled spake to her "verily it is
 a sorry matter if thou wilt set me at variance with hera whene'er she
 provoketh me with taunting words even now she upbraideth me ever amid
 the immortal gods and saith that i aid the trojans in battle but do
 thou now depart again lest hera mark aught and i will take thought for
 these things to fulfil them come now i will bow my head to thee that
 thou mayest be of good courage for that of my part is the surest
 token amid the immortals no word of mine is revocable nor false nor
 unfulfilled when the bowing of my head hath pledged it"

 kronion spake and bowed his dark brow and the ambrosial locks waved
 from the king's immortal head and he made great olympus quake

 thus the twain took counsel and parted she leapt therewith into the
 deep sea from glittering olympus and zeus fared to his own palace all
 the gods in company arose from their seats before their father's face
 neither ventured any to await his coming but stood up all before him
 so he sate him there upon his throne but hera saw and was not ignorant
 how that the daughter of the ancient of the sea thetis the
 silverfooted had devised counsel with him anon with taunting words
 spake she to zeus the son of kronos "now who among the gods thou
 crafty of mind hath devised counsel with thee it is ever thy good
 pleasure to hold aloof from me and in secret meditation to give thy
 judgments nor of thine own good will hast thou ever brought thyself to
 declare unto me the thing thou purposest"

 then the father of gods and men made answer her "hera think not thou
 to know all my sayings hard they are for thee even though thou art my
 wife but whichsoever it is seemly for thee to hear none sooner than
 thou shall know be he god or man only when i will to take thought
 aloof from the gods then do not thou ask of every matter nor make
 question"

 then hera the oxeyed queen made answer to him "most dread son of
 kronos what word is this thou hast spoken yea surely of old i have
 not asked thee nor made question but in my heart sore afraid lest thou
 have been won over by silverfooted thetis daughter of the ancient of
 the sea for she at early morn sat by thee and clasped thy knees to her
 i deem thou gavest a sure pledge that thou wilt do honour to achilles
 and lay many low beside the achaians' ships"

 to her made answer zeus the cloudgatherer "lady good lack ever art
 thou imagining nor can i escape thee yet shalt thou in no wise have
 power to fulfil but wilt be the further from my heart that shall be
 even the worse for thee and if it be so then such must my good
 pleasure be abide thou in silence and hearken to my bidding lest all
 the gods that are in olympus keep not off from thee my visitation when
 i put forth my hands unapproachable against thee"

 he said and hera the oxeyed queen was afraid and sat in silence
 curbing her heart but throughout zeus' palace the gods of heaven were
 troubled then hephaistos the famed craftsman began to make harangue
 among them to do kindness to his mother whitearmed hera "verily this
 will be a sorry matter neither any more endurable if ye twain thus
 fight for mortals' sakes and bring wrangling among the gods neither
 will there any more be joy of the goodly feast seeing that evil
 triumpheth so i give counsel to my mother though herself is wise to
 do kindness to our dear father zeus that our father upbraid us not
 again and cast the banquet in confusion what if the olympian the lord
 of the lightning will to dash us from our seats for he is strongest
 far nay approach thou him with gentle words then will the olympian
 forthwith be gracious unto us"

 so speaking he rose up and sat in his dear mother's hand the twyhandled
 cup and spake to her "be of good courage mother mine and endure
 though thou art vexed lest i behold thee thou art so dear chastised
 before mine eyes and then shall i not be able for all my sorrow to save
 thee for the olympian is a hard foe to face yea once ere this when i
 was fain to save thee he caught me by my foot and hurled me from the
 heavenly threshold all day i flew and at the set of sun i fell in
 lemnos and little life was in me there did the sintian folk forthwith
 tend me for my fall"

 he spake and the whitearmed goddess hera smiled and smiling took the
 cup at her son's hand then he poured wine to all the other gods from
 right to left ladling the sweet nectar from the bowl and laughter
 unquenchable arose amid the blessed gods to see hephaistos bustling
 through the palace

 so feasted they all day till the setting of the sun nor was their soul
 aught stinted of the fair banquet nor of the beauteous lyre that apollo
 held and the muses singing alternately with sweet voice

 now when the bright light of the sun was set these went each to his own
 house to sleep where each one had his palace made with cunning device
 by famed hephaistos the lame god and zeus the olympian the lord of
 lightning departed to his couch where he was wont of old to take his
 rest whenever sweet sleep visited him there went he up and slept and
 beside him was hera of the golden throne



 book ii

 how zeus beguiled agamemnon by a dream and of the assembly
 of the achaians and their marching forth to battle and of
 the names and numbers of the hosts of the achaians and the
 trojans

 now all other gods and chariotdriving men slept all night long only
 zeus was not holden of sweet sleep rather was he pondering in his heart
 how he should do honour to achilles and destroy many beside the
 achaians' ships and this design seemed to his mind the best to wit to
 send a baneful dream upon agamemnon son of atreus so he spake and
 uttered to him winged words "come now thou baneful dream go to the
 achaians' fleet ships enter into the hut of agamemnon son of atreus
 and tell him every word plainly as i charge thee bid him call to arms
 the flowinghaired achaians with all speed for that now he may take the
 widewayed city of the trojans for the immortals that dwell in the
 halls of olympus are no longer divided in counsel since hera hath
 turned the minds of all by her beseeching and over the trojans sorrows
 hang"

 so spake he and the dream went his way when he had heard the charge
 with speed he came to the achaians' fleet ships and went to agamemnon
 son of atreus and found him sleeping in his hut and ambrosial slumber
 poured over him so he stood over his head in seeming like unto the son
 of neleus even nestor whom most of all the elders agamemnon honoured
 in his likeness spake to him the heavenly dream

 "sleepest thou son of wise atreus tamer of horses to sleep all night
 through beseemeth not one that is a counsellor to whom peoples are
 entrusted and so many cares belong but now hearken straightway to me
 for i am a messenger to thee from zeus who though he be afar yet hath
 great care for thee and pity he biddeth thee call to arms the
 flowinghaired achaians with all speed for that now thou mayest take
 the widewayed city of the trojans for the immortals that dwell in the
 halls of olympus are no longer divided in counsel since hera hath
 turned the minds of all by her beseeching and over the trojans sorrows
 hang by the will of zeus but do thou keep this in thy heart not let
 forgetfulness come upon thee when honeyed sleep shall leave thee"

 so spake the dream and departed and left him there deeming in his mind
 things that were not to be fulfilled for indeed he thought to take
 priam's city that very day fond man in that he knew not the plans that
 zeus had in mind who was willed to bring yet more grief and wailing on
 trojans alike and danaans throughout the course of stubborn fights then
 woke he from sleep and the heavenly voice was in his ears so he rose
 up sitting and donned his soft tunic fair and bright and cast around
 him his great cloak and beneath his glistering feet he bound his fair
 sandals and over his shoulders cast his silverstudded sword and
 grasped his sires' sceptre imperishable for ever wherewith he took his
 way amid the mailclad achaians' ships

 now went the goddess dawn to high olympus foretelling daylight to zeus
 and all the immortals and the king bade the clearvoiced heralds summon
 to the assembly the flowinghaired achaians so did those summon and
 these gathered with speed

 but first the council of the greathearted elders met beside the ship of
 king nestor the pylosborn and he that had assembled them framed his
 cunning counsel "hearken my friends a dream from heaven came to me in
 my sleep through the ambrosial night and chiefly to goodly nestor was
 very like in shape and bulk and stature and it stood over my head and
 charged me saying 'sleepest thou son of wise atreus tamer of horses
 to sleep all night through beseemeth not one that is a counsellor to
 whom peoples are entrusted and so many cares belong but now hearken
 straightway to me for i am a messenger to thee from zeus who though he
 be afar yet hath great care for thee and pity he biddeth thee call to
 arms the flowinghaired achaians with all speed for that now thou
 mayest take the widewayed city of the trojans for the immortals that
 dwell in the palaces of olympus are no longer divided in counsel since
 hera hath turned the minds of all by her beseeching and over the
 trojans sorrows hang by the will of zeus but do thou keep this in thy
 heart' so spake the dream and was flown away and sweet sleep left me
 so come let us now call to arms as we may the sons of the achaians but
 first i will speak to make trial of them as is fitting and bid them
 flee with their benched ships only do ye from this side and from that
 speak to hold them back"

 so spake he and sate him down and there stood up among them nestor who
 was king of sandy pylos he of good intent made harangue to them and
 said "my friends captains and rulers of the argives had any other of
 the achaians told us this dream we might deem it a false thing and
 rather turn away therefrom but now he hath seen it who of all achaians
 avoweth himself far greatest so come let us call to arms as we may the
 sons of the achaians"

 so spake he and led the way forth from the council and all the other
 sceptred chiefs rose with him and obeyed the shepherd of the host and
 the people hastened to them even as when the tribes of thronging bees
 issue from the hollow rock ever in fresh procession and fly clustering
 among the flowers of spring and some on this hand and some on that fly
 thick even so from ships and huts before the low beach marched forth
 their many tribes by companies to the place of assembly and in their
 midst blazed forth rumour messenger of zeus urging them to go and so
 they gathered and the place of assemblage was in an uproar and the
 earth echoed again as the hosts sate them down and there was turmoil
 nine heralds restrained them with shouting if perchance they might
 refrain from clamour and hearken to their kings the fosterlings of
 zeus and hardly at the last would the people sit and keep them to
 their benches and cease from noise then stood up lord agamemnon bearing
 his sceptre that hephaistos had wrought curiously hephaistos gave it
 to king zeus son of kronos and then zeus gave it to the messengergod
 the slayer of argus or possibly "the swiftappearing" and king
 hermes gave it to pelops the charioteer and pelops again gave it to
 atreus shepherd of the host and atreus dying left it to thyestes rich
 in flocks and thyestes in his turn left it to agamemnon to bear that
 over many islands and all argos he should be lord thereon he leaned and
 spake his saying to the argives

 "my friends danaan warriors men of ares' company zeus kronos' son
 hath bound me with might in grievous blindness of soul hard of heart is
 he for that erewhile he promised me and pledged his nod that not till i
 had wasted wellwalled ilios should i return but now see i that he
 planned a cruel wile and biddeth me return to argos dishonoured with
 the loss of many of my folk so meseems it pleaseth most mighty zeus
 who hath laid low the head of many a city yea and shall lay low for
 his is highest power shame is this even for them that come after to
 hear how so goodly and great a folk of the achaians thus vainly warred
 a bootless war and fought scantier enemies and no end thereof is yet
 seen for if perchance we were minded both achaians and trojans to
 swear a solemn truce and to number ourselves and if the trojans should
 gather together all that have their dwellings in the city and we
 achaians should marshal ourselves by tens and every company choose a
 trojan to pour their wine then would many tens lack a cupbearer so
 much i say do the sons of the achaians outnumber the trojans that
 dwell within the city but allies from many cities even warriors that
 wield the spear are therein and they hinder me perforce and for all
 my will suffer me not to waste the populous citadel of ilios already
 have nine years of great zeus passed away and our ships' timbers have
 rotted and the tackling is loosed while there our wives and little
 children sit in our halls awaiting us yet is our task utterly
 unaccomplished wherefor we came hither so come even as i bid let us
 all obey let us flee with our ships to our dear native land for now
 shall we never take widewayed troy"

 so spake he and stirred the spirit in the breasts of all throughout the
 multitude as many as had not heard the council and the assembly swayed
 like high seawaves of the icarian main that east wind and south wind
 raise rushing upon them from the clouds of father zeus and even as
 when the west wind cometh to stir a deep cornfield with violent blast
 and the ears bow down so was all the assembly stirred and they with
 shouting hasted toward the ships and the dust from beneath their feet
 rose and stood on high and they bade each man his neighbor to seize the
 ships and drag them into the bright salt sea and cleared out the
 launchingways and the noise went up to heaven of their hurrying
 homewards and they began to take the props from beneath the ships

 then would the argives have accomplished their return against the will
 of fate but that hera spake a word to athene "out on it daughter of
 aegisbearing zeus unwearied maiden shall the argives thus indeed flee
 homeward to their dear native land over the sea's broad back but they
 would leave to priam and the trojans their boast even helen of argos
 for whose sake many an achaian hath perished in troy far away from his
 dear native land but go thou now amid the host of the mailclad
 achaians with thy gentle words refrain thou every man neither suffer
 them to draw their curved ships down to the salt sea"

 so spake she and the brighteyed goddess athene disregarded not but
 went darting down from the peaks of olympus and came with speed to the
 fleet ships of the achaians there found she odysseus standing peer of
 zeus in counsel neither laid he any hand upon his decked black ship
 because grief had entered into his heart and soul and brighteyed
 athene stood by him and said "heavensprung son of laertes odysseus of
 many devices will ye indeed fling yourselves upon your benched ships to
 flee homeward to your dear native land but ye would leave to priam and
 the trojans their boast even helen of argos for whose sake many an
 achaian hath perished in troy far from his dear native land but go
 thou now amid the host of the achaians and tarry not and with gentle
 words refrain every man neither suffer them to draw their curved ships
 down to the salt sea"

 so said she and he knew the voice of the goddess speaking to him and
 set him to run and cast away his mantle the which his herald gathered
 up even eurybated of ithaca that waited on him and himself he went to
 meet agamemnon son of atreus and at his hand received the sceptre of
 his sires imperishable for ever wherewith he took his way amid the
 ships of the mailclad achaians

 whenever he found one that was a captain and a man of mark he stood by
 his side and refrained him with gentle words "good sir it is not
 seemly to affright thee like a coward but do thou sit thyself and make
 all thy folk sit down for thou knowest not yet clearly what is the
 purpose of atreus' son now is he but making trial and soon he will
 afflict the sons of the achaians and heard we not all of us what he
 spake in the council beware lest in his anger he evilly entreat the
 sons of the achaians for proud is the soul of heavenfostered kings
 because their honour is of zeus and the god of counsel loveth them"

 but whatever man of the people he saw and found him shouting him he
 drave with his sceptre and chode him with loud words "good sir sit
 still and hearken to the words of others that are thy betters but thou
 art no warrior and a weakling never reckoned whether in battle or in
 council in no wise can we achaians all be kings here a multitude of
 masters is no good thing let there be one master one king to whom the
 son of crookedcounselling kronos hath granted it even the sceptre and
 judgments that he may rule among you"

 so masterfully ranged he the host and they hasted back to the assembly
 from ships and huts with noise as when a wave of loudsounding sea
 roareth on the long beach and the main resoundeth

 now all the rest sat down and kept their place upon the benches only
 thersites still chattered on the uncontrolled speech whose mind was
 full of words many and disorderly wherewith to strive against the
 chiefs idly and in no good order but even as he deemed that he should
 make the argives laugh and he was illfavored beyond all men that came
 to ilios bandylegged was he and lame of one foot and his two
 shoulders rounded arched down upon his chest and over them his head
 was warped and a scanty stubble sprouted on it hateful was he to
 achilles above all and to odysseus for them he was wont to revile but
 now with shrill shout he poured forth his upbraidings upon goodly
 agamemnon with him the achaians were sore vexed and had indignation in
 their souls but he with loud shout spake and reviled agamemnon
 "atreides for what art thou now ill content and lacking surely thy
 huts are full of bronze and many women are in they huts the chosen
 spoils that we achaians give thee first of all whene'er we take a town
 can it be that thou yet wantest gold as well such as some one of the
 horsetaming trojans may bring from ilios to ransom his son whom i
 perchance or some other achaian have led captive or else some young
 girl to know in love whom thou mayest keep apart to thyself but it is
 not seemly for one that is their captain to bring the sons of the
 achaians to ill soft fools base things of shame ye women of achaia
 and men no more let us depart home with our ships and leave this
 fellow here in troyland to gorge him with meeds of honour that he may
 see whether our aid avail him aught or no even he that hath now done
 dishonour to achilles a far better man than he for he hath taken away
 his meed of honour and keepeth it by his own violent deed of a very
 surety is there no wrath at all in achilles' mind but he is slack else
 this despite thou son of atreus were thy last"

 so spake thersites reviling agamemnon shepherd of the host but goodly
 odysseus came straight to his side and looking sternly at him with hard
 words rebuked him "thersites reckless in words shrill orator though
 thou art refrain thyself nor aim to strive singly against kings for i
 deem that no mortal is baser than thou of all that with the sons of
 atreus came before ilios therefore were it well that thou shouldest not
 have kings in thy mouth as thou talkest and utter revilings against
 them and be on the watch for departure we know not yet clearly how
 these things shall be whether we sons of the achaians shall return for
 good or ill therefore now dost thou revile continually agamemnon son of
 atreus shepherd of the host because the danaan warriors give him many
 gifts and so thou talkest tauntingly but i will tell thee plain and
 that i say shall even be brought to pass if i find thee again raving as
 now thou art then may odysseus' head no longer abide upon his
 shoulders nor may i any more be called father of telemachos if i take
 thee not and strip from thee thy garments thy mantle and tunic that
 cover thy nakedness and for thyself send thee weeping to the fleet
 ships and beat thee out of the assembly with shameful blows"

 so spake he and with his staff smote his back and shoulders and he
 bowed down and a big tear fell from him and a bloody weal stood up from
 his back beneath the golden sceptre then he sat down and was amazed
 and in pain with helpless look wiped away the tear but the rest though
 they were sotty laughed lightly at him and thus would one speak
 looking at another standing by "go to of a truth odysseus hath wrought
 good deeds without number ere now standing foremost in wise counsels
 and setting battle in array but now is this thing the best by far that
 he hath wrought among the argives to wit that he hath stayed this
 prating railer from his harangues never again forsooth will his proud
 soul henceforth bid him revile the kings with slanderous words"

 so said the common sort but up rose odysseus waster of cities with
 sceptre in his hand and by his side brighteyed athene in the likeness
 of a herald bade the multitude keep silence that the sons of the
 achaians both the nearest and the farthest might hear his words
 together and give heed to his counsel he of good intent made harangue
 to them and said "atreides now surely are the achaians for making
 thee o king most despised among all mortal men nor will they fulfil
 the promise that they pledged thee when they still were marching hither
 from horsepasturing argos that thou shouldest not return till thou
 hadst laid wellwalled ilios waste for like young children or widow
 women do they wail each to the other of returning home yea here is
 toil to make a man depart disheartened for he that stayeth away but one
 single month far from his wife in his benched ship fretteth himself when
 winter storms and the furious sea imprison him but for us the ninth
 year of our stay here is upon us in its course therefore do i not
 marvel that the achaians should fret beside their beaked ships yet
 nevertheless is it shameful to wait long and to depart empty be of good
 heart my friends and wait a while until we learn whether kalchas be a
 true prophet or no for this thing verily we know well in our hearts
 and ye all are witnesses thereof even as many as the fates of death
 have not borne away it was as it were but yesterday or the day before
 that the achaians' ships were gathering in aulis freighted with trouble
 for priam and the trojans and we round about a spring were offering on
 the holy altars unblemished hecatombs to the immortals beneath a fair
 planetree whence flowed bright water when there was seen a great
 portent a snake bloodred on the back terrible whom the god of
 olympus himself had sent forth to the light of day sprang from beneath
 the altar and darted to the planetree now there were there the brood
 of a sparrow tender little ones upon the topmost branch nestling
 beneath the leaves eight were they and the mother of the little ones
 was the ninth and the snake swallowed these cheeping pitifully and the
 mother fluttered around wailing for her dear little ones but he coiled
 himself and caught her by the wing as she screamed about him now when
 he had swallowed the sparrow's little ones and the mother with them the
 god who revealed him made of him a sign for the son of
 crookedcounselling kronos turned him to stone and we stood by and
 marvelled to see what was done so when the dread portent brake in upon
 the hecatombs of the gods then did kalchas forthwith prophesy and
 said 'why hold ye your peace ye flowinghaired achaians to us hath
 zeus the counsellor shown this great sign late come of late
 fulfilment the fame whereof shall never perish even as he swallowed
 the sparrow's little ones and herself the eight wherewith the mother
 that bare the little ones was the ninth so shall we war there so many
 years but in the tenth year shall we take the widewayed city' so
 spake the seer and now are all these things being fulfilled so come
 abide ye all ye wellgreaved achaians even where ye are until we have
 taken the great city of priam"

 so spake he and the argives shouted aloud and all round the ships
 echoed terribly to the voice of the achaians as they praised the saying
 of godlike odysseus and then spake among them knightly nestor of
 gerenia "out on it in very truth ye hold assembly like silly boys that
 have no care for deeds of war what shall come of our covenants and our
 oaths let all counsels be cast into the fire and all devices of
 warriors and the pure drinkofferings and the right hands of fellowship
 wherein we trusted for we are vainly striving with words nor can we
 find any device at all for all our long tarrying here son of atreus
 do thou still as erst keep steadfast purpose and lead the argives amid
 the violent fray and for these let them perish the one or two
 achaians that take secret counselto depart to argos first before they
 know whether the promise of aegisbearing zeus be a lie or no yea for
 i say that most mighty kronion pledged us his word that day when the
 argives embarked upon their fleet ships bearing unto the trojans death
 and fate for by his lightning upon our right he manifested signs of
 good therefore let trojan's wife and paid back his strivings and groans
 for helen's sake but if any man is overmuch desirous to depart homewards
 let him lay his hand upon his decked black ship that before all men he
 may encounter death and fate but do thou my king take good counsel
 thyself and whate'er it be shall not be cast away separate thy
 warriors by tribes and by clans agamemnon that clan may give aid to
 clan and tribe to tribe if thou do thus and the achaians hearken to
 thee then wilt thou know who among thy captains and who of the common
 sort is a coward and who too is brave for they will fight each after
 their sort so wilt thou know whether it is even by divine command that
 thou shalt not take the city or by the baseness of thy warriors and
 their ill skill in battle"

 and lord agamemnon answered and said to him "verily hast thou again
 outdone the sons of the achaians in speech old man ah father zeus and
 athene and apollo would that among the achaians i had ten such
 councillors then would the city of king priam soon bow beneath our
 hands captive and wasted but aegisbearing zeus the son of kronos
 hath brought sorrows upon me in that he casteth my lot amid fruitless
 wranglings and strifes for in truth i and achilles fought about a
 damsel with violent words and i was first to be angry but if we can
 only be at one in council then will there no more be any putting off
 the day of evil for the trojans no not for an instant but now go ye to
 your meal that we may join battle let each man sharpen well his spear
 and bestow well his shield and let him well give his fleetfooted
 steeds their meal and look well to his chariot on every side and take
 thought for battle that all day long we may contend in hateful war for
 of respite shall there intervene no not a whit only that the coming of
 night shall part the fury of warriors on each man's breast shall the
 baldrick of his covering shield be wet with sweat and his hand shall
 grow faint about the spear and each man's horse shall sweat as he
 draweth the polished chariot and whomsoever i perceive minded to tarry
 far from the fight beside the beaked ships for him shall there be no
 hope hereafter to escape the dogs and birds of prey"

 so spake he and the argives shouted aloud like to a wave on a steep
 shore when the south wind cometh and stirreth it even on a jutting
 rock that is never left at peace by the waves of all winds that rise
 from this side and from that and they did sacrifice each man to one of
 the everlasting gods praying for escape from death and the tumult of
 battle but agamemnon king of men slew a fat bull of five years to most
 mighty kronion and called the elders the princes of the achaian host
 nestor first and king idomeneus and then the two aiantes and tydeus'
 son and sixthly odysseus peer of zeus in counsel and menelaos of the
 loud warcry came to him unbidden for he knew in his heart how his
 brother toiled then stood they around the bull and took the
 barleymeal and agamemnon made his prayer in their midst and said
 "zeus most glorious most great god of the stormcloud that dwellest
 in the heaven vouchsafe that the sun set not upon us nor the darkness
 come near till i have laid low upon the earth priam's palace smirched
 with smoke and burnt the doorways thereof with consuming fire and rent
 on hector's breast his doublet cleft with the blade and about him may
 full many of his comrades prone in the dust bite the earth"

 so spake he but not as yet would kronion grant him fulfilment he
 accepted the sacrifice but made toil to wax increasingly

 now when they had prayed and sprinkled the barleymeal they first drew
 back the bull's head and cut his throat and flayed him and cut slices
 from the thigh's and wrapped them in fat making a double fold and laid
 raw collops thereon and these they burnt on cleft wood stript of
 leaves and spitted the vitals and held them over hephaistos' flame now
 when the thighs were burnt and they had tasted the vitals then sliced
 they all the rest and pierced it through with spits and roasted it
 carefully and drew all off again so when they had rest from the task
 and had made ready the banquet they feasted nor was their heart aught
 stinted of the fair banquet but when they had put away from them the
 desire of meat and drink then did knightly nestor of gerenia open his
 saying to them "most noble son of atreus agamemnon king of men let us
 not any more hold long converse here nor for long delay the work that
 god putteth in our hands but come let the heralds of the mailclad
 achaians make proclamation to the folk and gather them throughout the
 ships and let us go thus in concert through the wide host of the
 achaians that the speedier we may arouse keen war"

 so spake he and agamemnon king of men disregarded not straightway he
 bade the clearvoiced heralds summon to battle the flowinghaired
 achaians so those summoned and these gathered with all speed and the
 kings the fosterlings of zeus that were about atreus' son eagerly
 marshalled them and brighteyed athene in the midst bearing the holy
 aegis that knoweth neither age nor death whereon wave an hundred
 tassels of pure gold all deftly woven and each one an hundred oxen
 worth therewith she passed dazzling through the achaian folk urging
 them forth and in every man's heart she roused strength to battle
 without ceasing and to fight so was war made sweeter to them than to
 depart in their hollow ships to their dear native land even as ravaging
 fire kindleth a boundless forest on a mountain's peaks and the blaze is
 seen from afar even so as they marched went the dazzling gleam from the
 innumerable bronze through the sky even unto the heavens

 and as the many tribes of feathered birds wild geese or cranes or
 longnecked swans on the asian mead by kaystrios' stream fly hither
 and thither joying in their plumage and with loud cries settle ever
 onwards and the mead resounds even so poured forth the many tribes of
 warriors from ships and huts into the skamandrian plain and the earth
 echoed terribly beneath the tread of men and horses so stood they in
 the flowery skamandrian plain unnumbered as are leaves and flowers in
 their season even as the many tribes of thick flies that hover about a
 herdsman's steading in the spring season when milk drencheth the pails
 even in like number stood the flowinghaired achaians upon the plain in
 face of the trojans eager to rend them asunder and even as the
 goatherds easily divide the ranging flocks of goats when they mingle in
 the pasture so did their captains marshal them on this side and that
 to enter into the fray and in their midst lord agamemnon his head and
 eyes like unto zeus whose joy is in the thunder and his waist like unto
 ares and his breast unto poseidon even as a bull standeth out far
 foremost amid the herd for his is preeminent amid the pasturing kine
 even such did zeus make atreides on that day preeminent among many and
 chief amid heroes

 tell me now ye muses that dwell in the mansions of olympusseeing that
 ye are goddesses and are at hand and know all things but we hear only a
 rumour and know not anythingwho were the captains of the danaans and
 their lords but the common sort could i not number nor name nay not
 if ten tongues were mine and ten mouths and a voice unwearied and my
 heart of bronze within me did not the muses of olympus daughters of
 aegisbearing zeus put into my mind all that came to ilios so will i
 tell the captains of the ships and all the ships in order

 of the boiotians peneleos and leitos were captains and arkesilaos and
 prothoenor and klonios these were they that dwelt in hyria and rocky
 aulis and schoinos and skolos and eteonos full of ridges thespeia and
 graia and mykalessos with wide lawns and that dwelt about harma and

 sacred nisa and anthedon on the furthest borders of these there came
 fifty ships and in each one embarked young men of the boiotians an
 hundred and twenty and they that dwelt in aspledon and orchomenos of
 the minyai were led of askalaphos and ialmenos sons of ares whom
 astyoche conceived of the mighty god in the palace of aktor son of
 azeus having entered her upper chamber a stately maiden for mighty
 ares lay with her privily and with them sailed thirty hollow ships

 they that dwelt about anemoreia and hyampolis yea and they that lived
 by the goodly river kephisos and possessed lilaia by kephisos' springs
 and with them followed thirty black ships so they marshalled the ranks
 of the phokians diligently and had their station hard by the boiotians
 on the left

 and of the lokrians the fleet son of oileus was captain aias the less
 that was not so great as was the telamonian aias but far less small was
 he with linen corslet but with the spear he far outdid all the
 hellenes and achaians these were they that dwelt in kynos and opus and
 kalliaros and bessa and skarphe and lovely augeiai and tarphe and
 thronion about the streams of boagrios and with aias followed forty
 black ships of the lokrians that dwell over against holy euboia

 and the abantes breathing fury they that possessed euboia and chalkis

 the breasts of the foes and with him forty black ships followed

 and they that possessed the goodly citadel of athens the domain of
 erechtheus the highhearted whom erst athene daughter of zeus fostered

 restingplace in athens in her own rich sanctuary and there the sons of
 the athenians worship him with bulls and rams as the years turn in their
 coursesthese again were led of menestheus son of peteos and there was
 no man upon the face of earth that was like him for the marshalling of
 horsemen and warriors that bear the shield only nestor rivalled him
 for he was the elder by birth and with him rivalled him for he was the
 elder by birth and with him fifty black ships followed

 and aias led twelve ships from salamis and brought them and set them
 where the battalions of the athenians stood

 and they that possessed argos and tiryns of the great walls hermione
 and asine that enfold the deep gulf troizen and eionai and epidauros

 about aigion and through all the coastland and about broad helike of
 them did lord agamemnon son of atreus lead an hundred ships with him
 followed most and goodliest folk by far and in their midst himself was
 clad in flashing bronze all glorious and was preeminent amid all
 warriors because he was goodliest and led folk far greatest in number

 and of them that possessed lakedaimon lying low amid the rifted hills
 and pharis and sparta and messe the haunt of doves and dwelt in
 bryseiai and lovely augeiai and of them too that possessed amyklai and
 the seacoast fortress of helos and that possessed laas and dwelt about
 oitylos of these was the king's brother leader even menelaos of the
 loud warcry leader of sixty ships and these were arrayed apart and
 himself marched among them confident in his zeal urging his men to
 battle and his heart most of all was set to take vengeance for his
 strivings and groans for helen's sake or "for helen's searchings of
 heart and groans"

 and of them that dwelt in pylos and lovely arene and thryon the
 fordingplace of alpheios and in established aipy and were inhabitants
 of kyparisseis and amphigeneia and pteleos and helos and dorionwhere
 the muses met thamyris the thracian and made an end of his singing as
 he was faring from oichalia from eurytos the oichalian for he averred
 with boasting that he would conquer even did the muses themselves sing
 against him the daughters of aegisbearing zeus but they in their
 anger maimed him moreover they took from him the high gift of song and
 made him to forget his harpingof all these was knightly nestor of
 gerenia leader and with him sailed ninety hollow ships

 and of them that possessed arkadia beneath the steep mountain of
 kyllene beside the tomb of aipytos where are warriors that fight hand
 to hand and of them that dwelt in pheneos and orchomenos abounding in
 flocks and rhipe and stratie and windy enispe and that possessed tegea
 and lovely mantineia and possessed stymphelos and dwelt in parhasie of
 these was ankaios' son lord agapenor leader even of sixty ships and in
 each ship embarked many arkadian warriors skilled in fight for
 agamemnon king of men himself gave them benched ships wherewith to cross
 the winedark sea even he the son of atreus for matters of seafaring
 concerned them not

 and they too that inhabited bouprasion and goodly elis so much thereof
 as hyrmine and myrsinos upon the borders and the olenian rock and
 aleision bound between them of these men there were four captains and
 ten swift ships followed each one and many epeians embarked thereon so
 some were led of amphimachos and thalpios of the lineage of aktor sons
 one of kteatos and one of eurytos and of some was stalwart diores
 captain son of amarynkes and of the fourth company godlike polyxeinos
 was captain son of king agasthenes augeias' son

 and them of doulichion and the holy echinean isles that stand beyond the
 sea over against elis even these did meges lead the peer of ares
 phyleides to wit for he was begotten of knightly phyleus dear to zeus
 him that erst changed his habitation to doulichion for anger against his
 father and with him followed forty black ships

 and odysseus led the greathearted kephallenians them that possessed
 ithaka and neriton with quivering leafage and dwelt in krokyleia and
 rugged aigilips and them that possessed zakynthos and that dwelt in
 samos and possessed the mainland and dwelt in the parts over against
 the isles them did odysseus lead the peer of zeus in counsel and with
 him followed twelve ships with vermillion prow

 and of the aitolians thoas was captain the son of andraimon even of
 them that dwelt in pleuron and olenos and pylene and chalkis on the
 seashore and rocky kalydon for the sons of greathearted oineus were
 no more neither did he still live and goldenhaired meleagros was
 dead to whose hands all had been committed for him to be king of the
 aitolians and with thoas there followed forty black ships

 and of the cretans idomeneus the famous spearman was leader even of

 the manslaying wargod with these followed eighty black ships

 and tlepolemmos herakles' son goodly and tall led from rhodes nine
 ships of the lordly rhodians that dwelt in rhodes in threefold
 ordering in lindos and ialysos and chalky kameiros these were led of
 tlepolemos the famous spearman that was born to great herakles by
 astyocheia whom he had brought away from ephyre by the river selleeis
 when he laid waste many cities of strong men fosterlings of zeus now
 when tlepolemos had grown to manhood within the strong palace walls
 anon he slew his own father's dear uncle an old man now likymnios of
 the stock of ares then with speed built he ships and gathered much folk
 together and went fleeing across the deep because the other sons and
 grandsons of great herakles threatened him so he came to rhodes a
 wanderer enduring hardships and his folk settled by kinship in three
 tribes and were loved of zeus that is king among gods and men and
 kronion poured upon them exceeding great wealth

 nireus moreover led three trim ships from syme nireus son of aglaia
 and king charopos nireus the most beauteous man that came up under
 ilios of all the danaans after the noble son of peleus howbeit he was
 a weakling and a scanty host followed him

 and of them that possessed nisyros and krapathos and kasos and kos the
 city of eurypylos and the kalydnian isles of them pheidippos and
 antiphos were leaders the two sons of king thessalos son of herakles
 with them were arrayed thirty hollow ships

 now all moreover that dwelt in the pelasgian argos and inhabited alos
 and alope and trachis and possessed phthia and hellas the home of fair
 women and were called myrmidons and hellenes and achaians of all
 these even fifty ships achilles was captain but these took no thought
 of noisy war for there was no man to array them in line of battle for
 fleetfooted goodly achilles lay idle amid the ships wroth for the sake
 of a damsel briseis of the lovely hair whom he had won from lyrnessos
 and the walls of thebe and overthrew mynes and epistrophos warriors
 that bare the spear sons of king euenos selepos' son for her sake lay
 achilles sorrowing but soon was he to arise again

 and of them that possessed phylake and flowery pyrasos demeter's
 sanctuary and iton mother of flocks and antron by the seashore and
 pteleos couched in grass of all these was warlike protesilaos leader
 while yet he lived but now ere this the black earth held him fast his
 wife with marred visage was left alone in phylake yea and his bridal
 chamber half builded for a dardanian warrior slew him as he leapt from
 his ship far first of the achaians yet neither were his men leaderless
 though they sorrowed for their leader for podarkes of the stock of ares
 marshalled them son of phylakos' son iphiklos was he the lord of many
 flocks own brother of greathearted protesilaos and youngerborn than
 he but the other was alike the elder and the braver even protesilaos
 that mighty man of war yet did not the host lack at all a leader only
 they yearned for the noble dead with him followed forty black ships

 and of them that dwelt in pherai by the boibeian mere in boibe and
 glaphyre and stablished iolkos of them even eleven ships admetos'
 dear son was leader eumelos whom alkestis fair among women bare to
 admetos she that was most beauteous to look upon of the daughters of
 pelias

 and of them that dwelt in methone and thaumakie and possessed meliboia
 and rugged olizon of these even seven ships was philoktetes leader
 the cunning archer and in each ship sailed fifty oarsmen skilled to
 fight amain with the bow but their captain lay enduring sore pain in
 the isle of goodly lemnos where the sons of the achaians left him sick
 of a grievous wound from a deadly watersnake there lay he pining yet
 were the argives soon to bethink them beside their ships of king
 philoktetes yet neither were his men leaderless only they sorrowed for
 their leader but medon marshalled them oileus' bastard son whom rhene
 bare to oileus waster of cities

 and of them that possessed trikke and terraced ithome and that possessed
 oichalia city of eurytos the oichalian of these again asklepios' two
 sons were leaders the cunning leeches podaleirios and machaon and with
 them were arrayed thirty hollow ships

 and of them that possessed ormenios and the fountain of hypereia and
 possessed asterion and the white crests of titanos of these was
 eurypylos leader euaimon's glorious son and with him forty black
 ships followed

 and of them that possessed argissa and dwelt in gyrtona orthe and
 elone and the white city of olooson of these was captain unflinching
 polypoites son of peirithoos that immortal zeus begat and polypoites
 did famed hippodameia conceive of peirithoos on that day when he took
 vengeance of the shaggy wild folk and thrust them forth from pelion and
 drave them to the aithikes and polypoites ruled not alone but with him
 was leonteus of the stock of ares son of highhearted koronos kaineus'
 son and with them forty black ships followed

 and gouneus from kyphos led twoandtwenty ships and with him followed
 the enienes and unflinching peraibians that had pitched their homes
 about wintry dodona and dwelt on the tilth about lovely titaresios that
 poureth his fairflowing stream into peneios yet doth he not mingle
 with the silver eddies of peneios but floweth on over him like unto
 oil seeing that he is an offspring from the water of styx the dread
 river of the oath

 and the magnetes were led of prothoos son of tenthredon even they that
 dwelt about peneios and pelion with trembling leafage these did fleet
 prothoos lead and with him forty black ships followed

 so these were the leaders of the danaans and their captains now tell
 me o muse who among them was first and foremost of warriors alike and
 horses that followed the sons of atreus of horses they of pheres' son
 were far goodliest those that eumelos drave swift as birds like of
 coat like of age matched to the measure of a levelling line across
 their backs these were reared in peraia by apollo of the silver bow
 two mares carrying onward the terror of battle but of warriors far best
 was the telamonian aias while the wrath of achilles yet endured for he
 was greatest of all he and his horses that bore him even peleus' noble
 son but he lay idle among his seafaring ships in sore wrath against
 agamemnon atreus' son shepherd of the host and his folk along the
 seashore sported with quoits and with casting of javelins and archery
 and the horses each beside his own chariot stood idle champing clover
 and parsley of the marsh and their lords' chariots lay well covered up
 within the huts while the men yearned for their warrior chief and
 wandered hither and thither through the camp and fought not

 so marched they then as though all the land were consuming with fire
 and the earth groaned beneath them as at the wrath of zeus whose joy is
 in the thunder when he lasheth the earth about typhoeus in the country
 of the arimoi where men say is typhoeus' couch even so groaned the
 earth aloud at their tread as they went and with speed advanced they
 across the plain

 now fleet iris the windfooted went to the trojans a messenger from
 aegisbearing zeus with a grievous message these were holding assembly
 at priam's gate being gathered all together both young men and old and
 fleetfooted iris stood hard by and spake to them and she made her
 voice like to the voice of polites son of priam who was the sentinel of
 the trojans and was wont to sit trusting in his fleetness upon the
 barrow of aisyetes of old and on the top thereof wait the sallying of
 the achaians forth from their ships even in his likeness did
 fleetfooted iris speak to priam "old man words beyond number are
 still pleasant to thee as erst in the days of peace but war without
 respite is upon us of a truth have i very oft ere now entered into
 battles of the warriors yet have i never seen so goodly a host and so
 great for in the very likeness of the leaves of the forest or the sands
 of the sea are they marching along the plain to fight against the city
 but hector thee do i charge beyond all to do even as i shall say
 seeing that the allies are very many throughout priam's great city and
 diverse men being scattered abroad have diverse tongues therefore let
 each one give the word to those whose chieftain he is and them let him
 lead forth and have the ordering of his countrymen"

 so spake she and hector failed not to know the voice of the goddess
 and straightway dismissed the assembly and they rushed to arms and the
 gates were thrown open wide and the host issued forth footmen and
 horsemen and mighty din arose

 now there is before the city a certain steep mound apart in the plain
 with a clear way about it on this side and on that and men indeed call
 this "batieia" but the immortals call it "the tomb of lithe myrine"
 there did the trojans and their allies divide their companies

 amid the trojans great hector of the glancing helm was leader the son
 of priam with him the greatest hosts by far and the goodliest were
 arrayed eager warriors of the spear

 but the dardanians were led of the princely son of anchises aineias
 whom bright aphrodite conceived to anchises amids the spurs of ida a
 goddess wedded to a mortal neither was he alone with him were
 antenor's two sons archelochos and akamas well skilled in all the ways
 of war

 and of them that dwelt in zeleia beneath the nethermost foot of ida the
 men of substance that drink the dark waters of aisepos even the troes
 of these lykaon's glorious son was leader pandaros to whom apollo
 himself gave the bow

 and of them that possessed adresteia and the land of apaisos and
 possessed pityeia and the steep hill of tereia of these adrestos was
 captain and amphios of the linen corslet the two sons of merops of
 perkote that beyond all men knew soothsaying and would have hindered
 his children marching to murderous war but they gave him no heed for
 the fates of black death led them on

 and they that dwelt about perkote and praktios and possessed sestos and
 abydos and bright arisbe these were led of hyrtakos' son asios a
 prince of men asios son of hyrtakos whom his tall sorrel steeds
 brought from arisbe from the river selleeis

 and hippothoos led the tribes of the pelasgians that fight with spears
 them that inhabited deepsoiled larisa these were led of hippothoos and
 pylaios of the stock of ares twain sons of pelasgian lethos son of
 teutamos

 and the thracians were led of akamas and hero peiroos even all they
 that the strong stream of hellespont shutteth in and euphemos was
 captain of the kikonian spearmen the son of troizenos keos' son
 fosterling of zeus

 but pyraichmes led the paionians with curving bows from far away in
 amydon from the broad stream of axios axios whose water is the fairest
 that floweth over the face of the earth

 and pylaimenes of rugged heart led the paphlagonians from the land of
 the eneti whence is the breed of wild mules this folk were they that
 possessed kytoros and dwelt about sesamon and inhabited their famed
 dwellings round the river parthenios and kromna and aigialos and lofty
 erythini

 and the alizones were led of odios and epistrophos from far away in
 alybe where is the birthplace of silver

 and the mysians were led of chromis and ennomos the augur yet with all
 his auguries warded he not black fate from him but was vanguished by the
 hand of fleetfooted aiakides in the river when he made havoc of the
 trojans there and of the rest

 and phorkys and godlike askanios led the phrygians from far askania and
 these were eager to fight in the battlethrong

 and the maionians were commanded of mesthles and antiphos talaimenes'
 two sons whose mother was the gygaian mere so these led the maionians
 whose birthplace was under tmolos

 but nastes led the karians uncouth of speech that possessed miletos
 and the mountain of phthires of leafage numberless and the streams of
 maiandros and the steep crest of mykale these were led of amphimachos
 and nastes nastes and amphimachos the glorious children of nomion and
 he came forsooth to battle with golden attire like a girlfond man
 that held not back in any wise grievous destruction but he was
 vanguished by the hands of fleetfooted aiakides in the river and
 wisehearted achilles carried away his gold

 and sarpedon and blameless glaukos led the lykians from far away in
 lykia by eddying xanthos



 book iii

 how menelaos and paris fought in single combat and
 aphrodite rescued paris and how helen and priam beheld the
 achaian host from the walls of troy

 now when they were arrayed each company with their captains the
 trojans marched with clamour and with shouting like unto birds even as
 when there goeth up before heaven a clamour of cranes which flee from
 the coming of winter and sudden rain and fly with clamour towards the
 streams of ocean bearing slaughter and fate to the pigmy men and in
 early morn offer cruel battle but on the other side marched the
 achaians in silence breathing courage eager at heart to give succour
 man to man

 even as when the south wind sheddeth mist over the crests of a mountain
 mist unwelcome to the shepherd but to the robber better than night
 and a man can see no further than he casteth a stone even so thick
 arose the gathering dustclouds at their tread as they went and
 with all speed they advanced across the plain

 so when they were now come nigh in onset on each other godlike
 alexandros played champion to the trojans wearing upon his shoulders
 pantherskin and curved bow and sword and he brandished two
 bronzeheaded spears and challenged all the chieftains of the argives to
 fight him man to man in deadly combat but when menelaos dear to ares
 marked him coming in the forefront of the multitude with long strides
 then even as a lion is glad when he lighteth upon a great carcase a
 horned stag or a wild goat that he hath found being an hungered and
 so he devoureth it amain even though the fleet hounds and lusty youths
 set upon him even thus was menelaos glad when his eyes beheld godlike
 alexandros for he thought to take vengeance upon the sinner so
 straightway he leap in his armour from his chariot to the ground

 but when godlike alexandros marked him appear amid the champions his
 heart was smitten and he shrank back into the host of his comrades
 avoiding death and even as a man that hath seen a serpent in a mountain
 glade starteth backward and trembling seizeth his feet beneath him
 and he retreateth back again and paleness hath hold of his cheeks even
 so did godlike alexandros for fear of atreus' son shrink back into the
 throng of lordly trojans but hector beheld and upbraided him with
 scornful words "ill paris most fair in semblance thou deceiver
 womanmad would thou hadst been unborn and died unwed yea that were
 my desire and it were far better than thus to be our shame and looked
 at askance of all men i ween that the flowinghaired achaians laugh
 deeming that a prince is our champion only because a goodly favour is
 his but in his heart is there no strength nor any courage art thou
 indeed such an one that in thy seafaring ships thou didst sail over the
 deep with the company of thy trusty comrades and in converse with
 strangers didst bring back a fair woman from a far country one that was
 by marriage daughter to warriors that bear the spear that she might be
 a sore mischief to they father and city and all the realm but to our
 foes a rejoicing and to thyself a hanging of the head and canst thou
 not indeed abide menelaos dear to ares thou mightest see what sort of
 warrior is he whose lovely wife thou hast thy lyre will not avail thee
 nor the gifts of aphrodite those thy locks and fair favour when thou
 grovellest in the dust but the trojans are very cowards else ere this
 hadst thou donned a robe of stone ie been stoned by the people for
 all the ill thou hast wrought"

 and godlike alexandros made answer to him again "hector since in
 measure thou chidest me and not beyond measurethey heart is ever keen
 even as an axe that pierceth a beam at the hand of a man that shapeth a
 ship's timber with skill and thereby is the man's blow strengthened
 even such is thy heart undaunted in thy breast cast not in my teeth the
 lovely gifts of golden aphrodite not to be flung aside are the gods'
 glorious gifts that of their own good will they give for by his desire
 can no man win them but now if thou wilt have me do battle and fight
 make the other trojans sit down and all the achaians and set ye me in
 the midst and menelaos dear to ares to fight for helen and all her
 wealth and whichsoever shall vanquish and gain the upper hand let him
 take all the wealth aright and the woman and bear them home and let
 the rest pledge friendship and sure oaths so may ye dwell in
 deepsoiled troy and let them depart to argos pastureland of horses
 and achaia home of fair women"

 so spake he and hector rejoiced greatly to hear his saying and went
 into the midst and restrained the battalions of the trojans with his
 spear grasped by the middle and they all sate them down but the
 flowinghaired achaians kept shooting at him aiming with arrows and
 casting stones but agamemnon king of men cried aloud "refrain ye
 argives shoot not ye sons of the achaians for hector of the glancing
 helm hath set himself to say somewhat"

 so spake he and they refrained from battle and made silence speedily
 and hector spake between the two hosts "hear of me trojans and
 wellgreaved achaians the saying of alexandros for whose sake strife
 hath come about he biddeth the other trojans and all the achaians to
 lay down their goodly armour on the bounteous earth and himself in the
 midst and menelaos dear to ares to fight alone for helen and all her
 wealth and whichsoever shall vanquish and gain the upper hand let him
 take all the wealth aright and the woman and bear them home but let
 all of us pledge friendship and sure oaths"

 so spake he and they all kept silence and were still then in their
 midst spake menelaos of the loud warcry "hearken ye now to me too
 for into my heart most of all is grief entered and i deem that the
 parting of argives and trojans hath come at last seeing ye have endured
 many ills because of my quarrel and the first sin of alexandros and for
 whichsoever of us death and fate are prepared let him lie dead and be
 ye all parted with speed bring ye two lambs one white ram and one
 black ewe for earth and sun and let us bring one for zeus and call
 hither great priam that he may pledge the oath himself seeing he hath
 sons that are overweening and faithless lest any by transgression do
 violence to the oath of zeus for young men's hearts are ever lifted up
 but wheresoever an old man entereth in he looketh both before and
 after whereby the best issue shall come for either side"

 so spake he and achaians and trojans were glad deeming that they
 should have rest from grievous war so they refrained their chariots to
 the ranks and themselves alighted and doffed their arms and these they
 laid upon the earth each close to each and there was but small space
 between and hector sent two heralds to the city will all speed to
 bring the lambs and to call priam and lord agamemnon sent forth
 talthybios to go to the hollow ships and bade him bring a ram and he
 was not disobedient to noble agamemnon

 now iris went with a message to whitearmed helen in the likeness of her
 husband's sister the spouse of antenor's son even her that lord
 helikaon antenor's son had to wife laodike fairest favoured of priam's
 daughters and in the hall she found helen weaving a great purple web of
 double fold and embroidering thereon many battles of horsetaming
 trojans and mailclad achaians that they had endured for her sake at
 the hands of ares so fleetfooted iris stood by her side and said
 "come hither dear sister that thou mayest see the wondrous doings of
 horsetaming trojans and mailclad achaians they that erst waged
 tearful war upon each other in the plain eager for deadly battle even
 they sit now in silence and the tall spears are planted by their sides
 but alexandros and menelaos dear to ares will fight with their tall
 spears for thee and thou wilt be declared the dear wife of him that
 conquereth"

 so spake the goddess and put into her heart sweet longing for her
 former husband and her city and parents

 forthwith she veiled her face in shining linen and hastened from her
 chamber letting fall a round tear not unattended for there followed
 with her two handmaidens aithre daughter of pittheus and oxeyed
 klymene then came she straightway to the place of the skaian gates and
 they that were with priam and panthoos and thymoites and lampos and
 klytios and hiketaon of the stock of ares oukalegon withal and antenor
 twain sages being elders of the people sat at the skaian gates these
 had now ceased from battle for old age yet were they right good
 orators like grasshoppers that in a forest sit upon a tree and utter
 their lilylike supposed to mean "delicate" or "tender" voice even so
 sat the elders of the trojans upon the tower now when they saw helen
 coming to the tower they softly spake winged words one to the other
 "small blame is it that trojans and wellgreaved achaians should for
 such a woman long time suffer hardships marvellously like is she to the
 immortal goddesses to look upon yet even so though she be so goodly
 let her go upon their ships and not stay to vex us and our children
 after us"

 so said they and priam lifted up his voice and called to helen "come
 hither dear child and sit before me that thou mayest see thy former
 husband and they kinsfolk and thy friends i hold thee not to blame
 nay i hold the gods to blame who brought on me the dolorous war of the
 achaiansso mayest thou now tell me who is this huge hero this achaian
 warrior so goodly and great of a truth there are others even taller by
 a head yet mine eyes never behold a man so beautiful nor so royal for
 he is like unto one that is a king"

 and helen fair among women spake and answered him "reverend art thou
 to me and dread dear father of my lord would that sore death had been
 my pleasure when i followed thy son hither and left my home and my
 kinsfolk and my daughter in her girlhood and the lovely company of mine
 agefellows but that was not so wherefore i pine with weeping now
 will i tell thee that whereof thou askest me and enquirest this is
 atreides wideruling agamemnon one that is both a goodly king and
 mighty spearman and he was my husband's brother to me ah shameless me
 if ever such an one there was"

 so said she and the old man marvelled at him and said "ah happy
 atreides child of fortune blest of heaven now know i that many sons
 of the achaians are subject to thee erewhile fared i to phrygia the
 land of vines and there saw i that the men of phrygia they of the
 nimble steeds were very many even the hosts of otreus and godlike
 mygdon that were then encamped along the banks of sangarios for i too
 being their ally was numbered among them on the day that the amazons
 came the peers of men yet were not even they so many as are the
 glancingeyed achaians"

 and next the old man saw odysseus and asked "come now tell me of this
 man too dear child who is he shorter by a head than agamemnon son of
 atreus but broader of shoulder and of chest to behold his armour lieth
 upon the bounteous earth and himself like a bellwether rangeth the
 ranks of warriors yea i liken him to a thickfleeced ram ordering a
 great flock of ewes"

 then helen sprung of zeus made answer to him "now this is laertes' son
 crafty odysseus that was reared in the realm of ithaka rugged though
 it be and skilled in all the ways of wile and cunning device"

 then sage antenor made answer to her "lady verily the thing thou
 sayest is true indeed for erst came goodly odysseus hither also on an
 embassage for thee in the company of menelaos dear to ares and i gave
 them entertainment and welcomed them in my halls and learnt the aspect
 of both and their wise devices now when they mingled with the trojans
 in the assembly while all stood up menelaos overpassed them all by the
 measure of his broad shoulders but when both sat down odysseus was the
 more stately and when they began to weave the web of words and counsel
 in the face of all then menelaos harangued fluently in few words but
 very clearly seeing he was not long of speech neither random though
 in years he was the younger but whenever odysseus full of wiles rose
 up he stood and looked down with eyes fixed upon the ground and waved
 not his staff whether backwards or forwards but held it stiff like to
 a man of no understanding one would deem him to be churlish and naught
 but a fool but when he uttered his great voice from his chest and
 words like unto the snowflakes of winter then could no mortal man
 contend with odysseus then marvelled we not thus to behold odysseus'
 aspect"

 and thirdly the old man say aias and asked "who then is this other
 achaian warrior goodly and great preeminent among the archives by the
 measure of his head and broad shoulders"

 and longrobed helen fair among women answered "this is huge aias
 bulwark of the achaians and on the other side amid the cretans standeth
 idomeneus like a god and about him are gathered the captains of the
 cretans oft did menelaos dear to ares entertain him in our house
 whene'er he came from crete and now behold i all the other
 glancingeyed achaians whom well i could discern and tell their names
 but two captains of the host can i not see even kastor tamer of horses
 and polydeukes the skilful boxer mine own brethren whom the same mother
 bare either they came not in the company from lovely lakedaimon or
 they came hither indeed in their seafaring ships but now will not enter
 into the battle of the warriors for fear of the many scornings and
 revilings that are mine"

 so said she but them the lifegiving earth held fast there in
 lakedaimon in their dear native land

 meanwhile were the heralds bearing through the city the holy
 oathofferings two lambs and stronghearted wine the fruit of the
 earth in a goatskin bottle and the herald idaios bare the shining
 bowl and golden cups and came to the old man and summoned him and said
 "rise thou son of laomedon the chieftains of the horsetaming trojans
 and mailclad achaians call on thee to go down into the plain that ye
 may pledge a trusty oath but alexandros and menelaos dear to ares will
 fight with their long spears for the lady's sake and let lady and
 treasure go with him that shall conquer and may we that are left pledge
 friendship and trusty oaths and dwell in deepsoiled troy and they
 shall depart to argos pastureland of horses and achaia home of fair
 women"

 so said he and the old man shuddered and base his companions yoke the
 horses and they with speed obeyed then priam mounted and drew back the
 reins and by his side antenor mounted the splendid chariot so the two
 drave the fleet horses through the skaian gates to the plain and when
 they had come even to the trojans and achaians they went down from the
 chariots upon the bounteous earth and marched into the midst of trojans
 and achaians then forthwith rose up agamemnon king of men and up rose
 odysseus the man of wiles and the lordly heralds gathered together the
 holy oathofferings of the gods and mingled the wine in a bowl and
 poured water over the princes' hands and atreides put forth his hand
 and drew his knife that hung ever beside his sword's great sheath and
 cut the hair from off the lambs' heads and then the heralds portioned
 it among the chief of the trojans and achaians then in their midst
 atreus' son lifted up his hands and prayed aloud "father zeus that
 rulest from ida most glorious most great and thou sun that seest all
 things and hearest all things and ye rivers and thou earth and ye that
 in the underworld punish men outworn whosoever sweareth falsely be ye
 witnesses and watch over the faithful oath if alexandros slay
 menelaos then let him have helen to himself and all her possessions
 and we will depart on our seafaring ships but if goldenhaired menelaos
 slay alexandros then let the trojans give back helen and all her
 possessions and pay the argives the recompense that is seemly such as
 shall live among men that shall be hereafter but if so be that priam
 and priam's sons will not pay the recompense unto me when alexandros
 falleth then will i fight on thereafter for the price of sin and abide
 here till i compass the end of war"

 so said he and cut the lambs' throats with the pitiless knife them he
 laid gasping upon the ground failing of breath for the knife had taken
 their strength from them and next they drew the wine from the bowl into
 the cups and poured it forth and prayed to the gods that live for ever
 and thus would say many an one of achaians and trojans "zeus most
 glorious most great and all ye immortal gods which folk soe'er be
 first to sin against the oaths may their brains be so poured forth upon
 the earth even as this wine theirs and their children's and let their
 wives be made subject unto strangers"

 so spake they but the son of kronos vouchsafed not yet fulfilment and
 in their midst priam of the seed of dardanos uttered his saying
 "hearken to me trojans and wellgreaved achaians i verily will return
 back to windy ilios seeing that i can in no wise bear to behold with
 mine eyes my dear son fighting with menelaos dear to ares but zeus
 knoweth and all the immortal gods for whether of the twain the doom of
 death is appointed"

 so spake the godlike man and laid the lambs in his chariot and entered
 in himself and drew back the reins and by his side antenor mounted the
 splendid chariot so they departed back again to ilios and hector son
 of priam and goodly odysseus first meted out a space and then they took
 the lots and shook them in a bronzebound helmet to know whether of
 the twain should first cast his spear of bronze and the people prayed
 and lifted up their hands to the gods and thus would say many an one of
 achaians and trojans "father zeus that rulest from ida most glorious
 most great whichsoe'er it be that brought this trouble upon both
 peoples vouchsafe that he may die and enter the house of hades that so
 for us peace may be assured and trusty oaths"

 so said they and great hector of the glancing plume shook the helmet
 looking behind him and quickly leapt forth the lot of paris then the
 people sat them down by ranks where each man's highstepping horses and
 inwrought armour lay and upon his shoulders goodly alexandros donned
 his beauteous armour even he that was lord to helen of the lovely hair
 first upon his legs set he his greaves beautiful fastened with silver
 ankleclasps next upon his breast he donned the corslet of his brother
 lykaon and fitted it upon himself and over his shoulders cast he his
 silverstudded sword of bronze and then a shield great and sturdy and
 on his mighty head he set a wrought helmet of horsehair crest
 whereover the plume nodded terribly and he took him a strong spear
 fitted to his grasp and in like wise warlike menelaos donned his
 armour

 so when they had armed themselves on either side in the throng they
 strode between trojans and achaians fierce of aspect and wonder came
 on them that beheld both on the trojans tamers of horses and on the
 wellgreaved achaians then took they their stand near together in the
 measured space brandishing their spears in wrath each against other
 first alexandros hurled his far shadowing spear and smote on atreides'
 round shield but the bronze brake not through for its point was turned
 in the stout shield next menelaos son of atreus lifted up his hand to
 cast and made prayer to father zeus "king zeus grant me revenge on
 him that was first to do me wrong even on goodly alexandros and subdue
 thou him at my hands so that many an one of men that shall be hereafter
 may shudder to wrong his host that hath shown him kindness"

 so said he and poised his farshadowing spear and hurled and smote on
 the round shield of the son of priam through the bright shield went the
 ponderous spear and through the inwrought breastplate it pressed on and
 straight beside his flank the spear rent the tunic but he swerved and
 escaped black death then atreides drew his silverstudded sword and
 lifted up his hand and smote the helmetridge but the sword shattered
 upon it into three yea four and fell from his hand thereat atreides
 looked up to the wide heaven and cried "father zeus surely none of the
 gods is crueller than thou verily i thought to have gotten vengeance on
 alexandros for his wickedness but now my sword breaketh in my hand and
 my spear sped from my grasp in vain and i have not smitten him"

 so saying he leapt upon him and caught him by his horsehair crest and
 swinging him round dragged him towards the wellgreaved achaians and he
 was strangled by the embroidered strap beneath his soft throat drawn
 tight below his chin to hold his helm now would menelaos have dragged
 him away and won glory unspeakable but that zeus' daughter aphrodite
 was swift to mark and tore asunder for him the strap of slaughtered
 ox's hide so the helmet came away empty in his stalwart hand thereat
 menelaos cast it with a swing toward the wellgreaved achaians and his
 trusty comrades took it up and himself sprang back again eager to slay
 him with spear of bronze but aphrodite snatched up paris very easily
 as a goddess may and hid him in thick darkness and sent him down in
 his fragrant perfumed chamber and herself went to summon helen her she
 found on the high tower and about her the trojan women thronged so
 with her hand she plucked her perfumed raiment and shook it and spake to
 her in the likeness of an aged dame a woolcomber that was wont to work
 for her fair wool when she dwelt in lakedaimon whom too she greatly
 loved even in her likeness fair aphrodite spake "come hither
 alexandros summoneth thee to go homeward there is he in his chamber and
 inlaid bed radiant in beauty and vesture nor wouldst thou deem him to
 be come from fighting his foe but rather to be faring to the dance or
 from the dance to be just resting and set down"

 so said she and stirred helen's soul within her breast and when now
 she marked the fair neck and lovely breast and sparkling eyes of the
 goddess she marvelled straightway and spake a word and called upon her
 name "strange queen why art thou desirous now to beguile me verily
 thou wilt lead me further on to some one of the people cities of phrygia
 or lovely maionia if there too thou hast perchance some other darling
 among mortal men because even now menelaos hath conquered goodly
 alexandros and will lead me accursed me to his home therefore thou
 comest hither with guileful intent go and sit thou by his side and
 depart from the way of the gods neither let thy feet ever bear thee
 back to olympus but still be vexed for his sake and guard him till he
 make thee his wife or perchance his slave but thither will i not go
 that were a sinful thingto array the bed of him all the women of troy
 will blame me thereafter and i have griefs untold within my soul"

 then in wrath bright aphrodite spake to her "provoke me not rash
 woman lest in mine anger i desert thee and hate thee even as now i
 love thee beyond measure and lest i devise grievous enmities between
 both even betwixt trojans and achaians and so thou perish in evil
 wise"

 so said she and helen sprung of zeus was afraid and went wrapped in
 her bright radiant vesture silently and the trojan women marked her
 not and the goddess led the way

 now when they were come to the beautiful house of alexandros the
 handmaidens turned straightway to their tasks and the fair lady went to
 the highroofed chamber and laughterloving aphrodite took for her a
 chair and brought it even she the goddess and set it before the face
 of paris there helen took her seat the child of aegisbearing zeus
 and with eyes turned askance spake and chode her lord "thou comest back
 from battle would thou hadst perished there vanquished of that great
 warrior that was my former husband verily it was once thy boast that
 thou wast a better man than menelaos dear to ares in the might of thine
 arm and thy spear but go now challenge menelaos dear to ares to fight
 thee again face to face nay but i even i bid thee refrain nor fight
 a fight with goldenhaired menelaos man to man neither attack him
 recklessly lest perchance thou fall to his spear anon"

 and paris made answer to her and said "chide not my soul lady with
 cruel taunts for now indeed hath menelaos vanquished me with athene's
 aid but another day may i do so unto him for we too have gods with us
 but come now let us have joy of love upon our couch for never yet hath
 love so enwrapped my heartnot even then when first i snatched thee
 from lovely lakedaimon and sailed with thee on my seafaring ships and
 in the isle of kranae had converse with thee upon thy couch in loveas
 i love thee now and sweet desire taketh hold upon me" so saying he led
 the way to the couch and the lady followed with him

 thus laid they them upon their fretted couch but atreides the while
 strode through the host like to a wild beast if anywhere he might set
 eyes on godlike alexandros but none of the trojans or their famed
 allies could discover alexandros to menelaos dear to ares yet surely
 did they in no wise hide him for kindliness could any have seen him
 for he was hated of all even as black death so agamemnon king of men
 spake among them there "hearken to me trojans and dardanians and
 allies now is victory declared for menelaos dear to ares give ye back
 helen of argos and the possessions with her and pay ye the recompense
 such as is seemly that it may live even among men that shall be
 hereafter" so said atreides and all the achaians gave assent



 book iv

 how pandaros wounded menelaos by treachery and agamemnon
 exhorted his chief captains to battle

 now the gods sat by zeus and held assembly on the golden floor and in
 the midst the lady hebe poured them their nectar they with golden
 goblets pledged one another and gazed upon the city of the trojans
 then did kronos' son essay to provoke hera with vexing words and spake
 maliciously "twain goddesses hath menelaos for his helpers even hera
 of argos and alalkomenean athene yet these sit apart and take there
 pleasure in beholding but beside that other ever standeth
 laughterloving aphrodite and wardeth off fate from him and now hath
 she saved him as he thought to perish but of a truth the victory is to
 menelaos dear to ares so let us take thought how these things shall be
 whether once more we shall arouse ill war and the dread battledin or
 put friendship between the foes moreover if this were welcome to all
 and well pleasing may the city of king priam yet be an habitation and
 menelaos take back helen of argos"

 so said he but athene and hera murmured thereat who were sitting by
 him and devising ills for the trojans now athene held her peace and
 said not anything for wrath at father zeus and fierce anger gat hold
 upon her but hera's breast contained not her anger and she spake
 "most dread son of kronos what word is this thou hast spoken how hast
 thou the will to make my labour void and of none effect and the sweat
 of my toil that i sweated when my horses were wearied with my summoning
 of the host to be the plague of priam and his sons do as thou wilt
 but we other gods do not all approve thee"

 then in sore anger zeus the cloudgatherer spake to her "good lack how
 have priam and priam's sons done thee such great wrong that thou art
 furiously minded to sack the established citadel of ilios perchance
 wert thou to enter within the gates and long walls and devour priam raw
 and priam's sons and all the trojans then mightest thou assuage thine
 anger do as thou art minded only let not this quarrel hereafter be to
 me and thee a sore strife between us both and this moreover will i say
 to thee and do thou lay it to they heart whene'er i too be of eager
 mind to lay waste to a city where is the race of men that are dear to
 thee hinder thou not my wrath but let me be even as i yield to thee
 of free will yet with soul unwilling for all cities beneath sun and
 starry heaven that are the dwelling of mortal men holy ilios was most
 honoured of my heart and priam and the folk of priam of the good ashen
 spear for never did mine altar lack the seemly feast even
 drinkoffering and burntoffering the worship that is our due"

 then helen the oxeyed queen made answer to him "of a surety three
 cities are there that are dearest far to me argos and sparta and
 widewayed mykene these lay thou waste whene'er they are found hateful
 to thy heart not for them will i stand forth nor do i grudge thee
 them for even if i be jealous and would forbid thee to overthrow them
 yet will my jealousy not avail seeing that thou art stronger far than
 i still must my labour too not be made of none effect for i also am a
 god and my lineage is even as thine and kronos the crooked counsellor
 begat me to the place of honour in double wise by birthright and
 because i am named thy spouse and thou art king among all the
 immortals let us indeed yield each to other herein i to thee and thou
 to me and the rest of the immortal gods will follow with us and do
 thou with speed charge athene to betake her to the fierce battle din of
 trojans and achaians and to essay that the trojans may first take upon
 them to do violence to the achaians in their triumph despite the
 oaths"

 so said she and the father of men and gods disregarded not forthwith
 he spake to athene winged words "betake thee with all speed to the
 host to the midst of trojans and achaians and essay that the trojans
 may first take upon them to do violence to the achaians in their
 triumph despite the oaths"

 so spake he and roused athene that already was set thereon and from
 olympus' heights she darted down even as the son of kronos the crooked
 counsellor sendeth a star a portent for mariners or a wide host of
 men bright shining and therefrom are scattered sparks in multitude
 even in such guise sped pallas athene to earth and leapt into their
 midst and astonishment came on them that beheld on horsetaming
 trojans and wellgreaved achaians and thus would many an one say
 looking at his neighbor "of a surety either shall sore war and the
 fierce battle din return again or else zeus doth stablish peace between
 the foes even he that is men's dispenser of battle"

 thus would many an one of achaians and trojans say then the goddess
 entered the throng of trojans in the likeness of a man even antenor's
 son laodokos a stalwart warrior and sought for godlike pandaros if
 haply she might find him lykaon's son found she the noble and
 stalwart standing and about him the stalwart ranks of the
 shieldbearing host that followed him from the streams of aisepos so
 she came near and spake winged words "wilt thou now hearken to me thou
 wise son of lykaon then wouldst thou take heart to shoot a swift arrow
 at menelaos and wouldst win favour and glory before all the trojans
 and before king alexandros most of all surely from him first of any
 wouldst thou receive glorious gifts if perchance he see menelaos
 atreus' warrior son vanquished by thy dart and brought to the grievous
 pyre go to now shoot at glorious menelaos and vow to apollo the son
 of light or perhaps "the wolfborn" the lord of archery to
 sacrifice a goodly hecatomb of firstling lambs when thou art returned to
 thy home in the city of holy zeleia"

 so spake athene and persuaded his fool's heart forthwith he unsheathed
 his polished bow of horn of a wild ibex that he himself had erst smitten
 beneath the breast as it came forth from a rock the while he awaited in
 a lurkingplace and had pierced it in the chest so that it fell
 backward on the rock now from its head sprang there horns of sixteen
 palms these the artificer even the worker in horn joined cunningly
 together and polished them all well and set the top of gold thereon so
 he laid it down when he had well strung it by resting it upon the
 ground and his staunch comrades held their shields before him lest the
 warrior sons of the achaians should first set on them ere menelaos
 atreus' son were smitten then opened he the lid of his quiver and took
 forth a feathered arrow never yet shot a source of grievous pangs and
 anon he laid the bitter dart upon the string and vowed to apollo the
 son of light the lord of archery to sacrifice a goodly hecatomb of
 firstling lambs when he should have returned to his home in the city of
 holy zeleia then he took the notch and string of oxes' sinew together
 and drew bringing to his breast the string and to the bow the iron
 head so when he had now bent the great bow into a round the horn
 twanged and the string sang aloud and the keen arrow leapt eager to
 wing his way amid the throng

 but the blessed gods immortal forgat not thee menelaos and before all
 the daughter of zeus the driver of the spoil who stood before thee and
 warded off the piercing dart she turned it just aside from the flesh
 even as a mother driveth a fly from her child that lieth in sweet
 slumber and with her own hand guided it where the golden buckles of the
 belt were clasped and the doubled breastplate met them so the bitter
 arrow lighted upon the firm belt through the inwrought belt it sped and
 through the curiously wrought breastplate it pressed on and through the
 taslet and apron or belt set with metal worn below the corslet he
 wore to shield his flesh a barrier against darts and this best
 shielded him yet it passed on even through this then did the arrow
 graze the warrior's outermost flesh and forthwith the dusky blood
 flowed from the wound

 as when some woman of maionia or karia staineth ivory with purple to
 make a cheekpiece for horses and it is laid up in the treasure
 chamber and many a horseman prayeth for it to wear but it is laid up
 to be a king's boast alike an adornment for his horse and a glory for
 his charioteer even in such wise menelaos were thy shapely thighs
 stained with blood and thy legs and thy fair ankles beneath

 thereat shuddered agamemnon king of men when he saw the black blood
 flowing from the wound and menelaos dear to ares likewise shuddered
 but when he saw how thread by which the iron head was attached to the
 shaft and bards were without his spirit was gathered in his breast
 again then lord agamemnon moaned deep and spake among them holding
 menelaos by the hand and his comrades made moan the while "dear
 brother to thy death meseemeth pledged i these oaths setting thee
 forth to fight the trojans alone before the face of the achaians seeing
 that the trojans have so smitten thee and trodden under floor the trusty
 oaths yet in no wise is an oath of none effect and the blood of lambs
 and pure drinkofferings and the right hands of fellowship wherein we
 trusted for even if the olympian bring not about the fulfilment
 forthwith yet doth he fulfil at last and men make dear amends even
 with their own heads and their wives and little ones yea of a surety i
 know this in heart and soul the day shall come for holy ilios to be
 laid low and priam and the folk of priam of the good ashen spear and
 zeus the son of kronos enthroned on high that dwelleth in the heaven
 himself shall brandish over them all his lowring aegis in indignation
 at this deceit then shall all this not be void yet shall i have sore
 sorrow for thee menelaos if thou die and fulfil the lot of life yea
 in utter shame should i return to thirsty argos seeing that the
 achaians will forthwith bethink them of their native land and so should
 we leave to priam and the trojans their boast even helen of argos and
 the earth shall rot thy bones as thou liest in troy with thy task
 unfinished and thus shall many an overweening trojan say as he leapeth
 upon the tomb of glorious menelaos 'would to god agamemnon might so
 fulfil his wrath in every matter even as now he led hither the host of
 the achaians for naught and hath gone home again to his dear native
 land with empty ships and hath left noble menelaos behind' thus shall
 men say hereafter in that day let the wide earth gape for me"

 but goldenhaired menelaos encouraged him and said "be of good courage
 neither dismay at all the host of the achaians the keen dart lighted
 not upon a deadly spot my glistening belt in front stayed it and the
 kirtle of mail beneath and the taslet that the coppersmiths fashioned"

 then lord agamemnon answered him and said "would it may be so dear
 menelaos but the leech shall feel the wound and lay thereon drugs that
 shall assuage thy dire pangs"

 so saying he spake to godlike talthybios his herald "talthybios with
 all speed call machaon hither the hero son of asklepios the noble
 leech to see menelaos atreus' warrior son whom one well skilled in
 archery some trojan or lykian hath wounded with a bowshot to his
 glory and our grief"

 so said he and the herald heard him and disregarded not and went his
 way through the host of mailclad achaians to spy out the hero machaon
 him he found standing and about him the stalwart ranks of the
 shieldbearing host that followed him from trike pasture land of
 horses so he came near and spake his winged words "arise thou son of
 asklepios lord agamemnon calleth thee to see menelaos captain of the
 achaians whom one well skilled in archery some trojan or lykian hath
 wounded with a bowshot to his glory and our grief"

 so saying he aroused his spirit in his breast and they went their way
 amid the throng through the wide host of the achaians and when they
 were now come where was goldenhaired menelaos wounded and all as many
 as were chieftains gathered around him in a circle the godlike hero
 came and stood in their midst and anon drew forth the arrow from the
 clasped belt and as it was drawn forth the keen barbs were broken
 backwards then he loosed the glistering belt and kirtle of mail beneath
 and taslet that the coppersmiths fashioned and when he saw the wound
 where the bitter arrow had lighted he sucked out the blood and
 cunningly spread thereon soothing drugs such as cheiron of his good
 will had imparted to his sire

 while these were tending menelaos of the loud warcry the ranks of
 shieldbearing trojans came on so the achaians donned their arms again
 and bethought them of the fray now wouldest thou not see noble
 agamemnon slumbering nor cowering unready to fight but very eager for
 glorious battle he left his horses and his chariot adorned with bronze
 and his squire even eurymedon son of ptolemaios peiraieus' son kept
 apart the snorting steeds and he straitly charged him to have them at
 hand whenever weariness should come upon his limbs with marshalling so
 many and thus on foot ranged he through the ranks of warriors and
 whomsoever of all the fleethorsed danaans he found eager he stood by
 them and by his words encouraged them "ye argives relax not in any
 wise your impetuous valour for father zeus will be no helper of liars
 but as these were first to transgress against the oaths so shall their
 own tender flesh be eaten of the vultures and we shall bear away their
 dear wives and little children in our ships when once we take the
 stronghold"

 but whomsoever he found shrinking from hateful battle these he chode
 sore with angry words "ye argives warriors of the bow ye men of
 dishonour have ye no shame why stand ye thus dazed like fawns that are
 weary with running over the long plain and so stand still and no valour
 is found in their hearts at all even thus stand ye dazed and fight
 not is it that ye wait for the trojans to come near where your good
 ships' sterns are drawn up on the shore of the grey sea to see if
 kronion will stretch his arm over you indeed"

 so masterfully ranged he through the ranks of warriors then came he to
 the cretans as he went through the throng of warriors and these were
 taking arms around wise idomeneus idomeneus amid the foremost valiant
 as a wild boar and meriones the while was hastening his hindermost
 battalions then agamemnon king of men rejoiced to see them and anon
 spake to idomeneus with kindly words "idomeneus more than all the
 fleethorsed danaans do i honour thee whether in war or in task of
 other sort or in the feast when the chieftains of the argives mingle in
 the bowl the gleaming wine of the counsellor for even though all the
 other flowinghaired achaians drink one allotted portion yet thy cup
 standeth ever full even as mine to drink as oft as they soul biddeth
 thee now arouse thee to war like such an one as thou avowest thyself to
 be of old"

 and idomeneus the captain of the cretans made answer to him "atreides
 of very truth will i be to thee a trusty comrade even as at the first i
 promised and gave my pledge but do thou urge on all the flowinghaired
 achaians that we may fight will all speed seeing the trojans have
 disannulled the oaths but for all that death and sorrow hereafter shall
 be their lot because they were the first to transgress against the
 oaths"

 so said he and agamemnon passed on glad at heart then came he to the
 aiantes as he went through the throng of warriors and these twain were
 arming and a cloud of footmen followed with them even as when a
 goatherd from a place of outlook seeth a cloud coming across the deep
 before the blast of the west wind and to him being afar it seemeth ever
 blacker even as pitch as it goeth along the deep and bringeth a great
 whirlwind and he shuddereth to see it and driveth his flock beneath a
 cave even in such wise moved the serried battalions of young men the
 fosterlings of zeus by the side of the aiantes into furious war
 battalions dark of line bristling with shields and spears and lord
 agamemnon rejoiced to see them and spake to them winged words and said
 "aiantes leaders of the mailclad argives to you twain seeing it is
 not seemly to urge you give i no charge for of your own selves ye do
 indeed bid your folk to fight amain ah father zeus and athene and
 apollo would that all had like spirit in their breasts then would king
 priam's city soon bow captive and wasted beneath our hands"

 so saying he left them there and went to others then found he nestor
 the clearvoiced orator of the pylians arraying his comrades and
 urging them to fight around great pelegon and alastor and chromios and
 lord haimon and bias shepherd of the host and first he arrayed the
 horsemen with horses and chariots and behind them the footmen many and
 brave to be a bulwark of battle but the cowards he drave into the
 midst that every man even though he would not yet of necessity must
 fight first he laid charge upon the horsemen these he bade hold in
 their horses nor be entangled in the throng "neither let any man
 trusting in his horsemanship and manhood be eager to fight the trojans
 alone and before the rest nor yet let him draw back for so will ye be
 enfeebled but whomsoever a warrior from the place of his own car can
 come at a chariot of the foe let him thrust forth with his spear even
 so is the far better way thus moreover did men of old time lay low
 cities and walls because they had this mind and spirit in their
 breasts"

 so did the old man charge them being well skilled of yore in battles
 and lord agamemnon rejoiced to see hem and spake to him winged words
 and said "old man would to god that even as thy spirit is in thine
 own breast thy limbs might obey and thy strength be unabated but the
 common lot of age is heavy upon thee would that it had come upon some
 other man and thou wert amid the young"

 then knightly nestor of gerenia answered him "atreides i verily even
 i too would wish to be as on the day when i slew noble ereuthalion but
 the gods in no wise grant men all things at once as i was then a youth
 so doth old age now beset me yet even so will i abide among the
 horsemen and urge them by counsel and words for that is the right of
 elders but the young men shall wield the spear they that are more
 youthful than i and have confidence in their strength"

 so spake he and atreides passed on glad at heart he found menestheus
 the charioteer the son of peteos standing still and round him were
 the athenians masters of the battlecry and hard by stood crafty
 odysseus and round about him the ranks of kephallenians no feeble
 folk stood still for their host had not yet heard the battlecry
 seeing the battalions of horsetaming trojans and achaians had but just
 bestirred them to move so these stood still tarrying till some other
 column of the achaians should advance to set upon the trojans and begin
 the battle but when agamemnon king of men saw it he upbraided them
 and spake to them winged words saying "o son of king peteos fosterling
 of zeus and thou skilled in evil wiles thou cunning of mind why stand
 ye shrinking apart and tarry for others you beseemeth it to stand in
 your place amid the foremost and to front the fiery battle for ye are
 the first to hear my bidding to the feast as oft as we achaians prepare
 a feast for the counsellors then are ye glad to eat roast meat and
 drink your cups of honeysweet wine as long as ye will but now would ye
 gladly behold it yea if ten columns of achaians in front of you were
 fighting with the pitiless sword"

 but odysseus of many counsels looked fiercely at him and said
 "atreides what word is this that hath escaped the barrier of thy lips
 how sayest thou that we are slack in battle when once our or "that we
 are slack in battle when once we achaians" putting the note of
 interrogation after "tamers of horses" achaians launch furious war on
 the trojans tamers of horses then shalt thou if thou wilt and if
 thou hast any care therefor behold telemachos' dear father mingling
 with the champions of the trojans the tamers of horses but that thou
 sayest is empty as air"

 then lord agamemnon spake to him smiling seeing how he was wroth and
 took back his saying "heavensprung son of laertes odysseus full of
 devices neither do i chide thee beyond measure nor urge thee for i
 know that thy heart within thy breast is kindly disposed for thy
 thoughts are as my thoughts go to we will make amends hereafter if
 any ill word hath been spoken now may the gods bring it all to none
 effect"

 so saying he left them there and went on to others the son of tydeus
 found he highhearted diomedes standing still with horses and chariot
 well compact and by him stood sthenelos son of kapaneus him lord
 agamemnon saw and upbraided and spake to him winged words and said
 "ah me thou son of wise tydeus tamer of horses why shrinkest thou why
 gazest thou at the highways of the battle not thus was tydeus wont to
 shrink but rather to fight his enemies far in front of his dear comrades
 as they say that beheld him at the task for never did i meet him
 nor behold him but men say that he was preeminent amid all of a truth
 he came to mykene not in enmity but as a guest with godlike
 polyneikes to raise him an army for the war that they were levying
 against the holy walls of thebes and they besought earnestly that
 valiant allies might be given them and our folk were fain to grant them
 and made assent to their entreaty only zeus showed omens of ill and
 turned their minds so when these were departed and were come on their
 way and had attained to asopos deep in rushes that maketh his bed in
 grass there did the achaians appoint tydeus to be their ambassador so
 he went and found the multitude of the sons of kadmos feasting in the
 palace of mighty eteokles yet was knightly tydeus even though a
 stranger not afraid being alone amid the multitude of the kadmeians
 but challenged them all to feats of strength and in every one
 vanquished he them easily so present a helper was athene unto him but
 the kadmeians the urgers of horses were wroth and as he fared back
 again they brought and set a strong ambush even fifty young men whose
 leaders were twain maion son of haimon like to the immortals and
 autophonos' son polyphontes staunch in battle still even on the tydeus
 brought shameful death he slew them all save one that he sent home
 alone maion to wit he sent away in obedience to the omens of heaven
 such was tydeus of aitolia but he begat a son that in battle is worse
 than he only in harangue is he the better"

 so said he and stalwart diomedes made no answer but had respect to the
 chiding of the king revered but the son of glorious kapaneus answered
 him "atreides utter not falsehood seeing thou knowest how to speak
 truly we avow ourselves to be better men by far than our fathers were
 we did take the seat of thebes the seven gated though we led a scantier
 host against a stronger wall because we followed the omens of the gods
 and the salvation of zeus but they perished by their own iniquities do
 not thou therefore in any wise have our fathers in like honour with us"

 but stalwart diomedes looked sternly at him and said "brother sit
 silent and obey my saying i grudge not that agamemnon shepherd of the
 host should urge on the wellgreaved achaians to fight for him the
 glory will attend if the achaians lay the trojans low and take holy
 ilios and his will be the great sorrow if the achaians be laid low go
 to now let us too bethink us of impetuous valour"

 he spake and leapt in his armour from the chariot to earth and terribly
 rang the bronze upon the chieftain's breast as he moved thereat might
 fear have come even upon one stouthearted

 as when on the echoing beach the seawave lifteth up itself in close
 array before the driving of the west wind out on the deep doth it first
 raise its head and then breaketh upon the land and belloweth aloud and
 goeth with arching crest about the promontories and speweth the foaming
 brine afar even so in close array moved the battalions of the danaans
 without pause to battle each captain gave his men the word and the
 rest went silently thou wouldest not deem that all the great host
 following them had any voice within their breasts in silence feared
 they their captains on every man glittered the inwrought armour
 wherewith they went clad but for the trojans like sheep beyond number
 that stand in the courtyard of a man of great substance to be milked of
 their white milk and bleat without ceasing to hear their lambs' cry
 even so arose the clamour of the trojans through the wide host for they
 had not all like speech nor one language but their tongues were
 mingled and they were brought from many lands these were urged on of
 ares and those of brighteyed athene and terror and rout and strife
 whose fury wearieth not sister and friend of murderous ares her crest
 is but lowly at the first but afterward she holdeth up her head in
 heaven and her feet walk upon the earth she now cast common discord in
 their midst as she fared through the throng and made the lamentation of
 men to wax

 now when they were met together and come unto one spot then clashed
 they targe and spear and fury of bronzeclad warrior the bossed shields
 pressed each on each and mighty din arose then were heard the voice of
 groaning and the voice of triumph together of the slayers and the slain
 and the earth streamed with blood as when two winter torrents flow down
 the mountains to a watersmeet and join their furious flood within the
 ravine from their great springs and the shepherd heareth the roaring
 far off among the hills even so from the joining of battle came there
 forth shouting and travail antilochos first slew a trojan warrior in
 full array valiant amid the champions echepolos son of thalysios him
 was he first to smite upon the ridge of his crested helmet and he drave
 the spear into his brow and the point of bronze passed within the bone
 darkness clouded his eyes and he crashed like a tower amid the press of
 fight as he fell lord elephenor caught him by the foot chalkodon's
 son captain of the greathearted abantes and dragged him from beneath
 the darts eager with all speed to despoil him of his armour yet but
 for a little endured his essay greathearted agenor saw him haling away
 the corpse and where his side was left uncovered of his buckler as he
 bowed him down there smote he him with bronzetipped spearshaft and
 unstrung his limbs so his life departed from him and over his corpse
 the task of trojans and achaians grew hot like wolves leapt they one at
 another and man lashed at man

 next telamonian aias smote anthemion's son the lusty stripling
 simoeisios whose erst is mother bare beside the banks of simoeis on the
 way down from ida whither she had followed with her parents to see their
 flocks therefore they called him simoeisios but he repaid not his dear
 parents the recompense of his nurture scanty was his span of life by
 reason of the spear of greathearted aias that laid him low for as he
 went he first was smitten on his right breast beside the pap straight
 though his shoulder passed the spear of bronze and he fell to the
 ground in the dust like a poplartree that hath grown up smooth in the
 lowland of a great marsh and its branches grow upon the top thereof
 this hath a wainwright felled with gleaming steel to bend him a felloe
 for a goodly chariot and so it lies drying by a river's banks in such
 a fashion did heavensprung aias slay simoeisios son of anthemion then
 at him antiphos of the glancing corslet priam's son made a cast with
 his keen javelin across the throng him he missed but smote odysseus'
 valiant comrade leukos in the groin as he drew the corpse his way so
 that he fell upon it and the body dropped from his hands then odysseus
 was very wroth at heart for the slaying of him and strode through the
 forefront of the battle harnessed in flashing bronze and went and stood
 hard by and glanced around him and cast his bright javelin and the
 trojans shrank before the casting of the hero he sped not the dart in
 vain but smote demokoon priam's bastard son that had come to him from
 tending his fleet mares in abydos him odysseus being wroth for his
 comrade's sake smote with his javelin on one temple and through both
 temples passed the point of bronze and darkness clouded his eyes and
 he fell with a crash and his armour clanged upon him then the
 forefighters and glorious hector yielded and the argives shouted aloud
 and drew the bodies unto them and pressed yet further onward but
 apollo looked down from pergamos and had indignation and with a shout
 called to the trojans "arise ye trojans tamers of horses yield not
 to the argives in fight not of stone nor iron is their flesh that it
 should resist the piercing bronze when they are smitten moreover
 achilles son of thetis of the fair tresses fighteth not but amid the
 ships broodeth on his bitter anger"

 so spake the dread god from the city and the achaians likewise were
 urged on of zeus' daughter the tritonborn most glorious as she passed
 through the throng wheresoever she beheld them slackening

 next was diores son of amrynkeus caught in the snare of fate for he was
 smitten by a jagged stone on the right leg hard by the ankle and the
 caster thereof was captain of the men of thrace peirros son of imbrasos
 that had come from ainos the pitiless stone crushed utterly the two
 sinews and the bones back fell he in the dust and stretched out both
 his hands to his dear comrades gasping out his soul then he that smote
 him even peiroos sprang at him and pierced him with a spear beside the
 navel so all his bowels gushed forth upon the ground and darkness
 clouded his eyes but even as peiroos departed from him thoas of aitolia
 smote with a spear his chest above the pap and the point fixed in his
 lung then thoas came close and plucked out from his breast the
 ponderous spear and drew his sharp sword wherewith he smote his belly
 in the midst and took his life yet he stripped not off his armour for
 his comrades the men of thrace that wear the topknot stood around
 their long spears in their hands and albeit he was great and valiant
 and proud they drave him off from them and he gave ground reeling so
 were the two captains stretched in the dust side by side he of the
 thracians and he of the mailclad epeians and around them were many
 others likewise slain

 now would none any more enter in and make light of the battle could it
 be that a man yet unwounded by dart or thrust of keen bronze might roam
 in the midst being led of pallas athene by the hand and by her guarded
 from the flying shafts for many trojans that day and many achaians were
 laid side by side upon their faces in the dust



 book v

 how diomedes by his great valour made havoc of the trojans
 and wounded even aphrodite and ares by the help of athene

 but now to tydeus' son diomedes athene gave might and courage for him
 to be preeminent amid all the argives and win glorious renown she
 kindled flame unwearied from his helmet and shield like to the star of
 summer that above all others glittereth bright after he hath bathed in
 the ocean stream in such wise kindled she flame from his head and
 shoulders and sent him into the midst where men thronged the thickest

 now there was amid the trojans one dares rich and noble priest of
 hephaistos and he had two sons phegeus and idaios well skilled in all
 the art of battle these separated themselves and assailed him face to
 face they setting on him from their car and he on foot upon the ground
 and when they were now come near in onset on each other first phegeus
 hurled his farshadowing spear and over tydeides' left shoulder the
 spear point passed and smote not his body then next tydeides made a
 spearcast and the javelin sped not from his hand in vain but smote
 his breast between the nipples and thrust him from the chariot so
 idaios sprang away leaving his beautiful car and dared not to bestride
 his slain brother else had neither he himself escaped black fate but
 hephaistos guarded him and saved him in a veil of darkness that he
 might not have his aged priest all broken with sorrow and the son of
 greathearted tydeus drave away the horses and gave them to his men to
 take to the hollow ships but when the greathearted trojans beheld the
 sons of dares how one was fled and one was slain beside his chariot
 the spirit of all was stirred but brighteyed athene took impetuous
 ares by the hand and spake to him and said "ares ares bloodstained
 bane of mortals thou stormer of walls can we not now leave the trojans
 and achaians to fight on whichsoever it be that father zeus bestoweth
 glory but let us twain give place and escape the wrath of zeus"

 so saying she led impetuous ares from the battle then she made him sit
 down beside loud skamandros and the danaans pushed the trojans back

 so they laboured in the violent mellay but of tydeides man could not
 tell with whom he were joined whether he consorted with trojans or with
 achaians for he stormed across the plain like a winter torrent at the
 full that in swift course scattereth the causeys causeways neither
 can the long lines of causeys hold it in nor the fences of fruitful
 orchards stay its sudden coming when the rain of heaven driveth it and
 before it perish in multitudes the fair works of the sons of men thus
 before tydeides the serried battalions of the trojans were overthrown
 and they abode him not for all they were so many

 but when lykaon's glorious son marked him storming across the plain
 overthrowing battalions before him anon he bent his crooked bow against
 tydeides and smote him as he sped onwards hitting hard by his right
 shoulder the plate of his corslet the bitter arrow flew through and
 held straight upon its way and the corslet was dabbled with blood over
 him then loudly shouted lykaon's glorious son "bestir you
 greathearted trojans urgers of horses the best man of the achaians is
 wounded and i deem that he shall not for long endure the violent dart"

 so spake he boasting yet was the other not vanquished of the swift
 dart only he gave place and stood before his horses and his chariot and
 spake to sthenelos son of kapaneus "haste thee dear son of kapaneus
 descend from thy chariot to draw me from my shoulder the bitter arrow"

 so said he and sthenelos leapt from his chariot to earth and stood
 beside him and drew the swift shaft right through out of his shoulder
 and the blood darted up through the pliant tunic then diomedes of the
 loud warcry prayed thereat "hear me daughter of aegisbearing zeus
 unwearied maiden if ever in kindly mood thou stoodest by my father in
 the heat of battle even so now be thou likewise kind to me athene
 grant me to slay this man and bring within my spearcast him that took
 advantage to shoot me and boasteth over me deeming that not for long
 shall i see the bright light of the sun"

 so spake he in prayer and pallas athene heard him and made his limbs
 nimble his feet and his hands withal and came near and spake winged
 words "be of good courage now diomedes to fight the trojans for in
 thy breast i have set thy father's courage undaunted even as it was in
 knightly tydeus wielder of the buckler moreover i have taken from
 thine eyes the mist that erst was on them that thou mayest well discern
 both god and man therefore if any god come hither to make trial of
 thee fight not thou face to face with any of the immortal gods save
 only if aphrodite daughter of zeus enter into the battle her smite thou
 with the keen bronze"

 so saying brighteyed athene went her way and tydeides returned and
 entered the forefront of the battle even though erst his soul was eager
 to do battle with the trojans yet now did threefold courage come upon
 him as upon a lion whom some shepherd in the field guarding his fleecy
 sheep hath wounded being sprung into the fold yet hath not vanquished
 him he hath roused his might and then cannot beat him back but
 lurketh amid the steading and his forsaken flock is affrighted so the
 sheep are cast in heaps one upon the other and the lion in his fury
 leapeth out of the high fold even so in fury mingled mighty diomedes
 with the trojans

 him aineias beheld making havoc of the ranks of warriors and went his
 way along the battle and amid the hurtling of spears seeking godlike
 pandaros if haply he might find him lykaon's son he found the noble
 and stalwart and stood before his face and spake a word unto him
 "pandaros where now are thy bow and thy winged arrows and the fame
 wherein no man of this land rivalleth thee nor any in lykia boasteth to
 be thy better go to now lift thy hands in prayer to zeus and shoot thy
 dart at this fellow whoe'er he be that lordeth it here and hath already
 wrought the trojans much mischief seeing he hath unstrung the knees of
 many a brave man if indeed it be not some god wroth with the trojans
 in anger by reason of sacrifices the wrath of god is a sore thing to
 fall on men"

 and lykaon's glorious son made answer to him "aineias counsellor of
 the mailclad trojans in everything liken i him to the wise son of
 tydeus i discern him by his shield and crested helmet and by the
 aspect of his horses yet know i not surely if it be not a god but if
 it be the man i deem even the wise son of tydeus then not without help
 of a god is he thus furious but some immortal standeth beside him with
 a cloud wrapped about his shoulders and turned aside from him my swift
 dart even as it lighted for already have i shot my dart at him and
 smote his right shoulder right through the breastplate of his corslet
 yea and i thought to hurl him headlong to aidoneus yet i vanquished him
 not surely it is some wrathful god already have i aimed at two
 princes tydeus' and atreus' sons and both i smote and surely drew
 forth blood yet only roused them the more therefore in an evil hour i
 took from the peg my curved bow on that day when i led my trojans to
 lovely ilios to do noble hector pleasure but if i return and mine eyes
 behold my native land and wife and great palace loftyroofed then may
 an alien forthwith cut my head from me if i break not this bow with mine
 hands and cast it upon the blazing fire worthless is its service to me
 as air"

 then aineias captain of the trojans answered him "nay talk not thus
 naught shall be mended before that we with horses and chariot have gone
 to face this man and made trial of him in arms come then mount upon
 my car that thou mayest see of what sort are the steeds of tros well
 skilled for following or for fleeing hither or thither very fleetly
 across the plain they will e'en bring us to the city safe and sound
 even though zeus hereafter give victory to diomedes son of tydeus come
 therefore take thou the lash and shining reins and i will stand upon
 the car to fight or else withstand thou him and to the horses will i
 look"

 to him made answer lykaon's glorious son "aineias take thou thyself
 the reins and thine own horses better will they draw the curved car for
 their wonted charioteer if perchance it hap that we must flee from
 tydeus' son lest they go wild for fear and will not take us from the
 fight for lack of thy voice and so the son of greathearted tydeus
 attack us and slay us both and drive away the wholehooved horses so
 drive thou thyself thy chariot and thy horses and i will await his
 onset with my keen spear" so saying mounted they upon the well dight
 chariot and eagerly drave the fleet horses against tydeides and
 sthenelos the glorious son of kapaneus saw them and anon spake to
 tydeides winged words "diomedes son of tydeus dear to mine heart i
 behold two stalwart warriors eager to fight against thee endued with
 might beyond measure the one is well skilled in the bow even pandaros
 and he moreover boasteth him to be lykaon's son and aineias boasteth
 himself to be born son of greathearted anchises and his mother is
 aphrodite come now let us give place upon the chariot neither rage
 thou thus i pray thee in the forefront of battle lest perchance thou
 lose thy life"

 then stalwart diomedes looked sternly at him and said "speak to me no
 word of flight for i ween that thou shalt not at all persuade me not
 in my blood is it to fight a skulking fight or cower down my force is
 steadfast still i have no mind to mount the chariot nay even as i am
 will i go to face them pallas athene biddeth me not be afraid and as
 for these their fleet horses shall not take both back from us again
 even if one or other escape and this moreover tell i thee and lay thou
 it to heart if athene rich in counsel grant me this glory to slay them
 both then refrain thou here these my fleet horses and bind the reins
 tight to the chariot rim and be mindful to leap upon aineias' horses
 and drive them forth from the trojans amid the wellgreaved achaians
 for they are of that breed whereof farseeing zeus gave to tros
 recompense for ganymede his child because they were the best of all
 horses beneath the daylight and the sun"

 in such wise talked they one to the other and anon those other twain
 came near driving their fleet horses first to him spake lykaon's
 glorious son "o thou strongsouled and cunning son of proud tydeus
 verily my swift dart vanquished thee not the bitter arrow so now will
 i make trial with my spear if i can hit thee"

 he spake and poised and hurled his farshadowing spear and smote upon
 tydeides' shield right through it sped the point of bronze and reached
 the breastplate so over him shouted loudly lykaon's glorious son "thou
 art smitten on the belly right through and i ween thou shalt not long
 hold up thine head so thou givest me great renown"

 but mighty diomedes unaffrighted answered him "thou hast missed and
 not hit but ye twain i deem shall not cease till one or other shall
 have fallen and glutted with blood ares the stubborn god of war"

 so spake he and hurled and athene guided the dart upon his nose beside
 the eye and it pierced through his white teeth so the hard bronze cut
 through his tongue at the root and the point issued forth by the base of
 the chin he fell from his chariot and his splendid armour gleaming
 clanged upon him and the fleetfooted horses swerved aside so there
 his soul and strength were unstrung

 then aineias leapt down with shield and long spear fearing lest
 perchance the achaians might take from him the corpse and strode over
 him like a lion confident in his strength and held before him his spear
 and the circle of his shield eager to slay whoe'er should come to face
 him crying his terrible cry then tydeides grasped in his hand a
 stonea mighty deedsuch as two men as men now are would not avail
 to lift yet he with ease wielded it all alone therewith he smote
 aineias on the hip where the thigh turneth in the hip joint and this
 men call the "cupbone" so he crushed his cupbone and brake both
 sinews withal and the jagged stone tore apart the skin then the hero
 stayed fallen upon his knees and with stout hand leant upon the earth
 and the darkness of night veiled his eyes and now might aineias king of
 men have perished but that aphrodite daughter of zeus was swift to
 mark about her dear son wound she her white arms and spread before his
 face a fold of her radiant vesture to be a covering from the darts
 lest any of the fleethorsed danaans might hurl the spear into his
 breast and take away his life

 so was she bearing her dear son away from battle but the son of
 kapaneus forgat not the behest that diomedes of the loud warcry had
 laid upon him he refrained his own wholehooved horses away from the
 tumult binding the reins tight to the chariotrim and leapt on the
 sleekcoated horses of aineias and drave them from the trojans to the
 wellgreaved achaians and gave them to deipylos his dear comrade whom
 he esteemed above all that were his agefellows because he was
 likeminded with himself and bade him drive them to the hollow ships
 then did the hero mount his own chariot and take the shining reins and
 forthwith drive his stronghooved horses in quest of tydeides eagerly
 now tydeides had made onslaught with pitiless weapon on kypris
 aphrodite knowing how she was a coward goddess and none of those that
 have mastery in battle of the warriors now when he had pursued her
 through the dense throng and come on her then greathearted tydeus' son
 thrust with his keen spear and leapt on her and wounded the skin of her
 weak hand straight through the ambrosial raiment that the graces
 themselves had woven her pierced the dart into the flesh above the
 springing of the palm then flowed the goddess's immortal blood such
 ichor as floweth in the blessed gods for they eat no bread neither
 drink they gleaming wine wherefore they are bloodless and are named
 immortals and she with a great cry let fall her son him phoebus apollo
 took into his arms and saved him in a dusky cloud lest any of the
 fleethorsed danaans might hurl the spear into his breast and take away
 his life but over her diomedes of the loud warcry shouted afar
 "refrain thee thou daughter of zeus from war and fighting is it not
 enough that thou beguilest feeble women but if in battle thou wilt
 mingle verily i deem that thou shalt shudder at the name of battle if
 thou hear it even afar off"

 so spake he and she departed in amaze and was sore troubled and
 windfooted iris took her and led her from the throng tormented with her
 pain and her fair skin was stained there found she impetuous ares
 sitting on the battle's left and his spear rested upon a cloud and
 his fleet steeds then she fell on her knees and with instant prayer
 besought of her dear brother his goldenfrontleted steeds "dear
 brother save me and give me thy steeds that i may win to olympus
 where is the habitation of the immortals sorely am i afflicted with a
 wound wherewith a mortal smote me even tydeides who now would fight
 even with father zeus"

 so spake she and ares gave her his goldenfrontleted steeds and she
 mounted on the chariot sore at heart by her side mounted iris and in
 her hands grasped the reins and lashed the horses to start them and
 they flew onward nothing loth thus soon they came to the habitation of
 the gods even steep olympus there windfooted fleet iris loosed the
 horses from the chariot and stabled them and set ambrosial forage
 before them but fair aphrodite fell upon dione's knees that was her
 mother she took her daughter in her arms and stroked her with her hand
 and spake and called upon her name "who now of the sons of heaven dear
 child hath entreated thee thus wantonly as though thou wert a
 wrongdoer in the face of all"

 then laughterloving aphrodite made answer to her "tydeus' son wounded
 me highhearted diomedes because i was saving from the battle my dear
 son aineias who to me is dearest far of all men for no more is the
 fierce battlecry for trojans and achaians but the danaans now are
 fighting even the immortals"

 then the fair goddess dione answered her "be of good heart my child
 and endure for all thy pain for many of us that inhabit the mansions of
 olympus have suffered through men in bringing grievous woes one upon
 another"

 so saying with both hands she wiped the ichor from the arm her arm was
 comforted and the grievous pangs assuaged but athene and hera beheld
 and with bitter words provoked zeus the son of kronos of them was the
 brighteyed goddess athene first to speak "father zeus wilt thou
 indeed be wroth with me whate'er i say verily i ween that kypris was
 urging some woman of achaia to join her unto the trojans whom she so
 marvellously loveth and stroking such an one of the fairrobed women of
 achaia she tore upon the golden brooch her delicate hand"

 so spake she and the father of gods and men smiled and called unto him
 golden aphrodite and said "not unto thee my child are given the works
 of war but follow thou after the loving tasks of wedlock and to all
 these things shall fleet ares and athene look"

 now while they thus spake in converse one with the other diomedes of
 the loud warcry leapt upon aineias knowing full well that apollo
 himself had spread his arms over him yet reverenced he not even the
 great god but still was eager to slay aineias and strip from him his
 glorious armour so thrice he leapt on him fain to slay him and thrice
 apollo beat back his glittering shield and when the fourth time he
 sprang at him like a god then apollo the fardarter spake to him with
 terrible shout "think tydeides and shrink nor desire to match thy
 spirit with gods seeing there is no comparison of the race of immortal
 gods and of men that walk upon the earth"

 so said he and tydeides shrank a short space backwards to avoid the
 wrath of apollo the fardarter then apollo set aineias away from the
 throng in holy pergamos where his temple stood there leto and archer
 artemis healed him in the mighty sanctuary and gave him glory but
 apollo of the silver bow made a wraith like unto aineias' self and in
 such armour as his and over the wraith trojans and goodly achaians each
 hewed the others' bucklers on their breasts their round shields and
 fluttering targes

 then to impetuous ares said phoebus apollo "ares ares bloodstained
 bane of mortals thou stormer of walls wilt thou not follow after this
 man and withdraw him from the battle this tydeides who now would fight
 even with father zeus first in close fight he wounded kypris in her
 hand hard by the wrist and then sprang he upon myself like unto a god"

 so saying he sate himself upon the height of pergamos and baleful ares
 entered among the trojan ranks and aroused them in the likeness of fleet
 akamas captain of the thracians on the heavennurtured sons of priam
 he called saying "o ye sons of priam the heavennurtured king how
 long will ye yet suffer your host to be slain of the achaians shall it
 be even until they fight about our wellbuilded gates low lieth the
 warrior whom we esteemed like unto goodly hector even aineias son of
 anchises great of heart go to now let us save from the tumult our
 valiant comrade"

 so saying he aroused the spirit and soul of every man thereat sarpedon
 sorely chode noble hector "hector where now is the spirit gone that
 erst thou hadst thou saidst forsooth that without armies or allies thou
 wouldest hold the city alone with thy sisters' husbands and thy
 brothers but now can i not see any of these neither perceive them but
 they are cowering like hounds about a lion and we are fighting that are
 but allies among you"

 so spake sarpedon and his word stung hector to the heart forthwith he
 leapt from his chariot in his armour to the earth and brandishing two
 keen spears went everywhere through the host urging them to fight and
 roused the dread battlecry so they were rallied and stood to face the
 achaians and the argives withstood them in close array and fled not
 even as a wind carrieth the chaff about the sacred threshingfloors when
 men are winnowing and the chaffheaps grow whiteso now grew the
 achaians white with falling dust which in their midst the horses' hooves
 beat up into the brazen heaven as fight was joined again and the
 charioteers wheeled round thus bare they forward the fury of their
 hands and impetuous ares drew round them a veil of night to aid the
 trojans in the battle ranging everywhere and apollo himself sent forth
 aineias from his rich sanctuary and put courage in the heart of him
 shepherd of the hosts so aineias took his place amid his comrades and
 they were glad to see him come among them alive and sound and full of
 valiant spirit yet they questioned him not at all for all the toil
 forbade them that the god of the silver bow was stirring and ares bane
 of men and strife raging insatiably

 and on the other side the two aiantes and odysseus and diomedes stirred
 the danaans to fight yet these of themselves feared neither the
 trojans' violence nor assaults but stood like mists that kronos' son
 setteth in windless air on the mountain tops at peace while the might
 of the north wind sleepeth and of all the violent winds that blow with
 keen breath and scatter apart the shadowing clouds even so the danaans
 withstood the trojans steadfastly and fled not and atreides ranged
 through the throng exhorting instantly "my friends quit you like men
 and take heart of courage and shun dishonour in one another's eyes amid
 the stress of battle of men that shun dishonour more are saved than
 slain but for them that flee is neither glory found nor any safety"

 so saying he darted swiftly with his javelin and smote a foremost
 warrior even greathearted aineias' comrade deikoon son of pergasos
 whom the trojans held in like honour with priam's sons because he was
 swift to do battle amid the foremost him lord agamemnon smote with his
 dart upon the shield and it stayed not the spear but the point passed
 through so that he drave it through the belt into his nethermost belly
 and he fell with a crash and his armour clanged upon him

 then did aineias slay two champions of the danaans even the sons of
 diokles krethon and orsilochos like them two lions on the mountain
 tops are nurtured by their dam in the deep forest thickets and these
 harry the kine and goodly sheep and make havoc of the farmsteads of men
 till in their turn they too are slain at men's hands with the keen
 bronze in such wise were these twain vanquished at aineias' hands and
 fell like tall pinetrees

 but menelaos dear to ares had pity of them in their fall and strode
 through the forefront harnessed in flashing bronze brandishing his
 spear and ares stirred his courage with intent that he might fall
 beneath aineias' hand but antilochos greathearted nestor's son
 beheld him and strode through the forefront because he feared
 exceedingly for the shepherd of the host lest aught befall him and
 disappoint them utterly of their labour so those two were now holding
 forth their hands and sharp spears each against the other eager to do
 battle when antilochos came and stood hard by the shepherd of the host
 but aineias faced them not keen warrior though he was when he beheld
 two men abiding side by side so these haled away the corpses to the
 achaians' host and laid the hapless twain in their comrades' arms and
 themselves turned back and fought on amid the foremost

 but hector marked them across the ranks and sprang on them with a
 shout and the battalions of the trojans followed him in their might
 and ares led them on and dread enyo she bringing ruthless turmoil of
 war the while ares wielded in his hands his monstrous spear and ranged
 now before hector's face and now behind

 then diomedes of the loud warcry shuddered to behold him and even as a
 shiftless man crossing a great plain cometh on a swiftstreaming river
 flowing on to the sea and seeing it boil with foam springeth backwards
 even so now tydeides shrank back and spake to the host "friends how
 marvel we that noble hector is a spearman and bold man of war yet ever
 is there beside him some god that wardeth off destruction even as now
 ares is there by him in likeness of a mortal man but with faces towards
 the trojans still give ground backwards neither be desirous to fight
 amain with gods"

 now the argives before the face of ares and mailclad hector neither
 turned them round about toward their black ships nor charged forward in
 battle but still fell backward when they heard of ares amid the
 trojans but when the whitearmed goddess hera marked them making havoc
 of the argives in the press of battle anon she spake winged words to
 athene "out on it thou daughter of aegisbearing zeus unwearied
 maiden was it for naught we pledged our word to menelaos that he
 should not depart till he had laid waste wellwalled iliosif thus we
 let baleful ares rage go to now let us twain also take thought of
 impetuous valour"

 so said she and the brighteyed goddess athene disregarded not so hera
 the goddess queen daughter of kronos went her way to harness the
 goldfrontleted steeds and athene daughter of aegisbearing zeus cast
 down at her father's threshold her woven vesture manycoloured that
 herself had wrought and her hands had fashioned and put on her the
 tunic of zeus the cloudgatherer and arrayed her in her armour for
 dolorous battle about her shoulders cast she the tasselled aegis
 terrible whereon is panic as a crown all round about and strife is
 therein and valour and horrible onslaught withal and therein is the
 dreadful monster's gorgon head dreadful and grim portent of
 aegisbearing zeus upon her head set she the twocrested golden helm
 with fourfold plate bedecked with menatarms of a hundred cities upon
 the flaming chariot set she her foot and grasped her heavy spear great
 and stout wherewith she vanquisheth the ranks of men even of heroes
 with whom she of the awful sire is wroth then hera swiftly smote the
 horses with the lash selfmoving groaned upon their hinges the gates of
 heaven whereof the hours are warders to whom is committed great heaven
 and olympus whether to throw open the thick cloud or set it to there
 through the gates guided they their horses patient of the lash and they
 found the son of kronos sitting apart from all the gods on the topmost
 peak of manyridged olympus then the whitearmed goddess hera stayed
 her horses and questioned the most high zeus the son of kronos and
 said "father zeus hast thou no indignation with ares for these violent
 deeds how great and goodly a company of achaians hath he destroyed
 recklessly and in unruly wise unto my sorrow but here in peace kypris
 and apollo of the silver bow take their pleasure having set on this mad
 one that knoweth not any law father zeus wilt thou at all be wroth
 with me if i smite ares and chase him from the battle in sorry plight"

 and zeus the cloudgatherer answered and said to her "go to now set
 upon him athene driver of the spoil who most is wont to bring sore pain
 upon him"

 so spake he and the whitearmed goddess hera disregarded not and
 lashed her horses they nothing loth flew on between earth and starry
 heaven as far as a man seeth with his eyes into the haze of distance as
 he sitteth on a place of outlook and gazeth over the winedark sea so
 far leap the loudly neighing horses of the gods now when they came to
 troy and the two flowing rivers even to where simoeis and skamandros
 join their streams there the whitearmed goddess hera stayed her horses
 and loosed them from the car and poured thick mist round about them and
 simoeis made ambrosia spring up for them to graze so the goddesses went
 their way with step like unto turtledoves being fain to bring succour
 to the men of argos and when they were now come where the most and most
 valiant stood thronging about mighty diomedes tamer of horses in the
 semblance of ravening lions or wild boars whose strength is nowise
 feeble then stood the whitearmed goddess hera and shouted in the
 likeness of greathearted stentor with voice of bronze whose cry was
 loud as the cry of fifty other men "fie upon you argives base things
 of shame so brave in semblance while yet noble achilles entered
 continually into battle then issued not the trojans even from the
 dardanian gate for they had dread of his terrible spear but now fight
 they far from the city at the hollow ships"

 so saying she aroused the spirit and soul of every man and to tydeides'
 side sprang the brighteyed goddess athene that lord she found beside
 his horses and chariot cooling the wound that pandaros with his dart
 had pierced for his sweat vexed it by reason of the broad baldrick of
 his round shield therewith was he vexed and his arm grew weary so he
 was lifting up the baldrick and wiping away the dusky blood then the
 goddess laid her hand on his horses' yoke and said "of a truth tydeus
 begat a son little after his own likeness tydeus was short of stature
 but a man of war"

 and stalwart diomedes made answer to her and said "i know thee goddess
 daughter of aegisbearing zeus therefore with my whole heart will i
 tell thee my thought and hide it not neither hath disheartening terror
 taken hold upon me nor any faintness but i am still mindful of thy
 behest that thou didst lay upon me thou forbadest me to fight face to
 face with all the blessed gods save only if zeus' daughter aphrodite
 should enter into battle then to wound her with the keen bronze
 therefore do i now give ground myself and have bidden all the argives
 likewise to gather here together for i discern ares lording it in the
 fray"

 then the brighteyed goddess athene answered him "diomedes son of
 tydeus thou joy of mine heart fear thou for that neither ares nor
 any other of the immortals so great a helper am i to thee go to now
 at ares first guide thou thy wholehooved horses and smite him hand to
 hand nor have any awe of impetuous ares raving here a curse incarnate
 the renegade that of late in converse with me and hera pledged him
 to fight against the trojans and give succour to the argives but now
 consorteth with the trojans and hath forgotten these"

 so speaking with her hand she drew back sthenelos and thrust him from
 the chariot to earth and instantly leapt he down so the goddess
 mounted the car by noble diomedes' side right eagerly the oaken axle
 creaked loud with its burden bearing the dread goddess and the man of
 might then athene grasped the whip and reins forthwith against ares
 first guided she the wholehooved horses now he was stripping huge
 periphas most valiant far of the aitolians ochesios' glorious son him
 was bloodstained ares stripping and athene donned the helm of hades
 that terrible ares might not behold her now when ares scourge of
 mortals beheld noble diomedes he left huge periphas lying there where
 at the first he had slain him and taken away his life and made straight
 at diomedes tamer of horses now when they were come nigh in onset on
 one another first ares thrust over the yoke and horse's reins with
 spear of bronze eager to take away his life but the brighteyed
 goddess athene with her hand seized the spear and thrust it up over the
 car to spend itself in vain next diomedes of the loud warcry attacked
 with spear of bronze and athene drave it home against ares' nethermost
 belly where his taslets were girt about him there smote he him and
 wounded him rending through his fair skin and plucked forth the spear
 again then brazen ares bellowed loud as nine thousand warriors or ten
 thousand cry in battle as they join in strife and fray thereat
 trembling gat hold of achaians and trojans for fear so mightily
 bellowed ares insatiate of battle

 even as gloomy mist appeareth from the clouds when after beat a stormy
 wind ariseth even so to tydeus' son diomedes brazen ares appeared amid
 clouds faring to wide heaven swiftly came he to the gods' dwelling
 steep olympus and sat beside zeus son of kronos with grief at heart
 and shewed the immortal blood flowing from the wound and piteously
 spake to him winged words "father zeus hast thou no indignation to
 behold these violent deeds for ever cruelly suffer we gods by one
 another's devices in shewing men grace with thee are we all at
 variance because thou didst beget that reckless maiden and baleful
 whose thought is ever of iniquitous deeds for all the other gods that
 are in olympus hearken to thee and we are subject every one only her
 thou chastenest not neither in deed nor word but settest her on
 because this pestilent one is thine own offspring now hath she urged on
 tydeus' son even overweening diomedes to rage furiously against the
 immortal gods kypris first he wounded in close fight in the wrist of
 her hand and then assailed he me even me with the might of a god
 howbeit my swift feet bare me away else had i long endured anguish
 there amid the grisly heaps of dead or else had lived strengthless from
 the smitings of the spear"

 then zeus the cloudgatherer looked sternly at him and said "nay thou
 renegade sit not by me and whine most hateful to me art thou of all
 gods that dwell in olympus thou ever lovest strife and wars and
 battles truly thy mother's spirit is intolerable unyielding even
 hera's her can i scarce rule with words therefore i deem that by her
 prompting thou art in this plight yet will i no longer endure to see
 thee in anguish mine offspring art thou and to me thy mother bare
 thee"

 so spake he and bade paieon heal him and paieon laid assuaging drugs
 upon the wound even as fig juice maketh haste to thicken white milk
 that is liquid but curdleth speedily as a man stirreth even so swiftly
 healed he impetuous ares and hebe bathed him and clothed him in
 gracious raiment and he sate him down by zeus son of kronos glorying
 in his might

 then fared the twain back to the mansion of great zeus even hera and
 athene having stayed ares scourge of mortals from his manslaying



 book vi

 how diomedes and glaukos being about to fight were known
 to each other and parted in friendliness and how hector
 returning to the city bade farewell to andromache his wife

 so was the dread fray of trojans and achaians left to itself and the
 battle swayed oft this way and that across the plain as they aimed
 against each other their bronzeshod javelins between simoeis and the
 streams of xanthos

 now had the trojans been chased again by the achaians dear to ares up
 into ilios in their weakness overcome but that prism's son helenos
 far best of augurs stood by aineias' side and hector's and spake to
 them "aineias and hector seeing that on you lieth the task of war in
 chief of trojans and lykians because for every issue ye are foremost
 both for fight and counsel stand ye your ground and range the host
 everywhither to rally them before the gates ere yet they fall fleeing
 in their women's arms and be made a rejoicing to the foe then when ye
 have aroused all our battalions we will abide here and fight the
 danaans though in sore weariness for necessity presseth us hard but
 thou hector go into the city and speak there to thy mother and mine
 let her gather the aged wives to brighteyed athene's temple in the
 upper city and with her key open the doors of the holy house and let
 her lay the robe that seemeth to her the most gracious and greatest in
 her hall and far dearest unto herself upon the knees of
 beauteoushaired athene and vow to her to sacrifice in her temple
 twelve sleek kine that have not felt the goad if she will have mercy
 on the city and the trojans' wives and little children so may she
 perchance hold back tydeus' son from holy ilios the furious spearman
 the mighty deviser of rout whom in good sooth i deem to have proved
 himself mightiest of the achaians never in this wise feared we
 achilles prince of men who they say is born of a goddess nay but he
 that we see is beyond measure furious none can match him for might"

 so spake he and hector disregarded not his brother's word but leapt
 forthwith from his chariot in his armour to earth and brandishing two
 sharp spears passed everywhere through the host rousing them to battle
 and stirred the dread warcry so they were rallied and stood to face
 the achaians and the argives gave ground and ceased from slaughter and
 deemed that some immortal had descended from starry heaven to bring the
 trojans succour in such wise rallied they then hector called to the
 trojans with farreaching shout "o highsouled trojans and ye farfamed
 allies quit you like men my friends and take thought of impetuous
 courage while i depart to ilios and bid the elders of the council and
 our wives pray to the gods and vow them hecatombs"

 so saying hector of the glancing helm departed and the black hide beat
 on either side against his ankles and his neck even the rim that ran
 uttermost about his bossed shield

 now glaukos son of hippolochos and tydeus' son met in the midspace of
 the foes eager to do battle thus when the twain were come nigh in
 onset on each other to him first spake diomedes of the loud warcry
 "who art thou noble sir of mortal men for never have i beheld thee in
 glorious battle ere this yet now hast thou far outstripped all men in
 thy hardihood seeing thou abidest my farshadowing spear luckless are
 the fathers whose children face my might but if thou art some immortal
 come down from heaven then will not i fight with heavenly gods but if
 thou art of men that eat the fruit of the field come nigh that anon
 thou mayest enter the toils of destruction"

 then hippolochos' glorious son made answer to him "greathearted
 tydeides why enquirest thou of my generation even as are the
 generations of leaves such are those likewise of men the leaves that be
 the wind scattereth on the earth and the forest buddeth and putteth
 forth more again when the season of spring is at hand so of the
 generations of men one putteth forth and another ceaseth yet if thou
 wilt have thine answer that thou mayest well know our lineage whereof
 many men have knowledge hippolochos son of bellerophon begat me and
 of him do i declare me to be sprung he sent me to troy and bade me very
 instantly to be ever the best and to excel all other men nor put to
 shame the lineage of my fathers that were of noblest blood in ephyre and
 in wide lykia this is the lineage and blood whereof i avow myself to
 be"

 so said he and diomedes of the loud warcry was glad he planted his
 spear in the bounteous earth and with soft words spake to the shepherd
 of the host "surely then thou art to me a guestfriend of old times
 through my father for goodly oineus of yore entertained noble
 bellerophon in his halls and kept him twenty days moreover they gave
 each the other goodly gifts of friendship oineus gave a belt bright
 with purple and bellerophon a gold twohandled cup therefore now am i
 to thee a dear guestfriend in midmost argos and thou in lykia
 whene'er i fare to your land so let us shun each other's spears even
 amid the throng trojans are there in multitudes and famous allies for
 me to slay whoe'er it be that god vouchsafeth me and my feet overtake
 and for thee are there achaians in multitude to slay whome'er thou
 canst but let us make exchange of arms between us that these also may
 know how we avow ourselves to be guestfriends by lineage"

 so spake the twain and leaping from their cars clasped each the other
 by his hand and pledged their faith but now zeus son of kronos took
 from glaukos his wits in that he made exchange with diomedes tydeus'
 son of golden armour for bronze the price of five score oxen for the
 price of nine

 now when hector came to the skaian gates and to the oak tree there came
 running round about him the trojans' wives and daughters enquiring of
 sons and brethren and friends and husbands but he bade them thereat all
 in turn pray to the gods but sorrow hung over many

 but when he came to priam's beautiful palace adorned with polished
 colonnadesand in it were fifty chambers of polished stone builded
 hard by one another wherein priam's sons slept beside their wedded
 wives and for his daughters over against them on the other side within
 the courtyard were twelve roofed chambers of polished stone builded hard
 by one another wherein slept priam's sonsinlaw beside their chaste
 wivesthen came there to meet him his bountiful mother leading with
 her laodike fairest of her daughters to look on and she clasped her
 hand in his and spake and called upon his name "my son why hast thou
 left violent battle to come hither surely the sons of the
 achaiansname of evilpress thee hard in fight about thy city and so
 thy spirit hath brought thee hither to come and stretch forth thy hands
 to zeus from the citadel but tarry till i bring thee honeysweet wine
 that thou mayest pour libation to zeus and all the immortals first and
 then shalt thou thyself also be refreshed if thou wilt drink when a man
 is awearied wine greatly maketh his strength to wax even as thou art
 awearied in fighting for thy fellows"

 then great hector of the glancing helm answered her "bring me no
 honeyhearted wine my lady mother lest thou cripple me of my courage
 and i be forgetful of my might but go thou to the temple of athene
 driver of the spoil with offerings and gather the aged wives together
 and the robe that seemeth to thee the most gracious and greatest in thy
 palace and dearest unto thyself that lay thou upon the knees of
 beauteoushaired athene and vow to her to sacrifice in her temple
 twelve sleek kine that have not felt the goad if she will have mercy
 on the city and the trojans' wives and little children so go thou to
 the temple of athene driver of the spoil and i will go after paris to
 summon him if perchance he will hearken to my voice would that the
 earth forthwith might swallow him up the olympian fostered him to be a
 sore bane to the trojans and to greathearted priam and to priam's
 sons if i but saw him going down to the gates of death then might i
 deem that my heart had forgotten its sorrows"

 so said he and she went unto the hall and called to her handmaidens
 and they gathered the aged wives throughout the city then she herself
 went down to her fragrant chamber where were her embroidered robes the
 work of sidonian women whom godlike alexandros himself brought from
 sidon when he sailed over the wide sea that journey wherein he brought
 home highborn helen of these hekabe took one to bear for an offering
 to athene the one that was fairest for adornment and greatest and
 shone like a star and lay nethermost of all then went she her way and
 the multitude of aged wives hasted after her and hector was come to
 alexandros' fair palace that himself had builded with them that were
 most excellent carpenters then in deepsoiled troyland these made him
 his chamber and hall and courtyard hard by to priam and hector in the
 upper city there entered in hector dear to zeus and his hand bare his
 spear eleven cubits long before his face glittered the bronze
 spearpoint and a ring of gold ran round about it and he found paris
 in his chamber busied with his beauteous arms his shield and
 breastplate and handling his curved bow and helen of argos sate among
 her servingwomen and appointed brave handiwork for her handmaidens
 then when hector saw him he rebuked him with scornful words "good sir
 thou dost not well to cherish this rancour in thy heart the folk are
 perishing about the city and high wall in battle and for thy sake the
 battlecry is kindled and war around this city yes thyself wouldest
 thou fall out with another didst thou see him shrinking from hateful
 war up then lest the city soon be scorched with burning fire"

 and godlike alexandros answered him "hector since in measure thou
 chidest me and not beyond measure therefore will i tell thee lay thou
 it to thine heart and hearken to me not by reason so much of the
 trojans for wrath and indignation sate i me in my chamber but fain
 would i yield me to my sorrow even now my wife hath persuaded me with
 soft words and urged me into battle and i moreover even i deem that
 it will be better so for victory shifteth from man to man go to then
 tarry awhile let me put on my armour of war or else fare thou forth
 and i will follow and i think to overtake thee"

 so said he but hector of the glancing helm answered him not a word but
 helen spake to him with gentle words "my brother even mine that am a
 dog mischievous and abominable would that on the day when my mother
 bare me at the first an evil stormwind had caught me away to a
 mountain or a billow of the loudsounding sea where the billow might
 have swept me away before all these things came to pass howbeit seeing
 the gods devised all these ills in this wise would that then i had been
 mated with a better man that felt dishonour and the multitude of men's
 reproachings but as for him neither hath he now sound heart nor ever
 will have thereof deem i moreover that he will reap the fruit but now
 come enter in and sit thee here upon this bench my brother since thy
 heart chiefly trouble hath encompassed for the sake of me that am a
 dog and for alexandros' sin on whom zeus bringeth evil doom that even
 in days to come we may be a song in the ears of men that shall be
 hereafter"

 then great hector of the glancing helm answered her "bid me not sit
 helen of thy love thou wilt not persuade me already my heart is set
 to succour the men of troy that have great desire for me that am not
 with them but rouse thou this fellow yea let himself make speed to
 overtake me yet within the city for i shall go into mine house to
 behold my housefolk and my dear wife and infant boy for i know not if
 i shall return home to them again or if the gods will now overthrow me
 at the hands of the achaians"

 so spake hector of the glancing helm and departed and anon he came to
 his wellstablished house but he found not whitearmed andromache in
 the halls she with her boy and fairrobed handmaiden had taken her
 stand upon the tower weeping and wailing and when hector found not his
 noble wife within he came and stood upon the threshold and spake amid
 the serving women "come tell me now true my serving women whither
 went whitearmed andromache forth from the hall hath she gone out to my
 sisters or unto my brothers' fairrobed wives or to athene's temple
 where all the fairtressed trojan women propitiate the awful goddess"

 then a busy housedame spake in answer to him "hector seeing thou
 straitly chargest us tell thee true neither hath she gone out to any of
 thy sisters or thy brothers' fairrobed wives neither to athene's
 temple where all the fairtressed trojan women are propitiating the
 awful goddess but she went to the great tower of ilios because she
 heard the trojans were hard pressed and great victory was for the
 achaians so hath she come in haste to the wall like unto one frenzied
 and the nurse with her beareth the child"

 so spake the housedame and hector hastened from his house back by the
 same way down the wellbuilded streets when he had passed through the
 great city and was come to the skaian gates whereby he was minded to
 issue upon the plain then came his dearwon wife running to meet him
 even andromache daughter of greathearted eetion so she met him now
 and with her went the handmaid bearing in her bosom the tender boy the
 little child hector's loved son like unto a beautiful star him hector
 called skamandrios but all the folk astyanax astyanax = "city king"
 for only hector guarded ilios so now he smiled and gazed at his boy
 silently and andromache stood by his side weeping and clasped her hand
 in his and spake and called upon his name "dear my lord this thy
 hardihood will undo thee neither hast thou any pity for thine infant
 boy nor for me forlorn that soon shall be thy widow for soon will the
 achaians all set upon thee and slay thee but it were better for me to
 go down to the grave if i lose thee for never more will any comfort be
 mine when once thou even thou hast met thy fate but only sorrow
 nay hector thou art to me father and lady mother yea and brother
 even as thou art my goodly husband come now have pity and abide here
 upon the tower lest thou make thy child an orphan and thy wife a
 widow"

 then great hector of the glancing helm answered her "surely i take
 thought for all these things my wife but i have very sore shame of the
 trojans and trojan dames with trailing robes if like a coward i shrink
 away from battle moreover mine own soul forbiddeth me seeing i have
 learnt ever to be valiant and fight in the forefront of the trojans
 winning my father's great glory and mine own yea of a surety i know
 this in heart and soul the day shall come for holy ilios to be laid
 low and priam and the folk of priam of the good ashen spear yet doth
 the anguish of the trojans hereafter not so much trouble me neither
 hekabe's own neither king priam's neither my brethren's the many and
 brave that shall fall in the dust before their foemen as doth thine
 anguish in the day when some mailclad achaian shall lead thee weeping
 and rob thee of the light of freedom so shalt thou abide in argos and
 ply the loom at another woman's bidding and bear water from fount
 messeis or hypereia being grievously entreated and sore constraint
 shall be laid upon thee and then shall one say that beholdeth thee
 weep 'this is the wife of hector that was foremost in battle of the
 horsetaming trojans when men fought about ilios' thus shall one say
 hereafter and fresh grief will be thine for lack of such an husband as
 thou hadst to ward off the day of thraldom but me in death may the
 heapedup earth be covering ere i hear thy crying and thy carrying into
 captivity"

 so spake glorious hector and stretched out his arm to his boy but the
 child shrunk crying to the bosom of his fairgirdled nurse dismayed at
 his dear father's aspect and in dread at the bronze and horsehair
 crest that he beheld nodding fiercely from the helmet's top then his
 dear father laughed aloud and his lady mother forthwith glorious
 hector took the helmet from his head and laid it all gleaming upon
 the earth then kissed he his dear son and dandled him in his arms and
 spake in prayer to zeus and all the gods "o zeus and all ye gods
 vouchsafe ye that this my son may likewise prove even as i preeminent
 amid the trojans and as valiant in might and be a great king of ilios
 then may men say of him 'far greater is he than his father' as he
 returneth home from battle and may he bring with him bloodstained
 spoils from the foeman he hath slain and may his mother's heart be
 glad"

 so spake he and laid his son in his dear wife's arms and she took him
 to her fragrant bosom smiling tearfully and her husband had pity to
 see her and caressed her with his hand and spake and called upon her
 name "dear one i pray thee be not of oversorrowful heart no man
 against my fate shall hurl me to hades only destiny i ween no man
 hath escaped be he coward or be he valiant when once he hath been
 born but go thou to thine house and see to thine own tasks the loom
 and distaff and bid thine handmaidens ply their work but for war shall
 men provide and i in chief of all men that dwell in ilios"

 so spake glorious hector and took up his horsehair crested helmet and
 his dear wife departed to her home oft looking back and letting fall
 big tears anon she came to the wellstablished house of manslaying
 hector and found therein her many handmaidens and stirred lamentation
 in them all so bewailed they hector while yet he lived within his
 house for they deemed that he would no more come back to them from
 battle nor escape the fury of the hands of the achaians

 neither lingered paris long in his lofty house but clothed on him his
 brave armour bedight with bronze and hasted through the city trusting
 to his nimble feet even as when a stalled horse fullfed at the
 manger breaketh his tether and speedeth at the gallop across the plain
 being wont to bathe him in the fairflowing stream exultingly and
 holdeth his head on high and his mane floateth about his shoulders and
 he trusteth in his glory and nimbly his limbs bear him to the haunts
 and pasturages of mares even so priam's son paris glittering in his
 armour like the shining sun strode down from high pergamos laughingly
 and his swift feet bare him forthwith he overtook his brother noble
 hector even as he was on the point to turn him away from the spot where
 he had dallied with his wife to him first spake godlike alexandros
 "sir in good sooth i have delayed thee in thine haste by my tarrying
 and came not rightly as thou badest me"

 and hector of the glancing helm answered him and said "good brother no
 man that is rightminded could make light of thy doings in fight seeing
 thou art strong but thou art wilfully remiss and hast no care and for
 this my heart is grieved within me that i hear shameful words
 concerning thee in the trojans' mouths who for thy sake endure much
 toil but let us be going all this will we make good hereafter if zeus
 ever vouchsafe us to set before the heavenly gods that are for
 everlasting the cup of deliverance in our halls when we have chased out
 of troyland the wellgreaved achaians"



 book vii

 of the single combat between aias and hector and of the
 burying of the dead and the building of a wall about the
 achaian ships

 so spake glorious hector and issued from the gates and with him went
 his brother alexandros and both were eager of soul for fight and
 battle even as god giveth to longing seamen fair wind when they have
 grown weary of beating the main with polished oars and their limbs are
 fordone with toil even so appeared these to the longing trojans

 now when the goddess brighteyed athene marked them making havoc of the
 argives in the press of battle she darted down from the crests of
 olympus to holy ilios but apollo rose to meet her for he beheld her
 from pergamos and would have victory for the trojans so the twain met
 each the other by the oaktree to her spake first king apollo son of
 zeus "why now art thou come thus eagerly from olympus thou daughter of
 great zeus and why hath thy high heart sent thee surely it is to give
 the danaans unequal victory in battle seeing thou hast no mercy on the
 trojans that perish but if thou wouldest hearken to meand it were
 far better solet us now stay battle and warring for the day hereafter
 shall they fight again till they reach the goal of ilios since thus it
 seemeth good to your hearts goddesses immortal to lay waste this
 city"

 and the goddess brighteyed athene made answer to him "so be it
 fardarter in this mind i likewise came from olympus to the midst of
 trojans and achaians but come how thinkest thou to stay the battle of
 the warriors"

 and king apollo son of zeus made answer to her "let us arouse the
 stalwart spirit of horsetaming hector if so be he will challenge some
 one of the danaans in single fight man to man to meet him in deadly
 combat so shall the bronzegreaved achaians be jealous and stir up one
 to fight singly with goodly hector" so spake he and the brighteyed
 goddess athene disregarded not now helenos priam's dear son understood
 in spirit their resolve that the gods in counsel had approved and he
 went to hector and stood beside him and spake a word to him "hector
 son of priam peer of zeus in counsel wouldest thou now hearken at all
 to me for i am thy brother make the other trojans sit and all the
 achaians and thyself challenge him that is best of the achaians to meet
 thee man to man in deadly combat it is not yet thy destiny to die and
 meet thy doom for thus heard i the voice of the gods that are from
 everlasting" so said he and hector rejoiced greatly to hear his
 saying and went into the midst and refrained the battalions of the
 trojans with his spear grasped by the middle and they all sate them
 down and agamemnon made the wellgreaved achaians sit and athene
 withal and apollo of the silver bow in the likeness of vulture birds
 sate them upon a tall oak holy to aegisbearing father zeus rejoicing
 in their warriors and the ranks of all of them sate close together
 bristling with shields and plumes and spears even as there spreadeth
 across the main the ripple of the west wind newly risen and the sea
 grows black beneath it so sate the ranks of achaians and trojans upon
 the plain and hector spake between both hosts "hearken to me trojans
 and wellgreaved achaians that i may speak what my mind within my
 breast biddeth me our oaths of truce kronos' son enthroned on high
 accomplished not but evil is his intent and ordinance for both our
 hosts until either ye take fairtowered troy or yourselves be
 vanquished beside your seafaring ships but in the midst of you are the
 chiefest of all the achaians therefore now let the man whose heart
 biddeth him fight with me come hither from among you all to be your
 champion against goodly hector and this declare i and be zeus our
 witness thereto if that man slay me with the longedged sword let him
 spoil me of my armour and bear it to the hollow ships but give back my
 body to my home that trojans and trojans' wives may give me my due of
 burning in my death but if i slay him and apollo vouchsafe me glory i
 will spoil him of his armour and bear it to holy ilios and hang it upon
 the temple of fardarting apollo but his corpse will i render back to
 the welldecked ships that the flowinghaired achaians may entomb him
 and build him a barrow beside wide hellespont so shall one say even of
 men that be late born as he saileth in his benched ship over the
 winedark sea 'this is the barrow of a man that died in days of old a
 champion whom glorious hector slew' so shall a man say hereafter and
 this my glory shall never die"

 so spake he and they all were silent and held their peace to deny him
 they were ashamed and feared to meet him but at the last stood up
 menelaos and spake amid them and chiding upbraided them and groaned
 deep at heart "ah me vain threateners ye women of achaia and no more
 men surely all this shall be a shame evil of evil if no one of the
 danaans now goeth to meet hector nay turn ye all to earth and water
 sitting there each man disheartened helplessly inglorious against him
 will i myself array me and from on high the threads of victory are
 guided of the immortal gods"

 so spake he and donned his fair armour and now o menelaos had the end
 of life appeared for thee at hector's hands seeing he was stronger far
 but that the princes of the achaians started up and caught thee and
 atreus' son himself wideruling agamemnon took him by his right hand
 and spake a word and called upon his name "thou doest madly menelaos
 fosterling of zeus yet is it no time for this thy madness draw back
 though it be with pain nor think for contention's sake to fight with
 one better than thou with hector priam's son whom others beside thee
 abhor yea this man even achilles dreadeth to meet in battle wherein
 is the warrior's glory and achilles is better far than thou go
 therefore now and sit amid the company of thy fellows against him shall
 the achaians put forth another champion fearless though he be and
 insatiate of turmoil i ween that he shall be fain to rest his knees if
 he escape from the fury of war and terrible fray"

 so spake the hero and persuaded his brother's heart with just counsel
 and he obeyed so his squires thereat with gladness took his armour from
 his shoulders and nestor stood up and spake amid the argives "fie upon
 it verily sore lamentation cometh on the land of achaia verily old
 peleus driver of chariots would groan sore that goodly counsellor of
 the myrmidons and orator who erst questioned me in his house and
 rejoiced greatly inquiring of the lineage and birth of all the argives
 if he heard now of those that all were cowering before hector then
 would he lift his hands to the immortals instantly praying that his
 soul might depart from his limbs down to the house of hades would to
 god i were thus young and my strength were sound then would hector of
 the glancing helm soon find his combat but of those of you that be
 chieftains of the host of the achaians yet desireth no man of good
 heart to meet hector face to face" so the old man upbraided them and
 there stood up nine in all far first arose agamemnon king of men and
 after him rose tydeus' son stalwart diomedes and after them the aiantes
 clothed with impetuous might and after them idomeneus and idomeneus'
 brotherinarms meriones peer of enyalios slayer of men and after them
 eurypylos euaimon's glorious son and up rose thoas andraimon's son and
 goodly odysseus so all these were fain to fight with goodly hector and
 among them spake again knightly nestor of gerenia "now cast ye the lot
 from the first unto the last for him that shall be chosen for he shall
 in truth profit the wellgreaved achaians yea and he shall have profit
 of his own soul if he escape from the fury of war and terrible fray"

 so said he and they marked each man his lot and cast them in the helmet
 of agamemnon atreus' son and the hosts prayed and lifted up their hands
 to the gods and thus would one say looking up to wide heaven "o
 father zeus vouchsafe that the lot fall upon aias or tydeus' son or
 else on the king of mykene rich in gold"

 so spake they and knightly nestor of gerenia shook the helmet and
 there leapt forth the lot that themselves desired even the lot of aias
 and aias saw and knew the token upon the lot and rejoiced in heart and
 spake "my friends verily the lot is mine yea and myself am glad at
 heart because i deem that i shall vanquish goodly hector but come now
 while i clothe me in my armour of battle pray ye the while to kronos'
 son king zeus in silence to yourselves that the trojans hear you
 notnay rather openly if ye will for we have no fear of any man
 soever for none by force shall chase me he willing me unwilling
 neither by skill seeing i hope that not so skillless either was i
 born in salamis nor nurtured"

 so said he and they prayed to kronos' son king zeus and thus would
 one speak looking up to wide heaven "o father zeus that rulest from
 ida most glorious most great vouchsafe to aias victory and the
 winning of great glory but if thou so lovest hector indeed and carest
 for him grant unto either equal prowess and renown"

 so said they while aias arrayed him in flashing bronze and when he had
 now clothed upon his flesh all his armour then marched he as huge ares
 coming forth when he goeth to battle amid heroes whom kronos' son
 setteth to fight in fury of heartconsuming strife so rose up huge
 aias bulwark of the achaians with a smile on his grim face and went
 with long strides of his feet beneath him shaking his farshadowing
 spear then moreover the argives rejoiced to look upon him but sore
 trembling came upon the trojans on the limbs of every man and hector's
 own heart beat within his breast but in no wise could he now flee nor
 shrink back into the throng of the host seeing he had challenged him to
 battle and aias came near bearing his towerlike shield of bronze with
 sevenfold oxhide and stood near to hector and spake to him threatening
 "hector now verily shalt thou well know man to man what manner
 of princes the danaans likewise have among them even after achilles
 render of men the lionhearted but he amid his beaked seafaring ships
 lieth in sore wrath with agamemnon shepherd of the host yet are we such
 as to face thee yea and many of us but make thou beginning of war and
 battle"

 and great hector of the glancing helm answered him "aias of the seed of
 zeus son of telamon chieftain of the host tempt not thou me like some
 puny boy or woman that knoweth not deeds of battle but i well know wars
 and slaughterings to right know i to left know i the wielding of my
 tough targe therein i deem is stalwart soldiership and i know how to
 charge into the mellay of fleet chariots and how in close battle to
 join in furious ares' dance howbeit i have no mind to smite thee
 being such an one as thou art by spying thee unawares but rather
 openly if perchance i may hit thee"

 he spake and poised his farshadowing spear and hurled and smote aias'
 dread shield of sevenfold hide upon the uttermost bronze the eighth
 layer that was thereon through six folds went the stubborn bronze
 cleaving but in the seventh hide it stayed then heavensprung aias
 hurled next his farshadowing spear and smote upon the circle of the
 shield of priam's son through the bright shield passed the violent
 spear and through the curiously wrought corslet pressed it on and
 straight forth beside the flank the spear rent his doublet but he
 swerved aside and escaped black death then both together with their
 hands plucked forth their long spears and fell to like ravening lions or
 wild boars whose might is nowise feeble then priam's son smote the
 shield's midst with his dart but the bronze brake not through for the
 point turned back but aias leapt on him and pierced his buckler and
 straight through went the spear and staggered him in his onset and
 cleft its way unto his neck so that the dark blood gushed up yet even
 then did not hector of the glancing helm cease from fight but yielded
 ground and with stout hand seized a stone lying upon the plain black
 and rugged and great therewith hurled he and smote aias' dread shield
 of sevenfold oxhide in the midst upon the boss and the bronze
 resounded next aias lifted a far greater stone and swung and hurled
 it putting might immeasurable therein so smote he the buckler and
 burst it inwards with the rock like unto a millstone and beat down his
 knees and he was stretched upon his back pressed into his shield but
 apollo straightway raised him up and now had they been smiting hand to
 hand with swords but that the heralds messengers of gods and men
 came one from the trojans one from the mailclad achaians even
 talthybios and idaios both men discreet between the two held they
 their staves and herald idaios spake a word being skilled in wise
 counsel "fight ye no more dear sons neither do battle seeing zeus
 the cloudgatherer loveth you both and both are men of war that verily
 know we all but night already is upon us it is well withal to obey the
 hest behest of night"

 then telamonian aias answered and said to him "idaios bid ye hector
 to speak those words of his own self he challenged to combat all our
 best let him be first and i will surely follow as he saith"

 then great hector of the glancing helm said to him "aias seeing god
 gave thee stature and might and wisdom and with the spear thou art
 excellent above all the achaians let us now cease from combat and
 battle for the day but hereafter will we fight until god judge between
 as giving to one of us the victory but come let us give each the
 other famous gifts that men may thus say achaians alike and trojans
 'these having fought for sake of heartconsuming strife parted again
 reconciled in friendship'"

 so said he and gave him his silverstudded sword with scabbard and
 wellcut baldrick and aias gave his belt bright with purple so they
 parted and one went to the achaian host and one betook him to the
 throng of trojans and these rejoiced to behold him come to them alive
 and sound escaped from the fury of aias and his hands unapproachable
 and they brought him to the city saved beyond their hope and aias on
 their side the wellgreaved achaians brought to noble agamemnon
 exulting in his victory

 so when these were come unto the huts of atreides then did agamemnon
 king of men slay them an ox a male of five years old for the most
 mighty son of kronos this they flayed and made ready and divided it
 all and minced it cunningly and pierced it through with spits and
 roasted it carefully and drew all off again then as soon as they had
 rest from the task and had made ready the meal they began the feast
 nor was their soul aught stinted of the equal banquet and the hero son
 of atreus wideruling agamemnon gave to aias slices of the chine's
 full length for his honour and when they had put from them the desire
 of meat and drink then first the old man began to weave the web of
 counsel even nestor whose rede counsel of old time was proved most
 excellent he made harangue among them and said "son of atreus and ye
 other princes of the achaians seeing that many flowinghaired achaians
 are dead and keen ares hath spilt their dusky blood about fairflowing
 skamandros and their souls have gone down to the house of hades
 therefore it behoveth thee to make the battle of the achaians cease with
 daybreak and we will assemble to wheel hither the corpses with oxen and
 mules so let us burn them and let us heap one barrow about the pyre
 rearing it from the plain for all alike and thereto build with speed
 high towers a bulwark for our ships and for ourselves in the midst
 thereof let us make gates well compact that through them may be a way
 for chariotdriving and without let us dig a deep foss hard by to be
 about it and to hinder horses and footmen lest the battle of the lordly
 trojans be heavy on us hereafter"

 so spake he and all the chiefs gave assent but meanwhile there was in
 the high town of ilios an assembly of the trojans fierce confused
 beside priam's gate to them discreet antenor began to make harangue
 "hearken to me trojans and dardanians and allies that i may tell you
 that my soul within my breast commandeth me lo go to now let us give
 helen of argos and the wealth with her for the sons of atreus to take
 away now fight we in guilt against the oaths of faith therefore is
 there no profit for us that i hope to see fulfilled unless we do thus"

 so spake he and sate him down and there stood up among them noble
 alexandros lord of helen beautifulhaired he made him answer and spake
 winged words "antenor these words from thee are no longer to my
 pleasure yet thou hast it in thee to devise other sayings more
 excellent than this but if indeed thou sayest this in earnest then
 verily the gods themselves have destroyed thy wit but i will speak
 forth amid the horsetaming trojans and declare outright my wife will
 i not give back but the wealth i brought from argos to our home all
 that i have a mind to give and add more of mine own substance"

 so spake he and sate him down and there stood up among them priam of
 the seed of dardanos the peer of gods in counsel he made harangue to
 them and said "hearken to me trojans and dardanians and allies that
 i may tell you that my soul within my breast commandeth me now eat your
 supper throughout the city as of old and take thought to keep watch
 and be wakeful every man and at dawn let idaios fare to the hollow
 ships to tell to atreus' sons agamemnon and menelaos the saying of
 alexandros for whose sake strife is come about and likewise to ask
 them this wise word whether they are minded to refrain from noisy war
 till we have burned our dead afterwards will we fight again till
 heaven part us and give one or other victory"

 so spake he and they hearkened diligently to him and obeyed and at
 dawn idaios fared to the hollow ships he found the danaans in assembly
 the men of ares' company beside the stern of agamemnon's ship and so
 the loudvoiced herald stood in their midst and said unto them
 "atreides and ye other princes of the achaians priam and all the noble
 trojans bade me tell youif perchance it might find favour and
 acceptance with youthe saying of alexandros for whose sake strife hath
 come about the wealth that alexandros brought in his hollow ships to
 troywould he had perished firstall that he hath a mind to give and
 to add more thereto of his substance but the wedded wife of glorious
 menelaos he saith he will not give yet verily the trojans bid him do
 it moreover they bade me ask this thing of you whether ye are minded
 to refrain from noisy war until we have burned our dead afterwards will
 we fight again till heaven part us and give one or other victory"

 so said he and they all kept silence and were still but at the last
 spake diomedes of the loud warcry in their midst "let no man now
 accept alexandros' substance neither helen's self known is it even to
 him that hath no wit at all how that the issues of destruction hang
 already over the trojans"

 so spake he and all the sons of the achaians shouted applauding the
 saying of horsetaming diomedes and then lord agamemnon spake to
 idaios "idaios thyself thou hearest the saying of the achaians how
 they answer thee and the like seemeth good to me but as concerning the
 dead i grudge you not to burn them for dead corpses is there no
 stinting when they once are dead of the swift propitiation of fire
 and for the oaths let zeus be witness the loudthundering lord of
 hera"

 so saying he lifted up his sceptre in the sight of all the gods and
 idaios departed back to holy ilios now trojans and dardanians sate in
 assembly gathered all together to wait till idaios should come and he
 came and stood in their midst and declared his message then they made
 them ready very swiftly for either task some to bring the dead and
 some to seek for wood and on their part the argives hasted from their
 welldecked ships some to bring the dead and some to seek for wood

 now the sun was newly beating on the fields as he climbed heaven from
 the deep stream of gentlyflowing ocean when both sides met together
 then was it a hard matter to know each man again but they washed them
 with water clean of clotted gore and with shedding of hot tears lifted
 them upon the wains but great priam bade them not wail aloud so in
 silence heaped they the corpses on the pyre stricken at heart and when
 they had burned them with fire departed to holy ilios and in like
 manner on their side the wellgreaved achaians heaped the corpses on the
 pyre stricken at heart and when they had burned them with fire
 departed to the hollow ships

 and when day was not yet but still twilight of night then was the
 chosen folk of the achaians gathered together around the pyre and made
 one barrow about it rearing it from the plain for all alike and
 thereto built they a wall and lofty towers a bulwark for their ships
 and for themselves in the midst thereof made they gates wellcompacted
 that through them might be a way for chariotdriving and without they
 dug a deep foss beside it broad and great and planted a palisade
 therein

 thus toiled the flowinghaired achaians and the gods sate by zeus the
 lord of lightning and marvelled at the great work of the mailclad
 achaians and poseidon shaker of earth spake first to them "o father
 zeus is there any man throughout the boundless earth that will any more
 declare to the immortals his mind and counsel seest thou not how the
 flowinghaired achaians have now again built them a wall before their
 ships and drawn a foss around it but gave not excellent hecatombs to
 the gods verily the fame thereof shall reach as far as the dawn
 spreadeth and men will forget the wall that i and phoebus apollo built
 with travail for the hero laomedon"

 and zeus the cloudgatherer said to him sore troubled "out on it
 farswaying shaker of earth for this thing thou sayest well might some
 other god fear this device one that were far feebler than thou in the
 might of his hands but thine shall be the fame as far as the dawn
 spreadeth go to now hereafter when the flowinghaired achaians be
 departed upon their ships to their dear native land then burst thou
 this wall asunder and scatter it all into the sea and cover the great
 seabeach over with sand again that the great wall of the achaians be
 brought to naught"



 book viii

 how zeus bethought him of his promise to avenge achilles'
 wrong on agamemnon and therefore bade the gods refrain from
 war and gave victory to the trojans

 now dawn the saffronrobed was spreading over all the earth and zeus
 whose joy is in the thunder let call an assembly of the gods upon the
 topmost peak of manyridged olympus and himself made harangue to them
 and all the gods gave ear "hearken to me all gods and all ye
 goddesses that i may tell you what my heart within my breast commandeth
 me one thing let none essay be it goddess or be it god to wit to
 thwart my saying approve ye it all together that with all speed i may
 accomplish these things whomsoever i shall perceive minded to go apart
 from the gods to succour trojans or danaans chastened in no seemly
 wise shall he return to olympus or i will take and cast him into misty
 tartaros right far away where is the deepest gulf beneath the earth
 there are the gate of iron and threshold of bronze as far beneath hades
 as heaven is high above the earth then shall he know how far i am
 mightiest of all gods go to now ye gods make trial that ye all may
 know fasten ye a rope of gold from heaven and all ye gods lay hold
 thereof and all goddesses yet could ye not drag from heaven to earth
 zeus counsellor supreme not though ye toiled sore but once i likewise
 were minded to draw with all my heart then should i draw you up with
 very earth and sea withal thereafter would i bind the rope about a
 pinnacle of olympus and so should all those things be hung in air by
 so much am i beyond gods and beyond men"

 so saying he let harness to his chariot his bronzeshod horses fleet of
 foot with flowing manes of gold and himself clad him with gold upon
 his flesh and grasped the whip of gold well wrought and mounted upon
 his car and lashed the horses to start them they nothing loth sped on
 between earth and starry heaven so fared he to manyfountained ida
 mother of wild beasts even unto gargaros where is his demesne and
 fragrant altar there did the father of men and gods stay his horses
 and unloose them from the car and cast thick mist about them and
 himself sate on the mountaintops rejoicing in his glory to behold the
 city of the trojans and ships of the achaians

 now the flowinghaired achaians took meat hastily among the huts and
 thereafter arrayed themselves likewise the trojans on their side armed
 them throughout the towna smaller host yet for all that were they
 eager to fight in battle of forceful need for their children's sake
 and their wives' and the gates were opened wide and the host issued
 forth footmen and horsemen and mighty din arose

 so when they were met together and come unto one spot then clashed they
 targe and spear and fury of bronzeclad warrior the bossed shields
 pressed each on each and mighty din arose then were heard the voice of
 groaning and the voice of triumph together of the slayers and the slain
 and the earth streamed with blood

 now while it yet was morn and the divine day waxed so long from either
 side lighted the darts amain and the people fell but when the sun
 bestrode midheaven then did the father balance his golden scales and
 put therein two fates of death that layeth men at their length one for
 horsetaming trojans one for mailclad achaians and he took the
 scaleyard by the midst and lifted it and the achaians' day of destiny
 sank down so lay the achaians' fates on the bounteous earth and the
 trojans' fates were lifted up towards wide heaven and the god thundered
 aloud from ida and sent his blazing flash amid the host of the
 achaians and they saw and were astonished and pale fear gat hold upon
 all

 then had idomeneus no heart to stand neither agamemnon neither stood
 the twain aiantes men of ares' company only nestor of gerenia stood
 his ground he the warden of the achaians neither he of purpose but
 his horse was fordone which noble alexandros beauteoushaired helen's
 lord had smitten with an arrow upon the top of the crest where the
 foremost hairs of horses grow upon the skull and there is the most
 deadly spot so the horse leapt up in anguish and the arrow sank into
 his brain and he brought confusion on the steeds as he writhed upon the
 dart while the old man leapt forth and with his sword began to hew the
 traces came hector's fleet horses through the tumult bearing a bold
 charioteer even hecktor and now had the old man lost his life but
 that diomedes of the loud warcry was swift to mark terribly shouted
 he summoning odysseus "heavenborn son of laertes odysseus of many
 wiles whither fleest thou with thy back turned like a coward in the
 throng beware lest as thou fleest one plant a spear between thy
 shoulders nay stand thy ground till we thrust back from the old man
 his furious foe"

 so spake he but muchenduring noble odysseus heard him not but
 hastened by to the hollow ships of the achaians yet tydeides though
 but one mingled amid the fighters in the forefront and took his stand
 before the steeds of the old man neleus' son and spake to him winged
 words and said "old man of a truth young warriors beset thee hard
 and thy force is abated and old age is sore upon thee and thy squire
 is but a weakling and thy steeds are slow come then mount upon my
 car that thou mayest see of what sort are the steeds of tros well
 skilled for following or fleeing hither or thither very fleetly across
 the plain even those that erst i took from aineias inspirer of fear
 thine let our squires tend and these let us guide straight against the
 horsetaming trojans that even hector may know whether my spear also
 rageth in my hands"

 so said he and knightly nestor of gerenia disregarded not then the two
 squires tended nestor's horses even sthenelos the valiant and kindly
 eurymedon and the other twain both mounted upon diomedes' car and
 nestor took into his hands the shining reins and lashed the horses and
 soon they drew nigh hector then tydeus' son hurled at him as he charged
 straight upon them him missed he but his squire that drave his
 chariot eniopeus highhearted thebaios' son even him as he held the
 reins he smote upon the breast beside the nipple so he fell from out
 the car and his fleetfooted horses swerved aside and there his soul
 and spirit were unstrung then sore grief encompassed hector's soul for
 sake of his charioteer yet left he him there lying though he sorrowed
 for his comrade and drave in quest of a bold charioteer and his horses
 lacked not long a master for anon he found iphitos' son bold
 archeptolemos and him he made mount behind his fleet horses and gave
 the reins into his hands

 then had destruction come and deeds beyond remedy been wrought and so
 had they been penned in ilios like lambs had not the father of gods and
 men been swift to mark so he thundered terribly and darted his white
 lightning and hurled it before diomedes' steeds to earth and there
 arose a terrible flame of sulphur burning and the two horses were
 affrighted and cowered beneath the car and the shining reins dropped
 from nestor's hands and he was afraid at heart and spake to diomedes
 "come now tydeides turn back thy wholehooved horses to flight seest
 thou not that victory from zeus attendeth not on thee now doth kronos'
 son vouchsafe glory to this hector for the day hereafter shall he
 grant it us likewise if he will a man may not at all ward off the will
 of zeus not though one be very valiant he verily is mightier far"

 then diomedes of the loud warcry answered him "yea verily old man
 all this thou sayest is according unto right but this is the sore grief
 that entereth my heart and soul hector some day shall say as he maketh
 harangue amid the trojans 'tydeides betook him to the ships in flight
 before my face' so shall he boastin that day let the wide earth yawn
 for me"

 so spake he and turned the wholehooved horses to flight back through
 the tumult and the trojans and hector with wondrous uproar poured upon
 them their dolorous darts and over him shouted loudly great hector of
 the glancing helm "tydeides the fleethorsed danaans were wont to
 honour thee with the highest place and meats and cups brimful but now
 will they disdain thee thou art after all no better than a woman
 begone poor puppet not for my flinching shalt thou climb on our
 towers neither carry our wives away upon thy ships ere that will i
 deal thee thy fate"

 so said he and tydeides was of divided mind whether to wheel his
 horses and fight him face to face thrice doubted he in heart and soul
 and thrice from ida's mountains thundered zeus the lord of counsel and
 gave to the trojans a sign the turning of the course of battle and
 hector with loud shout called to the trojans "trojans and lykians and
 dardanians that love close fight be men my friends and bethink you of
 impetuous valour i perceive that of good will kronion vouchsafest me
 victory and great glory and to the danaans destruction fools that
 devised these walls weak and of none account they shall not withhold
 our fury and lightly shall our steeds overleap the delved foss but
 when i be once come amid the hollow ships then be thought taken of
 consuming fire that with fire i may burn the ships and slay the men"

 so spake he and shouted to his steeds and said "xanthos and thou
 podargos and aithon and goodly lampos now pay me back your tending
 even the abundance that andromache greathearted eetion's daughter set
 before you of honeyhearted wheat and mingled wine to drink at the
 heart's bidding pursue ye now and haste that we may seize nestor's
 shield the fame whereof now reacheth unto heaven how that it is of
 gold throughout armrods and all and may seize moreover from
 horsetaming diomedes' shoulders his richly dight breastplate that
 hephaistos wrought cunningly could we but take these then might i hope
 this very night to make the achaians to embark on their fleet ships"

 and now had he burned the trim ships with blazing fire but that queen
 hera put it in agamemnon's heart himself to bestir him and swiftly
 arouse the achaians so he went his way along the huts and ships of the
 achaians holding a great cloak of purple in his stalwart hand and
 stood by odysseus' black ship of mighty burden that was in the midst
 so that a voice could be heard to either end then shouted he in a
 piercing voice and called to the danaans aloud "fie upon you argives
 ye sorry things of shame so brave in semblance whither are gone our
 boastings when we said that we were bravest the boasts ye uttered
 vaingloriously when in lemnos as ye ate your fill of flesh of
 tallhorned oxen and drank goblets crowned with wine and said that
 every man should stand in war to face fivescore yea tenscore trojans
 yet now can we not match one even this hector that anon will burn our
 ships with flame of fire o father zeus didst ever thou blind with such
 a blindness any mighty king and rob him of great glory nay zeus this
 hope fulfil thou me suffer that we ourselves at least flee and escape
 neither suffer that the achaians be thus vanquished of the trojans"

 so spake he and the father had pity on him as he wept and vouchsafed
 him that his folk should be saved and perish not forthwith sent he an
 eaglesurest sign among winged fowlholding in his claws a fawn the
 young of a fleet hind beside the beautiful altar of zeus he let fall
 the fawn where the achaians did sacrifice unto zeus lord of all
 oracles so when they saw that the bird was come from zeus they sprang
 the more upon the trojans and bethought them of the joy of battle

 now could no man of the danaans for all they were very many boast that
 he before tydeus' son had guided his fleet horses forth and driven them
 across the trench and fought man to man first by far was tydeides to
 slay a warrior of the trojans in full array even agelaos son of
 phradmon now he had turned his steeds to flee but as he wheeled the
 other plunged the spear into his back between his shoulders and drave
 it through his breast so fell he from his chariot and his armour
 clanged upon him

 and after him came atreus' sons even agamemnon and menelaos and after
 them the aiantes clothed upon with impetuous valour and after them
 idomeneus and idomeneus' brother in arms meriones peer of enyalios
 slayer of men and after them eurypylos euaimon's glorious son and
 ninth came teukros stretching his backbent bow and took his stand
 beneath the shield of aias son of telamon and so aias would stealthily
 withdraw the shield and teukros would spy his chance and when he had
 shot and smitten one in the throng then fell such an one and gave up
 the ghost and teukros would return and as a child beneath his mother
 so gat he him to aias who hid him with the shining shield

 and agamemnon king of men rejoiced to behold him making havoc with his
 stalwart bow of the battalions of the trojans and he came and stood by
 his side and spake to him saying "teukros dear heart thou son of
 telamon prince of the host shoot on in this wise if perchance thou
 mayest be found the salvation of the danaans and glory of thy father
 telamon"

 and noble teukros made answer and said to him "most noble son of
 atreus why urgest thou me that myself am eager verily with such
 strength as is in me forbear i not but ever since we drave them towards
 ilios i watch with my bow to slay the foemen eight longbarbed arrows
 have i now sped and all are buried in the flesh of young men swift in
 battle only this mad dog can i not smite"

 he said and shot another arrow from the string right against hector
 and his heart was fain to smite him yet missed he once again for
 apollo turned the dart away but archeptolemos hector's bold
 charioteer he smote on the breast beside the nipple as he hasted into
 battle so he fell from his car and his fleetfooted horses swerved
 aside and there his soul and spirit were unstrung then sore grief
 encompassed hector's soul for his charioteer's sake yet left he him
 though he sorrowed for his comrade and bade kebriones his own brother
 being hard by take the chariot reins and he heard and disregarded not
 and himself he leapt to earth from the resplendent car with a terrible
 shout and in his hand he caught a stone and made right at teukros and
 his heart bade him smite him now teukros had plucked forth from his
 quiver a keen arrow and laid it on the string but even as he drew it
 back hector of the glancing helm smote him with the jagged stone as he
 aimed eagerly against him even beside his shoulder where the
 collarbone fenceth off neck and breast and where is the most deadly
 spot and he brake the bowstring and his hand from the wrist grew numb
 and he stayed fallen upon his knee and his bow dropped from his hand
 but aias disregarded not his brother's fall but ran and strode across
 him and hid him with his shield then two trusty comrades bent down to
 him even mekisteus son of echios and goodly alastor and bare him
 groaning sorely to the hollow ships and once again the olympian
 aroused the spirit of the trojans so they drove the achaians straight
 toward the deep foss and amid the foremost went hector exulting in his
 strength and even as when a hound behind wild boar or lion with swift
 feet pursuing snatcheth at him at flank or buttock and watcheth for
 him as he wheeleth so hector pressed hard on the flowinghaired
 achaians slaying ever the hindmost and they fled on but when they
 were passed in flight through palisade and foss and many were fallen
 beneath the trojans' hands then halted they and tarried beside the
 ships calling one upon another and lifting up their hands to all the
 gods prayed each one instantly but hector wheeled round his
 beauteousmaned steeds this way and that and his eyes were as the eyes
 of gorgon or ares bane of mortals

 now at the sight of them the whitearmed goddess hera had compassion
 and anon spake winged words to athene "out on it thou child of
 aegisbearing zeus shall not we twain any more take thought for the
 danaans that perish if only for this last time now will they fill up
 the measure of evil destiny and perish by one man's onslaught seeing
 that he is furious now beyond endurance this hector son of priam and
 verily hath wrought many a deed of ill"

 and the brighteyed goddess athene made answer to her "yea in good
 sooth may this fellow yield up strength and life and perish at the
 argives' hands in his native land only mine own sire is furious with
 no good intent headstrong ever sinful the foiler of my purposes but
 now make thou ready our wholehooved horses while i enter into the
 palace of aegisbearing zeus and gird me in my armour for battle that i
 may see if priam's son hector of the glancing helm shall be glad at
 the appearing of us twain amid the highways of the battle surely shall
 many a trojan likewise glut dogs and birds with fat and flesh fallen
 dead at the ships of the achaians"

 so said she and the whitearmed goddess hera disregarded not but when
 father zeus beheld from ida he was sore wroth and sped iris
 goldenwinged to bear a message "go thy way fleet iris turn them
 back neither suffer them to face me for in no happy wise shall we join
 in combat for thus will i declare and even so shall the fulfilment be
 i will maim their fleet horses in the chariot and them will i hurl out
 from the car and will break in pieces the chariot neither within the
 courses of ten years shall they heal them of the wounds the thunderbolt
 shall tear that the brighteyed one may know the end when she striveth
 against her father but with hera have i not so great indignation nor
 wrath seeing it ever is her wont to thwart me whate'er i have
 decreed"

 so said he and whirlwindfooted iris arose to bear the message and
 departed from the mountains of ida unto high olympus and even at the
 entrance of the gates of olympus manyfolded she met them and stayed
 them and told them the saying of zeus

 and father zeus drave from ida his fairwheeled chariot and horses unto
 olympus and came unto the session of the gods for him also the noble
 shaker of earth unyoked the steeds and set the car upon the stand and
 spread a cloth thereover and farseeing zeus himself sate upon his
 golden throne and beneath his feet great olympus quaked only athene
 and hera sate apart from zeus and spake no word to him neither
 questioned him but he was ware thereof in his heart and said "why are
 ye thus vexed athene and hera surely ye are not wearied of making
 havoc in glorious battle of the trojans for whom ye cherish bitter
 hate howsoever seeing that my might is so great and my hands
 invincible all the gods that are in olympus could not turn me and for
 you twain trembling erst gat hold upon your bright limbs ere that ye
 beheld war and war's fell deeds for thus will i declare and even so
 had the fulfilment beennever had ye once smitten with the
 thunderbolt fared on your chariots back unto olympus where is the
 habitation of the immortals"

 so spake he and athene and hera murmured that were sitting by him and
 devising ills for the trojans now athene held her peace and said not
 anything for wrath at father zeus and fierce anger gat hold upon her
 but hera's heart contained not her anger and she spake "most dread son
 of kronos what word is this thou hast said well know we even we that
 thy might is no wise puny yet still have we pity for the danaan
 spearmen that now shall perish and fill up the measure of grievous
 fate"

 and zeus the cloudgatherer answered and said "at morn shalt thou
 behold most mighty kronion if thou wilt have it so o hera oxeyed
 queen making yet more havoc of the vast army of argive spearmen for
 headlong hector shall not refrain from battle till that peleus' son
 fleet of foot have arisen beside the ships that day when these shall
 fight amid the sterns in most grievous stress around patroklos fallen
 such is the doom of heaven and for thine anger reck i not not even
 though thou go to the nethermost bounds of earth and sea where sit
 iapetos and kronos and have no joy in the beams of hyperion the sungod
 neither in any breeze but deep tartaros is round about them though
 thou shouldest wander till thou come even thither yet reck i not of thy
 vexation seeing there is no thing more unabashed than thou"

 so said he but whitearmed hera spake him no word and the sun's bright
 light dropped into ocean drawing black night across earth the
 graingiver against the trojans' will daylight departed but welcome
 thrice prayed for to the achaians came down the murky night

 now glorious hector made an assembly of the trojans taking them apart
 from the ships beside the eddying river in an open space where was
 found a spot clear of dead and they came down from their chariots to
 the ground to hear the word that hector dear unto zeus proclaimed he
 in his hand held his spear eleven cubits long before his face gleamed
 the spearhead of bronze and a ring of gold ran round about it thereon
 he leaned and spake to the trojans saying "hearken to me trojans and
 dardanians and allies i thought but now to make havoc of the ships and
 all the achaians and depart back again to windy ilios but dusk came too
 soon and that in chief hath now saved the argives and the ships beside
 the beach of the sea so let us now yield to black night and make our
 supper ready unyoke ye from the chariots your fairmaned horses and
 set fodder beside them and from the city bring kine and goodly sheep
 with speed and provide you with honeyhearted wine and corn from your
 houses and gather much wood withal that all night long until
 earlyspringing dawn we may burn many fires and the gleam may reach to
 heaven lest perchance even by night the flowinghaired achaians strive
 to take flight over the broad back of the sea verily must they not
 embark upon their ships unvexed at ease but see ye that many a one of
 them have a wound to nurse even at home being stricken with arrow or
 keenpointed spear as he leapeth upon his ship that so many another man
 may dread to wage dolorous war on the horsetaming men of troy and let
 the heralds dear to zeus proclaim throughout the city that young maidens
 and old men of hoary heads camp round the city on the battlements
 builded of the gods and let the women folk burn a great fire each in
 her hall and let there be a sure watch set lest an ambush enter the
 city when the host is absent howbeit for the night will we guard our
 own selves and at morn by daybreak arrayed in our armour let us awake
 keen battle at the hollow ships i will know whether tydeus' son
 stalwart diomedes shall thrust me from the ships back to the wall or i
 shall lay him low with my spear and bear away his gory spoils tomorrow
 shall he prove his valour whether he can abide the onslaught of my
 spear would that i were immortal and ageless all my days and honoured
 like as athene is honoured and apollo so surely as this day bringeth
 the argives ill"

 so hector made harangue and the trojans clamoured applause and they
 loosed their sweating steeds from the yoke and tethered them with
 thongs each man beside his chariot and from the city they brought kine
 and goodly sheep with speed and provided them with honeyhearted wine
 and corn from their houses and gathered much wood withal and from the
 plain the winds bare into heaven the sweet savour but these with high
 hopes sate them all night along the highways of the battle and their
 watchfires burned in multitude even as when in heaven the stars about
 the bright moon shine clear to see when the air is windless and all
 the peaks appear and the tall headlands and glades and from heaven
 breaketh open the infinite air and all stars are seen and the
 shepherd's heart is glad even in like multitude between the ships and
 the streams of xanthos appeared the watchfires that the trojans kindled
 in front of ilios a thousand fires burned in the plain and by the side
 of each sate fifty in the gleam of blazing fire and the horses champed
 white barley and spelt and standing by their chariots waited for the
 throned dawn



 book ix

 how agamemnon sent an embassage to achilles beseeching him
 to be appeased and how achilles denied him

 thus kept the trojans watch but the achaians were holden of heavensent
 panic handmaid of palsying fear and all their best were stricken to
 the heart with grief intolerable like as two winds stir up the main
 the home of fishes even the north wind and the west wind that blow from
 thrace coming suddenly and the dark billow straightway lifteth up its
 crest and casteth much tangle out along the sea even so was the
 achaians' spirit troubled in their breast

 but atreides was stricken to the heart with sore grief and went about
 bidding the clearvoiced heralds summon every man by name to the
 assembly but not to shout aloud and himself he toiled amid the
 foremost so they sat sorrowful in assembly and agamemnon stood up
 weeping like unto a fountain of dark water that from a beetling cliff
 poureth down its black stream even so with deep groaning he spake amid
 the argives and said "my friends leaders and captains of the argives
 zeus son of kronos hath bound me with might in grievous blindness of
 soul hard of heart is he for that erewhile he promised and gave his
 pledge that not till i had laid waste wellwalled ilios should i depart
 but now hath planned a cruel wile and biddeth me return in dishonour to
 argos with the loss of many of my folk such meseemeth is the good
 pleasure of most mighty zeus that hath laid low the heads of many
 cities yea and shall lay low for his is highest power so come even
 as i shall bid let us all obey let us flee with our ships to our dear
 native land for now shall we never take widewayed troy"

 so said he and they all held their peace and kept silence long time
 were the sons of the achaians voiceless for grief but at the last
 diomedes of the loud warcry spake amid them and said "atreides with
 thee first in thy folly will i contend where it is just o king even
 in the assembly be not thou wroth therefor my valour didst thou blame
 in chief amid the danaans and saidst that i was no man of war but a
 coward and all this know the argives both young and old but the son of
 crookedcounselling kronos hath endowed thee but by halves he granted
 thee to have the honour of the sceptre above all men but valour he gave
 thee not wherein is highest power sir deemest thou that the sons of
 the achaians are thus indeed cowards and weaklings as thou sayest if
 thine own heart be set on departing go thy way the way is before thee
 and thy ships stand beside the sea even the great multitude that
 followed thee from mykene but all the other flowinghaired achaians
 will tarry here until we lay waste troy nay let them too flee on their
 ships to their dear native land yet will we twain even i and
 sthenelos fight till we attain the goal of ilios for in god's name are
 we come"

 so said he and all the sons of the achaians shouted aloud applauding
 the saying of horsetaming diomedes then knightly nestor arose and said
 amid them "tydeides in battle art thou passing mighty and in council
 art thou best among thine equals in years none of all the achaians will
 make light of thy word nor gainsay it now let us yield to black night
 and make ready our meal and let the sentinels bestow them severally
 along the deepdelved foss without the wall this charge give i to the
 young men and thou atreides lead then the way for thou art the most
 royal spread thou a feast for the councillors that is thy place and
 seemly for thee thy huts are full of wine that the ships of the
 achaians bring thee by day from thrace across the wide sea all
 entertainment is for thee being king over many in the gathering of
 many shalt thou listen to him that deviseth the most excellent counsel
 sore need have all the achaians of such as is good and prudent because
 hard by the ships our foemen are burning their watchfires in multitude
 what man can rejoice thereat this night shall either destroy or save
 the host"

 so said he and they gladly hearkened to him and obeyed forth sallied
 the sentinels in their harness seven were the captains of the
 sentinels and with each went fivescore young men bearing their long
 spears in their hands and they took post midway betwixt foss and wall
 and kindled a fire and made ready each man his meal

 then atreides gathered the councillors of the achaians and led them to
 his hut and spread before them an abundant feast so they put forth
 their hands to the good cheer that lay before them and when they had
 put away from them the desire of meat and drink then the old man first
 began to weave his counsel even nestor whose rede of old time was
 approved the best he spake to them and said "most noble son of atreus
 agamemnon king of men in thy name will i end and with thy name begin
 because thou art king over many hosts and to thy hand zeus hath
 entrusted sceptre and law that thou mayest take counsel for thy folk
 thee therefore more than any it behoveth both to speak and hearken and
 to accomplish what another than thou may say no other man shall have a
 more excellent thought than this that i bear in mind from old time even
 until now since the day when thou o heavensprung king didst go and
 take the damsel briseis from angry achilles' hut by no consent of ours
 nay i right heartily dissuaded thee but thou yieldedst to thy proud
 spirit and dishonouredst a man of valour whom even the immortals
 honoured for thou didst take and keepest from him his meed of valour
 still let us even now take thought how we may appease him and persuade
 him with gifts of friendship and kindly words"

 and agamemnon king of men answered and said to him "old sir in no
 false wise hast thou accused my folly fool was i i myself deny it not
 worth many hosts is he whom zeus loveth in his heart even as now he
 honoureth this man and destroyeth the host of the achaians but seeing i
 was a fool in that i yielded to my sorry passion i will make amends and
 give a recompense beyond telling in the midst of you all i will name
 the excellent gifts seven tripods untouched of fire and ten talents of
 gold and twenty gleaming caldrons and twelve stalwart horses winners
 in the race that have taken prizes by their speed no lackwealth were
 that man whose substance were as great as the prizes my wholehooved
 steeds have borne me off and seven women will i give skilled in
 excellent handiwork lesbians whom i chose me from the spoils the day
 that he himself took stablished lesbos surpassing womankind in beauty
 these will i give him and with them shall be she whom erst i took from
 him even the daughter of briseus all these things shall be set
 straightway before him and if hereafter the gods grant us to lay waste
 the great city of priam then let him enter in when we achaians be
 dividing the spoil and lade his ship full of gold and bronze and
 himself choose twenty trojan women the fairest that there be after
 helen of argos and if we win to the richest of lands even achaian
 argos he shall be my son and i will hold him in like honour with
 orestes my stripling boy that is nurtured in all abundance three
 daughters are mine in my wellbuilded hall chrysothemis and laodike and
 iphianassa let him take of them which he will without gifts of wooing
 to peleus' house and i will add a great dower such as no man ever yet
 gave with his daughter and seven wellpeopled cities will i give him
 kardamyle and enope and grassy hire and holy pherai and antheia deep in
 meads and fair aipeia and pedasos land of vines and all are nigh to
 the salt sea on the uttermost border of sandy pylos therein dwell men
 abounding in flocks and kine men that shall worship him like a god with
 gifts and beneath his sway fulfil his prosperous ordinances all this
 will i accomplish so he but cease from wrath let him yield hades i
 ween is not to be softened neither overcome and therefore is he
 hatefullest of all gods to mortals yea let him be ruled by me
 inasmuch as i am more royal and avow me to be the elder in years"

 then knightly nestor of gerenia answered and said "most noble son of
 atreus agamemnon king of men now are these gifts not lightly to be
 esteemed that thou offerest king achilles come therefore let us speed
 forth picked men to go with all haste to the hut of peleus' son
 achilles lo now whomsoever i appoint let them consent first let
 phoinix dear to zeus lead the way and after him great aias and noble
 odysseus and for heralds let odios and eurybates be their companions
 and now bring water for our hands and bid keep holy silence that we
 may pray unto zeus the son of kronos if perchance he will have mercy
 upon us"

 so said he and spake words that were wellpleasing unto all forthwith
 the heralds poured water on their hands and the young men crowned the
 bowls with drink and gave each man his portion after they had poured the
 libation in the cups and when they had made libation and drunk as their
 heart desired they issued forth from the hut of agamemnon son of
 atreus and knightly nestor of gerenia gave them full charge with many
 a glance to each and chiefest to odysseus how they should essay to
 prevail on peleus' noble son

 so the twain went along the shore of the loudsounding sea making
 instant prayer to the earthembracer the shaker of the earth that they
 might with ease prevail on aiakides' great heart so they came to the
 huts and ships of the myrmidons and found their king taking his
 pleasure of a loud lyre fair of curious work with a silver crossbar
 upon it therein he was delighting his soul and singing the glories of
 heroes and over against him sate patroklos alone in silence watching
 till aiakides should cease from singing so the twain came forward and
 noble odysseus led the way and they stood before his face and achilles
 sprang up amazed with the lyre in his hand and left the seat where he
 was sitting and in like manner patroklos when he beheld the men arose
 then achilles fleet of foot greeted them and said "welcome verily ye
 are friends that are comesore indeed is the needeven ye that are
 dearest of the achaians to me even in my wrath"

 so spake noble achilles and led them forward and made them sit on
 settles and carpets of purple and anon he spake to patroklos being
 near "bring forth a greater bowl thou son of menoitios mingle
 stronger drink and prepare each man a cup for dearest of men are these
 that are under my roof"

 then put they forth their hands to the good cheer lying before them and
 when they had put from them the desire of meat and drink aias nodded to
 phoinix but noble odysseus marked it and filled a cup with wine and
 pledged achilles "hail o achilles the fair feast lack we not either
 in the hut of agamemnon son of atreus neither now in thine for feasting
 is there abundance to our heart's desire but our thought is not for
 matters of the delicious feast nay we behold very sore destruction
 thou fosterling of zeus and are afraid now is it in doubt whether we
 save the benched ships or behold them perish if thou put not on thy
 might nigh unto ships and wall have the highhearted trojans and famed
 allies pitched their camp and kindled many fires throughout their host
 and ween that they shall no more be withheld but will fall on our black
 ships and zeus son of kronos sheweth them signs upon the right by
 lightning and hector greatly exulteth in his might and rageth
 furiously trusting in zeus and recketh not of god nor man for mighty
 madness hath possessed him he prayeth bright dawn to shine forth with
 all speed for he bath passed his word to smite off from the ships the
 ensigns' tops and to fire the hulls with devouring flame and hard
 thereby to make havoc of the achaians confounded by the smoke therefore
 am i sore afraid in my heart lest the gods fulfil his boastings and it
 be fated for us to perish here in troyland far from argos pastureland
 of horses up then if thou art minded even at the last to save the
 failing sons of the achaians from the wardin of the trojans eschew thy
 grievous wrath agamemnon offereth thee worthy gifts so thou wilt cease
 from anger lo now hearken thou to me and i will tell thee all the
 gifts that in his hut agamemnon promised thee but if agamemnon be too
 hateful to thy heart both he and his gifts yet have thou pity on all
 the achaians that faint throughout the host these shall honour thee as
 a god for verily thou wilt earn exceeding great glory at their hands
 yea now mightest thou slay hector for he would come very near thee in
 his deadly madness because he deemeth that there is no man like unto
 him among the danaans that the ships brought hither"

 and achilles fleet of foot answered and said unto him "heavensprung
 son of laertes odysseus of many wiles in openness must i now declare
 unto you my saying even as i am minded and as the fulfilment thereof
 shall be that ye may not sit before me and coax this way and that for
 hateful to me even as the gates of hell is he that hideth one thing in
 his heart and uttereth another but i will speak what meseemeth best
 not me i ween shall agamemnon son of atreus persuade nor the other
 danaans seeing we were to have no thank for battling with the foemen
 ever without respite he that abideth at home hath equal share with him
 that fighteth his best and in like honour are held both the coward and
 the brave death cometh alike to the untoiling and to him that hath
 toiled long neither have i any profit for that i endured tribulation of
 soul ever staking my life in fight even as a hen bringeth her
 unfledged chickens each morsel as she winneth it and with herself it
 goeth hard even so i was wont to watch out many a sleepless night and
 pass through many bloody days of battle warring with folk for their
 women's sake twelve cities of men have i laid waste from shipboard
 and from land eleven throughout deepsoiled troyland out of all these
 took i many goodly treasures and would bring and give them all to
 agamemnon son of atreus and he staying behind amid the fleet ships
 would take them and portion out some few but keep the most now some he
 gave to be meeds of honour to the princes and the kings and theirs are
 left untouched only from me of all the achaians took he my darling lady
 and keepeth her but why must the argives make war on the trojans why
 hath atreides gathered his host and led them hither is it not for
 lovelyhaired helen's sake do then the sons of atreus alone of mortal
 men love their wives surely whatsoever man is good and sound of mind
 loveth his own and cherisheth her even as i too loved mine with all my
 heart though but the captive of my spear but now that he hath taken my
 meed of honour from mine arms and hath deceived me let him not tempt me
 that know him full well he shall not prevail nay odysseus let him
 take counsel with thee and all the princes to ward from the ships the
 consuming fire verily without mine aid he hath wrought many things and
 built a wall and dug a foss about it wide and deep and set a palisade
 therein yet even so can he not stay murderous hector's might but so
 long as i was fighting amid the achaians hector had no mind to array
 his battle far from the wall but scarce came unto the skaian gates and
 to the oaktree there once he awaited me alone and scarce escaped my
 onset but now seeing i have no mind to fight with noble hector i will
 tomorrow do sacrifice to zeus and all the gods and store well my ships
 when i have launched them on the salt seathen shalt thou see if thou
 wilt and hast any care therefor my ships sailing at break of day over
 hellespont the fishes' home and my men right eager at the oar and if
 the great shaker of the earth grant me good journey on the third day
 should i reach deepsoiled phthia there are my great possessions that i
 left when i came hither to my hurt and yet more gold and ruddy bronze
 shall i bring from hence and fairgirdled women and grey iron all at
 least that were mine by lot only my meed of honour hath he that gave it
 me taken back in his despitefulness even lord agamemnon son of atreus
 to him declare ye everything even as i charge you openly that all the
 achaians likewise may have indignation if haply he hopeth to beguile
 yet some other danaan for that he is ever clothed in shamelessness
 verily not in my face would he dare to look though he have the front of
 a dog neither will i devise counsel with him nor any enterprise for
 utterly he hath deceived me and done wickedly but never again shall he
 beguile me with fair speechlet this suffice him let him begone in
 peace zeus the lord of counsel hath taken away his wits hateful to me
 are his gifts and i hold him at a straw's worth not even if he gave me
 ten times yea twenty all that now is his and all that may come to him
 otherwhence even all the revenue of orchomenos or egyptian thebes where
 the treasurehouses are stored fullestthebes of the hundred gates
 whence sally forth two hundred warriors through each with horses and
 chariotsnay nor gifts in number as sand or dust not even so shall
 agamemnon persuade my soul till he have paid me back all the bitter
 despite and the daughter of agamemnon son of atreus will i not wed not
 were she rival of golden aphrodite for fairness and for handiwork
 matched brighteyed athenenot even then will i wed her let him choose
 him of the achaians another that is his peer and is more royal than i
 for if the gods indeed preserve me and i come unto my home then will
 peleus himself seek me a wife many achaian maidens are there throughout
 hellas and phthia daughters of princes that ward their cities
 whomsoever of these i wish will i make my dear lady very often was my
 high soul moved to take me there a wedded wife a help meet for me and
 have joy of the possessions that the old man peleus possesseth for not
 of like worth with life hold i even all the wealth that men say was
 possessed of the wellpeopled city of ilios in days of peace gone by
 before the sons of the achaians came neither all the treasure that the
 stone threshold of the archer phoebus apollo encompasseth in rocky
 pytho for kine and goodly flocks are to be had for the harrying and
 tripods and chestnut horses for the purchasing but to bring back man's
 life neither harrying nor earning availeth when once it hath passed the
 barrier of his lips for thus my goddess mother telleth me thetis the
 silverfooted that twain fates are bearing me to the issue of death if
 i abide here and besiege the trojans' city then my returning home is
 taken from me but my fame shall be imperishable but if i go home to my
 dear native land my high fame is taken from me but my life shall
 endure long while neither shall the issue of death soon reach me
 moreover i would counsel you all to set sail homeward seeing ye shall
 never reach your goal of steep ilios of a surety farseeing zeus
 holdeth his hand over her and her folk are of good courage so go your
 way and tell my answer to the princes of the achaians even as is the
 office of elders that they may devise in their hearts some other better
 counsel such as shall save them their ships and the host of the
 achaians amid the hollow ships since this counsel availeth them naught
 that they have now devised by reason of my fierce wrath but let
 phoinix now abide with us and lay him to rest that he may follow with
 me on my ships to our dear native land tomorrow if he will for i will
 not take him perforce"

 so spake he and they all held their peace and were still and marvelled
 at his saying for he denied them very vehemently but at the last spake
 to them the old knight phoinix bursting into tears because he was sore
 afraid for the ships of the achaians "if indeed thou ponderest
 departure in thy heart glorious achilles and hast no mind at all to
 save the fleet ships from consuming fire because that wrath bath
 entered into thy heart how can i be left of thee dear son alone
 thereafter to thee did the old knight peleus send me the day he sent
 thee to agamemnon forth from phthia a stripling yet unskilled in equal
 war and in debate wherein men wax preeminent therefore sent he me to
 teach thee all these things to be both a speaker of words and a doer of
 deeds yea i reared thee to this greatness thou godlike achilles with
 my heart's love for with none other wouldest thou go unto the feast
 neither take meat in the hall till that i had set thee upon my knees
 and stayed thee with the savoury morsel cut first for thee and put the
 winecup to thy lips oft hast thou stained the doublet on my breast
 with sputtering of wine in thy sorry helplessness thus i suffered much
 with thee and much i toiled being mindful that the gods in nowise
 created any issue of my body but i made thee my son thou godlike
 achilles that thou mayest yet save me from grievous destruction
 therefore achilles rule thy high spirit neither beseemeth it thee to
 have a ruthless heart nay even the very gods can bend and theirs
 withal is loftier majesty and honour and might nay come for the gifts
 the achaians shall honour thee even as a god but if without gifts thou
 enter into battle the bane of men thou wilt not be held in like honour
 even though thou avert the fray"

 and achilles fleet of foot made answer and said to him "phoinix my
 father thou old man fosterling of zeus such honour need i in no wise
 for i deem that i have been honoured by the judgment of zeus which
 shall abide upon me amid my beaked ships as long as breath tarrieth in
 my body and my limbs are strong moreover i will say this thing to thee
 and lay thou it to thine heart trouble not my soul by weeping and
 lamentation to do the pleasure of warrior atreides neither beseemeth
 it thee to cherish him lest thou be hated of me that cherish thee it
 were good that thou with me shouldest vex him that vexeth me be thou
 king even as i and share my sway by halves but these shall bear my
 message so tarry thou here and lay thee to rest in a soft bed and with
 break of day will we consider whether to depart unto our own or to
 abide"

 he spake and nodded his brow in silence unto patroklos to spread for
 phoinix a thick couch that the others might bethink them to depart from
 the hut with speed then spake to them aias telamon's godlike son and
 said "heavensprung son of laertes odysseus of many wiles let us go
 hence for methinks the purpose of our charge will not by this journey
 be accomplished and we must tell the news though it be no wise good
 with all speed unto the danaans that now sit awaiting but achilles
 hath wrought his proud soul to fury within himstubborn man that
 recketh naught of his comrades' love wherein we worshipped him beyond
 all men amid the shipsunmerciful yet doth a man accept recompense of
 his brother's murderer or for his dead son and so the manslayer for a
 great price abideth in his own land and the kinsman's heart is
 appeased and his proud soul when he hath taken the recompense but for
 thee the gods have put within thy breast a spirit implacable and evil
 by reason of one single damsel and now we offer thee seven damsels far
 best of all and many other gifts besides entertain thou then a kindly
 spirit and have respect unto thine home because we are guests of thy
 roof sent of the multitude of danaans and we would fain be nearest to
 thee and dearest beyond all other achaians as many as there be"

 and achilles fleet of foot made answer and said to him "aias sprung of
 zeus thou son of telamon prince of the folk thou seemest to speak all
 this almost after mine own mind but my heart swelleth with wrath as oft
 as i bethink me of those things how atreides entreated me arrogantly
 among the argives as though i were some worthless sojourner but go ye
 and declare my message i will not take thought of bloody war until that
 wise priam's son noble hector come to the myrmidons' huts and ships
 slaying the argives and smirch the ships with fire but about mine hut
 and black ship i ween that hector though he be very eager for battle
 shall be refrained"

 so said he and they took each man a twohandled cup and made libation
 and went back along the line of ships and odysseus led the way and
 patroklos bade his fellows and handmaidens spread with all speed a thick
 couch for phoinix and they obeyed and spread a couch as he ordained
 fleeces and rugs and fine flock of linen then the old man laid him down
 and tarried for bright dawn

 now when those were come unto atreides' huts the sons of the achaians
 stood up on this side and on that and pledged them in cups of gold and
 questioned them and agamemnon king of men asked them first "come now
 tell me odysseus full of praise thou great glory of the achaians will
 he save the ships from consuming fire or said he nay and hath wrath
 yet hold of his proud spirit"

 and steadfast goodly odysseus answered him "most noble son of atreus
 agamemnon king of men he yonder hath no mind to quench his wrath but
 is yet more filled of fury and spurneth thee and thy gifts he biddeth
 thee take counsel for thyself amid the argives how to save the ships
 and folk of the achaians and for himself he threateneth that at break
 of day he will launch upon the sea his trim wellbenched ships moreover
 he said that he would counsel all to sail for home because ye now shall
 never reach your goal of steep ilios surely farseeing zeus holdeth his
 hand over her and her folk are of good courage even so said he and
 here are also these to tell the tale that were my companions aias and
 the two heralds both men discreet but the old man phoinix laid him
 there to rest even as achilles bade him that he may follow with him on
 his ships to his dear native land tomorrow if he will for he will not
 take him perforce"

 so said he and they all held their peace and were still marvelling at
 his saying for he harangued very vehemently long were the sons of the
 achaians voiceless for grief but at the last diomedes of the loud
 warcry spake amid them "most noble son of atreus agamemnon king of
 men would thou hadst never besought peleus' glorious son with offer of
 gifts innumerable proud is he at any time but now hast thou yet far
 more encouraged him in his haughtiness howbeit we will let him bide
 whether he go or tarry hereafter he shall fight whenever his heart
 within him biddeth and god arouseth him come now even as i shall say
 let us all obey go ye now to rest full to your hearts' desire of meat
 and wine wherein courage is and strength but when fair rosyfingered
 dawn appeareth array thou with all speed before the ships thy folk and
 horsemen and urge them on and fight thyself amid the foremost"

 so said he and all the princes gave assent applauding the saying of
 diomedes tamer of horses and then they made libation and went every man
 to his hut and there laid them to rest and took the boon of sleep



 book x

 how diomedes and odysseus slew dolon a spy of the trojans
 and themselves spied on the trojan camp and took the horses
 of rhesos the thracian king

 now beside the ships the other leaders of the whole achaian host were
 sleeping all night long by soft sleep overcome but agamemnon son of
 atreus shepherd of the host sweet sleep held not so many things he
 debated in his mind and even as when the lord of fairtressed hera
 lighteneth fashioning either a mighty rain unspeakable or hail or
 snow when the flakes sprinkle all the ploughed lands or fashioning
 perchance the wide mouth of bitter war even so oft in his breast
 groaned agamemnon from the very deep of his heart and his spirits
 trembled within him and whensoever he looked toward that trojan plain
 he marvelled at the many fires that blazed in front of ilios and at the
 sound of flutes and pipes and the noise of men but whensoever to the
 ships he glanced and the host of the achaians then rent he many a lock
 clean forth from his head to zeus that is above and greatly groaned
 his noble heart

 and this in his soul seemed to him the best counsel to go first of all
 to nestor son of neleus if perchance he might contrive with him some
 right device that should be for the warding off of evil from all the
 danaans

 then he rose and did on his doublet about his breast and beneath his
 shining feet he bound on fair sandals and thereafter clad him in the
 tawny skin of a lion fiery and great a skin that reached to the feet
 and he grasped his spear

 and even in like wise did trembling fear take hold on menelaos for
 neither on his eyelids did sleep settle down lest somewhat should
 befall the argives who verily for his sake over wide waters were come
 to troyland with fierce war in their thoughts

 with a dappled pard's akin first he covered his broad shoulders and he
 raised and set on his head a casque of bronze and took a spear in his
 strong hand then went he on his way to rouse his brother that mightily
 ruled over all the argives and as a god was honoured by the people him
 found he harnessing his goodly gear about his shoulders by the stern of
 the ship and glad to his brother was his coming then menelaos of the
 loud warcry first accosted him "wherefore thus dear brother art thou
 arming wilt thou speed forth any of thy comrades to spy on the trojans
 nay terribly i fear lest none should undertake for thee this deed even
 to go and spy out the foeman alone through the ambrosial night needs
 must he be a man right hardy of heart"

 then the lord agamemnon answered him and spake "need of good counsel
 have i and thou menelaos fosterling of zeus of counsel that will help
 and save the argives and the ships since the heart of zeus hath turned
 again surely on the sacrifices of hector hath he set his heart rather
 than on ours for never did i see nor heard any tell that one man
 devised so many terrible deeds in one day as hector dear to zeus hath
 wrought on the sons of the achaians unaided though no dear son of a
 goddess is he nor of a god he hath done deeds that methinks will be a
 sorrow to the argives lasting and long such evils hath he devised
 against the achaians but go now run swiftly by the ships and summon
 aias and idomeneus but i will betake me to noble nestor and bid him
 arise if perchance he will be fain to go to the sacred company of the
 sentinels and lay on them his command for to him above others would
 they listen for his own son is chief among the sentinels he and the
 brother in arms of idomeneus even meriones for to them above all we
 entrusted this charge"

 then menelaos of the loud warcry answered him "how meanest thou this
 word wherewith thou dost command and exhort me am i to abide there with
 them waiting till thou comest or run back again to thee when i have
 well delivered to them thy commandment"

 then the king of men agamemnon answered him again "there do thou
 abide lest we miss each other as we go for many are the paths through
 the camp but call aloud wheresoever thou goest and bid men awake
 naming each man by his lineage and his father's name and giving all
 their dues of honour nor be thou proud of heart nay rather let us
 ourselves be labouring for even thus did zeus from our very birth
 dispense to us the heaviness of toil"

 so he spake and sent his brother away having clearly laid on him his
 commandment then went he himself after nestor the shepherd of the
 host whom he found by his hut and black ship in his soft bed beside
 him lay his arms a shield and two spears and a shining helmet beside
 him lay his glittering girdle wherewith the old man was wont to gird
 himself when he harnessed him for war the bane of men and led on the
 host for he yielded not to grievous old age then he raised him on his
 elbow lifting his head and spake to the son of atreus inquiring of
 him with this word "who art thou that farest alone by the ships
 through the camp in the dark night when other mortals are sleeping
 seekest thou one of thy mules or of thy comrades speak and come not
 silently upon me what need hast thou"

 then the king of men agamemnon answered him "o nestor son of neleus
 great glory of the achaians thou shalt know agamemnon son of atreus
 whom above all men zeus hath planted for ever among labours while my
 breath abides within my breast and my knees move i wander thus for
 that sweet sleep rests not on mine eyes but war is my care and the
 troubles of the achaians yea greatly i fear for the sake of the
 danaans nor is my heart firm but i am tossed to and fro and my heart
 is leaping from my breast and my good knees tremble beneath me but if
 thou wilt do aught since neither on thee cometh sleep let us go
 thither to the sentinels that we may see them lest they be fordone
 with toil and so are slumbering and have quite forgotten to keep
 watch and hostile men camp hard by nor know we at all but that they
 are keen to do battle in the night"

 then knightly nestor of gerenia answered him "verily will i follow
 after thee but let us also rouse others again both the son of tydeus
 spearman renowned and odysseus and swift aias and the strong son of
 phyleus but well it would be if one were to go and call those also the
 godlike aias and idomeneus the prince for their ships are furthest of
 all and nowise close at hand but menelaos will i blame dear as he is
 and worshipful yea even if thou be angry with me nor will i hide my
 thought for that he slumbereth and to thee alone hath left the toil
 now should he be toiling among all the chiefs and beseeching them for
 need no longer tolerable is coming upon us"

 and the king of men agamemnon answered him again "old man another
 day i even bid thee blame him for often is he slack and willeth not
 to labour yielding neither to unreadiness nor heedlessness of heart
 but looking toward me and expecting mine instance but now he awoke
 far before me and came to me and him i sent forward to call those
 concerning whom thou inquirest but let us be gone and them shall
 we find before the gates among the sentinels for there i bade them
 gather"

 then knightly nestor of gerenia answered him "so will none of the
 argives be wroth with him or disobey him when soever he doth urge any
 one and give him his commands"

 so spake he and did on his doublet about his breast and beneath his
 bright feet he bound goodly shoon and all around him buckled a purple
 cloak with double folds and wide and thick down all over it

 and he took a strong spear pointed with sharp bronze and he went among
 the ships of the mailclad achaians then odysseus first the peer of
 zeus in counsel did knightly gerenian nestor arouse out of sleep with
 his voice and quickly the cry came all about his heart and he came
 forth from the hut and spake to them saying "wherefore thus among the
 ships and through the camp do ye wander alone in the ambrosial night
 what so great need cometh upon you"

 then knightly nestor of gerenia answered him "laertes' son be not
 wroth for great trouble besetteth the achaians nay follow that we may
 arouse others too even all that it behoveth to take counsel whether we
 should fly or fight"

 so spake he and odysseus of the many counsels came to the hut and cast
 a shield about his shoulders and went after them

 and they went to seek diomedes son of tydeus and him they found
 outside his hut with his arms and around him his comrades were
 sleeping with their shields beneath their heads but their spears were
 driven into the ground erect on the spikes of the butts and afar shone
 the bronze like the lightning of father zeus now that hero was asleep
 and under him was strewn the hide of an ox of the field but beneath his
 head was stretched a shining carpet beside him went and stood knightly
 nestor of gerenia and stirred him with a touch of his foot and aroused
 him chiding him to his face saying "wake son of tydeus why all
 night long dost thou sleep knowest thou not that the trojans on the
 high place of the plain are camped near the ships and but a little
 space holdeth them apart"

 so spake he and diomedes sprang swiftly up out of sleep and spake to
 him winged words "hard art thou old man and from toil thou never
 ceasest now are there not other younger sons of the achaians who might
 rouse when there is need each of the kings going all around the host
 but thou old man art indomitable"

 and him knightly nestor of gerenia answered again "nay verily my son
 all this that thou sayest is according unto right noble sons have i
 and there be many of the host of whom each man might go and call the
 others but a right great need hath assailed the achaians for now to
 all of us it standeth on a razor's edge either pitiful ruin for the
 achaians or life but come now if indeed thou dost pity me rouse
 swift aias and the son of phyleus for thou art younger than i"

 so spake he and diomedes cast round his shoulders the skin of a great
 fiery lion that reached to his feet and he grasped his spear and
 started on his way and roused the others from their place and led them
 on

 now when they had come among the assembled sentinels they found not the
 leaders of the sentinels asleep but they all sat wide awake with their
 arms and even as hounds keep difficult guard round the sheep in a fold
 having heard a hardy wild beast that cometh through the wood among the
 hills and much clamour riseth round him of hounds and men and sleep
 perisheth from them even so sweet sleep did perish from their eyes as
 they watched through the wicked night for ever were they turning toward
 the plains when they heard the trojans moving

 and that old man was glad when he saw them and heartened them with his
 saying and calling out to them he spake winged words "even so now
 dear children do ye keep watch nor let sleep take any man lest we
 become a cause of rejoicing to them that hate us"

 so saying he sped through the moat and they followed with him the
 kings of the argives who had been called to the council and with them
 went meriones and the glorious son of nestor for they called them to
 share their counsel so they went clean out of the delved foss and sat
 down in the open where the midspace was clear of dead men fallen
 where fierce hector had turned again from destroying the argives when
 night covered all there sat they down and declared their saying each
 to the other and to them knightly nestor of gerenia began discourse "o
 friends is there then no man that would trust to his own daring spirit
 to go among the greathearted trojans if perchance he might take some
 straggler of the enemy yea or hear perchance some rumour among the
 trojans and what things they devise among themselves whether they are
 fain to abide there by the ships away from the city or will retreat
 again to the city now that they have conquered the achaians all this
 might such an one learn and back to us come scathless great would be
 his fame under heaven among all men and a goodly gift will be given
 him for all the best men that bear sway by the ships each and all of
 them will give him a black ewe with her lamb at her foot and ever will
 he be present at feasts and clandrinkings"

 so spake he and thereon were they all silent holding their peace but
 to them spake diomedes of the loud warcry "nestor my heart and manful
 spirit urge me to enter the camp of the foemen hard by even of the
 trojans and if some other man will follow with me more comfort and
 more courage will there be if two go together one before another
 perceiveth a matter how there may be gain therein but if one alone
 perceive aught even so his wit is shorter and weak his device"

 so spake he and many were they that wished to follow diomedes the two
 aiantes were willing men of ares' company and meriones was willing
 and right willing the son of nestor and the son of atreus menelaos
 spearman renowned yea and the hardy odysseus was willing to steal into
 the throng of trojans for always daring was his heart within him but
 among them spake the king of men agamemnon "diomedes son of tydeus
 joy of mine heart thy comrade verily shalt thou choose whomsoever thou
 wilt the best of them that be here for many are eager but do not
 thou out of reverent heart leave the better man behind and give
 thyself the worse companion yielding to regard for any and looking to
 their lineage even if one be more kingly born"

 so spake he but was in fear for the sake of fairhaired menelaos but
 to them again answered diomedes of the loud warcry "if indeed ye bid
 me choose myself a comrade how then could i be unmindful of godlike
 odysseus whose heart is passing eager and his spirit so manful in all
 manner of toils and athene loveth him but while he cometh with me
 even out of burning fire might we both return for he excelleth in
 understanding"

 then him again answered the steadfast noble odysseus "son of tydeus
 praise me not overmuch neither blame me aught for thou speakest thus
 among the argives that themselves know all but let us be going for
 truly the night is waning and near is the dawn and the stars have gone
 onward and the night has advanced more than two watches but the third
 watch is yet left"

 so spake they and harnessed them in their dread armour to the son of
 tydeus did thrasymedes steadfast in war give a twoedged sword for his
 own was left by his ship and a shield and about his head set a helm of
 bull's hide without cone or crest that is called a skullcap and
 keeps the heads of stalwart youths and meriones gave odysseus a bow and
 a quiver and a sword and on his head set a helm made of leather and
 with many a thong was it stiffly wrought within while without the white
 teeth of a boar of flashing tusks were arrayed thick set on either side
 well and cunningly and in the midst was fixed a cap of felt

 so when these twain had harnessed them in their dread armour they set
 forth to go and left there all the best of the host and to them did
 pallas athene send forth an omen on the right a heron hard by the way
 and they beheld it not with their eyes through the dark night but they
 heard its shrill cry and odysseus was glad in the omen of the bird and
 prayed to athene "listen to me thou child of aegisbearing zeus that
 ever in all toils dost stand by me nor doth any motion of mine escape
 thee but now again above all be thou friendly to me athene and grant
 that we come back with renown to the ships having wrought a great work
 that shall be sorrow to the trojans"

 next again prayed diomedes of the loud warcry "listen now likewise to
 me thou child of zeus unwearied maiden and follow with me as when
 with my father thou didst follow even noble tydeus into thebes when
 he went forth as a messenger from the achaians even so now stand thou
 by me willingly and protect me and to thee will i sacrifice a yearling
 heifer broad of brow unbroken that never yet hath man led below the
 yoke her will i sacrifice to thee and gild her horns with gold"

 so spake they in their prayer and pallas athene heard them and when
 they had prayed to the daughter of mighty zeus they went forth on their
 way like two lions through the dark night amid the slaughter amid
 the slain men through the arms and the black blood

 nay nor the stouthearted trojans did hector suffer to sleep but he
 called together all the best of them all that were chiefs and leaders
 of the trojans them did he call together and contrived a crafty
 counsel "who is there that would promise and perform for me this deed
 for a great gift yea his reward shall be sufficient for i will give
 him a chariot and two horses of arching neck the best that be at the
 swift ships of the achaians to whosoever shall dare the deed and for
 himself shall win glory and the deed is this to go near the
 swiftfaring ships and seek out whether the swift ships are guarded as
 of old or whether already being subdued beneath our hands the foes
 are devising of flight among themselves and have no care to watch
 through the night being fordone with dread weariness"

 so spake he but they were all silent and held their peace now there
 was among the trojans one dolon the son of eumedes the godlike herald
 and he was rich in gold and rich in bronze and verily he was ill
 favoured to look upon but swift of foot so he spake then a word to the
 trojans and to hector "hector my heart and manful spirit urge me to go
 near the swiftfaring ships and spy out all but come i pray thee
 hold up the staff and swear to me that verily thou wilt give me the
 horses and the chariots bedight with bronze that bear the noble son of
 peleus but to thee i will prove no vain spy nor disappoint thy hope
 for i will go straight to the camp until i may come to the ship of
 agamemnon where surely the chiefs are like to hold council whether to
 fight or flee"

 so spake he and hector took the staff in his hand and sware to him
 "now let zeus himself be witness the loudthundering lord of hera that
 no other man of the trojans shall mount those horses but thou i
 declare shalt rejoice in them for ever"

 so spake he and sware a bootless oath thereto and aroused dolon to go
 and straightway he cast on his shoulders his crooked bow and did on
 thereover the skin of a grey wolf and on his head a helm of
 ferretskin and took a sharp javelin and went on his way to the ships
 from the host but he was not like to come back from the ships and bring
 word to hector

 but when he had left the throng of men and horses he went forth eagerly
 on the way and odysseus of the seed of zeus was ware of him as he
 approached and said unto diomedes "lo here is some man diomedes
 coming from the camp i know not whether as a spy to our ships or to
 strip certain of the dead men fallen but let us suffer him to pass by
 us a little way on the plain and thereafter may we rush on him and take
 him speedily and if it chance that he outrun us by speed of foot ever
 do thou hem him in towards the ships and away from the camp rushing on
 him with thy spear lest in any wise he escape towards the city"

 so they spake and turning out of the path they lay down among the
 bodies of the dead and swiftly dolon ran past them in his witlessness
 but when he was as far off as is the length of the furrow made by mules
 these twain ran after him and he stood still when he heard the sound
 supposing in his heart that they were friends come from among the
 trojans to turn him back at the countermand of hector but when they
 were about a spearcast off or even less he knew them for foemen and
 stirred his swift limbs to fly and speedily they started in pursuit

 and as when two sharptoothed hounds well skilled in the chase press
 ever hard on a doe or a hare through a wooded land and it runs
 screaming before them even so tydeus' son and odysseus the sacker of
 cities cut dolon off from the host and ever pursued hard after him but
 when he was just about to come among the sentinels in his flight
 towards the ships then athene poured strength into the son of tydeus
 that none of the mailclad achaians might boast himself the first to
 smite and he come second and strong diomedes leaped upon him with the
 spear and said "stand or i shall overtake thee with the spear and
 methinks that thou shalt not long avoid sheer destruction at my hand"

 so spake he and threw his spear but of his own will he missed the man
 and passing over his right shoulder the point of the polished spear
 stuck fast in the ground and dolon stood still in great dread and
 trembling and the teeth chattered in his mouth and he was green with
 fear then the twain came up with him panting and gripped his hands
 and weeping he spake "take me alive and i will ransom myself for
 within our house there is bronze and gold and smithied iron wherefrom
 my father would do you grace with ransom untold if he should learn that
 i am alive among the ships of the achaians"

 then odysseus of the many counsels answered him and said "take courage
 let not death be in thy mind but come speak and tell me truly all the
 tale why thus from the host lost thou come all alone among the ships
 through the black night when other mortals are sleeping comest thou to
 strip certain of the dead men fallen or did hector send thee forth to
 spy out everything at the hollow ships or did thine own spirit urge
 thee on"

 then dolon answered him his limbs trembling beneath him "with many a
 blind hope did hector lead my wits astray who vowed to give me the
 wholehooved horses of the proud son of peleus and his car bedight with
 bronze and he bade me fare through the swift black night and draw nigh
 the foemen and seek out whether the swift ships are guarded as of old
 or whether already being subdued beneath our hands they are devising
 of flight among themselves and have no care to watch through the night
 being fordone with dread weariness"

 and smiling thereat did odysseus of the many counsels make him answer
 "verily now thy soul was set on great rewards even the horses of the
 wise son of aiakos but hard are they for mortal men to master and hard
 to drive for any but achilles only whom a deathless mother bare but
 come tell me all this truly all the tale where when thou camest
 hither didst thou leave hector shepherd of the host and where lie his
 warlike gear and where his horses and how are disposed the watches
 and the beds of the other trojans and what counsel take they among
 themselves are they fain to abide there nigh the ships afar from the
 city or will they return to the city again seeing that they have
 subdued unto them the achaiana"

 then dolon son of eumedes made him answer again "lo now all these
 things will i recount to thee most truly hector with them that are
 counsellors holdeth council by the barrow of godlike ilos apart from
 the din but as for the guards whereof thou askest oh hero no chosen
 watch nor guard keepeth the host as for all the watch fires of the
 trojanson them is necessity so that they watch and encourage each
 other to keep guard but for the allies called from many lands they
 are sleeping and to the trojans they leave it to keep watch for no wise
 near dwell the children and wives of the allies" then odysseus of the
 many counsels answered him and said "how stands it now do they sleep
 amidst the horsetaming trojans or apart tell me clearly that i may
 know"

 then answered him dolon son of eumedes "verily all this likewise will i
 recount to thee truly towards the sea lie the karians and paionians of
 the bended bow and the leleges and kaukones and noble pelasgoi and
 towards thymbre the lykians have their place and the haughty mysians
 and the phrygians that fight from chariots and maionians lords of
 chariots but wherefore do ye inquire of me throughly concerning all
 these things for if ye desire to steal into the throng of trojans lo
 there be those thracians new comers at the furthest point apart from
 the rest and among them their king rhesos son of eioneus his be the
 fairest horses that ever i beheld and the greatest whiter than snow
 and for speed like the winds and his chariot is fashioned well with
 gold and silver and golden is his armour that he brought with him
 marvellous a wonder to behold such as it is in no wise fit for mortal
 men to bear but for the deathless gods but bring me now to the swift
 ships or leave me here when ye have bound me with a ruthless bond
 that ye may go and make trial of me whether i have spoken to you truth
 or lies"

 then strong diomedes looking grimly on him said "put no thought of
 escape dolon in thy heart for all the good tidings thou hast brought
 since once thou halt come into our hands for if now we release thee or
 let thee go on some later day wilt thou come to the swift ships of the
 achaians either to play the spy or to fight in open war but if
 subdued beneath my hands thou lose thy life never again wilt thou prove
 a bane to the argives"

 he spake and that other with strong hand was about to touch his chin
 and implore his mercy but diomedes smote him on the midst of the neck
 rushing on him with the sword and cut through both the sinews and the
 head of him still speaking was mingled with the dust and they stripped
 him of the casque of ferret's skin from off his head and of his
 wolfskin and his bended bow and his long spear and these to athene
 the giver of spoil did noble odysseus hold aloft in his hand and he
 prayed and spake a word "rejoice o goddess in these for to thee
 first of all the immortals in olympus will we call for aid nay but yet
 again send us on against the horses and the sleeping places of the
 thracian men"

 so spake he aloud and lifted from him the spoils on high and set them
 on a tamarisk bush and raised thereon a mark right plain to see
 gathering together reeds and luxuriant shoots of tamarisk lest they
 should miss the place as they returned again through the swift dark
 night

 so the twain went forward through the arms and the black blood and
 quickly they came to the company of thracian men now they were
 slumbering fordone with toil but their goodly weapons lay by them on
 the ground all orderly in three rows and by each man his pair of
 steeds and rhesos slept in the midst and beside him his swift horses
 were bound with thongs to the topmost rim of the chariot him odysseus
 spied from afar and showed him unto diomedes "lo diomedes this is
 the man and these are the horses whereof dolon that we slew did give us
 tidings but come now put forth thy great strength it doth not behove
 thee to stand idle with thy weapons nay loose the horses or do thou
 slay the men and of the horses will i take heed"

 so spake he and into that other brighteyed athene breathed might and
 he began slaying on this side and on that and hideously went up their
 groaning as they were smitten with the sword and the earth was
 reddened with blood and like as a lion cometh on flocks without a
 herdsman on goats or sheep and leaps upon them with evil will so set
 the son of tydeus on the men of thrace till he had slain twelve but
 whomsoever the son of tydeus drew near and smote with the sword him did
 odysseus of the many counsels seize by the foot from behind and drag
 him out of the way with this design in his heart that the fairmaned
 horses might lightly issue forth and not tremble in spirit when they
 trod over the dead for they were not yet used to dead men but when the
 son of tydeus came upon the king he was the thirteenth from whom he
 took sweet life away as he was breathing hard for an evil dream stood
 above his head that night through the device of athens meanwhile the
 hardy odysseus loosed the wholehooved horses and bound them together
 with thongs and drave them out of the press smiting them with his bow
 since he had not taken thought to lift the shining whip with his hands
 from the chariot then he whistled for a sign to noble diomedes

 but diomedes stood and pondered what most daring deed he might do
 whether he should take the chariot where lay the armour and drag it
 out by the pole or lift it upon high and so bear it forth or whether
 he should take the life away from yet more of the thracians and while
 he was pondering this in his heart then athene drew near and stood
 and spake to noble diomedes "bethink thee of returning o son of
 greathearted tydeus to the hollow ships lest perchance thou come
 thither in flight and perchance another god rouse up the trojans
 likewise"

 so spake she and he observed the voice of the utterance of the goddess
 and swiftly he sprang upon the steeds and odysseus smote them with his
 bow and they sped to the swift ships of the achaians

 nay nor a vain watch kept apollo of the silver bow when he beheld
 athene caring for the son of tydeus in wrath against her he stole among
 the crowded press of trojans and aroused a counsellor of the thracians
 hippokoon the noble kinsman of rhesos and he started out of sleep
 when he beheld the place desolate where the swift horses had stood and
 beheld the men gasping in the death struggle then he groaned aloud and
 called out by name to his comrade dear and a clamour arose and din
 unspeakable of the trojans hasting together and they marvelled at the
 terrible deeds even all that the heroes had wrought and had gone
 thereafter to the hollow ships

 but when those others came to the place where they had slain the spy of
 hector there odysseus dear to zeus checked the swift horses and
 tydeus' son leaping to the ground set the bloody spoil in the hands of
 odysseus and again mounted and lashed the horses and they sped onward
 nothing loth but nestor first heard the sound and said "o friends
 leaders and counsellors of the argives shall i be wrong or speak sooth
 for my heart bids me speak the sound of swiftfooted horses strikes
 upon mine ears would to god that odysseus and that strong diomedes may
 even instantly be driving the wholehooved horses from among the
 trojans but terribly i fear in mine heart lest the bravest of the
 argives suffer aught through the trojans' battle din"

 not yet was his whole word spoken when they came themselves and leaped
 down to earth but gladly the others welcomed them with handclasping
 and with honeyed words and first did knightly nestor of gerenia make
 question "come tell me now renowned odysseus great glory of the
 achaians how ye twain took those horses was it by stealing into the
 press of trojans or did some god meet you and give you them wondrous
 like are they to rays of the sun ever with the trojans do i mix in
 fight nor methinks do i tarry by the ships old warrior as i am but
 never yet saw i such horses nor deemed of such nay methinks some god
 must have encountered you and given you these for both of you doth zeus
 the cloudgatherer love and the maiden of aegisbearing zeus
 brighteyed athene"

 and him answered odysseus of the many counsels "o nestor son of
 neleus great glory of the achaians lightly could a god if so he
 would give even better steeds than these for the gods are far stronger
 than we but as for these newcome horses whereof old man thou askest
 me they are thracian but their lord did brave diomedes slay and
 beside him all the twelve best men of his company the thirteenth man
 was a spy we took near the ships one that hector and the other haughty
 trojans sent forth to pry upon our camp"

 so spake he and drave the wholehooved horses through the foss
 laughing and the other achaians went with him joyfully but when they
 had come to the wellbuilt hut of the son of tydeus they bound the
 horses with wellcut thongs at the mangers where the swift horses of
 diomedes stood eating honeysweet barley

 and odysseus placed the bloody spoils of dolon in the stern of the ship
 that they might make ready a sacred offering to athene but for
 themselves they went into the sea and washed off the thick sweat from
 shins and neck and thighs but when the wave of the sea had washed the
 thick sweat from their skin and their hearts revived again they went
 into polished baths and were cleansed

 and when they had washed and anointed them with olive oil they sat
 down at supper and from the full mixing bowl they drew off the
 honeysweet wine and poured it forth to athene



 book xi

 despite the glorious deeds of agamemnon the trojans press
 hard on the achaians and the beginning of evil comes on
 patroklos

 now dawn arose from her couch beside proud tithonos to bring light to
 the immortals and to mortal men but zeus sent forth fierce discord unto
 the fleet ships of the achaians and in her hands she held the signal of
 war and she stood upon the huge black ship of odysseus that was in the
 midst to make her voice heard on either side both to the huts of aias
 son of telamon and to the huts of achilles for these twain trusting
 in their valour and the might of their hands had drawn up their trim
 ships at the two ends of the line there stood the goddess and cried
 shrilly in a great voice and terrible and mighty strength she set in
 the heart of each of the achaians to war and fight unceasingly and
 straightway to them war grew sweeter than to depart in the hollow ships
 to their dear native land

 then each man gave in charge his horses to his charioteer to hold them
 in by the foss well and orderly and themselves as heavy men at arms
 were hasting about being harnessed in their gear and unquenchable the
 cry arose into the dawn and long before the charioteers were they
 arrayed at the foss but after them a little way came up the drivers
 and among them the son of kronos aroused an evil din and from above
 rained down dew danked with blood out of the upper air for that he was
 about to send many strong men down to hades

 but the trojans on the other side on the high ground of the plain
 gathered them around great hector and noble polydamus and aineias that
 as a god was honoured by the people of the trojans and the three sons
 of antenor polybos and noble agenor and young akamas like unto the
 immortals and hector in the foremost rank bare the circle of his
 shield and as from amid the clouds appeareth glittering a baneful star
 and then again sinketh within the shadowy clouds even so hector would
 now appear among the foremost ranks and again would be giving command
 in the rear and all in bronze he shone like the lightning of
 aegisbearing father zeus

 and even as when reapers over against each other drive their swaths
 through a rich man's field of wheat or barley and thick fall the
 handfuls even so the trojans and achaians leaped upon each other
 destroying and neither side took thought of ruinous flight and equal
 heads had the battle and they rushed on like wolves and woful discord
 was glad at the sight for she alone of the gods was with them in the
 war for the other gods were not beside them but in peace they sat
 within their halls where the goodly mansion of each was builded in the
 folds of olympus and they all were blaming the son of kronos lord of
 the stormcloud for that he willed to give glory to the trojans but of
 them took the father no heed but aloof from the others he sat apart
 glad in his glory looking toward the city of the trojans and the ships
 of the achaians and the glitter of bronze and the slayers and the
 slain

 so long as morning was and the sacred day still waxed so long did the
 shafts of both hosts strike and the folk fell but about the hour when
 a woodman maketh ready his meal in the dells of a mountain when he
 hath tired his hands with felling tall trees and weariness cometh on
 his soul and desire of sweet food taketh his heart even then the
 danaans by their valour brake the battalions and called on their
 comrades through the lines and in rushed agamemnon first of all where
 thickest clashed the battalions there he set on and with him all the
 wellgreaved achaians footmen kept slaying footmen as they were driven
 in flight and horsemen slaying horsemen with the sword and from
 beneath them rose up the dust from the plain stirred by the thundering
 hooves of horses and the lord agamemnon ever slaying followed after
 calling on the argives and as when ruinous fire falleth on dense
 woodland and the whirling wind beareth it everywhere and the thickets
 fall utterly before it being smitten by the onset of the fire even so
 beneath agamemnon son of atreus fell the heads of the trojans as they
 fled and many strongnecked horses rattled empty cars along the
 highways of the battle lacking their noble charioteers but they on the
 earth were lying far more dear to the vultures than to their wives but
 hector did zeus draw forth from the darts and the dust from the
 manslaying and the blood and the din and the son of atreus followed
 on crying eagerly to the danaans and past the tomb of ancient ilos
 son of dardanos across the mid plain past the place of the wild
 figtree they sped making for the city and ever the son of atreus
 followed shouting and his invincible hands were defiled with gore but
 when they were come to the skaian gates and the oaktree there then
 they halted and awaited each other but some were still in full flight
 through the mid plain like kine that a lion hath scattered coming on
 them in the dead of night all hath he scattered but to one sheer death
 appeareth instantly and he breaketh her neck first seizing her with
 strong teeth and thereafter swalloweth greedily the blood and all the
 guts even so lord agamemnon son of atreus followed hard on the trojans
 ever slaying the hindmost man and they were scattered in flight and on
 face or back many of them fell from their chariots beneath the hands of
 agamemnon for mightily he raged with the spear but when he was
 nowabout coming below the city and the steep wall then did the father
 of men and gods sit him down on the crests of manyfountained ida from
 heaven descending with the thunderbolt in his hands

 then sent he forth iris of the golden wings to bear his word "up and
 go swift iris and tell this word unto hector so long as he sees
 agamemnon shepherd of the host raging among the foremost fighters and
 ruining the ranks of men so long let him hold back but bid the rest of
 the host war with the foe in strong battle but when or smitten with
 the spear or wounded with arrow shot agamemnon leapeth into his
 chariot then will i give hector strength to slay till he come even to
 the welltimbered ships and the sun go down and sacred darkness draw
 on"

 so swiftfooted iris spake to hector the words of zeus and departed but
 hector with his harness leaped from the chariot to the ground and
 shaking his sharp spears went through all the host stirring up his men
 to fight and he roused the dread din of battle and they wheeled round
 and stood and faced the achaians while the argives on the other side
 strengthened their battalions and battle was made ready and they stood
 over against each other and agamemnon first rushed in being eager to
 fight far in front of all

 tell me now ye muses that inhabit mansions in olympus who was he that
 first encountered agamemnon whether of the trojans themselves or of
 their allies renowned it was iphidamas son of antenor great and
 mighty who was nurtured in thrace rich of soil the mother of sheep he
 it was that then encountered agamemnon son of atreus and when they were
 come near in onset against each other atreus' son missed and his spear
 was turned aside but iphidamas smote him on the girdle below the
 corslet and himself pressed on trusting to his heavy hand but pierced
 not the gleaming girdle for long ere that the point struck on the
 silver and was bent like lead then wideruling agamemnon caught the
 spear with his hand and drew it toward him furiously like a lion and
 snatched it out of the hand of iphidamas and smote his neck with the
 sword and unstrung his limbs so even there he fell and slept a sleep
 of bronze most piteously then did agamemnon son of atreus strip him
 and went bearing his goodly harness into the throng of the achaians

 now when koon beheld him koon antenor's eldest son illustrious among
 men strong sorrow came on him covering his eyes for his brother's
 fall and he stood on one side with his spear and unmarked of noble
 agamemnon smote him on the midarm beneath the elbow and clean through
 went the point of the shining spear then agamemnon king of men
 shuddered yet not even so did he cease from battle and war but rushed
 against koon grasping his windnurtured spear verily then koon seized
 right lustily by the foot iphidamas his brother and his father's son
 and called to all the best of his men but him as he dragged the dead
 through the press beneath his bossy shield agamemnon wounded with a
 bronzeshod spear and unstrung his limbs and drew near and cut off his
 head over iphidamas there the sons of antenor at the hands of
 agamemnon the king filled up the measure of their fate and went down
 within the house of hades

 but agamemnon ranged among the ranks of men with spear and sword and
 great stones for throwing while yet the blood welled warm from his
 wound but when the wound waxed dry and the blood ceased to flow then
 keen pangs came on the might of the son of atreus then leaped he into
 his chariot and bade his charioteer drive to the hollow ships for he
 was sore vexed at heart and he called in a piercing voice and shouted
 to the danaans "o friends leaders and counsellors of the argives do
 ye now ward from the seafaring ships the harsh din of battle for zeus
 the counsellor suffers me not all day to war with the trojans"

 so spake he and his charioteer lashed the fairmaned steeds toward the
 hollow ships and they flew onward nothing loth and their breasts were
 covered with foam and their bellies were stained with dust as they
 bore the wounded king away from the war

 but hector when he beheld agamemnon departed cried to the trojans and
 lykians with a loud shout "ye trojans and lykians and dardanians that
 war in close fight be men my friends and be mindful of your impetuous
 valour the best man of them hath departed and to me hath zeus the son
 of kronos given great renown but straightway drive ye the wholehooved
 horses against the mighty danaans that ye may be the masters and bear
 away the higher glory"

 so spake he and aroused the might and spirit of every man himself with
 high thoughts he fared among the foremost and fell upon the fight like
 a roaring blast that leapeth down and stirreth the violetcoloured
 deep there whom first whom last did he slay even hector son of
 priam when zeus vouchsafed him renown

 asaios first and autonoos and opites and dolops son of klytios and
 opheltios and agelaos and aisymnos and oros and hipponoos steadfast
 in the fight these leaders of the danaans he slew and thereafter smote
 the multitude even as when the west wind driveth the clouds of the
 white south wind smiting with deep storm and the wave swelleth huge
 rolling onward and the spray is scattered on high beneath the rush of
 the wandering wind even so many heads of the host were smitten by
 hector

 there had ruin begun and deeds remedeless been wrought and now would
 all the achaians have fled and fallen among the ships if odysseus had
 not called to diomedes son of tydeus "tydeus' son what ails us that
 we forget our impetuous valour nay come hither friend and take thy
 stand by me for verily it will be shame if hector of the glancing helm
 take the ships"

 and to him strong diomedes spake in answer "verily will i abide and
 endure but short will be all our profit for zeus the cloudgatherer
 clearly desireth to give victory to the trojans rather than to us"

 he spake and drave thymbraios from his chariot to the ground smiting
 him with the spear in the left breast and odysseus smote molion the
 godlike squire of that prince these then they let be when they had
 made them cease from war and then the twain fared through the crowd
 with a din as when two boars full of valour fall on the hunting hounds
 so rushed they on again and slew the trojans while gladly the achaians
 took breath again in their flight from noble hector

 but hector quickly spied them among the ranks and rushed upon them
 shouting and with him followed the battalions of the trojans and
 beholding him diomedes of the loud warcry shuddered and straightway
 spake to odysseus that was hard by "lo on us this ruin even mighty
 hector is rolling let us stand and await him and ward off his
 onset"

 so spake he and swayed and sent forth his farshadowing spear and
 smote him nor missed for he aimed at the head on the summit of the
 crest and bronze by bronze was turned nor reached his fair flesh for
 it was stopped by the threefold helm with its socket that phoebus
 apollo to hector gave but hector sprang back a wondrous way and
 mingled with the throng and he rested fallen on his knee and leaned
 on the ground with his stout hand and dark night veiled his eyes

 but while tydeus' son was following after his spearcast far through
 the foremost fighters where he saw it sink into the earth hector gat
 breath again and leaping back into his chariot drave out into the
 throng and avoided black fate then rushing on with his spear mighty
 diomedes spake to him "dog thou art now again escaped from death yet
 came ill very nigh thee but now hath phoebus apollo saved thee to whom
 thou must surely pray when thou goest amid the clash of spears verily i
 will slay thee yet when i meet thee hereafter if any god is helper of
 me too now will i make after the rest whomsoever i may seize"

 so spake he and stripped the son of paeon spearman renowned but
 alexandros the lord of fairtressed helen aimed with his arrows at
 tydeides shepherd of the host leaning as he aimed against a pillar on
 the barrow by men fashioned of ilos son of dardanos an elder of the
 people in time gone by now diomedes was stripping the shining corslet
 of strong agastrophos from about his breast and the shield from his
 shoulders and his strong helmet when paris drew the centre of his bow
 nor vainly did the shaft fly from his hand for he smote the flat of the
 right foot of diomedes and the arrow went clean through and stood
 fixed in the earth and right sweetly laughing paris leaped up from his
 lair and boasted and said "thou art smitten nor vainly hath the dart
 flown forth would that i had smitten thee in the nether belly and
 taken thy life away so should the trojans have breathed again from
 their trouble they that shudder at thee as bleating goats at a lion"

 but him answered strong diomedes no wise dismayed "bowman reviler
 proud in thy bow of horn thou gaper after girls verily if thou madest
 trial in full harness man to man thy bow and showers of shafts would
 nothing avail thee but now thou boastest vainly for that thou hast
 grazed the sole of my foot i care not more than if a woman had struck
 me or a senseless boy for feeble is the dart of a craven man and a
 worthless in other wise from my hand yea if it do but touch the
 sharp shaft flieth and straightway layeth low its man and torn are the
 cheeks of his wife and fatherless his children and he reddening the
 earth with his blood doth rot away more birds than women round him"

 so spake he and odysseus spearman renowned drew near and stood in
 front of him and diomedes sat down behind him and drew the sharp arrow
 from his foot and a sore pang passed through his flesh then sprang he
 into his car and bade his charioteer drive back to the hollow ships
 for he was hurt at heart then odysseus spearman renowned was left
 alone nor did one of the argives abide by him for fear had fallen on
 them all then in heaviness he spoke to his own greathearted spirit
 "ah me what thing shall befall me a great evil it is if i flee in
 dread of the throng yet worse is this if i be taken all alone for the
 other danaans bath kronion scattered in flight but wherefore doth my
 heart thus converse with herself for i know that they are cowards who
 flee the fight but whosoever is a hero in war him it mainly behoves to
 stand stubbornly whether he be smitten or whether he smite another"

 while he pondered thus in heart and spirit the ranks came on of the
 trojans under shield and hemmed him in the midst setting among them
 their own bane and even as when hounds and young men in their bloom
 press round a boar and he cometh forth from his deep lair whetting his
 white tusk between crooked jaws and round him they rush and the sound
 of the gnashing of tusks ariseth and straightway they await his
 assault so dread as he is even so then round odysseus dear to zeus
 rushed the trojans and first he wounded noble deiopites from above in
 the shoulder leaping on him with sharp spear and next he slew thoon
 and ennomos and next chersidamas being leapt down from his chariot he
 smote with the spear on the navel beneath the bossy shield and he fell
 in the dust and clutched the ground with the hollow of his hand these
 left he and wounded charops son of hippasos with the spear the
 brother of highborn sokos and to help him came sokos a godlike man
 and stood hard by him and spake saying "o renowned odysseus
 insatiable of craft and toil today shalt thou either boast over two
 sons of hippasos as having slain two such men of might and stripped
 their harness or smitten by my spear shaft lose thy life"

 so spake he and smote him on the circle of his shield through the
 shining shield passed the strong spear and through the fairdight
 corslet it was thrust and tore clean off the flesh of the flanks but
 pallas athens did not suffer it to mingle with the bowels of the hero
 and odysseus knew that the dart had in nowise lighted on a deadly spot
 and drawing backward he spake unto sokos "ah wretched one verily
 sheer destruction is come upon thee surely thou hast made me to cease
 from warring among the trojans but here to thee i declare that slaying
 and black fate will be upon thee this day and beneath my spear
 overthrown shalt thou give glory to me and thy soul to hades of the
 noble steeds"

 he spake and the other turned and started to flee and in his back as
 he turned he fixed the spear between the shoulders and drave it
 through the breast then he fell with a crash and noble odysseus
 boasted over him "ah sokos son of wisehearted hippasos the tamer of
 horses the end of death hath come upon and caught thee nor hast thou
 avoided ah wretch thy father and lady mother shall not close thine
 eyes in death but birds that eat flesh raw shall tear thee shrouding
 thee in the multitude of their wings but to me if i die the noble
 achaians will yet give due burial"

 so spake he and drew the mighty spear of wisehearted sokos forth from
 his flesh and from his bossy shield and his blood flowed forth when
 the spear was drawn away and afflicted his spirit and the
 greathearted trojans when they beheld the blood of odysseus with
 clamour through the throng came all together against him but he gave
 ground and shouted unto his comrades thrice he shouted then as loud
 as man's mouth might cry and thrice did menelaos dear to zeus hear his
 call and quickly he spake to aias that was hard by him "aias of the
 seed of zeus child of telamon lord of the hosts the shout of odysseus
 of the hardy heart rings round me like as though the trojans were
 oppressing him alone among them and had cut him off in the strong
 battle nay let us speed into the throng for better it is to rescue
 him i fear lest he suffer some evil being alone among the trojans so
 brave as he is and lest great sorrow for his loss come upon the
 danaans"

 so spake he and led the way and the other followed him a godlike man
 then found they odysseus dear to zeus and the trojans beset him like
 tawny jackals from the hills round a wounded horned stag that a man
 hath smitten with an arrow from the bowstring and the stag hath fled
 from him by speed of foot as long as the blood is warm and his limbs
 are strong but when the swift arrow hath overcome him then do the
 ravening jackals rend him in the hills in a dark wood and then god
 leadeth a murderous lion thither and the jackals flee before him but
 he rendeth them so then round wisehearted odysseus of the crafty
 counsels did the trojans gather many and mighty but that hero
 thrusting on with the spear held off the pitiless day then aias drew
 near bearing his shield like a tower and stood thereby and the
 trojans fled from him where each man might then warlike menelaos led
 odysseus out of the press holding him by the hand till the squire
 drave up the horses

 then aias leaped on the trojans and slew doyrklos bastard son of
 priam and thereafter wounded he pandokos and he wounded lysandros and
 pyrasos and pylartes and as when a brimming river cometh down upon the
 plain in winter flood from the hills swollen by the rain of zeus and
 many dry oaks and many pines it sucketh in and much soil it casteth
 into the sea even so renowned aias charged them pursuing through the
 plain slaying horses and men nor wist hector thereof at all for he
 was fighting on the left of all the battle by the banks of the river
 skamandros whereby chiefly fell the heads of men and an unquenchable
 cry arose around great nestor and warlike idomeneus and hector with
 them was warring and terrible things did he with the spear and in
 horsemanship and he ravaged the battalions of the young men nor would
 the noble achaians have yet given ground from the path if alexandros
 the lord of fairtressed helen had not stayed machaon shepherd of the
 host in his valorous deeds and smitten him on the right shoulder with a
 threebarbed arrow therefore were the achaians breathing valour in
 great fear lest men should seize machaon in the turning of the fight

 then idomeneus spake to noble nestor "o nestor son of neleus great
 glory of the achaians arise get thee up into thy chariot and with
 thee let machaon go and swiftly drive to the ships the wholehooved
 horses for a leech is worth many other men to cut out arrows and
 spread soothing medicaments"

 so spake he nor did knightly nestor of gerenia disobey him but
 straightway gat up into his chariot and with him went machaon son of
 asklepios the good leech and he lashed the horses and willingly flew
 they forward to the hollow ships where they desired to be

 but kebriones the charioteer of hector beheld the trojans driven in
 flight and spake to him and said "hector here do we contend with the
 danaans at the limit of the wailful war but lo the other trojans are
 driven in flight confusedly men and horses and aias son of telamon is
 driving them well i know him for wide is the shield round his
 shoulders nay let us too urge thither the horses and chariot there
 where horsemen and footmen thickest in the forefront of evil strife are
 slaying each other and the cry goes up unquenchable"

 so spake he and smote the fairmaned horses with the shrillsounding
 whip and they felt the lash and fleetly bore the swift chariot among
 the trojans and achaians treading on the dead and the shields and
 with blood was sprinkled all the axletree beneath and the rims round
 the car with the drops from the hooves of the horses and with drops
 from the tires about the wheels and hector was eager to enter the press
 of men and to leap in and break through and evil din of battle he
 brought among the danaans and brief space rested he from smiting with
 the spear nay but he ranged among the ranks of other men with spear
 and sword and with great stones but he avoided the battle of aias son
 of telamon

 now father zeus throned in the highest roused dread in aias and he
 stood in amaze and cast behind him his sevenfold shield of bull's hide
 and gazed round in fear upon the throng like a wild beast turning this
 way and that and slowly retreating step by step and as when hounds and
 country folk drive a tawny lion from the midfold of the kine and
 suffer him not to carry away the fattest of the herd all night they
 watch and he in great desire for the flesh maketh his onset but takes
 nothing thereby for thick the darts fly from strong hands against him
 and the burning brands and these he dreads for all his fury and in the
 dawn he departeth with vexed heart even so at that time departed aias
 vexed at heart from among the trojans right unwillingly for he feared
 sore for the ships of the achaians and as when a lazy ass going past a
 field hath the better of the boys with him an ass that hath had many a
 cudgel broken about his sides and he fareth into the deep crop and
 wasteth it while the boys smite him with cudgels and feeble is the
 force of them but yet with might and main they drive him forth when he
 hath had his fill of fodder even so did the highhearted trojans and
 allies called from many lands smite great aias son of telamon with
 darts on the centre of his shield and ever followed after him and aias
 would now be mindful of his impetuous valour and turn again and hold
 at bay the battalions of the horsetaming trojans and once more he
 would turn him again to flee yet he hindered them all from making their
 way to the fleet ships and himself stood and smote between the trojans
 and the achaians and the spears from strong hands stuck some of them in
 his great shield fain to win further and many or ever they reached his
 white body stood fast halfway in the earth right eager to sate
 themselves with his flesh

 so they fought like unto burning fire

 but the mares of neleus all sweating bare nestor out of the battle and
 also carried they machaon shepherd of the host then the noble
 achilles swift of foot beheld and was ware of him for achilles was
 standing by the stern of his great ship watching the dire toil and the
 woful rout of battle and straightway he spake to his own comrade
 patroklos calling to him from beside the ship and he heard and from
 the hut he came like unto ares and this to him was the beginning of
 evil then the strong son of menoitios spake first to achilles "why
 dost thou call me achilles what need hast thou of me"

 then swiftfooted achilles answered him and spake "noble son of
 menoitios dear to my heart now methinks that the achaians will stand
 in prayer about my knees for need no longer tolerable cometh upon them
 but go now patroklos dear to zeus and ask nestor who is this that he
 bringeth wounded from the war verily from behind he is most like
 machaon that child of asklepios but i beheld not the eyes of the man
 for the horses sped past me straining forward eagerly"

 so spake he and patroklos obeyed his dear comrade and started and ran
 past the ships and the huts of the achaians

 now when they came to the hut of the son of neleus they lighted down on
 the bounteous earth and the squire eurymedon loosed the horses of
 that old man from the car and they dried the sweat from their doublets
 standing before the breeze by the shore of the sea and thereafter came
 they to the hut and sat them down on chairs and fairtressed hekamede
 mixed for them a mess hekamede that the old man won from tenedos when
 achilles sacked it and she was the daughter of greathearted arsinoos
 and her the achaians chose out for him because always in counsel he
 excelled them all first she drew before them a fair table polished
 well with feet of cyanus and thereon a vessel of bronze with onion
 for relish to the drink and pale honey and the grain of sacred barley
 and beside it a right goodly cup that the old man brought from home
 embossed with studs of gold and four handles there were to it and
 round each two golden doves were feeding and to the cup were two feet
 below another man could scarce have lifted the cup from the table when
 it was full but nestor the old raised it easily in this cup the woman
 like unto the goddesses mixed a mess for them with pramnian wine and
 therein grated cheese of goats' milk with a grater of bronze and
 scattered white barley thereover and bade them drink whenas she had
 made ready the mess

 so when the twain had drunk and driven away parching thirst they took
 their pleasure in discourse speaking each to the other now patroklos
 stood at the doors a godlike man and when the old man beheld him he
 arose from his shining chair and took him by the hand and led him in
 and bade him be seated but patroklos from over against him was for
 refusing and spake and said "no time to sit have i old man
 fosterling of zeus nor wilt thou persuade me revered and dreaded is he
 that sent me forth to ask thee who this man is that thou bringest home
 wounded nay but i know myself for i see machaon shepherd of the
 host and now will i go back again a messenger to speak a word to
 achilles and well dost thou know old man fosterling of zeus how
 terrible a man he is lightly would he blame even one that is
 blameless"

 then knightly nestor of gerenia answered him again "wherefore is
 achilles thus sorry for the sons of the achaians for as many as are
 wounded with darts he knoweth not at all what grief hath arisen in the
 camp for the best men lie in the ships wounded by shaft or smitten by
 spear wounded with the shaft is strong diomedes son of tydeus and
 smitten is odysseus spearman renowned and agamemnon and this other
 have i but newly carried out of battle wounded with an arrow from the
 bowstring but achilles for all his valiance careth not for the
 danaans nor pities them at all doth he wait till the fleet ships hard
 by the shore shall burn in the consuming fire and till we be slain one
 upon another nay but even now speak thou thus and thus to wisehearted
 achilles if perchance he will obey thee who knows but that god
 helping thou mightst stir his spirit with thy persuading and good is
 the persuasion of a friend but if in his heart he be shunning some
 oracle of god and his lady mother hath told him somewhat from zeus
 natheless let him send forth thee and let the rest of the host of the
 myrmidons follow with thee if perchance any light shall arise from thee
 to the danaans and let him give thee his fair harness to bear into the
 war if perchance the trojans may take thee for him and withhold them
 from the strife and the warlike sons of the achaians might take breath
 being wearied for brief is the breathing time in battle and lightly
 might ye being unwearied drive men wearied in the war unto the city
 away from the ships and the huts"

 so spake he and roused his heart within his breast and he started and
 ran by the ships to achilles of the seed of aiakos



 book xii

 how the trojans and allies broke within the wall of the
 achaians

 so in the huts the strong son of menortios was tending the wounded
 eurypylos but still they fought confusedly the argives and trojans
 nor were the fosse of the danaans and their wide wall above long to
 protect them the wall they had builded for defence of the ships and
 the fosse they had drawn round about for neither had they given goodly
 hecatombs to the gods that it might guard with its bounds their swift
 ships and rich spoil nay maugre the deathless gods was it builded
 wherefore it abode steadfast for no long time while hector yet lived
 and yet achilles kept his wrath and unsacked was the city of priam the
 king so long the great wall of the achaians likewise abode steadfast
 but when all the bravest of the trojans died and many of the
 argivessome were taken and some were leftand the city of priam
 was sacked in the tenth year and the argives had gone back in their
 ships to their own dear country then verily did poseidon and apollo
 take counsel to wash away the wall bringing in the might of the rivers
 of all that flow from the hills of ida to the sea rhesos there was and
 heptaporos and karesos and rhodios grenikos and aisepos and goodly
 skamandros and simoeis whereby many shields and helms fell in the
 dust and the generation of men half divine the mouths of all these
 waters did phoebus apollo turn together and for nine days he drave
 their stream against the wall and still zeus rained unceasingly that
 the quicker he might mingle the wall with the salt sea and the shaker
 of the earth with his trident in his hands was himself the leader and
 sent forth into the waves all the foundations of beams and stones that
 the achaians had laid with toil and made all smooth by the strong
 current of the hellespont and covered again the great beach with sand
 when he had swept away the wall and turned the rivers back to flow in
 their channel where of old they poured down their fair flow of water

 so were poseidon and apollo to do in the aftertime but then war and the
 din of war sounded about the wellbuilded wall and the beams of the
 towers rang beneath the strokes while the argives subdued by the
 scourge of zeus were penned and driven in by the hollow ships in dread
 of hector the mighty maker of flight but he as aforetime fought like
 a whirlwind and as when among hounds and hunting men a boar or lion
 wheeleth him about raging in his strength and these array themselves
 in fashion like a tower and stand up against him casting many javelins
 from their hands but never is his stout heart confused nor afraid and
 his courage is his bane and often he wheeleth him about and maketh
 trial of the ranks of men and wheresoever he maketh onset there the
 ranks of men give way even so hector went and besought his comrades
 through the press and spurred them on to cross the dyke but his
 swiftfooted horses dared not but loud they neighed standing by the
 sheer edge for the wide fosse affrighted them neither easy to leap
 from hard by nor to cross for overhanging banks stood round about it
 all on either hand and above it was furnished with sharp stakes that
 the sons of the achaians had planted there thick set and great a
 bulwark against hostile men thereby not lightly might a horse enter
 drawing a wellwheeled chariot but the footmen were eager if they
 might accomplish it then polydamas drew near valiant hector and spake
 to him "hector and ye other leaders of the trojans and allies
 foolishly do we drive our fleet horses through the dyke nay right hard
 it is to cross for sharp stakes stand in it and over against them the
 wall of the achaians thereby none may go down and fight in chariots
 for strait is the place wherein methinks we might come by a mischief
 for if zeus that thunders on high is utterly to destroy them in his evil
 will and is minded to help the trojans verily then i too would desire
 that even instantly this might be that the achaians should perish here
 nameless far from argos but and if they turn again and we flee back
 from among the ships and rush into the delved ditch then methinks that
 not even one from among us to bear the tidings will win back to the city
 before the force of the achaians when they rally but come as i declare
 let us all obey let our squires hold the horses by the dyke while we
 being harnessed in our gear as foot soldiers follow all together with
 hector and the achaians will not withstand us if indeed the bands of
 death be made fast upon them"

 so spake polydamas and his wise word pleased hector well and
 straightway in his harness he leaped from his chariot to the ground nor
 were the other trojans gathered upon the chariots but they all leaped
 forth when they beheld goodly hector there each gave it into the
 charge of his own charioteer to keep the horses orderly there by the
 fosse and they divided and arrayed themselves and ordered in five
 companies they followed with the leaders

 now they that went with hector and noble polydamas these were most and
 bravest and most were eager to break the wall and fight by the hollow
 ships and with them followed kebriones for the third for hector had
 left another man with his chariot a weaker warrior than kebriones the
 second company paris led and alkathoos and agenor and the third
 company helenos led and godlike deiphobostwo sons of priamthe
 third was the warrior asios asios hyrtakos' son whom his tall sorrel
 steeds brought out of arisbe from the river selleeis and of the fourth
 company was the brave son of anchises leader even aineias and with
 him were two sons of antenor archelochos and akamas both well skilled
 in all warfare

 and sarpedon led the glorious allies and to be with him he chose
 glaukos and warlike asteropaios for they seamed to him to be manifestly
 the bravest of all after himself but he was excellent yea above all
 the host and these when they had arrayed one another with
 wellfashioned shields of bulls' hide went straight and eager against
 the danaans nor deemed that they could longer resist them but that
 themselves should fall on the black ships

 then the rest of the trojans and the farfamed allies obeyed the counsel
 of blameless polydamas but asios son of hyrtakos leader of men
 willed not to leave his horses there and his squire the charioteer but
 with them he drew near the swift ships fond man for never was he
 avoiding evil fates to return rejoicing in his horses and chariot
 back from the ships to windy ilios nay ere that the fate of ill name
 overshadowed him by the spear of idomeneus the haughty son of
 deukalion for asios went against the left flank of the ships whereby
 the achaians returned out of the plain with chariots and horses there
 he drave through his horses and his car nor found he the doors shut on
 the gates and the long bar but men were holding them open if perchance
 they might save any of their comrades fleeing out of the battle towards
 the ships straight thereby held he his horses with unswerving aim and
 his men followed him crying shrilly for they deemed that the achaians
 could no longer hold them off but that themselves would fall on the
 black ships fools for in the gates they found two men of the bravest
 the highhearted sons of the warrior lapithae one the son of
 peirithoos strong polypoites and one leonteus peer of ares the bane
 of men these twain stood in front of the lofty gates like highcrested
 oak trees in the hills that for ever abide the wind and rain firm
 fixed with roots great and long even so these twain trusting to the
 mightiness of their hands abode the coming of great asios and fled
 not but straight came the trojans against the wellbuilded wall
 holding their shields of dry bulls' hide on high with mighty clamour
 round the prince asios and iamenos and orestes and adamas son of
 asios and thoon and oinomaos but the other twain for a while being
 within the wall urged the wellgreaved achaians to fight for the ships
 but when they saw the trojans assailing the wall while the danaans
 cried and turned in flight then forth rushed the twain and fought in
 front of the gates like wild boars that in the mountains abide the
 assailing crew of men and dogs and charging on either flank they
 crush the wood around them cutting it at the root and the clatter of
 their tusks wages loud till one smite them and take their life away so
 clattered the bright bronze on the breasts of the twain as they were
 smitten in close fight for right hardily they fought trusting to the
 host above them and to their own strength

 for the men above were casting with stones from the wellbuilded
 towers in defence of themselves and of the huts and of the
 swiftfaring ships and like snowflakes the stones fell earthward
 flakes that a tempestuous wind as it driveth the dark clouds rains
 thickly down on the bounteous earth so thick fell the missiles from the
 hands of achaians and trojans alike and their helms rang harsh and
 their bossy shields being smitten with mighty stones verily then
 asios son of hyrtakos groaned and smote both his thighs and
 indignantly he spake "zeus verily thou too dost greatly love a lie
 for i deemed not that the achaian heroes could withstand our might and
 our hands invincible but they like wasps of nimble body or bees that
 have made their dwellings in a rugged path and leave not their hollow
 hold but abide and keep the hunters at bay for the sake of their little
 ones even so these men have no will to give ground from the gates
 though they are but two ere they slay or be slain"

 so spake he nor with his speech did he persuade the mind of zeus for
 his will was to give renown to hector

 but the others were fighting about the other gates and hard it were for
 me like a god to tell all these things for everywhere around the wall
 of stone rose the fire divine the argives for all their sorrow
 defending the ships of necessity and all the gods were grieved at
 heart as many as were defenders of the danaans in battle and together
 the lapithae waged war and strife

 there the son of peirithoos mighty polypoites smote damasos with the
 spear through the helmet with cheekpieces of bronze nor did the bronze
 helm stay the spear but the point of bronze brake clean through the
 bone and all the brain within was scattered and the spear overcame him
 in his eagerness thereafter he slew pylon and ormenos and leonteus of
 the stock of ares smote hippomachos son of antimachos with the spear
 striking him on the girdle then again he drew his sharp sword from the
 sheath and smote antiphates first in close fight rushing on him
 through the throng that he fell on his back on the ground and
 thereafter he brought down menon and iamenos and orestes one after the
 other to the bounteous earth

 while they were stripping from these the shining arms the young men who
 followed with polydamas and hector they that were most in number and
 bravest and most were eager to break the wall and set the ships on
 fire these still stood doubtful by the fosse for as they were eager to
 pass over a bird had appeared to them an eagle of lofty flight
 skirting the host on the left hand in its talons it bore a bloodred
 monstrous snake alive and struggling still yea not yet had it
 forgotten the joy of battle but writhed backward and smote the bird
 that held it on the breast beside the neck and the bird cast it from
 him down to the earth in sore pain and dropped it in the midst of the
 throng then with a cry sped away down the gusts of the wind and the
 trojans shuddered when they saw the gleaming snake lying in the midst of
 them an omen of aegisbearing zeus

 then verily polydamas stood by brave hector and spake "hector ever
 dost thou rebuke me in the assemblies though i counsel wisely since it
 by no means beseemeth one of the people to speak contrary to thee in
 council or in war but always to increase thy power but now again will
 i say all that seemeth to me to be best let us not advance and fight
 with the danaans for the ships for even thus methinks the end will
 be if indeed this bird hath come for the trojans when they were eager
 to cross the dyke this eagle of lofty flight skirting the host on
 the left hand bearing in his talons a bloodred monstrous snake yet
 living then straightway left he hold of him before he reached his own
 nest nor brought him home in the end to give to his nestlings even so
 shall we though we burst with mighty force the gates and wall of the
 achaians and the achaians give ground even so we shall return in
 disarray from the ships by the way we came for many of the trojans
 shall we leave behind whom the achaians will slay with the sword in
 defence of the ships even so would a soothsayer interpret that in his
 heart had clear knowledge of omens and whom the people obeyed"

 then hector of the glancing helm lowered on him and said "polydamas
 that thou speakest is no longer pleasing to me yea thou knowest how to
 conceive another counsel better than this but if thou verily speakest
 thus in earnest then the gods themselves have utterly destroyed thy
 wits thou that bidst us forget the counsels of loudthundering zeus
 that himself promised me and confirmed with a nod of his head but thou
 bidst us be obedient to birds long of wing whereto i give no heed nor
 take any care thereof whether they fare to the right to the dawn and
 to the sun or to the left to mist and darkness nay for us let us
 trust to the counsel of mighty zeus who is king over all mortals and
 immortals one omen is best to fight for our own country and wherefore
 dost thou fear war and battle for if all the rest of us be slain by the
 ships of the argives yet needst thou not fear to perish for thy heart
 is not warlike nor enduring in battle but if thou dost hold aloof from
 the fight or winnest any other with thy words to turn him from war
 straightway by my spear shalt thou be smitten and lose thy life"

 so spake he and led on and they followed with a wondrous din and zeus
 that joyeth in the thunder roused from the hills of ida a blast of
 wind which bare the dust straight against the ships and he made weak
 the heart of the achaians but gave renown to the trojans and to hector
 trusting then in his omens and their might they strove to break the
 great wall of the achaians they dragged down the machicolations
 projecting galleries of the towers and overthrew the battlements and
 heaved up the projecting buttresses that the achaians set first in the
 earth to be the props of the towers these they overthrew and hoped to
 break the wall of the achaians nor even now did the danaans give ground
 from the path but closed up the battlements with shields of bulls'
 hides and cast from them at the foemen as they went below the walls

 now the two aiantes went everywhere on the towers ever urging and
 arousing the courage of the achaians one they would accost with honeyed
 words another with hard words they would rebuke whomsoever they saw
 utterly giving ground from the fight "o friends whosoever is eminent
 or whosoever is of middle station among the argives ay or lower yet
 for in no wise are all men equal in war now is there work for all and
 this yourselves well know let none turn back to the ships for that he
 hath heard one threatening aloud nay get ye forward and cheer another
 on if perchance olympian zeus the lord of lightning will grant us to
 drive back the assault and push the foe to the city"

 so these twain shouted in the front and aroused the battle of the
 achaians but as flakes of snow fall thick on a winter day when zeus
 the counsellor bath begun to snow showing forth these arrows of his
 to men and he hath lulled the winds and he snoweth continually till
 he hath covered the crests of the high hills and the uttermost
 headlands and the grassy plains and rich tillage of men and the snow
 is scattered over the havens and shores of the grey sea and only the
 wave as it rolleth in keeps off the snow but all other things are
 swathed over when the shower of zeus cometh heavily so from both sides
 their stones flew thick some towards the trojans and some from the
 trojans against the achaians while both sides were smitten and over
 all the wall the din arose

 yet never would the trojans then and renowned hector have broken the
 gates of the wall and the long bar if zeus the counsellor had not
 roused his son sarpedon against the argives like a lion against the
 kine of crooked horn straightway he held forth his fair round shield
 of hammered bronze that the bronzesmith had hammered out and within
 had stitched many bulls' hides with rivets of gold all round the
 circle this held he forth and shook two spears and sped on his way
 like a mountainnurtured lion that long lacketh meat and his brave
 spirit urgeth him to make assail on the sheep and come even against a
 wellbuilded homestead nay even if he find herdsmen thereby guarding
 the sheep with hounds and spears yet hath he no mind to be driven
 without an effort from the steading but he either leapeth on a sheep
 and seizeth it or himself is smitten in the foremost place with a dart
 from a strong hand so did his heart then urge on the godlike sarpedon
 to rush against the wall and break through the battlements and
 instantly he spake to glaukos son of hippolochos "glaukos wherefore
 have we twain the chiefest honourseats of honour and messes and
 full cups in lykia and all men look on us as gods and wherefore hold
 we a great demesne by the banks of xanthos a fair demesne of orchardland
 and wheatbearing tilth therefore now it behoveth us to take our
 stand in the first rank of the lykians and encounter fiery battle
 that certain of the wellcorsleted lykians may say 'verily our kings
 that rule lykia be no inglorious men they that eat fat sheep and drink
 the choice wine honeysweet nay but they are also of excellent might
 for they war in the foremost ranks of the lykians' ah friend if once
 escaped from this battle we were for ever to be ageless and immortal
 neither would i fight myself in the foremost ranks nor would i send
 thee into the war that giveth men renown but nowfor assuredly ten
 thousand fates of death do every way beset us and these no mortal may
 escape nor avoidnow let us go forward whether we shall give glory to
 other men or others to us"

 so spake he and glaukos turned not apart nor disobeyed him and they
 twain went straight forward leading the great host of the lykians

 then menestheus son of peteos shuddered when he beheld them for against
 his tower they went bringing with them ruin and he looked along the
 tower of the achaians if perchance he might see any of the leaders
 that would ward off destruction from his comrades and he beheld the two
 aiantes insatiate of war standing there and teukros hard by newly
 come from his hut but he could not cry to be heard of them so great
 was the din and the noise went up unto heaven of smitten shields and
 helms with horsehair crests and of the gates for they had all been
 shut and the trojans stood beside them and strove by force to break
 them and enter in swiftly then to aias he sent the herald thootes
 "go noble thootes and run and call aias or rather the twain for
 that will be far the best of all since quickly here will there be
 wrought utter ruin for hereby press the leaders of the lykians who of
 old are fierce in strong battle but if beside them too war and toil
 arise yet at least let the strong telamonian aias come alone and let
 teukros the skilled bowman follow with him"

 so spake he and the herald listened and disobeyed him not but started
 and ran by the wall of the mailclad achaians and came and stood by
 the aiantes and straightway spake "ye twain aiantes leaders of the
 mailclad achaians the dear son of peteos fosterling of zeus biddeth
 you go thither that if it be but for a little while ye may take your
 part in battle both of you he more desireth for that will be far the
 best of all since quickly there will there be wrought utter ruin for
 thereby press the leaders of the lykians who of old are fierce in
 strong battle but if beside you too war and toil arise yet at least
 let the strong telamonian aias come alone and let teukros the skilled
 bowman follow with him"

 so spake he nor did the strong telamonian aias disobey but instantly
 spake winged words to the son of oileus "aias do ye twain stand here
 thyself and strong lykomedes and urge the danaans to war with all their
 might but i go thither to take my part in battle and quickly will i
 come again when i have well aided them"

 so spake telamonian aias and departed and teukros went with him his
 brother by the same father and with them pandion bare the bended bow
 of teukros

 now when they came to the tower of greathearted menestheus passing
 within the walland to men sore pressed they camethe foe were
 climbing upon the battlements like a dark whirlwind even the strong
 leaders and counsellors of the lykians and they hurled together into
 the war and the battlecry arose now first did aias telamon's son slay
 a man epikles great of heart the comrade of sarpedon with a jagged
 stone he smote him a great stone that lay uppermost within the wall by
 the battlements not lightly could a man hold it in both hands however
 strong in his youth of such mortals as now are but aias lifted it and
 cast it from above and shattered the helm of fourfold crest and broke
 the bones of the head and he fell like a diver from the lofty tower
 and his life left his bones and teukros smote glaukos the strong son
 of hippolochos as he came on with an arrow from the lofty wall even
 where he saw his shoulder bare he smote him and made him cease from
 delight in battle back from the wall he leapt secretly lest any of the
 achaians should see him smitten and speak boastfully but sorrow came
 on sarpedon when glaukos departed so soon as he was aware thereof but
 he forgot not the joy of battle he aimed at alkmaon son of thestor
 with the spear and smote him and drew out the spear and alkmaon
 following the spear fell prone and his bronzedight arms rang round
 him then sarpedon seized with strong hands the battlement and dragged
 and it all gave way together while above the wall was stripped bare
 and made a path for many

 then aias and teukros did encounter him teukros smote him with an
 arrow on the bright baldric of his covering shield about the breast
 but zeus warded off the fates from his son that he should not be
 overcome beside the ships' sterns then aias leaped on and smote his
 shield nor did the spear pass clean through yet shook he sarpedon in
 his eagerness he gave ground a little way from the battlement yet
 retreated not wholly since his heart hoped to win renown then he
 turned and cried to the godlike lykians "o lykians wherefore thus are
 ye slack in impetuous valour hard it is for me stalwart as i am alone
 to break through and make a path to the ships nay follow hard after
 me for the more men the better work"

 so spake he and they dreading the rebuke of their king pressed on the
 harder around the counsellor and king and the argives on the other side
 made strong their battalions within the wall and mighty toil began for
 them for neither could the strong lykians burst through the wall of
 the danaans and make a way to the ships nor could the warlike danaans
 drive back the lykians from the wall when once they had drawn near
 thereto but as two men contend about the marches of their land with
 measuring rods in their hands in a common field when in narrow space
 they strive for equal shares even so the battlements divided them and
 over those they smote the round shields of ox hide about the breasts of
 either side and the fluttering bucklers and many were wounded in the
 flesh with the ruthless bronze whensoever the back of any of the
 warriors was laid bare as he turned ay and many clean through the very
 shield yea everywhere the towers and battlements swam with the blood
 of men shed on either side by trojans and achaians but even so they
 could not put the argives to rout but they held their ground as an
 honest woman that laboureth with her hands holds the balance and raises
 the weight and the wool together balancing them that she may win scant
 wages for her children so evenly was strained their war and battle
 till the moment when zeus gave the greater renown to hector son of
 priam who was the first to leap within the wall of the achaians in a
 piercing voice he cried aloud to the trojans "rise ye horsetaming
 trojans break the wall of the argives and cast among the ships fierce
 blazing fire"

 so spake he spurring them on and they all heard him with their ears
 and in one mass rushed straight against the wall and with sharp spears
 in their hands climbed upon the machicolations of the towers and
 hector seized and carried a stone that lay in front of the gates thick
 in the hinder part but sharp at point a stone that not the two best
 men of the people such as mortals now are could lightly lift from the
 ground on to a wain but easily he wielded it alone for the son of
 crookedcounselling kronos made it light for him and as when a shepherd
 lightly beareth the fleece of a ram taking it in one hand and little
 doth it burden him so hector lifted the stone and bare it straight
 against the doors that closely guarded the stubbornset portals double
 gates and tall and two cross bars held them within and one bolt
 fastened them and he came and stood hard by and firmly planted
 himself and smote them in the midst setting his legs well apart that
 his cast might lack no strength and he brake both the hinges and the
 stone fell within by reason of its weight and the gates rang loud
 around and the bars held not and the doors burst this way and that
 beneath the rush of the stone then glorious hector leaped in with face
 like the sudden night shining in wondrous mail that was clad about his
 body and with two spears in his hands no man that met him could have
 held him back when once he leaped within the gates none but the gods
 and his eyes shone with fire turning towards the throng he cried to the
 trojans to overleap the wall and they obeyed his summons and speedily
 some overleaped the wall and some poured into the fairwrought
 gateways and the danaans fled in fear among the hollow ships and a
 ceaseless clamour arose



 book xiii

 poseidon stirreth up the achaians to defend the ships
 the valour of idomeneus

 now zeus after that he had brought the trojans and hector to the ships
 left them to their toil and endless labour there but otherwhere again
 he turned his shining eyes and looked upon the land of the thracian
 horsebreeders and the mysians fierce fighters hand to hand and the
 proud hippemolgoi that drink mare's milk and the abioi the most
 righteous of men to troy no more at all he turned his shining eyes for
 he deemed in his heart that not one of the immortals would draw near to
 help either trojans or danaans

 but the mighty earthshaker held no blind watch who sat and marvelled on
 the war and strife high on the topmost crest of wooded samothrace for
 thence all ida was plain to see and plain to see were the city of
 priam and the ships of the achaians thither did he go from the sea and
 sate him down and he had pity on the achaians that they were subdued
 to the trojans and strong was his anger against zeus

 then forthwith he went down from the rugged hill faring with swift
 steps and the high hills trembled and the woodland beneath the
 immortal footsteps of poseidon as he moved three strides he made and
 with the fourth he reached his goal even aigae and there was his
 famous palace in the deeps of the mere his glistering golden mansions
 builded imperishable for ever thither went he and let harness to the
 car his bronzehooved horses swift of flight clothed with their golden
 manes he girt his own golden array about his body and seized the
 wellwrought lash of gold and mounted his chariot and forth he drove
 across the waves and the sea beasts frolicked beneath him on all
 sides out of the deeps for well they knew their lord and with gladness
 the sea stood asunder and swiftly they sped and the axle of bronze was
 not wetted beneath and the bounding steeds bare him on to the ships
 of the achaians

 now there is a spacious cave in the depths of the deep mere between
 tenedos and rugged imbros there did poseidon the shaker of the earth
 stay his horses and loosed them out of the chariot and cast before
 them ambrosial food to graze withal and golden tethers he bound about
 their hooves tethers neither to be broken nor loosed that there the
 horses might continually await their lord's return and he went to the
 host of the achaians

 now the trojans like flame or stormwind were following in close array
 with fierce intent after hector son of priam with shouts and cries
 they came and thought to take the ships of the achaians and to slay
 thereby all the bravest of the host but poseidon that girdleth the
 world the shaker of the earth was urging on the argives and forth he
 came from the deep salt sea in form and untiring voice like unto
 kalchas first he spake to the two aiantes that themselves were eager
 for battle "ye aiantes twain ye shall save the people of the achaians
 if ye are mindful of your might and reckless of chill fear for verily
 i do not otherwhere dread the invincible hands of the trojans that have
 climbed the great wall in their multitude nay the wellgreaved
 achaians will hold them all at bay but hereby verily do i greatly dread
 lest some evil befall us even here where that furious one is leading
 like a flame of fire hector who boasts him to be son of mighty zeus
 nay but here may some god put it into the hearts of you twain to stand
 sturdily yourselves and urge others to do the like thereby might ye
 drive him from the fleetfaring ships despite his eagerness yea even
 if the olympian himself is rousing him to war"

 therewith the shaker of the world the girdler of the earth struck the
 twain with his staff and filled them with strong courage and their
 limbs he made light and their feet and their hands withal then even
 as a swiftwinged hawk speeds forth to fly poised high above a tall
 sheer rock and swoops to chase some other bird across the plain even
 so poseidon sped from them the shaker of the world and of the twain
 oileus' son the swiftfooted aias was the first to know the god and
 instantly he spake to aias son of telamon "aias since it is one of
 the gods who hold olympus that in the semblance of a seer commands us
 now to fight beside the shipsnot kalchas is he the prophet and
 soothsayer for easily i knew the tokens of his feet and knees as he
 turned away and the gods are easy to discernlo then mine own heart
 within my breast is more eagerly set on war and battle and my feet
 beneath and my hands above are lusting for the fight"

 then aias son of telamon answered him saying "even so too my hands
 invincible now rage about the spearshaft and wrath has risen within
 me and both my feet are swift beneath me yea i am keen to meet even
 in single fight the ceaseless rage of hector son of priam"

 so they spake to each other rejoicing in the delight of battle which
 the god put in their heart then the girdler of the earth stirred up the
 achaians that were in the rear and were renewing their strength beside
 the swift ships their limbs were loosened by their grievous toil yea
 and their souls filled with sorrow at the sight of the trojans that had
 climbed over the great wall in their multitude and they looked on them
 and shed tears beneath their brows thinking that never would they
 escape destruction but the shaker of the earth right easily came among
 them and urged on the strong battalions of warriors teukros first he
 came and summoned and leitos and the hero peneleos and thoas and
 deipyros and meriones and antilochos lords of the warcry all these
 he spurred on with winged words "shame on you argives shame ye
 striplings in your battle had i trusted for the salvation of our ships
 but if you are to withdraw from grievous war now indeed the day doth
 shine that shall see us conquered by the trojans out on it for verily
 a great marvel is this that mine eyes behold a terrible thing that
 methought should never come to pass the trojans advancing against our
 ships of yore they were like fleeting hinds that in the wild wood are
 the prey of jackals and pards and wolves and wander helpless
 strengthless empty of the joy of battle even so the trojans of old
 cared never to wait and face the wrath and the hands of the achaians
 not for a moment but now they are fighting far from the town by the
 hollow ships all through the baseness of our leader and the remissness
 of the people who being at strife with the chief have no heart to
 defend the swiftfaring ships nay thereby they are slain but if
 indeed and in truth the hero agamemnon the wideruling son of atreus
 is the very cause of all for that he did dishonour the swiftfooted son
 of peleus not even so may we refrain in any wise from war nay let us
 right our fault with speed for easily righted are the hearts of the
 brave no longer do ye well to refrain from impetuous might all ye that
 are the best men of the host i myself would not quarrel with one that
 being a weakling abstained from war but with you i am heartily wroth
 ah friends soon shall ye make the mischief more through this
 remissnessbut let each man conceive shame in his heart and
 indignation for verily great is the strife that hath arisen lo the
 mighty hector of the loud warcry is fighting at the ships and the
 gates and the long bar he hath burst in sunder"

 on this wise did the earthenfolder call to and spur on the achaians
 and straightway they made a stand around the two aiantes strong bands
 that ares himself could not enter and make light of nor athene that
 marshals the host yea they were the chosen best that abode the trojans
 and goodly hector and spear on spear made closeset fence and shield
 on serried shield buckler pressed on buckler and helm on helm and man
 on man the horsehair crests on the bright helmetridges touched each
 other as they nodded so close they stood each by other and spears
 brandished in bold hands were interlaced and their hearts were
 steadfast and lusted for battle

 then the trojans drave forward in close array and hector led them
 pressing straight onwards like a rolling rock from a cliff that the
 winterswollen water thrusteth from the crest of a hill having broken
 the foundations of the stubborn rock with its wondrous flood leaping
 aloft it flies and the wood echoes under it and unstayed it runs its
 course till it reaches the level plain and then it rolls no more for
 all its eagernesseven so hector for a while threatened lightly to
 win to the sea through the huts and the ships of the achaians slaying
 as he came but when he encountered the serried battalions he was
 stayed when he drew near against them but they of the other part the
 sons of the achaians thrust with their swords and doublepointed
 spears and drave him forth from them that he gave ground and reeled
 backward then he cried with a piercing voice calling on the trojans
 "trojans and lykians and closefighting dardanians hold your ground
 for the achaians will not long ward me off nay though they have
 arrayed themselves in fashion like a tower rather methinks they will
 flee back before the spear if verily the chief of gods has set me on
 the loudthundering lord of hera"

 therewith he spurred on the heart and spirit of each man and deiphobos
 the son of priam strode among them with high thoughts and held in
 front of him the circle of his shield and lightly he stepped with his
 feet advancing beneath the cover of his shield then meriones aimed at
 him with a shining spear and struck and missed not but smote the
 circle of the bullshide shield yet no whit did he pierce it nay
 well ere that might be the long spearshaft snapped in the socket now
 deiphobos was holding off from him the bullshide shield and his heart
 feared the lance of wise meriones but that hero shrunk back among the
 throng of his comrades greatly in wrath both for the loss of victory
 and of his spear that he had shivered so he set forth to go to the
 huts and the ships of the achaians to bring a long spear that he had
 left in his hut

 meanwhile the others were fighting on and there arose an
 inextinguishable cry first teukros son of telamon slew a man the
 spearman imbrios the son of mentor rich in horses in pedaion he dwelt
 before the coming of the sons of the achaians and he had for wife a
 daughter of priam born out of wedlock medesikaste but when the curved
 ships of the danaans came he returned again to ilios and was
 preeminent among the trojans and dwelt with priam who honoured him
 like his own children him the son of telemon pierced below the ear with
 his long lance and plucked back the spear then he fell like an ash
 that on the crest of a farseen hill is smitten with the axe of bronze
 and brings its delicate foliage to the ground even so he fell and
 round him rang his armour bedight with bronze then teukros rushed
 forth most eager to strip his armour and hector cast at him as he came
 with his shining spear but teukros steadily regarding him avoided by
 a little the spear of bronze so hector struck amphimachos son of
 kteatos son of aktor in the breast with the spear as he was returning
 to the battle with a crash he fell and his armour rang upon him

 then hector sped forth to tear from the head of greathearted
 amphimachos the helmet closely fitted to his temples but aias aimed at
 hector as he came with a shining spear yet in no wise touched his
 body for he was all clad in dread armour of bronze but he smote the
 boss of his shield and drave him back by main force and he gave place
 from behind the two dead men and the achaians drew them out of the
 battle so stichios and goodly menestheus leaders of the athenians
 conveyed amphimachos back among the host of the achaians but imbrios
 the two aiantes carried with hearts full of impetuous might and as
 when two lions have snatched away a goat from sharptoothed hounds and
 carry it through the deep thicket holding the body on high above the
 ground in their jaws so the two warrior aiantes held imbrios aloft and
 spoiled his arms then the son of oileus cut his head from his delicate
 neck in wrath for the sake of amphimachos and sent it rolling like a
 ball through the throng and it dropped in the dust before the feet of
 hector

 then verily was poseidon wroth at heart when his son's son fell in the
 terrible fray kteatos father of amphimachos was poseidon's son so
 he set forth to go by the huts and the ships of the achaians to spur on
 the danaans and sorrows he was contriving for the trojans then
 idomeneus spearman renowned met him on his way from his comrade that
 had but newly returned to him out of the battle wounded on the knee
 with the sharp bronze him his comrades carried forth and idomeneus
 gave charge to the leeches and so went on to his hut for he still was
 eager to face the war then the mighty shaker of the earth addressed
 him in the voice of thoas son of andraimon that ruled over the
 aitolians in all pleuron and mountainous kalydon and was honoured like
 a god by the people "idomeneus thou counsellor of the cretans say
 whither have thy threats fared wherewith the sons of the achaians
 threatened the trojans"

 then idomeneus leader of the cretans answered him again "o thaos now
 is there no man to blame that i wot of for we all are skilled in war
 neither is there any man that spiritless fear holds aloof nor any that
 gives place to cowardice and shuns the cruel war nay but even thus
 methinks must it have seemed good to almighty kronion even that the
 achaians should perish nameless here far away from argos but thoas
 seeing that of old thou wert staunch and dost spur on some other man
 wheresoever thou mayst see any give ground therefore slacken not now
 but call aloud to every warrior"

 then poseidon the shaker of the earth answered him again "idomeneus
 never may that man go forth out of troyland but here may he be the
 sport of dogs who this day wilfully is slack in battle nay come take
 thy weapons and away herein we must play the man together if any avail
 there may be though we are no more than two ay and very cowards get
 courage from company but we twain know well how to battle even with the
 brave"

 therewith the god went back again into the strife of men but idomeneus
 so soon as he came to his wellbuilded hut did on his fair armour about
 his body and grasped two spears and set forth like the lightning that
 kronion seizes in his hand and brandishes from radiant olympus showing
 forth a sign to mortal men and far seen are the flames thereof even so
 shone the bronze about the breast of idomeneus as he ran and meriones
 his good squire met him while he was still near his huthe was going
 to bring his spear of bronzeand mighty idomeneus spake to him
 "meriones son of molos fleet of foot dearest of my company wherefore
 hast thou come hither and left the war and strife art thou wounded at
 all and vexed by a dart's point or dost thou come with a message for
 me concerning aught verily i myself have no desire to sit in the huts
 but to fight"

 then wise meriones answered him again saying "i have come to fetch a
 spear if perchance thou hast one left in the huts for that which
 before i carried i have shivered in casting at the shield of proud
 deiphobos"

 then idomeneus leader of the cretans answered him again "spears if
 thou wilt thou shalt find one ay and twenty standing in the hut
 against the shining side walls spears of the trojans whereof i have
 spoiled their slain yea it is not my mood to stand and fight with
 foemen from afar wherefore i have spears and bossy shields and helms
 and corslets of splendid sheen"

 then wise meriones answered him again "yea and in mine own hut and my
 black ship are many spoils of the trojans but not ready to my hand
 nay for methinks that neither am i forgetful of valour but stand forth
 among the foremost to face the glorious war whensoever ariseth the
 strife of battle any other methinks of the mailclad achaians should
 sooner forget my prowess but thou art he that knoweth it"

 then idomeneus leader of the cretans answered him again "i know what
 a man of valour thou art wherefore shouldst thou tell me thereof nay
 if now beside the ships all the best of us were being chosen for an
 ambushwherein the valour of men is best discerned there the coward
 and the brave man most plainly declare themselves for the colour of the
 coward changes often and his spirit cannot abide firm within him but
 now he kneels on one knee now on the other and rests on either foot
 and his heart beats noisily in his breast as he thinks of doom and his
 teeth chatter loudly but the colour of the brave man does not change
 nor is he greatly afraid from the moment that he enters the ambush of
 heroes but his prayer is to mingle instantly in woeful war were we
 being chosen for such an ambush i say not even then would any man
 reckon lightly of thy courage and thy strength nay and even if thou
 wert stricken in battle from afar or smitten in close fight the dart
 would not strike thee in the hinder part of the neck nor in the back
 but would encounter thy breast or belly as thou dost press on towards
 the gathering of the foremost fighters but come no more let us talk
 thus like children loitering here lest any man be vehemently wroth
 but go thou to the hut and bring the strong spear"

 thus he spake and meriones the peer of swift ares quickly bare the
 spear of bronze from the hut and went after idomeneus with high
 thoughts of battle and even as ares the bane of men goes forth into
 the war and with him follows his dear son panic stark and fearless
 that terrifies even the hardy warrior and these twain leave thrace and
 harness them for fight with the ephyri or the greathearted phlegyans
 yet hearken not to both peoples but give honour to one only like these
 gods did meriones and idomeneus leaders of men set forth into the
 fight harnessed in gleaming bronze and meriones spake first to
 idomeneus saying "child of deukalion whither art thou eager to enter
 into the throng on the right of all the host or in the centre or on
 the left ay and no other where methinks are the flowinghaired
 achaians so like to fail in fight"

 then idomeneus the leader of the cretans answered him again "in the
 centre of the ships there are others to bear the brunt the two aiantes
 and teukros the best bowman of the achaians ay and a good man in
 close fight these will give hector priam's son toil enough howsoever
 keen he be for battle yea though he be exceeding stalwart hard will
 he find it with all his lust for war to overcome their strength and
 their hands invincible and to fire the ships unless kronion himself
 send down on the swift ships a burning brand but not to a man would he
 yield the great telamonian aias to a man that is mortal and eateth
 demeter's grain and may be chosen with the sword of bronze and with
 hurling of great stones nay not even to achilles the breaker of the
 ranks of men would he give way not in close fight but for speed of
 foot none may in any wise strive with achilles but guide us twain as
 thou sayest to the left hand of the host that speedily we may learn
 whether we are to win glory from others or other men from us"

 so he spake and meriones the peer of swift ares led the way till
 they came to the host in that place whither he bade him go

 and when the trojans saw idomeneus strong as flame and his squire with
 him and their glorious armour they all shouted and made for him
 through the press then their mellay began by the sterns of the ships
 and as the gusts speed on when shrill winds blow on a day when dust
 lies thickest on the roads and the winds raise together a great cloud
 of dust even so their battle clashed together and all were fain of
 heart to slay each other in the press with the keen bronze and the
 battle the bane of men bristled with the long spears the piercing
 spears they grasped and the glitter of bronze from gleaming helmets
 dazzled the eyes and the sheen of newburnished corslets and shining
 shields as the men thronged all together right hardy of heart would he
 have been that joyed and sorrowed not at the sight of this labour of
 battle

 thus the two mighty sons of kronos with contending will were
 contriving sorrow and anguish for the heroes zeus desired victory for
 the trojans and hector giving glory to swiftfooted achilles yet he
 did not wish the achaian host to perish utterly before ilios but only
 to give renown to thetis and her stronghearted son but poseidon went
 among the argives and stirred them to war stealing secretly forth from
 the grey salt sea for he was sore vexed that they were overcome by
 the trojans and was greatly in wrath against zeus verily both were of
 the same lineage and the same place of birth but zeus was the elder and
 the wiser therefore also poseidon avoided to give open aid but
 secretly ever he spurred them on throughout the host in the likeness
 of a man these twain had strained the ends of the cords of strong
 strife and equal war and had stretched them over both trojans and
 achaians a knot that none might break nor undo for the loosening of
 the knees of many

 even then idomeneus though his hair was flecked with grey called on
 the danaans and leaping among the trojans roused their terror for he
 slew othryoneus of kabesos a sojourner there who but lately had
 followed after the rumour of war and asked in marriage the fairest of
 the daughters of priam kassandra without gifts of wooing but with
 promise of mighty deed namely that he would drive perforce out of
 troyland the sons of the achaians to him the old man priam had
 promised and appointed that he would give her so he fought trusting in
 his promises and idomeneus aimed at him with a bright spear and cast
 and smote him as he came proudly striding on and the corslet of bronze
 that he wore availed not but the lance struck in the midst of his
 belly and he fell with a crash and idomeneus boasted over him and
 lifted up his voice saying "othryoneus verily i praise thee above all
 mortal men if indeed thou shalt accomplish all that thou hast promised
 priam son of dardanos that promised thee again his own daughter yea
 and we likewise would promise as much to thee and fulfil it and would
 give thee the fairest daughter of the son of atreus and bring her from
 argos and wed her to thee if only thou wilt aid us to take the
 fairset citadel of ilios nay follow us that we may make a covenant of
 marriage by the seafaring ships for we are no hard exacters of gifts of
 wooing"

 therewith the hero idomeneus dragged him by the foot across the fierce
 mellay but asios came to his aid on foot before his horses that the
 charioteer guided so that still their breath touched the shoulders of
 asios and the desire of his heart was to cast at idomeneus who was
 beforehand with him and smote him with the spear in the throat below
 the chin and drove the point straight through and he fell as an oak
 falls or a poplar or tall pine tree that craftsmen have felled on the
 hills with new whetted axes to be a ship's timber even so he lay
 stretched out before the horses and the chariot groaning and clutching
 the bloody dust and the charioteer was amazed and kept not his wits
 as of old and dared not turn his horses and avoid out of the hands of
 foemen and antilochos the steadfast in war smote him and pierced the
 middle of his body with a spear nothing availed the corslet of bronze
 he was wont to wear but he planted the spear fast in the midst of his
 belly therewith he fell gasping from the wellwrought chariot and
 antilochos the son of greathearted nestor drave the horses out from
 the trojans among the wellgreaved achaians then deiphobos in sorrow
 for asios drew very nigh idomeneus and cast at him with his shining
 spear but idomeneus steadily watching him avoided the spear of bronze
 being hidden beneath the circle of his shield the shield covered about
 with oxhide and gleaming bronze that he allows bore fitted with two
 armrods under this he crouched together and the spear of bronze flew
 over and his shield rang sharply as the spear grazed thereon yet it
 flew not vainly from the heavy hand of deiphobos but smote hypsenor
 son of hippasos the shepherd of the hosts in the liver beneath the
 midriff and instantly unstrung his knees and deiphobos boasted over
 him terribly crying aloud "ah verily not unavenged lies asios nay
 methinks that even on his road to hades strong warden of the gate he
 will rejoice at heart since lo i have sent him escort for the way"

 so spake he but grief came on the argives by reason of his boast and
 stirred above all the soul of the wisehearted antilochos yet
 despite his sorrow he was not heedless of his dear comrade but ran and
 stood over him and covered him with his buckler then two trusty
 companions mekisteus son of echios and goodly alastor stooped down
 and lifted him and with heavy groaning bare him to the hollow ships

 and idomeneus relaxed not his mighty force but ever was striving
 either to cover some one of the trojans with black night or himself to
 fall in warding off death from the achaians there the dear son of
 aisyetes fosterling of zeus even the hero alkathoos was slain who
 was soninlaw of anchises and had married the eldest of his daughters
 hippodameia whom her father and her lady mother dearly loved in the
 halls for she excelled all the maidens of her age in beauty and skill
 and in wisdom wherefore the best man in wide troy took her to wife
 this alkathoos did poseidon subdue to idomeneus throwing a spell over
 his shining eyes and snaring his glorious limbs so that he might
 neither flee backwards nor avoid the stroke but stood steady as a
 pillar or a tree with lofty crown of leaves when the hero idomeneus
 smote him in the midst of the breast with the spear and rent the coat
 of bronze about him that aforetime warded death from his body but now
 rang harsh as it was rent by the spear and he fell with a crash and
 the lance fixed in his heart that still beating shook the buttend of
 the spear then at length mighty ares spent its fury there but
 idomeneus boasted terribly and cried aloud "deiphobos are we to deem
 it fair acquittal that we have slain three men for one since thou
 boastest thus nay sir but stand thou up also thyself against me that
 thou mayst know what manner of son of zeus am i that have come hither
 for zeus first begat minos the warden of crete and minos got him a
 son the noble deukalion and deukalion begat me a prince over many men
 in wide crete and now have the ships brought me hither a bane to thee
 and thy father and all the trojans"

 thus he spake but the thoughts of deiphobos were divided whether
 he should retreat and call to his aid some one of the greathearted
 trojans or should try the adventure alone and on this wise to his mind
 it seemed the better to go after aineias whom he found standing the
 last in the press for aineias was ever wroth against goodly priam for
 that priam gave him no honour despite his valour among men so
 deiphobos stood by him and spake winged words to him "aineias thou
 counsellor of the trojans now verily there is great need that thou
 shouldst succour thy sister's husband if any care for kin doth touch
 thee nay follow let us succour alkathoos thy sister's husband who of
 old did cherish thee in his hall while thou wert but a little one and
 now lo spearfamed idomeneus hath stripped him of his arms"

 so he spake and roused the spirit in the breast of aineias who went to
 seek idomeneus with high thoughts of war but fear took not hold upon
 idomeneus as though he had been some tender boy but he stood at bay
 like a boar on the hills that trusteth to his strength and abides the
 great assailing throng of men in a lonely place and he bristles up his
 back and his eyes shine with fire while he whets his tusks and is
 right eager to keep at bay both men and hounds even so stood
 spearfamed idomeneus at bay against aineias that came to the rescue
 and gave ground no whit but called on his comrades glancing to
 askalaphos and aphareus and deipyros and meriones and antilochos
 all masters of the warcry them he spurred up to battle and spake
 winged words "hither friends and rescue me all alone as i am and
 terribly i dread the onslaught of swiftfooted aineias that is
 assailing me for he is right strong to destroy men in battle and he
 hath the flower of youth the greatest avail that may be yea if he and
 i were of like age and in this spirit whereof now we are speedily
 should he or i achieve high victory"

 so he spake and they all being of one spirit in their hearts stood
 hard by each other with buckler laid on shoulder but aineias on the
 other side cried to his comrades glancing to deiphobos and paris and
 noble agenor that with him were leaders of the trojans and then the
 hosts followed them as sheep follow their leader to the water from the
 pasture and the shepherd is glad at heart even so the heart of aineias
 was glad in his breast when he saw the hosts of the people following to
 aid him

 then they rushed in close fight around alkathoos with their long spears
 and round their breasts the bronze rang terribly as they aimed at each
 other in the press while two men of war beyond the rest aineias and
 idomeneus the peers of ares were each striving to hew the flesh of the
 other with the pitiless bronze now aineias first cast at idomeneus who
 steadily watching him avoided the spear of bronze and the point of
 aineias went quivering in the earth since vainly it had flown from his
 stalwart hand but idomeneus smote oinomaos in the midst of the belly
 and brake the plate of his corslet and the bronze let forth the bowels
 through the corslet and he fell in the dust and clutched the earth in
 his palms and idomeneus drew forth the farshadowing spear from the
 dead but could not avail to strip the rest of the fair armour from his
 shoulders for the darts pressed hard on him nay and his feet no
 longer served him firmly in a charge nor could he rush after his own
 spear nor avoid the foe wherefore in close fight he still held off the
 pitiless day of destiny but in retreat his feet no longer bore him
 swiftly from the battle and as he was slowly departing deiphobos aimed
 at him with his shining spear for verily he ever cherished a steadfast
 hatred against idomeneus but this time too he missed him and smote
 askalapbos the son of enyalios with his dart and the strong spear
 passed through his shoulder and he fell in the dust and clutched the
 earth in his outstretched hand but loudvoiced awful ares was not yet
 aware at all that his son had fallen in strong battle but he was
 reclining on the peak of olympus beneath the golden clouds being held
 there by the design of zeus where also were the other deathless gods
 restrained from the war

 now the people rushed in close fight around askalaphos and deiphobos
 tore from askalaphos his shining helm but meriones the peer of swift
 ares leaped forward and smote the arm of deiphobos with his spear and
 from his hand the vizored casque fell clanging to the ground and
 meriones sprang forth instantly like a vulture and drew the strong
 spear from the shoulder of deiphobos and fell back among the throng of
 his comrades but the own brother of deiphobos polites stretched his
 hands round his waist and led him forth from the evil din of war even
 till he came to the swift horses that waited for him behind the battle
 and the fight with their charioteer and welldight chariot these bore
 him heavily groaning to the city worn with his hurt and the blood ran
 down from his newly wounded arm

 but the rest still were fighting and the warcry rose unquenched there
 aineias rushed on aphareus son of kaletor and struck his throat that
 chanced to be turned to him with the keen spear and his head dropped
 down and his shield and helm fell with him and death that slays the
 spirit overwhelmed him and antilochos watched thoon as he turned the
 other way and leaped on him and wounded him severing all the vein
 that runs up the back till it reaches the neck this he severed clean
 and thoon fell on his back in the dust stretching out both his hands to
 his comrades dear then antilochos rushed on and stripped the armour
 from his shoulders glancing around while the trojans gathered from here
 and there and smote his wide shining shield yet did not avail to
 graze behind the shield the delicate flesh of antilochos with the
 pitiless bronze for verily poseidon the shaker of the earth did guard
 on every side the son of nestor even in the midst of the javelins and
 never did antilochos get free of the foe but turned him about among
 them nor ever was his spear at rest but always brandished and shaken
 and the aim of his heart was to smite a foeman from afar or to set on
 him at close quarters but as he was aiming through the crowd he
 escaped not the ken of adamas son of asios who smote the midst of his
 shield with the sharp bronze setting on nigh at hand but poseidon of
 the dark locks made his shaft of no avail grudging him the life of
 antilochos and part of the spear abode there like a burned stake in
 the shield of antilochos and half lay on the earth and back retreated
 adamas to the ranks of his comrades avoiding fate but meriones
 following after him as he departed smote him with a spear between the
 privy parts and the navel where a wound is most baneful to wretched
 mortals even there he fixed the spear in him and he fell and writhed
 about the spear even as a bull that herdsmen on the hills drag along
 perforce when they have bound him with withes so he when he was smitten
 writhed for a moment not for long till the hero meriones came near
 and drew the spear out of his body and darkness covered his eyes

 and helenos in close fight smote deipyros on the temple with a great
 thracian sword and tore away the helm and the helm being dislodged
 fell on the ground and one of the achaians in the fight picked it up as
 it rolled between his feet but dark night covered the eyes of deipyros

 then grief took hold of the son of atreus menelaos of the loud warcry
 and he went with a threat against the warrior helenos the prince
 shaking his sharp spear while the other drew the centrepiece of his
 bow and both at once were making ready to let fly one with his sharp
 spear the other with the arrow from the string then the son of priam
 smote menelaos on the breast with his arrow on the plate of the
 corslet and off flew the bitter arrow even as from a broad shovel in a
 great threshing floor fly the blackskinned beans and pulse before the
 whistling wind and the stress of the winnower's shovel even so from
 the corslet of the renowned menelaos flew glancing far aside the bitter
 arrow but the son of atreus menelaos of the loud warcry smote the
 hand of helenos wherein he held the polished bow and into the bow
 clean through the hand was driven the spear of bronze back he withdrew
 to the ranks of his comrades avoiding fate with his hand hanging down
 at his side for the ashen spear dragged after him and the
 greathearted agenor drew the spear from his hand and himself bound up
 the hand with a band of twisted sheep'swool a sling that a squire
 carried for him the shepherd of the host

 then peisandros made straight for renowned menelaos but an evil fate
 was leading him to the end of death by thee menelaos to be overcome
 in the dread strife of battle now when the twain had come nigh in onset
 upon each other the son of atreus missed and his spear was turned
 aside but peisandros smote the shield of renowned menelaos yet availed
 not to drive the bronze clean through for the wide shield caught it
 and the spear brake in the socket yet peisandros rejoiced in his heart
 and hoped for the victory but the son of atreus drew his silverstudded
 sword and leaped upon peisandros and peisandros under his shield
 clutched his goodly axe of fine bronze with long and polished haft of
 olivewood and the twain set upon each other then peisandros smote the
 crest of the helmet shaded with horse hair close below the very plume
 but menelaos struck the other as he came forward on the brow above
 the base of the nose and the bones cracked and the eyes all bloody
 fell at his feet in the dust then he bowed and fell and menelaos set
 his foot on his breast and stripped him of his arms and triumphed
 saying "even thus then surely ye will leave the ships of the danaans
 of the swift steeds ye trojans overweening insatiate of the dread din
 of war yea and ye shall not lack all other reproof and shame
 wherewith ye made me ashamed ye hounds of evil having no fear in your
 hearts of the strong wrath of loudthundering zeus the god of guest and
 host who one day will destroy your steep citadel o ye that wantonly
 carried away my wedded wife and many of my possessions when ye were
 entertained by her now again ye are fain to throw ruinous fire on the
 seafaring ships and to slay the achaian heroes nay but ye will yet
 refrain you from battle for as eager as ye be o zeus verily they say
 that thou dost excel in wisdom all others both gods and men and all
 these things are from thee how wondrously art thou favouring men of
 violence even the trojans whose might is ever iniquitous nor can they
 have their fill of the din of equal war of all things there is satiety
 yea even of love and sleep and of sweet song and dance delectable
 whereof a man would sooner have his fill than of war but the trojans
 are insatiable of battle"

 thus noble menelaos spake and stripped the bloody arms from the body
 and gave them to his comrades and instantly himself went forth again
 and mingled in the forefront of the battle then harpalion the son of
 king pylaimenes leaped out against him harpalion that followed his
 dear father to troy to the war nor ever came again to his own country
 he then smote the middle of the shield of atreus' son with his spear in
 close fight yet availed not to drive the bronze clean through but fell
 back into the host of his comrades avoiding fate glancing round every
 way lest one should wound his flesh with the bronze but meriones shot
 at him as he retreated with a bronzeshod arrow and smote him in the
 right buttock and the arrow went right through the bladder and came out
 under the bone and sitting down even there in the arms of his dear
 comrades he breathed away his soul lying stretched like a worm on the
 earth and out flowed the black blood and wetted the ground and the
 paphlagonians great of heart tended him busily and set him in a
 chariot and drove him to sacred ilios sorrowing and with them went his
 father shedding tears and there was no atonement for his dead son

 now paris was very wroth at heart by reason of his slaying for he had
 been his host among the many paphlagonions wherefore in wrath for his
 sake he let fly a bronzeshod arrow now there was a certain euchenor
 the son of polyidos the seer a rich man and a good whose dwelling was
 in corinth and well he knew his own ruinous fate when he went on
 shipboard for often would the old man the good polyidos tell him
 that he must either perish of a sore disease in his halls or go with
 the ships of the achaians and be overcome by the trojans wherefore he
 avoided at once the heavy warfine of the achaians and the hateful
 disease that so he might not know any anguish this man did paris smite
 beneath the jaw and under the ear and swiftly his spirit departed from
 his limbs and lo dread darkness overshadowed him

 so they fought like flaming fire but hector beloved of zeus had not
 heard nor knew at all that on the left of the ships his host was being
 subdued by the argives and soon would the achaians have won renown so
 mighty was the holder and shaker of the earth that urged on the argives
 yea and himself mightily defended them but hector kept where at first
 he had leaped within the walls and the gate and broken the serried
 ranks of shieldbearing danaans even where were the ships of aias and
 protesilaos drawn up on the beach of the hoary sea while above the
 wall was builded lowest and thereby chiefly the heroes and their horses
 were raging in battle

 there the boiotians and ionians with trailing tunics and lokrians and
 phthians and illustrious epeians scarcely availed to stay his onslaught
 on the ships nor yet could they drive back from them noble hector like
 a flame of fire and there were the picked men of the athenians among
 them menestheus son of peteos was the leader and there followed with
 him pheidas and stichios and brave bias while the epeians were led by
 meges son of phyleus and amphion and drakios and in front of the
 phthians were medon and podarkes resolute in war now the one medon
 was the bastard son of noble oileus and brother of aias and he dwelt
 in phylake far from his own country for that he had slain a man the
 brother of his stepmother eriopis wife of oileus but the other
 podarkes was the son of iphiklos son of phylakos and they in their
 armour in the van of the greathearted phthians were defending the
 ships and fighting among the boiotians

 now never at all did aias the swift son of oileus depart from the side
 of aias son of telamon nay not for an instant but even as in fallow
 land two winedark oxen with equal heart strain at the shapen plough
 and round the roots of their horns springeth up abundant sweat and
 nought sunders them but the polished yoke as they labour through the
 furrow till the end of the furrow brings them up so stood the two
 aiantes close by each other now verily did many and noble hosts of his
 comrades follow with the son of telamon and bore his shield when labour
 and sweat came upon his limbs but the lokrians followed not with the
 highhearted son of oileus for their hearts were not steadfast in close
 brunt of battle seeing that they had no helmets of bronze shadowy with
 horsehair plumes nor round shields nor ashen spears but trusting in
 bows and welltwisted slings of sheep's wool they followed with him to
 ilios therewith in the war they shot thick and fast and brake the
 ranks of the trojans so the one party in front contended with the
 trojans and with hector arrayed in bronze while the others from behind
 kept shooting from their ambush and the trojans lost all memory of the
 joy of battle for the arrows confounded them

 there then right ruefully from the ships and the huts would the trojans
 have withdrawn to windy ilios had not polydamas come near valiant
 hector and said "hector thou art hard to be persuaded by them that
 would counsel thee for that god has given thee excellence in the works
 of war therefore in council also thou art fain to excel other men in
 knowledge but in nowise wilt thou be able to take everything on
 thyself for to one man has god given for his portion the works of war
 to another the dance to another the lute and song but in the heart
 of yet another hath farseeing zeus placed an excellent understanding
 whereof many men get gain yea he saveth many an one and himself best
 knoweth it but lo i will speak even as it seemeth best to me behold
 all about thee the circle of war is blazing but the greathearted
 trojans now that they have got down the wall are some with their arms
 standing aloof and some are fighting few men against a host being
 scattered among the ships nay withdraw thee and call hither all the
 best of the warriors thereafter shall we take all counsel carefully
 whether we should fall on the ships of many benches if indeed god
 willeth to give us victory or after counsel held should return
 unharmed from the ships for verily i fear lest the achaians repay their
 debt of yesterday since by the ships there tarrieth a man insatiate of
 war and never methinks will he wholly stand aloof from battle"

 so spake polydamas and his safe counsel pleased hector well who spake
 to him winged words and said "polydamas do thou stay here all the best
 of the host but i will go thither to face the war and swiftly will
 return again when i have straitly laid on them my commands"

 so he spake and set forth in semblance like a snowy mountain and
 shouting aloud he flew through the trojans and allies and they all sped
 to polydamas the kindly son of panthoos when they heard the voice of
 hector but he went seeking deiphobos and the strong prince helenos
 and adamas son of asios and asios son of hyrtakos among the warriors
 in the foremost line if anywhere he might find them but them he found
 not at all unharmed nor free of bane but lo some among the sterns of
 the ships of the achaians lay lifeless slain by the hands of the
 argives and some were within the wall wounded by thrust or cast but
 one he readily found on the left of the dolorous battle goodly
 alexandros the lord of fairtressed helen heartening his comrades and
 speeding them to war and he drew near to him and addressed him with
 words of shame "thou evil paris fairest of face thou that lustest for
 women thou seducer where prithee are deiphobos and the strong
 prince helenos and adamas son of asios and asios son of hyrtakos and
 where is othryoneus now hath all high ilios perished utterly now too
 thou seest is sheer destruction sure"

 then godlike alexandros answered him again saying "hector since thy
 mind is to blame one that is blameless some other day might i rather
 withdraw me from the war since my mother bare not even me wholly a
 coward for from the time that thou didst gather the battle of thy
 comrades about the ships from that hour do we abide here and war with
 the danaans ceaselessly and our comrades concerning whom thou inquirest
 are slain only deiphobos and the strong prince helenos have both
 withdrawn both of them being wounded in the hand with long spears for
 kronion kept death away from them but now lead on wheresoever thy
 heart and spirit bid thee and we will follow with thee eagerly nor
 methinks shall we lack for valour as far as we have strength but beyond
 his strength may no man fight howsoever eager he be"

 so spake the hero and persuaded his brother's heart and they went
 forth where the war and din were thickest round kebriones and noble
 polydamas and phalkes and orthaios and godlike polyphetes and
 palmys and askanios and morys son of hippotion who had come in their
 turn out of deepsoiled askanie on the morn before and now zeus
 urged them to fight and these set forth like the blast of violent
 winds that rushes earthward beneath the thunder of zeus and with
 marvellous din doth mingle with the salt sea and therein are many
 swelling waves of the loud roaring sea arched over and white with foam
 some vanward others in the rear even so the trojans arrayed in van and
 rear and shining with bronze followed after their leaders

 and hector son of priam was leading them the peer of ares the bane of
 men in front he held the circle of his shield thick with hides and
 plates of beaten bronze and on his temples swayed his shining helm and
 everywhere he went in advance and made trial of the ranks if perchance
 they would yield to him as he charged under cover of his shield but he
 could not confound the heart within the breast of the achaians and
 aias stalking with long strides challenged him first "sir draw nigh
 wherefore dost thou vainly try to dismay the argives we are in no wise
 ignorant of war but by the cruel scourge of zeus are we achaians
 vanquished surely now thy heart hopes utterly to spoil the ships but
 we too have hands presently to hold our own verily your peopled city
 will long ere that beneath our hands be taken and sacked but for thee i
 tell thee that the time is at hand when thou shalt pray in thy flight
 to zeus and the other immortal gods that thy fairmaned steeds may be
 fleeter than falcons thy steeds that are to bear thee to the city as
 they storm in dust across the plain"

 and even as he spake a bird flew forth on the right hand an eagle of
 lofty flight and the host of the achaians shouted thereat encouraged
 by the omen but renowned hector answered "aias thou blundering
 boaster what sayest thou would that indeed i were for ever as surely
 the son of aegisbearing zeus and that my mother were lady hera and
 that i were held in such honour as apollo and athene as verily this day
 is to bring utter evil on all the argives and thou among them shalt be
 slain if thou hast the heart to await my long spear which shall rend
 thy lily skin and thou shalt glut with thy fat and flesh the birds and
 dogs of the trojans falling among the ships of the achaians"

 so he spake and led the way and they followed with wondrous din and
 the whole host shouted behind and the argives on the other side
 answered with a shout and forgot not their valiance but abode the
 onslaught of the bravest of the trojans and the cry of the two hosts
 went up through the higher air to the splendour of zeus



 book xiv

 how sleep and hera beguiled zeus to slumber on the heights
 of ida and poseidon spurred on the achaians to resist
 hector and how hector was wounded

 yet the cry of battle escaped not nestor albeit at his wine but he
 spake winged words to the son of asklepios "bethink thee noble
 machaon what had best be done lo louder waxes the cry of the strong
 warriors by the ships nay now sit where thou art and drink the bright
 wine till hekamede of the fair tresses shall heat warm water for the
 bath and wash away the clotted blood but i will speedily go forth and
 come to a place of outlook"

 therewith he took the wellwrought shield of his son horsetaming
 thrasymedes which was lying in the hut all glistering with bronze for
 the son had the shield of his father and he seized a strong spear with
 a point of keen bronze and stood outside the hut and straightway
 beheld a deed of shame the achaians fleeing in rout and the
 highhearted trojans driving them and the wall of the achaians was
 overthrown and as when the great sea is troubled with a dumb wave and
 dimly bodes the sudden paths of the shrill winds but is still unmoved
 nor yet rolled forward or to either side until some steady gale comes
 down from zeus even so the old man ponderedhis mind divided this
 way and thatwhether he should fare into the press of the danaans of
 the swift steeds or go after agamemnon son of atreus shepherd of the
 host and thus as he pondered it seemed to him the better counsel to go
 to the son of atreus meanwhile they were warring and slaying each
 other and the stout bronze rang about their bodies as they were thrust
 with swords and doublepointed spears

 now the kings the fosterlings of zeus encountered nestor as they went
 up from the ships even they that were wounded with the bronze tydeus'
 son and odysseus and agamemnon son of atreus for far apart from the
 battle were their ships drawn up on the shore of the grey sea for
 these were the first they had drawn up to the plain but had builded the
 wall in front of the hindmost for in no wise might the beach wide as
 it was hold all the ships and the host was straitened wherefore they
 drew up the ships row within row and filled up the wide mouth of all
 the shore that the headlands held between them therefore the kings were
 going together leaning on their spears to look on the war and fray
 and the heart of each was sore within his breast and the old man met
 them even nestor and caused the spirit to fail within the breasts of
 the achaians

 and mighty agamemnon spake and accosted him "o nestor son of neleus
 great glory of the achaians wherefore dost thou come hither and hast
 deserted the war the bane of men lo i fear the accomplishment of the
 word that dread hector spake and the threat wherewith he threatened us
 speaking in the assembly of the trojans namely that never would he
 return to ilios from the ships till he had burned the ships with fire
 and slain the men even so he spake and lo now all these things are
 being fulfilled alas surely even the other wellgreaved achaians store
 wrath against me in their hearts like achilles and have no desire to
 fight by the rearmost ships"

 then nestor of gerenia the knight answered him saying "verily these
 things are now at hand and being accomplished nor otherwise could zeus
 himself contrive them he that thundereth on high for lo the wall is
 overthrown wherein we trusted that it should be an unbroken bulwark of
 the ships and of our own bodies but let us take counsel how these
 things may best be done if wit may do aught but into the war i counsel
 not that we should go down for in no wise may a wounded man do battle"

 then agamemnon king of men answered him again "nestor for that they
 are warring by the rearmost ships and the wellbuilded wall hath
 availed not nor the trench whereat the achaians endured so much
 labour hoping in their hearts that it should be the unbroken bulwark of
 the ships and of their own bodiessuch it seemeth must be the will
 of zeus supreme that the achaians should perish here nameless far from
 argos for i knew it when he was forward to aid the danaans and now i
 know that he is giving to the trojans glory like that of the blessed
 gods and hath bound our hands and our strength but come as i declare
 let us all obey let us drag down the ships that are drawn up in the
 first line near to the sea and speed them all forth to the salt sea
 divine and moor them far out with stones till the divine night comes
 if even at night the trojans will refrain from war and then might we
 drag down all the ships for there is no shame in fleeing from ruin
 yea even in the night better doth he fare who flees from trouble than
 he that is overtaken"

 then looking on him sternly spake odysseus of many counsels "atreus'
 son what word hath passed the door of thy lips man of mischief sure
 thou shouldst lead some other inglorious army not be king among us to
 whom zeus hath given it from youth even unto age to wind the skein of
 grievous wars till every man of us perish art thou indeed so eager
 to leave the widewayed city of the trojans the city for which we
 endure with sorrow so many evils be silent lest some other of the
 achaians hear this word that no man should so much as suffer to pass
 through his mouth none that understandeth in his heart how to speak
 fit counsel none that is a sceptred king and hath hosts obeying him so
 many as the argives over whom thou reignest and now i wholly scorn thy
 thoughts such a word as thou hast uttered thou that in the midst of
 war and battle dost bid us draw down the welltimbered ships to the
 sea that even more than ever the trojans may possess their desire
 albeit they win the mastery even now and sheer destruction fall upon
 us for the achaians will not make good the war when the ships are
 drawn down to the salt sea but will look round about to flee and
 withdraw from battle there will thy counsel work a mischief o marshal
 of the host"

 then the king of men agamemnon answered him "odysseus right sharply
 hast thou touched my heart with thy stern reproof nay i do not bid the
 sons of the achaians to drag against their will the welltimbered
 ships to the salt sea now perchance there may be one who will utter a
 wiser counsel than this of minea young man or an oldwelcome
 would it be to me"

 then diomedes of the loud warcry spake also among them "the man is
 nearnot long shall we seek him if ye be willing to be persuaded of
 me and each of you be not resentful at all because in years i am the
 youngest among you nay but i too boast me to come by lineage of a
 noble sire tydeus whom in thebes the piledup earth doth cover for
 portheus had three wellborn children and they dwelt in pleuron and
 steep kalydon even agrios and melas and the third was oineus the
 knight the father of my father and in valour he excelled the others
 and there he abode but my father dwelt at argos whither he had
 wandered for so zeus and the other gods willed that it should be and
 he wedded one of the daughters of adrastos and dwelt in a house full of
 livelihood and had wheatbearing fields enow and many orchards of
 trees apart and many sheep were his and in skill with the spear he
 excelled all the achaians these things ye must have heard if i speak
 sooth therefore ye could not say that i am weak and a coward by
 lineage and so dishonour my spoken counsel that well i may speak let
 us go down to the battle wounded as we are since we needs must and
 then might we hold ourselves aloof from the battle beyond the range of
 darts lest any take wound upon wound but the others will we spur on
 even them that aforetime gave place to their passion and stand apart
 and fight not"

 so he spake and they all heard him readily and obeyed him and they
 set forth led by agamemnon the king of men

 now the renowned earthshaker held no vain watch but went with them in
 the guise of an ancient man and he seized the right hand of agamemnon
 atreus' son and uttering winged words he spake to him saying
 "atreides now methinks the ruinous heart of achilles rejoices in his
 breast as he beholds the slaughter and flight of the achaians since he
 hath no wisdom not a grain nay even so may he perish likewise and
 god mar him but with thee the blessed gods are not utterly wroth nay
 even yet methinks the leaders and rulers of the trojans will cover the
 wide plain with dust and thyself shalt see them fleeing to the city
 from the ships and the huts"

 so spake he and shouted mightily as he sped over the plain and loud
 as nine thousand men or ten thousand cry in battle when they join the
 strife of war so mighty was the cry that the strong shaker of the earth
 sent forth from his breast and great strength he put into the heart of
 each of the achaians to strive and war unceasingly

 now hera of the golden throne stood on the peak of olympus and saw with
 her eyes and anon knew him that was her brother and her lord's going to
 and fro through the glorious fight and she rejoiced in her heart and
 she beheld zeus sitting on the topmost crest of manyfountained ida and
 to her heart he was hateful then she took thought the oxeyed lady
 hera how she might beguile the mind of aegisbearing zeus and this
 seemed to her in her heart to be the best counsel namely to fare to
 ida when she had well adorned herself if perchance a sweet sleep and a
 kindly she could pour on his eye lids and his crafty wits and she set
 forth to her bower that her dear son hephaistos had fashioned and
 therein had made fast strong doors on the pillars with a secret bolt
 that no other god might open there did she enter in and closed the
 shining doors with ambrosia first did she cleanse every stain from her
 winsome body and anointed her with olive oil ambrosial soft and of a
 sweet savour if it were but shaken in the bronzefloored mansion of
 zeus the savour thereof went right forth to earth and heaven therewith
 she anointed her fair body and combed her hair and with her hands
 plaited her shining tresses fair and ambrosial flowing from her
 immortal head then she clad her in her fragrant robe that athene
 wrought delicately for her and therein set many things beautifully
 made and fastened it over her breast with clasps of gold and she
 girdled it with a girdle arrayed with a hundred tassels and she set
 earrings in her pierced ears earrings of three drops and glistering
 therefrom shone grace abundantly and with a veil over all the peerless
 goddess veiled herself a fair new veil bright as the sun and beneath
 her shining feet she bound goodly sandals but when she had adorned her
 body with all her array she went forth from her bower and called
 aphrodite apart from the other gods and spake to her saying "wilt
 thou obey me dear child in that which i shall tell thee or wilt thou
 refuse with a grudge in thy heart because i succour the danaans and
 thou the trojans"

 then aphrodite the daughter of zeus answered her "hera goddess queen
 daughter of mighty kronos say the thing that is in thy mind my heart
 bids me fulfil it if fulfil it i may and if it may be accomplished"

 then with crafty purpose the lady hera answered her "give me now love
 and desire wherewith thou dost overcome all the immortals and mortal
 men for i am going to visit the limits of the bountiful earth and
 okeanos father of the gods and mother tethys who reared me well and
 nourished me in their halls having taken me from rhea when farseeing
 zeus imprisoned kronos beneath the earth and the unvintaged sea them am
 i going to visit and their endless strife will i loose for already
 this long time they hold apart from each other since wrath hath settled
 in their hearts if with words i might persuade their hearts and bring
 them back to love ever should i be called dear to them and worshipful"

 then laughterloving aphrodite answered her again "it may not be nor
 seemly were it to deny that thou askest for thou steepest in the arms
 of zeus the chief of gods"

 therewith from her breast she loosed the broidered girdle fairwrought
 wherein are all her enchantments therein are love and desire and
 loving converse that steals the wits even of the wise this girdle she
 laid in her hands and spake and said "lo now take this girdle and
 lay it up in thy bosom this fairwrought girdle wherein all things are
 fashioned methinks thou wilt not return with that unaccomplished which
 in thy heart thou desirest"

 so spake she and the oxeyed lady hera smiled and smiling laid up the
 zone within her breast

 then the daughter of zeus aphrodite went to her house and hera
 rushing down left the peak of olympus and sped' over the snowy hills
 of the thracian horsemen even over the topmost crests nor grazed the
 ground with her feet and from athos she fared across the foaming sea
 and came to lemnos the city of godlike thoas there she met sleep the
 brother of death and clasped her hand in his and spake and called him
 by name "sleep lord of all gods and of all men if ever thou didst
 hear my word obey me again even now and i will be grateful to thee
 always lull me i pray thee the shining eyes of zeus beneath his
 brows and gifts i will give to thee even a fair throne imperishable
 for ever a golden throne that hephaistos the lame mine own child
 shall fashion skilfully and will set beneath it a footstool for the
 feet for thee to set thy shining feet upon when thou art at a
 festival nay come and i will give thee one of the younger of the
 graces to wed and to be called thy wife"

 so she spake and sleep was glad and answered and said"come now
 swear to me by the inviolable water of styx and with one of thy hands
 grasp the bounteous earth and with the other the shining sea that all
 may be witnesses to us even all the gods below that are with kronos
 that verily thou wilt give me one of the younger of the graces even
 pasithea that myself do long for all my days"

 so spake he nor did she disobey the whitearmed goddess hera she
 sware as he bade her and called all the gods by name even those below
 tartaros that are called titans but when she had sworn and ended that
 oath the twain left the citadel of lemnos and of imbros clothed on in
 mist and swiftly they accomplished the way to manyfountained ida they
 came the mother of wild beasts to lekton where first they left the
 sea and they twain fared above the dry land and the topmost forest
 waved beneath their feet there sleep halted ere the eyes of zeus
 beheld him and alighted on a tall pine tree the loftiest pine that
 then in all ida rose through the nether to the upper air but hera
 swiftly drew nigh to topmost gargaros the highest crest of ida and
 zeus the cloudgatherer beheld her and as he saw her so love came over
 his deep heart and he stood before her and spoke and said "hera
 with what desire comest thou thus hither from olympus and thy horses
 and chariot are not here whereon thou mightst ascend"

 then with crafty purpose lady hera answered him "i am going to visit
 the limits of the bountiful earth and okeanos father of the gods and
 mother tethys who reared me well and cherished me in their halls them
 am i going to visit and their endless strife will i loose for already
 this long time they hold apart from each other since wrath hath settled
 in their hearts but my horses are standing at the foot of
 manyfountained ida my horses that shall bear me over wet and dry and
 now it is because of thee that i am thus come hither down from olympus
 lest perchance thou mightest be wroth with me hereafter if silently i
 were gone to the mansion of deepflowing okeanos"

 then zeus the gatherer of the clouds answered her and said "hera
 thither mayst thou go on a later day for never once as thus did the
 love of goddess or woman so mightily overflow and conquer the heart
 within my breast"

 thus slept the father in quiet on the crest of gargaros by sleep and
 love overcome but sweet sleep started and ran to the ships of the
 achaians to tell his tidings to the god that holdeth and shaketh the
 earth and he stood near him and spake winged words "eagerly now
 poseidon do thou aid the danaans and give them glory for a little
 space while yet zeus sleepeth for over him have i shed soft slumber
 and hera hath beguiled him"

 so he spake and passed to the renowned tribes of men and still the
 more did he set on poseidon to aid the danaans who straightway sprang
 far afront of the foremost and called to them "argives are we again
 to yield the victory to hector son of priam that he may take our ships
 and win renown nay even so he saith and declareth that he will do for
 that achilles by the hollow ships abides angered at heart but for him
 there will be no such extreme regret if we spur us on to aid each the
 other nay come as i command let us all obey let us harness us in the
 best shields that are in the host and the greatest and cover our heads
 with shining helms and take the longest spears in our hands and so go
 forth yea and i will lead the way and methinks that hector son of
 priam will not long await us for all his eagerness and whatsoever man
 is steadfast in battle and hath a small buckler on his shoulder let
 him give it to a worse man and harness him in a larger shield"

 so spake he and they heard him eagerly and obeyed him and them the
 kings themselves arrayed wounded as they were tydeus' son and
 odysseus and agamemnon son of atreus they went through all the host
 and made exchange of weapons of war the good arms did the good warrior
 harness him in the worse he gave to the worse but when they had done
 on the shining bronze about their bodies they started on the march and
 poseidon led them the shaker of the earth with a dread sword of fine
 edge in his strong hand like unto lightning wherewith it is not
 permitted that any should mingle in woful war but fear holds men afar
 therefrom but the trojans on the other side was renowned hector
 arraying then did they now strain the fiercest strife of war even
 darkhaired poseidon and glorious hector one succouring the trojans
 the other with the argives and the sea washed up to the huts and ships
 of the argives and they gathered together with a mighty cry not so
 loudly bellows the wave of the sea against the land stirred up from the
 deep by the harsh breath of the north wind nor so loud is the roar of
 burning fire in the glades of a mountain when it springs to burn up the
 forest nor calls the wind so loudly in the high leafy tresses of the
 trees when it rages and roars its loudest as then was the cry of the
 trojans and achaians shouting dreadfully as they rushed upon each
 other

 first glorious hector cast with his spear at aias who was facing him
 full and did not miss striking him where two belts were stretched
 across his breast the belt of his shield and of his silverstudded
 sword these guarded his tender flesh and hector was enraged because
 his swift spear had flown vainly from his hand and he retreated into
 the throng of his fellows avoiding fate

 then as he was departing the great telamonian aias smote him with a huge
 stone for many stones the props of swift ships were rolled among the
 feet of the fighters one of these he lifted and smote hector on the
 breast over the shieldrim near the neck and made him spin like a top
 with the blow that he reeled round and round and even as when an oak
 falls uprooted beneath the stroke of father zeus and a dread savour of
 brimstone arises therefrom and whoso stands near and beholds it has no
 more courage for dread is the bolt of great zeus even so fell mighty
 hector straightway in the dust and the spear fell from his hand but
 his shield and helm were made fast to him and round him rang his arms
 adorned with bronze

 then with a loud cry they ran up the sons of the achaians hoping to
 drag him away and they cast showers of darts but not one availed to
 wound or smite the shepherd of the host before that might be the
 bravest gathered about him polydamas and aineias and goodly agenor
 and sarpedon leader of the lykians and noble glaukos and of the rest
 not one was heedless of him but they held their round shields in front
 of him and his comrades lifted him in their arms and bare him out of
 the battle till he reached his swift horses that were standing waiting
 for him with the charioteer and the fairdight chariot at the rear of
 the combat and the war these toward the city bore him heavily moaning
 now when they came to the ford of the fairflowing river of eddying
 xanthos that immortal zeus begat there they lifted him from the
 chariot to the ground and poured water over him and he gat back his
 breath and looked up with his eyes and sitting on his heels kneeling
 he vomited black blood then again he sank back on the ground and black
 night covered his eyes the stroke still conquering his spirit



 book xv

 zeus awakening biddeth apollo revive hector and restore
 the fortunes of the trojans fire is thrown on the ship of
 protesilaos

 now when they had sped in flight across the palisade and trench and
 many were overcome at the hands of the danaans the rest were stayed
 and abode beside the chariots in confusion and pale with terror and
 zeus awoke on the peaks of ida beside hera of the golden throne then
 he leaped up and stood and beheld the trojans and achaians those in
 flight and these driving them on from the rear even the argives and
 among them the prince poseidon and hector he saw lying on the plain
 and around him sat his comrades and he was gasping with difficult
 breath and his mind wandering and was vomiting blood for it was not
 the weakest of the achaians that had smitten him beholding him the
 father of men and gods had pity on him and terribly he spoke to hera
 with fierce look "o thou ill to deal with hera verily it is thy
 crafty wile that has made noble hector cease from the fight and has
 terrified the host nay but yet i know not whether thou mayst not be
 the first to reap the fruits of thy cruel treason and i beat thee with
 stripes dost thou not remember when thou wert hung from on high and
 from thy feet i suspended two anvils and round thy hands fastened a
 golden bond that might not be broken and thou didst hang in the clear
 air and the clouds and the gods were wroth in high olympus but they
 could not come round and unloose thee"

 so spake he and the oxeyed lady hera shuddered and spake unto him
 winged words saying "let earth now be witness hereto and wide heaven
 above and that falling water of styx the greatest oath and the most
 terrible to the blessed gods and thine own sacred head and our own
 bridal bed whereby never would i forswear myself that not by my will
 does earthshaking poseidon trouble the trojans and hector and succour
 them of the other part nay it is his own soul that urgeth and
 commandeth him and he had pity on the achaians when he beheld them
 hard pressed beside the ships i would even counsel him also to go even
 where thou lord of the stormcloud mayst lead him"

 so spake she and the father of gods and men smiled and answering her
 he spake winged words "if thou of a truth o oxeyed lady hera
 wouldst hereafter abide of one mind with me among the immortal gods
 thereon would poseidon howsoever much his wish be contrariwise quickly
 turn his mind otherwhere after thy heart and mine but if indeed thou
 speakest the truth and soothly go thou now among the tribes of the
 gods and call iris to come hither and apollo the renowned archer
 that iris may go among the host of mailclad achaians and tell poseidon
 the prince to cease from the war and get him unto his own house but
 let phoebus apollo spur hector on to the war and breathe strength into
 him again and make him forget his anguish that now wears down his
 heart and drive the achaians back again when he hath stirred in them
 craven fear let them flee and fall among the manybenched ships of
 achilles son of peleus and he shall rouse his own comrade patroklos
 and him shall renowned hector slay with the spear in front of ilios
 after that he has slain many other youths and among them my son noble
 sarpedon in wrath therefor shall goodly achilles slay hector from that
 hour verily will i cause a new pursuit from the ships that shall endure
 continually even until the achaians take steep ilios through the
 counsels of athene but before that hour neither do i cease in my wrath
 nor will i suffer any other of the immortals to help the danaans there
 before i accomplish that desire of the son of peleus as i promised him
 at the first and confirmed the same with a nod of my head on that day
 when the goddess thetis clasped my knees imploring me to honour
 achilles the sacker of cities"

 so spake he nor did the whitearmed goddess hera disobey him and she
 sped down from the hills of ida to high olympus and went among the
 gathering of the immortal gods and she called apollo without the hall
 and iris that is the messenger of the immortal gods and she spake
 winged words and addressed them saying "zeus bids you go to ida as
 swiftly as may be and when ye have gone and looked on the face of
 zeus do ye whatsoever he shall order and command"

 and these twain came before the face of zeus the cloud gatherer and
 stood there and he was nowise displeased at heart when he beheld them
 for that speedily they had obeyed the words of his dear wife and to
 iris first he spake winged words "go get thee swift iris to the
 prince poseidon and tell him all these things nor be a false
 messenger command him to cease from war and battle and to go among the
 tribes of the gods or into the bright sea but if he will not obey my
 words but will hold me in no regard then let him consider in his heart
 and mind lest he dare not for all his strength to abide me when i come
 against him since i deem me to be far mightier than he and elder
 born"

 so spake he nor did the windfooted fleet iris disobey him but went
 down the hills of ida to sacred ilios and as when snow or chill hail
 fleets from the clouds beneath the stress of the north wind born in the
 clear air so fleetly she fled in her eagerness swift iris and drew
 near the renowned earthshaker and spake to him the message of zeus and
 he left the host of the achaians and passed to the sea and sank and
 sorely they missed him the heroes of the achaians

 then zeus the gatherer of the clouds spake to apollo saying "go now
 dear phoebus to hector of the helm of bronze let glorious hector be
 thy care and rouse in him great wrath even till the achaians come in
 their flight to the ships and the hellespont and from that moment will
 i devise word and deed wherewithal the achaians may take breath again
 from their toil"

 so spake he nor was apollo deaf to the word of the father but he went
 down the hills of ida like a fleet falcon the bane of doves that is
 the swiftest of flying things and he found the son of wisehearted
 priam noble hector sitting up no longer lying for he had but late
 got back his life and knew the comrades around him and his gasping and
 his sweat had ceased from the moment when the will of aegisbearing
 zeus began to revive him then fardarting apollo stood near him and
 spake to him "hector son of priam why dost thou sit fainting apart
 from the others is it perchance that some trouble cometh upon thee"

 then with faint breath answered him hector of the glancing helm "nay
 but who art thou best of the gods who enquirest of me face to face
 dost thou not know that by the hindmost row of the ships of the
 achaians aias of the loud warcry smote me on the breast with a stone
 as i was slaying his comrades and made me cease from mine impetuous
 might and verily i deemed that this very day i should pass to the dead
 and the house of hades when i had gasped my life away"

 then prince apollo the fardarter answered him again "take courage now
 so great an ally hath the son of kronos sent thee out of ida to stand
 by thee and defend thee even phoebus apollo of the golden sword me who
 of old defend thee thyself and the steep citadel but come now bid thy
 many charioteers drive their swift steeds against the hollow ships and
 i will go before and make smooth all the way for the chariots and will
 put to flight the achaian heroes"

 so he spake and breathed great might into the shepherd of the host and
 even as when a stalled horse full fed at the manger breaks his tether
 and speedeth at the gallop over the plain exultingly being wont to
 bathe in the fairflowing stream and holds his head on high and the
 mane floweth about his shoulders and he trusteth in his glory and
 nimbly his knees bear him to the haunts and pasture of the mares even
 so hector lightly moved his feet and knees urging on his horsemen when
 he heard the voice of the god but as when hounds and country folk
 pursue a horned stag or a wild goat that steep rock and shady wood
 save from them nor is it their lot to find him but at their clamour a
 bearded lion hath shown himself on the way and lightly turned them all
 despite their eagerness even so the danaans for a while followed on
 always in their companies smiting with swords and doublepointed
 spears but when they saw hector going up and down the ranks of men
 then were they afraid and the hearts of all fell to their feet

 then to them spake thoas son of andraimon far the best of the
 aitolians skilled in throwing the dart and good in close fight and in
 council did few of the achaians surpass him when the young men were
 striving in debate he made harangue and spake among them "alas and
 verily a great marvel is this i behold with mine eyes how he hath again
 arisen and hath avoided the fates even hector surely each of us hoped
 in his heart that he had died beneath the hand of aias son of telamon
 but some one of the gods again hath delivered and saved hector who
 verily hath loosened the knees of many of the danaans as methinks will
 befall even now for not without the will of loudthundering zeus doth
 he rise in the front ranks thus eager for battle but come as i
 declare let us all obey let us bid the throng turn back to the ships
 but let us as many as avow us to be the best in the host take our
 stand if perchance first we may meet him and hold him off with
 outstretched spears and he methinks for all his eagerness will fear
 at heart to enter into the press of the danaans"

 so spake he and they heard him eagerly and obeyed him they that were
 with aias and the prince idomeneus and teukros and neriones and meges
 the peer of ares called to all the best of the warriors and sustained
 the fight with hector and the trojans but behind them the multitude
 returned to the ships of the achaians

 now the trojans drave forward in close ranks and with long strides
 hector led them while in front of him went phoebus apollo his
 shoulders wrapped in cloud and still he held the fell aegis dread
 circled with a shaggy fringe and gleaming that hephaistos the smith
 gave to zeus to bear for the terror of men with this in his hands did
 he lead the host

 now the argives abode them in close ranks and shrill the cry arose on
 both sides and the arrows leaped from the bowstrings and many spears
 from stalwart hands whereof some stood fast in the flesh of young men
 swift in fight but many halfway ere ever they reached the white flesh
 stuck in the ground longing to glut themselves with flesh now so long
 as phoebus apollo held the aegis unmoved in his hands so long the darts
 smote either side amain and the folk fell but when he looked face to
 face on the danaans of the swift steeds and shook the aegis and
 himself shouted mightily he quelled their heart in their breast and
 they forgot their impetuous valour and as when two wild beasts drive in
 confusion a herd of kine or a great flock of sheep in the dark hour of
 black night coming swiftly on them when the herdsman is not by even so
 were the achaians terrorstricken and strengthless for apollo sent a
 panic among them but still gave renown to the trojans and hector

 and hector smote his horses on the shoulder with the lash and called
 aloud on the trojans along the ranks and they all cried out and level
 with his held the steeds that drew their chariots with a marvellous
 din and in front of them phoebus apollo lightly dashed down with his
 feet the banks of the deep ditch and cast them into the midst thereof
 making a bridgeway long and wide as is a spearcast when a man throws
 to make trial of his strength thereby the trojans poured forward in
 their battalions while in their van apollo held the splendid aegis and
 most easily did he cast down the wall of the achaians as when a boy
 scatters the sand beside the sea first making sand buildings for sport
 in his childishness and then again in his sport confounding them with
 his feet and hands even so didst thou archer apollo confound the long
 toil and labour of the argives and among them rouse a panic fear

 so they were halting and abiding by the ships calling each to other
 and lifting their hands to all the gods did each man pray vehemently
 and chiefly prayed nestor the warden of the achaians stretching his
 hand towards the starry heaven "o father zeus if ever any one of us in
 wheatbearing argos did burn to thee fat thighs of bull or sheep and
 prayed that he might return and thou didst promise and assent thereto
 of these things be thou mindful and avert olympian the pitiless day
 nor suffer the trojans thus to overcome the achaians"

 so spake he in his prayer and zeus the lord of counsel thundered
 loudly hearing the prayers of the ancient son of neleus

 but the trojans when they heard the thunder of aegisbearing zeus
 rushed yet the more eagerly upon the argives and were mindful of the
 joy of battle and as when a great wave of the wide sea sweeps over the
 bulwarks of a ship the might of the wind constraining it which chiefly
 swells the waves even so did the trojans with a great cry bound over
 the wall and drave their horses on and at the hindmost row of the
 ships were fighting hand to hand with doublepointed spears the trojans
 from the chariots but the achaians climbing up aloft from the black
 ships with long pikes that they had lying in the ships for battle at
 sea jointed pikes shod at the head with bronze

 now the trojans like ravening lions rushed upon the ships fulfilling
 the behests of zeus that ever was rousing their great wrath but
 softened the temper of the argives and took away their glory while he
 spurred on the others for the heart of zeus was set on giving glory to
 hector the son of priam that withal he might cast fierceblazing fire
 unwearied upon the beaked ships and so fulfil all the presumptuous
 prayer of thetis wherefore wisecounselling zeus awaited till his eyes
 should see the glare of a burning ship for even from that hour was he
 to ordain the backward chase of the trojans from the ships and to give
 glory to the danaans with this design was he rousing hector priam's
 son that himself was right eager against the hollow ships for short
 of life was he to be yea and already pallas athene was urging against
 him the day of destiny at the hand of the son of peleus and fain he
 was to break the ranks of men trying them wheresoever he saw the
 thickest press and the goodliest harness yet not even so might he
 break them for all his eagerness nay they stood firm and embattled
 like a steep rock and a great hard by the hoary sea a rock that abides
 the swift paths of the shrill winds and the swelling waves that roar
 against it even so the danaans steadfastly abode the trojans and fled
 not away but hector shining with fire on all sides leaped on the
 throng and fell upon them as when beneath the stormclouds a fleet
 wave reared of the winds falls on a swift ship and she is all hidden
 with foam and the dread blast of the wind roars against the sail and
 the sailors fear and tremble in their hearts for by but a little way
 are they borne forth from death even so the spirit was torn in the
 breasts of the achaians

 so again keen battle was set by the ships thou wouldst deem that
 unwearied and unworn they met each other in war so eagerly they fought
 and in their striving they were minded thus the achaians verily deemed
 that never would they flee from the danger but perish there but the
 heart of each trojan hoped in his breast that they should fire the
 ships and slay the heroes of the achaians with these imaginations they
 stood to each other and hector seized the stern of a seafaring ship a
 fair ship swift on the brine that had borne protesilaos to troia but
 brought him not back again to his own country now round his ship the
 achaians and trojans warred on each other hand to hand nor far apart
 did they endure the flights of arrows nor of darts but standing hard
 each by other with one heart with sharp axes and hatchets they fought
 and with great swords and doublepointed spears and many fair brands
 darkscabbarded and hilted fell to the ground some from the hands
 some from off the shoulders of warring men and the black earth ran with
 blood but hector after that once he had seized the ship's stern left
 not his hold keeping the ensign in his hands and he called to the
 trojans "bring fire and all with one voice do ye raise the warcry
 now hath zeus given us the dearest day of allto take the ships that
 came hither against the will of the gods and brought many woes upon us
 by the cowardice of the elders who withheld me when i was eager to
 fight at the sterns of the ships and kept back the host but if even
 then farseeing zeus did harm our wits now he himself doth urge and
 command us onwards" so spake he and they set yet the fiercer on the
 argives and aias no longer abode their onset for he was driven back by
 the darts but he withdrew a littlethinking that now he should
 dieon to the oarsman's bench of seven feet long and he left the
 decks of the trim ship there then he stood on the watch and with his
 spear he ever drave the trojans from the ships whosoever brought
 unwearied fire and ever he shouted terribly calling to the danaans "o
 friends danaan heroes men of ares' company play the man my friends
 and be mindful of impetuous valour do we deem that there be allies at
 our backs or some wall stronger than this to ward off death from men
 verily there is not hard by any city arrayed with towers whereby we
 might defend ourselves having a host that could turn the balance of
 battle nay but we are set down in the plain of the mailed men of troy
 with our backs against the sea and far off from our own land therefore
 is safety in battle and not in slackening from the fight" so spake he
 and rushed on ravening for battle with his keen spear and whosoever of
 the trojans was coming against the ship with blazing fire to pleasure
 hector at his urging him would aias wound awaiting him with his long
 spear and twelve men in front of the ships at close quarters did he
 wound



 book xvi

 how patroklos fought in the armour of achilles and drove
 the trojans from the ships but was slain at last by hector

 so they were warring round the welltimbered ship but patroklos drew
 near achilles shepherd of the host and he shed warm tears even as a
 fountain of dark water that down a steep cliff pours its cloudy stream
 and noble swiftfooted achilles when he beheld him was grieved for his
 sake and accosted him and spake winged words saying "wherefore
 weepest thou patroklos like a fond little maid that runs by her
 mother's side and bids her mother take her up snatching at her gown
 and hinders her in her going and tearfully looks at her till the
 mother takes her up like her patroklos dost thou let fall soft tears
 hast thou aught to tell to the myrmidons or to me myself or is it some
 tidings out of phthia that thou alone hast beard or dost thou lament
 for the sake of the argiveshow they perish by the hollow ships
 through their own transgression speak out and hide it not within thy
 spirit that we may both know all"

 but with a heavy groan didst thou speak unto him o knight patroklos "o
 achilles son of peleus far the bravest of the achaians be not wroth
 seeing that so great calamity has beset the achaians for verily all of
 them that aforetime were the best are lying among the ships smitten and
 wounded smitten is the son of tydeus strong diomedes and wounded is
 odysseus spearman renowned and agamemnon and smitten is eurypylos on
 the thigh with an arrow and about them the leeches skilled in medicines
 are busy healing their wounds but thou art hard to reconcile
 achilles never then may such wrath take hold of me as that thou
 nursest thou brave to the hurting of others what other men later born
 shall have profit of thee if thou dost not ward off base ruin from the
 argives pitiless that thou art the knight peleus was not then thy
 father nor thetis thy mother but the grey sea bare thee and the sheer
 cliffs so untoward is thy spirit but if in thy heart thou art shunning
 some oracle and thy lady mother hath told thee somewhat from zeus yet
 me do thou send forth quickly and make the rest of the host of the
 myrmidons follow me if yet any light may arise from me to the danaans
 and give me thy harness to buckle about my shoulders if perchance the
 trojans may take me for thee and so abstain from battle and the
 warlike sons of the achaians may take breath wearied as they be for
 brief is the breathing in war and lightly might we that are fresh drive
 men wearied with the battle back to the citadel away from the ships and
 the huts"

 so he spake and besought him in his unwittingness for truly it was to
 be his own evil death and fate that he prayed for then to him in great
 heaviness spake swiftfooted achilles "ah me patroklos of the seed of
 zeus what word hast thou spoken neither take i heed of any oracle that
 i wot of nor yet has my lady mother told me somewhat from zeus but
 this dread sorrow comes upon my heart and spirit from the hour that a
 man wishes to rob me who am his equal and to take away my prize for
 that he excels me in power a dread sorrow to me is this after all the
 toils that my heart hath endured the maiden that the sons of the
 achaians chose out for me as my prize and that i won with my spear when
 i sacked a wellwalled city her has mighty agamemnon the son of atreus
 taken back out of my hands as though i were but some sojourner
 dishonourable but we will let bygones be bygones no man may be angry
 of heart for ever yet verily i said that i would not cease from my
 wrath until that time when to mine own ships should come the warcry
 and the battle but do thou on thy shoulders my famous harness and lead
 the warloving myrmidons to the fight to ward off destruction from the
 ships lest they even burn the ships with blazing fire and take away
 our desired return but when thou hast driven them from the ships
 return and even if the loudthundering lord of hera grant thee to win
 glory yet long not thou apart from me to fight with the warloving
 trojans thereby wilt thou minish mine honour neither do thou exulting
 in war and strife and slaying the trojans lead on toward ilios lest
 one of the eternal gods from olympus come against thee right dearly
 doth apollo the fardarter love them nay return back when thou halt
 brought safety to the ships and suffer the rest to fight along the
 plain for would o father zeus and athene and apollo would that not
 one of all the trojans might escape death nor one of the argives but
 that we twain might avoid destruction that alone we might undo the
 sacred coronal of troy"

 so spake they each to other but aias no longer abode the onset for he
 was overpowered by darts the counsel of zeus was subduing him and the
 shafts of the proud trojans and his bright helmet being smitten kept
 ringing terribly about his temples for always it was smitten upon the
 fairwrought cheekpieces moreover his left shoulder was wearied as
 steadfastly he held up his glittering shield nor yet could they make
 him give ground as they pressed on with their darts around him and
 ever he was worn out with difficult breath and much sweat kept running
 from all his limbs nor had he a moment to draw breath so on all sides
 was evil heaped on evil

 tell me now ye muses that have mansions in olympus how first fire fell
 on the ships of the achaians hector drew near and the ashen spear of
 aias he smote with his great sword hard by the socket behind the
 point and shore it clean away and the son of telamon brandished in his
 hand no more than a pointless spear and far from him the head of bronze
 fell ringing on the ground

 and aias knew in his noble heart and shuddered at the deeds of the
 gods even how zeus that thundereth on high did utterly cut off from him
 avail in war and desired victory for the trojans then aias gave back
 out of the darts but the trojans cast on the swift ship unwearying
 fire and instantly the inextinguishable flame streamed over her so the
 fire begirt the stern whereon achilles smote his thighs and spake to
 patroklos "arise patroklos of the seed of zeus commander of the
 horsemen for truly i see by the ships the rush of the consuming fire
 up then lest they take the ships and there be no more retreat do on
 thy harness speedily and i will summon the host"

 so spake he while patroklos was harnessing him in shining bronze his
 goodly greaves fitted with silver clasps he first girt round his legs
 and next did on around his breast the welldight starry corslet of the
 swiftfooted son of aiakos and round his shoulders he cast a sword of
 bronze with studs of silver and next took the great and mighty shield
 and on his proud head set a wellwrought helm with a horsehair crest
 and terribly nodded the crest from above then seized he two strong
 lances that fitted his grasp only he took not the spear of the noble
 son of aiakos heavy and huge and stalwart that none other of the
 achaians could wield and patroklos bade automedon to yoke the horses
 speedily even automedon whom most he honoured after achilles the
 breaker of the ranks of men and whom he held trustiest in battle to
 abide his call and for him automedon led beneath the yoke the swift
 horses xanthos and balios that fly as swift as the winds the horses
 that the harpy podarge bare to the west wind as she grazed on the
 meadow by the stream of okeanos and in the sidetraces he put the
 goodly pedasos that achilles carried away when he took the city of
 eetion and being but a mortal steed he followed with the immortal
 horses

 meanwhile achilles went and harnessed all the myrmidons in the huts with
 armour and they gathered like ravening wolves with strength in their
 hearts unspeakable and among them all stood warlike achilles urging on
 the horses and the targeteers and he aroused the heart and valour of
 each of them and the ranks were yet the closer serried when they heard
 the prince and as when a man builds the wall of a high house with
 closeset stones to avoid the might of the winds even so close were
 arrayed the helmets and bossy shields and shield pressed on shield
 helm on helm and man on man and the horsehair crests on the bright
 helmetridges touched each other when they nodded so close they stood
 by each other

 and straightway they poured forth like wasps that have their dwelling by
 the wayside and that boys are ever wont to vex always tormenting them
 in their nests beside the way in childish sport and a common evil they
 make for many with heart and spirit like theirs the myrmidons poured
 out now from the ships and a cry arose unquenchable and patroklos
 called on his comrades shouting aloud "myrmidons ye comrades of
 achilles son of peleus be men my friends and be mindful of your
 impetuous valour that so we may win honour for the son of peleus that
 is far the bravest of the argives by the ships and whose closefighting
 squires are the best and let wideruling agamemnon the son of atreus
 learn his own blindness of heart in that he nothing honoured the best
 of the achaians"

 so spake he and aroused each man's heart and courage and all in a mass
 they fell on the trojans and the ships around echoed wondrously to the
 cry of the achaians but when the trojans beheld the strong son of
 menoitios himself and his squire shining in their armour the heart
 was stirred in all of them and the companies wavered for they deemed
 that by the ships the swiftfooted son of peleus had cast away his
 wrath and chosen reconcilement then each man glanced round to see
 where he might flee sheer destruction

 but patroklos first with a shining spear cast straight into the press
 where most men were thronging even by the stern of the ship of
 greathearted protesilaos and he smote pyraichmes who led his paionian
 horsemen out of amydon from the wide water of axios him he smote on
 the right shoulder and he fell on his back in the dust with a groan
 and his comrades around him the paionians were afraid for patroklos
 sent fear among them all when he slew their leader that was ever the
 best in fight then he drove them out from the ships and quenched the
 burning fire and the halfburnt ship was left there and the trojans
 fled with a marvellous din and the danaans poured in among the hollow
 ships and ceaseless was the shouting and as when from the high crest
 of a great hill zeus the gatherer of the lightning hath stirred a
 dense cloud and forth shine all the peaks and sharp promontories and
 glades and from heaven the infinite air breaks open even so the
 danaans having driven the blazing fire from the ships for a little
 while took breath but there was no pause in the battle for not yet
 were the trojans driven in utter rout by the achaians dear to ares
 from the black ships but they still stood up against them and only
 perforce gave ground from the ships but even as robber wolves fall on
 the lambs or kids choosing them out of the herds when they are
 scattered on hills by the witlessness of the shepherd and the wolves
 behold it and speedily harry the younglings that have no heart of
 courageeven so the danaans fell on the trojans and they were mindful
 of illsounding flight and forgot their impetuous valour

 but that great aias ever was fain to cast his spear at hector of the
 helm of bronze but he in his cunning of war covered his broad
 shoulders with his shield of bulls' hide and watched the hurtling of
 the arrows and the noise of spears and verily well he knew the change
 in the mastery of war but even so he abode and was striving to rescue
 his trusty comrades

 and as when from olympus a cloud fares into heaven from the sacred air
 when zeus spreadeth forth the tempest even so from the ships came the
 warcry and the rout nor in order due did they cross the ditch again
 but his swiftfooted horses bare hector forth with his arms and he left
 the host of troy whom the delved trench restrained against their will
 and in the trench did many swift steeds that draw the car break the
 forepart of the pole and leave the chariots of their masters

 but patroklos followed after crying fiercely to the danaans and full
 of evil will against the trojans while they with cries and flight
 filled all the ways for they were scattered and on high the storm of
 dust was scattered below the clouds and the wholehooved horses
 strained back towards the city away from the ships and the huts

 but even where patroklos saw the folk thickest in the rout thither did
 he guide his horses with a cry and under his axletrees men fell prone
 from their chariots and the cars were overturned with a din of
 shattering but straight over the ditch in forward flight leaped the
 swift horses and the heart of patroklos urged him against hector for
 he was eager to smite him but his swift steeds bore hector forth and
 away and even as beneath a tempest the whole black earth is oppressed
 on an autumn day when zeus pours forth rain most vehemently and all
 the rivers run full and many a scaur the torrents tear away and down
 to the dark sea they rush headlong from the hills roaring mightily and
 minished are the works of men even so mighty was the roar of the trojan
 horses as they ran

 now patroklos when he had cloven the nearest companies drave them
 backward again to the ships nor suffered them to approach the city
 despite their desire but between the ships and the river and the
 lofty wall he rushed on them and slew them and avenged many a comrade
 slain there first he smote pronoos with a shining spear where the
 shield left bare the breast and loosened his limbs and he fell with a
 crash then thestor the son of enops he next assailed as he sat
 crouching in the polished chariot for he was struck distraught and the
 reins flew from his hands him he drew near and smote with the lance on
 the right jaw and clean pierced through his teeth and patroklos caught
 hold of the spear and dragged him over the rim of the car as when a man
 sits on a jutting rock and drags a sacred fish forth from the sea with
 line and glittering hook of bronze so on the bright spear dragged he
 thestor gaping from the chariot and cast him down on his face and life
 left him as he fell next as euryalos came on he smote him on the
 midst of the head with a stone and all his head was shattered within
 the strong helmet and prone on the earth he fell and death that
 slayeth the spirit overwhelmed him next erymas and amphoteros and
 epaltes and tlepolemos son of damastor and echios and pyris and ipheus
 and euippos and polymelos son of argeas all these in turn he brought
 low to the bounteous earth but when sarpedon beheld his comrades with
 ungirdled doublets subdued beneath the hands of patroklos son of
 menoitios he cried aloud upbraiding the godlike lykians "shame ye
 lykians whither do ye flee now be ye strong for i will encounter this
 man that i may know who he is that conquers here and verily many evils
 hath he wrought the trojans in that he hath loosened the knees of many
 men and noble"

 so spake he and leaped with his arms from the chariot to the ground
 but patroklos on the other side when he beheld him leaped from his
 chariot and they like vultures of crooked talons and curved beaks
 that war with loud yells on some high cliff even so they rushed with
 cries against each other and beholding then the son of kronos of the
 crooked counsels took pity on them and he spake to hera his sister and
 wife "ah woe is me for that it is fated that sarpedon the bestbeloved
 of men to me shall be subdued under patroklos son of menoitios and in
 two ways my heart within my breast is divided as i ponder whether i
 should catch him up alive out of the tearful war and set him down in
 the rich land of lykia or whether i should now subdue him beneath the
 hands of the son of menoitios"

 then the oxeyed lady hera made answer to him "most dread son of
 kronos what word is this thou hast spoken a mortal man long doomed to
 fate dost thou desire to deliver again from death of evil name work thy
 will but all we other gods will in no wise praise thee and another
 thing i will tell thee and do thou lay it up in thy heart if thou dost
 send sarpedon living to his own house consider lest thereon some other
 god likewise desire to send his own dear son away out of the strong
 battle for round the great citadel of priam war many sons of the
 immortals and among the immortals wilt thou send terrible wrath but if
 he be dear to thee and thy heart mourns for him truly then suffer him
 to be subdued in the strong battle beneath the hands of patroklos son of
 menoitios but when his soul and life leave that warrior send death and
 sweet sleep to bear him even till they come to the land of wide lykia
 there will his kindred and friends bury him with a barrow and a pillar
 for this is the due of the dead"

 so spake she nor did the father of gods and men disregard her but he
 shed bloody raindrops on the earth honouring his dear son that
 patroklos was about to slay in the deepsoiled land of troia far off
 from his own country now when they were come near each other in onset
 there verily did patroklos smite the renowned thrasymelos the good
 squire of the prince sarpedon on the lower part of the belly and
 loosened his limbs but sarpedon missed him with his shining javelin as
 he in turn rushed on but wounded the horse pedasos on the right
 shoulder with the spear and he shrieked as he breathed his life away
 and fell crying in the dust and his spirit fled from him but the other
 twain reared this way and that and the yoke creaked and the reins were
 confused on them when their tracehorse lay in the dust but thereof
 did automedon the spearman renowned find a remedy and drawing his
 longedged sword from his stout thigh he leaped forth and cut adrift
 the horse with no delay and the pair righted themselves and strained
 in the reins and they met again in lifedevouring war

 then again sarpedon missed with his shining dart and the point of the
 spear flew over the left shoulder of patroklos and smote him not but he
 in turn arose with the bronze and his javelin flew not vainly from his
 hand but struck sarpedon even where the midriff clasps the beating
 heart and he fell as falls an oak or a silver poplar or a slim pine
 tree that on the hills the shipwrights fell with whetted axes to be
 timber for shipbuilding even so before the horses and chariot he lay
 at length moaning aloud and clutching at the bloody dust and as when
 a lion hath fallen on a herd and slain a bull tawny and high of heart
 among the kine of trailing gait and he perishes groaning beneath the
 claws of the lion even so under patroklos did the leader of the lykian
 shieldmen rage even in death and he called to his dear comrade "dear
 glaukos warrior among warlike men now most doth it behove thee to be a
 spearman and a hardy fighter now let baneful war be dear to thee if
 indeed thou art a man of might first fare all about and urge on the
 heroes that be leaders of the lykians to fight for sarpedon and
 thereafter thyself do battle for me with the sword for to thee even in
 time to come shall i be shame and disgrace for ever all thy days if
 the achaians strip me of mine armour fallen in the gathering of the
 ships nay hold out manfully and spur on all the host"

 even as he spake thus the end of death veiled over his eyes and his
 nostrils but patroklos setting foot on his breast drew the spear out
 of his flesh and the midriff followed with the spear so that he drew
 forth together the spear point and the soul of sarpedon and the
 myrmidons held there his panting steeds eager to fly afar since the
 chariot was reft of its lords

 then dread sorrow came on glaukos when he heard the voice of sarpedon
 and his heart was stirred that he availed not to succour him and with
 his hand he caught and held his arm for the wound galled him the wound
 of the arrow wherewith as he pressed on towards the lofty wall teukros
 had smitten him warding off destruction from his fellows then in
 prayer spake glaukos to fardarting apollo "hear o prince that art
 somewhere in the rich land of lykia or in troia for thou canst listen
 everywhere to the man that is in need as even now need cometh upon me
 for i have this stark wound and mine arm is thoroughly pierced with
 sharp pains nor can my blood be stanched and by the wound is my
 shoulder burdened and i cannot hold my spear firm nor go and fight
 against the enemy and the best of men has perished sarpedon the son
 of zeus and he succours not even his own child but do thou o prince
 heal me this stark wound and lull my pains and give me strength that
 i may call on my lykian kinsmen and spur them to the war and myself
 may fight about the dead man fallen"

 so spake he in his prayer and phoebus apollo heard him straightway he
 made his pains to cease and in the grievous wound stanched the black
 blood and put courage into his heart and glaukos knew it within him
 and was glad for that the great god speedily heard his prayer first
 went he all about and urged on them that were leaders of the lykians to
 fight around sarpedon and thereafter he went with long strides among
 the trojans to polydamas son of panthoos and noble agenor and he went
 after aineias and hector of the helm of bronze and standing by them
 spake winged words "hector now surely art thou utterly forgetful of
 the allies that for thy sake far from their friends and their own
 country breathe their lives away but thou carest not to aid them
 sarpedon lies low the leader of the lykian shieldmen he that defended
 lykia by his dooms and his might yea him hath mailed ares subdued
 beneath the spear of patroklos but friends stand by him and be angry
 in your hearts lest the myrmidons strip him of his harness and
 dishonour the dead in wrath for the sake of the danaans even them that
 perished whom we slew with spears by the swift ships"

 so spake he and sorrow seized the trojans utterly ungovernable and not
 to be borne for sarpedon was ever the stay of their city all a
 stranger as he was for many people followed with him and himself the
 best warrior of them all then they made straight for the danaans
 eagerly and hector led them being wroth for sarpedon's sake but the
 fierce heart of patrokloa son of menoitios urged on the achaians and he
 spake first to the twain aiantes that themselves were right eager
 "aiantes now let defence be your desire and be such as afore ye were
 among men or even braver yet that man lies low who first leaped on to
 the wall of the achaians even sarpedon nay let us strive to take him
 and work his body shame and strip the harness from his shoulders and
 many a one of his comrades fighting for his sake let us subdue with the
 pitiless bronze"

 so spake he and they themselves were eager in defence so on both
 sides they strengthened the companies trojans and lykians myrmidons
 and achaians and they joined battle to fight around the dead man
 fallen terribly they shouted and loud rang the harness of men and as
 the din ariseth of woodcutters in the glades of a mountain and the
 sound thereof is heard far away so rose the din of them from the
 widewayed earth the noise of bronze and of welltanned bulls' hides
 smitten with swords and doublepointed spears and now not even a
 clearsighted man could any longer have known noble sarpedon for with
 darts and blood and dust was he covered wholly from head to foot and
 ever men thronged about the dead as in a steading flies buzz around the
 full milkpails in the season of spring when the milk drenches the
 bowls even so thronged they about the dead nor ever did zeus turn from
 the strong fight his shining eyes but ever looked down on them and
 much in his heart he debated of the slaying of patroklos whether there
 and then above divine sarpedon glorious hector should slay him likewise
 in strong battle with the sword and strip his harness from his
 shoulders or whether to more men yet he should deal sheer labour of
 war and thus to him as he pondered it seemed the better way that the
 gallant squire of achilles peleus' son should straightway drive the
 trojans and hector of the helm of bronze towards the city and should
 rob many of their life and in hector first he put a weakling heart and
 leaping into his car hector turned in flight and cried on the rest of
 the trojans to flee for he knew the turning of the sacred scales of
 zeus thereon neither did the strong lykians abide but fled all in
 fear when they beheld their king stricken to the heart lying in the
 company of the dead for many had fallen above him when kronion made
 fierce the fight then the others stripped from the shoulders of
 sarpedon his shining arms of bronze and these the strong son of
 menoitios gave to his comrades to bear to the hollow ships then zeus
 that gathereth the clouds spake to apollo "prithee dear phoebus go
 take sarpedon out of range of darts and cleanse the black blood from
 him and thereafter bear him far away and bathe him in the streams of
 the river and anoint him with ambrosia and clothe him in garments that
 wax not old and send him to be wafted by fleet convoy by the twin
 brethren sleep and death that quickly will set him in the rich land of
 wide lykia there will his kinsmen and clansmen give him burial with
 barrow and pillar for such is the due of the dead"

 so spake he nor was apollo disobedient to his father he went down the
 hills of ida to the dread battle din and straight way bore goodly
 sarpedon out of the darts and carried him far away and bathed him in
 the streams of the river and anointed him with ambrosia and clad him
 in garments that wax not old and sent him to be wafted by fleet convoy
 the twin brethren sleep and death that swiftly set him down in the rich
 land of wide lykia but patroklos cried to his horses and automedon and
 after the trojans and lykians went he and so was blindly forgetful in
 his witlessness for if he had kept the saying of the son of peleus
 verily he should have escaped the evil fate of black death but ever is
 the wit of zeus stronger than the wit of men so now he roused the
 spirit of patroklos in his breast there whom first whom last didst
 thou slay patroklos when the gods called thee deathward adrestos
 first and autonoos and echeklos and perimos son of megas and
 epistor and melanippos and thereafter elasos and moulios and
 pylartes these he slew but the others were each man of them fain of
 flight then would the sons of the achaians have taken highgated troy
 by the hands of patroklos for around and before him he raged with the
 spear but that phoebus apollo stood on the wellbuilded wall with
 baneful thoughts towards patroklos and succouring the trojans thrice
 clomb patroklos on the corner of the lofty wall and thrice did apollo
 force him back and smote the shining shield with his immortal hands but
 when for the fourth time he came on like a god then cried fardarting
 apollo terribly and spake winged words "give back patroklos of the
 seed of zeus not beneath thy spear is it fated that the city of the
 valiant trojans shall fall nay nor beneath achilles a man far better
 than thou"

 so spake he and patroklos retreated far back avoiding the wrath of
 fardarting apollo but hector within the skaian gates was restraining
 his wholehooved horses pondering whether he should drive again into
 the din and fight or should call unto the host to gather to the wall
 while thus he was thinking phoebus apollo stood by him in the guise of
 a young man and a strong asios who was the mother's brother of
 horsetaming hector being own brother of hekabe and son of dymas who
 dwelt in phrygia on the streams of sangarios in his guise spake
 apollo son of zeus to hector "hector wherefore dost thou cease from
 fight it doth not behove thee would that i were as much stronger than
 thou as i am weaker thereon quickly shouldst thou stand aloof from war
 to thy hurt but come turn against patroklos thy stronghooved horses
 if perchance thou mayst slay him and apollo give thee glory"

 so spake the god and went back again into the moil of men but renowned
 hector bade wisehearted kebriones to lash his horses into the war then
 apollo went and passed into the press and sent a dread panic among the
 argives but to the trojans and hector gave he renown and hector let
 the other argives be and slew none of them but against patroklos he
 turned his stronghooved horses and patroklos on the other side leaped
 from his chariot to the ground with a spear in his left hand and in
 his other hand grasped a shining jagged stone that his hand covered
 firmly he planted himself and hurled it nor long did he shrink from his
 foe nor was his cast in vain but he struck kebriones the charioteer of
 hector the bastard son of renowned priam on the brow with the sharp
 stone as he held the reins of the horses both his brows the stone
 drave together and his bone held not but his eyes fell to the ground
 in the dust there in front of his feet then he like a diver fell
 from the wellwrought car and his spirit left his bones then taunting
 him didst thou address him knightly patroklos "out on it how nimble a
 man how lightly he diveth yea if perchance he were on the teeming
 deep this man would satisfy many by seeking for oysters leaping from
 the ship even if it were stormy weather so lightly now he diveth from
 the chariot into the plain verily among the trojans too there be diving
 men"

 so speaking he set on the hero kebriones with the rush of a lion that
 while wasting the cattlepens is smitten in the breast and his own
 valour is his bane even so against kebriones patroklos didst thou
 leap furiously but hector on the other side leaped from his chariot
 to the ground and these twain strove for kebriones like lions that on
 the mountain peaks fight both hungering both high of heart for a
 slain hind even so for kebriones' sake these two masters of the
 warcry patroklos son of menoitios and renowned hector were eager
 each to hew the other's flesh with the ruthless bronze

 hector then seized him by the head and slackened not hold while
 patroklos on the other side grasped him by the foot and thereon the
 others trojans and danaans joined strong battle and as the east wind
 and the south contend with one another in shaking a deep wood in the
 dells of a mountain shaking beech and ash and smoothbarked cornel
 tree that clash against each other their long boughs with marvellous
 din and a noise of branches broken so the trojans and achaians were
 leaping on each other and slaying nor had either side any thought of
 ruinous flight and many sharp darts were fixed around kebriones and
 winged arrows leaping from the bowstring and many mighty stones smote
 the shields of them that fought around him but he in the whirl of dust
 lay mighty and mightily fallen forgetful of his chivalry

 now while the sun was going about midheaven so long the darts smote
 either side and the host fell but when the sun turned to the time of
 the loosing of oxen lo then beyond their doom the achaians proved the
 better the hero kebriones drew they forth from the darts out of the
 tumult of the trojans and stripped the harness from his shoulders and
 with ill design against the trojans patroklos rushed upon them three
 times then rushed he on peer of swift ares shouting terribly and
 thrice he slew nine men but when the fourth time he sped on like a god
 thereon to thee patroklos did the end of life appear for phoebus met
 thee in the strong battle in dreadful wise and patroklos was not ware
 of him coming through the press for hidden in thick mist did he meet
 him and stood behind him and smote his back and broad shoulders with a
 downstroke of his hand and his eyes were dazed and from his head
 phoebus apollo smote the helmet that rolled rattling away with a din
 beneath the hooves of the horses the helm with upright socket and the
 crests were defiled with blood and dust and all the longshadowed spear
 was shattered in the hands of patroklos the spear great and heavy and
 strong and sharp while from his shoulders the tasselled shield with
 the baldric fell to the ground

 and the prince apollo son of zeus loosed his corslet and blindness
 seized his heart and his shining limbs were unstrung and he stood in
 amaze and at close quarters from behind a dardanian smote him on the
 back between the shoulders with a sharp spear even euphorbos son of
 panthoos who excelled them of his age in casting the spear and in
 horsemanship and in speed of foot even thus verily had he cast down
 twenty men from their chariots though then first had he come with his
 car to learn the lesson of war he it was that first smote a dart into
 thee knightly patroklos nor overcame thee but ran back again and
 mingled with the throng first drawing forth from the flesh his ashen
 spear nor did he abide the onset of patroklos unarmed as he was in
 the strife but patroklos being overcome by the stroke of the god and
 by the spear gave ground and retreated to the host of his comrades
 avoiding fate but hector when he beheld greathearted patroklos give
 ground being smitten with the keen bronze came nigh unto him through
 the ranks and wounded him with a spear in the lowermost part of the
 belly and drave the bronze clean through and he fell with a crash and
 sorely grieved the host of achaians and as when a lion hath overcome in
 battle an untiring boar they twain fighting with high heart on the
 crests of a hill about a little well and both are desirous to drink
 and the lion hath by force overcome the boar that draweth difficult
 breath so after that he had slain many did hector son of priam take the
 life away from the strong son of menoitios smiting him at close
 quarters with the spear and boasting over him he spake winged words
 "patroklos surely thou saidst that thou wouldst sack my town and from
 trojan women take away the day of freedom and bring them in ships to
 thine own dear country fool nay in front of these were the swift
 horses of hector straining their speed for the fight and myself in
 wielding the spear excel among the warloving trojans even i who ward
 from them the day of destiny but thee shall vultures here devour ah
 wretch surely achilles for all his valour availed thee not who
 straitly charged thee as thou camest he abiding there saying 'come
 not to me patroklos lord of steeds to the hollow ships till thou hast
 torn the gory doublet of manslaying hector about his breast' so
 surely he spake to thee and persuaded the wits of thee in thy
 witlessness"

 then faintly didst thou answer him knightly patroklos "boast greatly
 as now hector for to thee have zeus son of kronos and apollo given
 the victory who lightly have subdued me for themselves stripped my
 harness from my shoulders but if twenty such as thou had encountered
 me here had they all perished subdued beneath my spear but me have
 ruinous fate and the son of leto slain and of men euphorbos but thou
 art the third in my slaying but another thing will i tell thee and do
 thou lay it up in thy heart verily thou thyself art not long to live
 but already doth death stand hard by thee and strong fate that thou
 art to be subdued by the hands of noble achilles of the seed of
 aiakos"

 even as so he spake the end of death overshadowed him and his soul
 fleeting from his limbs went down to the house of hades wailing its
 own doom leaving manhood and youth

 then renowned hector spake to him even in his death "patroklos
 wherefore to me dolt thou prophesy sheer destruction who knows but that
 achilles the child of fairtressed thetis will first be smitten by my
 spear and lose his life"

 so spake he and drew the spear of bronze from the wound setting his
 foot on the dead and cast him off on his back from the spear and
 straightway with the spear he went after automedon the godlike squire
 of the swiftfooted aiakides for he was eager to smite him but his
 swiftfooted immortal horses bare him out of the battle horses that the
 gods gave to peleus a splendid gift



 book xvii

 of the battle around the body of patroklos

 but atreus' son menelaos dear to ares was not unaware of the slaying
 of patroklos by the trojans in the fray he went up through the front of
 the fight harnessed in flashing bronze and strode over the body as
 above a firstborn calf standeth lowing its mother thus above patroklos
 strode fairhaired menelaos and before him held his spear and the
 circle of his shield eager to slay whoever should encounter him then
 was panthoos' son of the stout ashen spear not heedless of noble
 patroklos as he lay and he smote on the circle of the shield of
 menelaos but the bronze spear brake it not but the point was bent back
 in the stubborn shield and menelaos atreus' son in his turn made at him
 with his bronze spear having prayed unto father zeus and as he gave
 back pierced the nether part of his throat and threw his weight into
 the stroke following his heavy hand and sheer through the tender neck
 went the point of the spear and he fell with a crash and his armour
 rang upon him in blood was his hair drenched that was like unto the
 hair of the graces and his tresses closely knit with bands of silver
 and gold

 then easily would the son of atreus have borne off the noble spoils of
 panthoos' son had not phoebus apollo grudged it to him and aroused
 against him hector peer of swift ares putting on the semblance of a
 man of mentes chief of the kikones and he spake aloud to him winged
 words "hector now art thou hasting after things unattainable even the
 horses of wise aiakides for hard are they to be tamed or driven by
 mortal man save only achilles whom an immortal mother bare meanwhile
 hath warlike menelaos atreus' son stridden over patroklos and slain the
 best of the trojans there even panthoos' son euphorbos and hath stayed
 him in his impetuous might"

 thus saying the god went back into the strife of men but dire grief
 darkened hectors inmost soul and then he gazed searchingly along the
 lines and straightway was aware of the one man stripping off the noble
 arms and the other lying on the earth and blood was flowing about the
 gaping wound then he went through the front of the fight harnessed in
 flashing bronze crying a shrill cry like unto hephaistos' flame
 unquenchable not deaf to his shrill cry was atreus' son and sore
 troubled he spake to his great heart "ay me if i shall leave behind me
 these goodly arms and patroklos who here lieth for my vengeance' sake
 i fear lest some danaan beholding it be wroth against me but if for
 honour's sake i do battle alone with hector and the trojans i fear lest
 they come about me many against one for all the trojans is
 brighthelmed hector leading hither but if i might somewhere find aias
 of the loud warcry then both together would we go and be mindful of
 battle even were it against the power of heaven if haply we might save
 his dead for achilles peleus' son that were best among these ills"

 while thus he communed with his mind and heart therewithal the trojan
 ranks came onward and hector at their head then menelaos gave
 backward and left the dead man turning himself ever about like a
 deepwaned lion which men and dogs chase from a fold with spears and
 cries and his strong heart within him groweth chill and loth goeth he
 from the steading so from patroklos went fairhaired menelaos and
 turned and stood when he came to the host of his comrades searching
 for mighty aias telamon's son him very speedily he espied on the left
 of the whole battle cheering his comrades and rousing them to fight
 for great terror had phoebus apollo sent on them and he hasted him to
 run and straightway stood by him and said "this way beloved aias let
 us bestir us for the dead patroklos if haply his naked corpse at least
 we may carry to achilles though his armour is held by hector of the
 glancing helm"

 thus spake he and aroused the heart of wise aias and he went up
 through the front of the fight and with him fairhaired menelaos now
 hector when he had stripped from patroklos his noble armour was
 dragging him thence that he might cut off the head from the shoulders
 with the keen bronze and carry his body to give to the dogs of troy but
 aias came anigh and the shield that he bare was as a tower then hector
 gave back into the company of his comrades and sprang into his chariot
 and the goodly armour he gave to the trojans to carry to the city to be
 great glory unto him but aias spread his broad shield over the son of
 menoitios and stood as it were a lion before his whelps when huntsmen in
 a forest encounter him as he leadeth his young and by his side stood
 atreus' son menelaos dear to ares nursing great sorrow in his breast

 then hector called on the trojans with a mighty shout "trojans and
 lykians and dardanians that fight hand to hand be men my friends and
 bethink you of impetuous valour until i do on me the goodly arms of
 noble achilles that i stripped from brave patroklos when i slew him"

 thus having spoken went hector of the glancing helm forth out of the
 strife of war and ran and speedily with fleet feet following overtook
 his comrades not yet far off who were bearing to the city peleides'
 glorious arms and standing apart from the dolorous battle he changed
 his armour his own he gave the warlike trojans to carry to sacred
 ilios and he put on the divine arms of achilles peleus' son

 but when zeus that gathereth the clouds beheld from afar off hector
 arming him in the armour of peleus' godlike son he shook his head and
 spake thus unto his soul "ah hapless man no thought is in thy heart
 of death that yet draweth nigh unto thee thou doest on thee the divine
 armour of a peerless man before whom the rest have terror his comrade
 gentle and brave thou hast slain and unmeetly hast stripped the armour
 from his head and shoulders yet now for a while at least i will give
 into thy hands great might in recompense for this even that nowise
 shalt thou come home out of the battle for andromache to receive from
 thee peleides' glorious arms"

 thus spake the son of kronos and bowed his dark brows therewithal

 but the armour fitted itself unto hectors body and ares the dread
 wargod entered into him and his limbs were filled within with valour
 and strength then he sped among the noble allies with a mighty cry and
 in the flashing of his armour he seemed to all of them like unto peleus'
 greathearted son and he came to each and encouraged him with his
 wordsmesthles and glaukos and medon and thersilochos and asteropaios
 and deisenor and hippothoos and phorkys and chromios and the augur
 ennomosthese encouraged he and spake to them winged words "listen ye
 countless tribes of allies that dwell round about it was not for mere
 numbers that i sought or longed when i gathered each of you from your
 cities but that ye might zealously guard the trojans' wives and infant
 little ones from the warloving achaians for this end am i wearying my
 people by taking gifts and food from them and nursing thereby the
 courage of each of you now therefore let all turn straight against the
 foe and live or die for such is the dalliance of war and whoso shall
 drag patroklos dead though he be among the horsetaming men of troy
 and make aias yield to him will i award half the spoils and keep half
 myself so shall his glory be great as mine"

 thus spake he and they against the danaans charged with all their
 weight levelling their spears and their hearts were high of hope to
 drag the corpse from under aias telamon's son fond men from full many
 reft he life over that corpse and then spake aias to menelaos of the
 loud warcry "dear menelaos fosterling of zeus no longer count i that
 we two of ourselves shall return home out of the war nor have i so much
 dread for the corpse of patroklos that shall soon glut the dogs and
 birds of the men of troy as for thy head and mine lest some evil fall
 thereon for all is shrouded by a stormcloud of war even by hector
 and sheer doom stareth in our face but come call thou to the best men
 of the danaans if haply any hear"

 thus spake he and menelaos of the loud warcry disregarded him not but
 shouted unto the danaans crying a farheard cry "o friends ye leaders
 and counsellors of the argives who by the side of the sons of atreus
 agamemnon and menelaos drink at the common cost and are all commanders
 of the host on whom wait glory and honour from zeus hard is it for me
 to distinguish each chief amid the presssuch blaze is there of the
 strife of war but let each go forward of himself and be wroth at heart
 that patroklos should become a sport among the dogs of troy"

 thus spake he and oileus' son fleet aias heard him clearly and was
 first to run along the mellay to meet him and after him idomeneus and
 idomeneus' brotherinarms meriones peer of the manslaying wargod
 and who shall of his own thought tell the names of the rest even of all
 that after these aroused the battle of the achaians

 now the trojans charged forward in close array and hector led them and
 as when at the mouth of some heavenborn river a mighty wave roareth
 against the stream and arouseth the high cliffs' echo as the salt sea
 belloweth on the beach so loud was the cry wherewith the trojans came
 but the achaians stood firm around menoitios' son with one soul all
 walled in with shields of bronze and over their bright helmets the son
 of kronos shed thick darkness for in the former time was menoitios' son
 not unloved of him while he was yet alive and squire of aiakides so
 was zeus loth that he should become a prey of the dogs of his enemies at
 troy and stirred his comrades to do battle for him

 now first the trojans thrust back the glancingeyed achaians who shrank
 before them and left the dead yet the proud trojans slew not any of
 them with spears though they were fain but set to hale the corpse but
 little while would the achaians hold back therefrom for very swiftly
 aias rallied them aias the first in presence and in deeds of all the
 danaans after the noble son of peleus right through the fighters in the
 forefront rushed he like a wild boar in his might that in the mountains
 when he turneth at bay scattereth lightly dogs and lusty young men
 through the glades thus did proud telamon's son the glorious aias press
 on the trojan battalions and lightly scatter them as they had bestrode
 patroklos and were full fain to drag him to their city and win renown

 then would the trojans in their turn in their weakness overcome have
 been driven back into ilios by the achaians dear to ares and the
 argives would have won glory even against the appointment of zeus by
 their power and might but apollo himself aroused aineias putting on
 the semblance of periphas the herald the son of epytos who grew old
 with his old father in his heraldship of friendly thought toward
 aineias in his similitude spake apollo son of zeus "aineias how
 could ye ever guard high ilios if it were against the will of god other
 men have i seen that trust in their own might and power and valour and
 in their host even though they have scant folk to lead but here
 albeit zeus is fainer far to give victory to us than to the danaans yet
 ye are dismayed exceedingly and fight not"

 thus spake he and aineias knew fardarting apollo when he looked upon
 his face and spake unto hector shouting loud "hector and ye other
 leaders of the trojans and their allies shame were this if in our
 weakness overcome we were driven back into ilios by the achaians dear to
 ares nay thus saith a god who standeth by my side zeus highest
 orderer is our helper in this fight therefore let us go right onward
 against the danaans not easily at least let them take the dead
 patroklos to the ships"

 thus spake he and leapt forth far before the fighters in the front and
 the trojans rallied and stood up against the achaians thus strove they
 as it had been fire nor wouldst thou have thought there was still sun
 or moon for over all the battle where the chiefs stood around the slain
 son of menoitios they were shrouded in darkness while the other trojans
 and wellgreaved achaians fought at ease in the clear air and piercing
 sunlight was spread over them and on all the earth and hills there was
 no cloud seen and they ceased fighting now sad again avoiding each
 other's dolorous darts and standing far apart but they who were in the
 midst endured affliction of the darkness and the battle and all the
 best men of them were wearied by the pitiless weight of their bronze
 arms

 thus all day long waxed the mighty fray of their sore strife and
 unabatingly ever with the sweat of toil were the knees and legs and feet
 of each man and arms anal eyes bedewed as the two hosts did battle
 around the brave squire of fleet aiakides and as when a man giveth the
 hide of a great bull to his folk to stretch all soaked in fat and they
 take and stretch it standing in a circle and straightway the moisture
 thereof departeth and the fat entereth in under the haling of many
 hands and it is all stretched throughoutthus they on both sides
 haled the dead man this way and that in narrow space for their hearts
 were high of hope the trojans that they should drag him to ilios and
 the achaians to the hollow ships and around him the fray waxed wild
 nor might ares rouser of hosts nor athene despise the sight thereof
 albeit their anger were exceeding great

 such was the grievous travail of men and horses over patroklos that zeus
 on that day wrought but not as yet knew noble achilles aught of
 patroklos' death for far away from the swift ships they were fighting
 beneath the wall of the men of troy therefore never deemed he in his
 heart that he was dead but that he should come back alive after that
 he had touched the gates for neither that other thought had he anywise
 that patroklos should sack the stronghold without his aid

 now the rest continually around the dead man with their keen spears made
 onset relentlessly and slew each the other and thus would one speak
 among the mailclad achaians "friends it were verily not glorious for
 us to go back to the hollow ships rather let the black earth yawn for
 us all beneath our feet far better were that straightway for us if we
 suffer the horsetaming trojans to hale this man to their city and win
 renown"

 and thus on the other side would one of the greathearted trojans say
 "friends though it were our fate that all together we be slain beside
 this man let none yet give backward from the fray"

 thus would one speak and rouse the spirit of each so they fought on
 and the iron din went up through the high desert air unto the brazen
 heaven but the horses of aiakides that were apart from the battle were
 weeping since first they were aware that their charioteer was fallen in
 the dust beneath the hand of manslaying hector verily automedon
 diores' valiant son plied them oft with blows of the swift lash and
 oft with gentle words he spake to them and oft with chiding yet would
 they neither go back to the ships at the broad hellespont nor yet to the
 battle after the achaians but as a pillar abideth firm that standeth on
 the tomb of a man or woman dead so abode they immovably with the
 beautiful chariot abasing their heads unto the earth and hot tears
 flowed from their eyes to the ground as they mourned in sorrow for their
 charioteer and their rich manes were soiled as they drooped from
 beneath the yokecushion on both sides beside the yoke and when the son
 of kronos beheld them mourning he had compassion on them and shook his
 head and spake to his own heart "ah hapless pair why gave we you to
 king peleus a mortal man while ye are deathless and ever young was it
 that ye should suffer sorrows among illfated men for methinketh there
 is nothing more piteous than a man among all things that breathe and
 creep upon the earth but verily hector priam's son shall not drive you
 and your deftlywrought car that will i not suffer is it a small thing
 that he holdeth the armour and vaunteth himself vainly thereupon nay i
 will put courage into your knees and heart that ye may bring automedon
 also safe out of the war to the hollow ships for yet further will i
 increase victory to the men of troy so that they slay until they come
 unto the welltimbered ships and the sun set and divine night come
 down"

 thus saying he breathed good courage into the horses and they shook to
 earth the dust from their manes and lightly bare the swift car amid
 trojans and achaians and behind them fought automedon albeit in grief
 for his comrade swooping with his chariot as a vulture on wild geese
 for lightly he would flee out of the onset of the trojans and lightly
 charge pursuing them through the thick mellay yet could he not slay
 any man as he halted to pursue them for it was impossible that being
 alone in his sacred car he should at once assail them with the spear and
 hold his fleet horses then at last espied him a comrade even alkimedon
 son of laerkes son of haimon and he halted behind the car and spake
 unto automedon "automedon what god hath put into thy breast
 unprofitable counsel and taken from thee wisdom that thus alone thou
 art fighting against the trojans in the forefront of the press thy
 comrade even now was slain and hector goeth proudly wearing on his own
 shoulders the armour of aiakides"

 and automedon son of diores answered him saying "alkimedon what other
 achaian hath like skill to guide the spirit of immortal steeds save
 only patroklos peer of gods in counsel while he yet lived but now
 have death and fate overtaken him but take thou the lash and shining
 reins and i will get me down from my horses that i may fight"

 thus spake he and alkimedon leapt on the fleet warchariot and swiftly
 took the lash and reins in his hands and automedon leapt down and
 noble hector espied them and straightway spake unto aineias as he stood
 near "aineias counsellor of mailclad trojans i espy here the two
 horses of fleet aiakides come forth to battle with feeble charioteers
 therefore might i hope to take them if thou in thy heart art willing
 since they would not abide our onset and stand to do battle against us"

 thus spake he and the brave son of anchises disregarded him not and
 they twain went right onward their shoulders shielded by oxhides dried
 and tough and bronze thick overlaid and with them went both chromios
 and godlike aretos and their hearts were of high hope to slay the men
 and drive off the strongnecked horsesfond hope for not without blood
 lost were they to get them back from automedon he praying to father
 zeus was filled in his inmost heart with valour and strength and
 straightway he spake to alkimedon his faithful comrade "alkimedon
 hold the horses not far from me but with their very breath upon my
 back for i deem that hector the son of priam will not refrain him from
 his fury until he mount behind achilles' horses of goodly manes after
 slaying us twain and dismay the ranks of argive men or else himself
 fall among the foremost"

 thus said he and called upon the aiantes and menelaos "aiantes
 leaders of the argives and menelaos lo now commit ye the corpse unto
 whoso may best avail to bestride it and resist the ranks of men and
 come ye to ward the day of doom from us who are yet alive for here in
 the dolorous war are hector and aineias the best men of the trojans
 pressing hard yet verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods i too
 will cast my spear and the rest shall zeus decide"

 he said and poised his farshadowing spear and hurled it and smote on
 the circle of the shield of aretos and the shield sustained not the
 spear but right through went the bronze and he forced it into his
 belly low down through his belt and as when a strong man with a sharp
 axe smiting behind the horns of an ox of the homestead cleaveth the
 sinew asunder and the ox leapeth forward and falleth so leapt aretos
 forward and fell on his back and the spear in his entrails very
 piercingly quivering unstrung his limbs and hector hurled at automedon
 with his bright spear but he looked steadfastly on the bronze javelin
 as it came at him and avoided it for he stooped forward and the long
 spear fixed itself in the ground behind and the javelinbutt quivered
 and there dread ares took away its force and then had they lashed at
 each other with their swords hand to hand had not the aiantes parted
 them in their fury when they were come through the mellay at their
 comrades' call before them hector and aineias and godlike chromios
 shrank backward and gave ground and left aretos wounded to the death as
 he lay and automedon peer of swift ares stripped off the armour of
 the dead and spake exultingly "verily i have a little eased my heart
 of grief for the death of menoitios' son albeit a worse man than him
 have i slain"

 thus saying he took up the gory spoils and set them in his car and gat
 him thereon with feet and hands all bloody as a lion that hath
 devoured a bull

 now greathearted aias and menelaos were aware of zeus how he gave the
 trojans their turn to victory first of these to speak was great aias
 son of telamon "ay me now may any man even though he be a very fool
 know that father zeus himself is helping the trojans come let us
 ourselves devise some excellent means that we may both hale the corpse
 away and ourselves return home to the joy of our friends who grieve as
 they look hitherward and deem that no longer shall the fury of
 manslaying hector's unapproachable hand refrain itself but fall upon
 the black ships and would there were some comrade to carry tidings with
 all speed unto the son of peleus since i deem that he hath not even
 heard the grievous tidings how his dear comrade is slain but nowhere
 can i behold such an one among the achaians for themselves and their
 horses likewise are wrapped in darkness o father zeus deliver thou the
 sons of the achaians from the darkness and make clear sky and vouchsafe
 sight unto our eyes in the light be it that thou slayest us since it
 is thy good pleasure that we die"

 then fairhaired menelaos departed glancing everywhither as an eagle
 which men say hath keenest sight of all birds under heaven and though
 he be far aloft the fleetfooted hare eludeth him not by crouching
 beneath a leafy bush but the eagle swoopeth thereon and swiftly seizeth
 her and taketh her life thus in that hour menelaos fosterling of zeus
 ranged thy shining eyes everywhither through the multitude of the host
 of thy comrades if haply they might behold nestor's son yet alive him
 quickly he perceived at the left of the whole battle heartening his
 comrades and rousing them to fight and fairhaired menelaos came and
 stood nigh and said unto him "antilochos fosterling of zeus come
 hither that thou mayest learn woful tidingswould it had never been
 ere now i ween thou too hast known by thy beholding that god rolleth
 mischief upon the danaans and with the trojans is victory and slain is
 the best man of the achaians patroklos and great sorrow is wrought for
 the danaans but run thou to the ships of the achaians and quickly tell
 this to achilles if haply he may straightway rescue to his ship the
 naked corpse but his armour is held by hector of the glancing helmet"

 thus spake he and antilochos had horror of the word he heard and long
 time speechlessness possessed him and his eyes were filled with tears
 and his full voice choked yet for all this disregarded he not the
 bidding of menelaos but set him to run when he had given his armour to
 a noble comrade laodokos who close anigh him was wheeling his
 wholehooved horses

 so him his feet bare out of the battle weeping to achilles son of
 peleus carrying an evil tale but thy heart menelaos fosterling of
 zeus chose not to stay to aid the wearied comrades from whom antilochos
 departed and great sorrow was among the pylians but to them menelaos
 sent noble thrasymedes and himself went again to bestride the hero
 patroklos and he hasted and stood beside the aiantes and straightway
 spake to them "so have i sent that man to the swift ships to go to
 fleetfooted achilles yet deem i not that he will now come for all his
 wrath against noble hector for he could not fight unarmed against the
 men of troy but let us ourselves devise some excellent means both how
 we may hale the dead away and how we ourselves may escape death and
 fate amid the trojans' battlecry"

 then answered him great aias telamon's son saying "all this hast thou
 said well most noble menelaos but do thou and meriones put your
 shoulders beneath the dead and lift him and bear him swiftly out of the
 fray while we twain behind you shall do battle with the trojans and
 noble hector one in heart as we are in name for from of old time we
 are wont to await fierce battle side by side"

 thus spake he and the others took the dead man in their arms and lifted
 him mightily on high but the trojan host behind cried aloud when they
 saw the achaians lifting the corpse and charged like hounds that spring
 in front of hunteryouths upon a wounded wild boar and for a while run
 in haste to rend him but when he wheeleth round among them trusting in
 his might then they give ground and shrink back here and there thus
 for a while the trojans pressed on with all their power striking with
 swords and doubleheaded spears but when the aiantes turned about and
 halted over against them then they changed colour and none dared
 farther onset to do battle around the dead



 book xviii

 how achilles grieved for patroklos and how thetis asked for
 him new armour of hephaistos and of the making of the
 armour

 thus fought the rest in the likeness of blazing fire while to achilles
 came antilochos a messenger fleet of foot him found he in front of his
 ships of upright horns boding in his soul the things which even now
 were accomplished and sore troubled he spake to his great heart "ay
 me wherefore again are the flowinghaired achaians flocking to the
 ships and flying in rout over the plain may the gods not have wrought
 against me the grievous fears at my heart even as my mother revealed
 and told me that while i am yet alive the best man of the myrmidons must
 by deed of the men of troy forsake the light of the sun surely now must
 menoitios' valiant son be deadfoolhardy surely i bade him when he
 should have beaten off the fire of the foe to come back to the ships nor
 with hector fight amain"

 while thus he held debate in his heart and soul there drew nigh unto
 him noble nestor's son shedding hot tears and spake his grievous
 tidings "ay me wise peleus' son very bitter tidings must thou hear
 such as i would had never been fallen is patroklos and they are
 fighting around his body naked for his armour is held by hector of the
 glancing helm"

 thus spake he and a black cloud of grief enwrapped achilles and with
 both hands he took dark dust and poured it over his head and defiled his
 comely face and on his fragrant doublet black ashes fell and himself
 in the dust lay mighty and mightily fallen and with his own hands tore
 and marred his hair and the handmaidens whom achilles and patroklos
 took captive cried aloud in the grief of their hearts and ran forth
 around valiant achilles and all beat on their breasts with their hands
 and the knees of each of them were unstrung and antilochos on the other
 side wailed and shed tears holding achilles' hands while he groaned in
 his noble heart for he feared lest he should cleave his throat with the
 sword then terribly moaned achilles and his lady mother heard him as
 she sate in the depths of the sea beside her ancient sire and thereon
 she uttered a cry and the goddesses flocked around her all the
 daughters of nereus that were in the deep of the sea with these the
 bright cave was filled and they all beat together on their breasts and
 thetis led the lament "listen sister nereids that ye all hear and
 know well what sorrows are in my heart ay me unhappy ay me that bare
 to my sorrow the first of men for after i had borne a son noble and
 strong the chief of heroes and he shot up like a young branch then
 when i had reared him as a plant in a very fruitful field i sent him in
 beaked ships to ilios to fight against the men of troy but never again
 shall i welcome him back to his home to the house of peleus and while
 he yet liveth in my sight and beholdeth the light of the sun he
 sorroweth neither can i help him any whit though i go unto him but i
 will go that i may look upon my dear child and learn what sorrow hath
 come to him though he abide aloof from the war"

 thus spake she and left the cave and the nymphs went with her weeping
 and around them the surge of the sea was sundered and when they came to
 deepsoiled troyland they went up upon the shore in order where the
 ships of the myrmidons were drawn up thickly around fleet achilles and
 as he groaned heavily his lady mother stood beside him and with a
 shrill cry clasped the bead of her child and spake unto him winged
 words of lamentation "my child why weepest thou what sorrow hath come
 to thy heart tell it forth hide it not one thing at least hath been
 accomplished of zeus according to the prayer thou madest holding up to
 him thy hands that the sons of the achaians should all be pent in at
 the ships through lack of thee and should suffer hateful things"

 then groaning heavily spake unto her achilles fleet of foot "my mother
 that prayer truly hath the olympian accomplished for me but what
 delight have i therein since my dear comrade is dead patroklos whom i
 honoured above all my comrades as it were my very self him have i lost
 and hector that slew him hath stripped from him the armour great and
 fair a wonder to behold that the gods gave to peleus a splendid gift
 on the day when they laid thee in the bed of a mortal man would thou
 hadst abode among the deathless daughters of the sea and peleus had
 wedded a mortal bride but now that thou mayest have sorrow a thousand
 fold in thy heart for a dead son never shalt thou welcome him back
 home since my soul biddeth me also live no longer nor abide among men
 if hector be not first smitten by my spear and yield his life and pay
 for his slaughter of patroklos menoitios' son"

 then answered unto him thetis shedding tears "shortlived i ween must
 thou be then my child by what thou sayest for straightway after
 hector is death appointed unto thee"

 then mightily moved spake unto her achilles fleet of foot "straightway
 may i die since i might not succour my comrade at his slaying he hath
 fallen afar from his country and lacked my help in his sore need now
 therefore since i go not back to my dear native land neither have at
 all been succour to patroklos nor to all my other comrades that have
 been slain by noble hector but i sit beside my ships a profitless
 burden of the earth i that in war am such an one as is none else of the
 mailclad achaians though in council are others bettermay strife
 perish utterly among gods and men and wrath that stirreth even a wise
 man to be vexed wrath that far sweeter than trickling honey waxeth like
 smoke in the breasts of men even as i was wroth even now against
 agamemnon king of men but bygones will we let be for all our pain
 curbing the heart in our breasts under necessity now go i forth that i
 may light on the destroyer of him i loved on hector then will i accept
 my death whensoever zeus willeth to accomplish it and the other immortal
 gods for not even the mighty herakles escaped death albeit most dear
 to kronian zeus the king but fate overcame him and hera's cruel wrath
 so also shall i if my fate hath been fashioned likewise lie low when i
 am dead but now let me win high renown let me set some trojan woman
 some deepbosomed daughter of dardanos staunching with both hands the
 tears upon her tender cheeks and wailing bitterly yea let them know
 that i am come back though i tarried long from the war hold not me
 then from the battle in thy love for thou shalt not prevail with me"

 then thetis the silverfooted goddess answered him saying "yea verily
 my child no blame is in this that thou ward sheer destruction from thy
 comrades in their distress but thy fair glittering armour of bronze is
 held among the trojans hector of the glancing helm beareth it on his
 shoulders in triumph yet not for long i ween shall he glory therein
 for death is hard anigh him but thou go not yet down into the mellay
 of war until thou see me with thine eyes come hither in the morning
 will i return at the coming up of the sun bearing fair armour from the
 king hephaistos"

 thus spake she and turned to go from her son and as she turned she
 spake among her sisters of the sea "ye now go down within the wide
 bosom of the deep to visit the ancient one of the sea and our father's
 house and tell him all i am going to high olympus to hephaistos of
 noble skill if haply he will give unto my son noble armour shining
 gloriously"

 thus spake she and they forthwith went down beneath the surge of the
 sea and the silverfooted goddess thetis went on to olympus that she
 might bring noble armour to her son

 so her unto olympus her feet bore but the achaians with terrible cries
 were fleeing before manslaying hector till they came to the ships and
 to the hellespont nor might the wellgreaved achaians drag the corpse
 of patroklos achilles' squire out of the darts for now again overtook
 him the host and the horses of troy and hector son of priam in might
 as it were a flame of fire thrice did glorious hector seize him from
 behind by the feet resolved to drag him away and mightily called upon
 the men of troy thrice did the two aiantes clothed on with impetuous
 might beat him off from the dead man but he nathless trusting in his
 might anon would charge into the press anon would stand and cry aloud
 but he gave ground never a whit as when shepherds in the field avail
 nowise to chase a fiery lion in fierce hunger away from a carcase so
 availed not the two warrior aiantes to scare hector son of priam from
 the dead and now would he have won the body and gained renown
 unspeakable had not fleet windfooted iris come speeding from olympus
 with a message to the son of peleus to array him unknown of zeus and
 the other gods for hera sent her and she stood anigh and spake to him
 winged words "rouse thee son of peleus of all men most redoubtable
 succour patroklos for whose body is terrible battle afoot before the
 ships there slay they one another these guarding the dead corpse
 while the men of troy are fierce to hale him unto windy ilios and
 chiefliest noble hector is fain to drag him and his heart biddeth him
 fix the head on the stakes of the wall when he hath sundered it from the
 tender neck but arise lie thus no longer let awe enter thy heart to
 forbid that patroklos become the sport of dogs of troy thine were the
 shame if he go down mangled amid the dead"

 then answered her fleetfooted noble achilles "goddess iris what god
 sent thee a messenger unto me"

 and to him again spake windfooted fleet iris "it was hera that sent
 me the wise wife of zeus nor knoweth the highthroned son of kronos
 nor any other of the immortals that on snowy olympus have their
 dwellingplace"

 and achilles fleet of foot made answer to her and said "and how may i
 go into the fray the trojans hold my arms and my dear mother bade me
 forbear to array me until i behold her with my eyes returned for she
 promised to bring fair armour from hephaistos other man know i none
 whose noble armour i might put on save it were the shield of aias
 telamon's son but himself i ween is in the forefront of the press
 dealing death with his spear around patroklos dead"

 then again spake unto him windfooted fleet iris "well are we also
 aware that thy noble armour is held from thee but go forth unto the
 trench as thou art and show thyself to the men of troy if haply they
 will shrink back and refrain them from battle and the warlike sons of
 the achaians take breath"

 thus spake fleetfooted iris and went her way but achilles dear to zeus
 arose and around his strong shoulders athene cast her tasselled aegis
 and around his head the bright goddess set a crown of a golden cloud
 and kindled therefrom a blazing flame and as when a smoke issueth from
 a city and riseth up into the upper air from an island afar off that
 foes beleaguer while the others from their city fight all day in
 hateful warbut with the going down of the sun blaze out the
 beaconfires in line and high aloft rusheth up the glare for dwellers
 round about to behold if haply they may come with ships to help in
 needthus from the head of achilles soared that blaze toward the
 heavens and he went and stood beyond the wall beside the trench yet
 mingled not among the achaians for he minded the wise bidding of his
 mother there stood he and shouted aloud and afar off pallas athene
 uttered her voice and spread terror unspeakable among the men of troy
 clear as the voice of a clarion when it soundeth by reason of
 slaughterous foemen that beleaguer a city so clear rang forth the voice
 of aiakides and when they heard the brazen voice of aiakides the souls
 of all of them were dismayed and the horses of goodly manes were fain
 to turn the chariots backward for they boded anguish in their hearts
 and the charioteers were amazed when they saw the unwearying fire blaze
 fierce on the head of the greathearted son of peleus for the
 brighteyed goddess athene made it blaze thrice from over the trench
 shouted mightily noble achilles and thrice were the men of troy
 confounded and their proud allies yea there and then perished twelve
 men of their best by their own chariot wheels and spears but the
 achaians with joy drew patroklos forth of the darts and laid him on a
 litter and his dear comrades stood around lamenting him and among them
 followed fleetfooted achilles shedding hot tears for his true comrade
 he saw lying on the bier mangled by the keen bronze him sent he forth
 with chariot and horses unto the battle but home again welcomed never
 more

 then hera the oxeyed queen sent down the unwearying sun to be gone
 unwillingly unto the streams of ocean so the sun set and the noble
 achaians made pause from the stress of battle and the hazardous war

 but the achaians all night made moan in lamentation for patroklos and
 first of them in the loud lamentation was the son of peleus laying upon
 the breast of his comrade his manslaying hands and moaning very sore
 even as a deepbearded lion whose whelps some staghunter hath snatched
 away out of a deep wood and the lion coming afterward grieveth and
 through many glens he rangeth on the track of the footsteps of the man
 if anywhere he might find him for most bitter anger seizeth himthus
 achilles moaning heavily spake among the myrmidons "ay me vain verily
 was the word i uttered on that day when i cheered the hero menoitios in
 his halls and said that i would bring back to opoeis his son in glory
 from the sack of ilios with the share of spoil that should fall unto
 him not all the purposes of men doth zeus accomplish for them it is
 appointed that both of us redden the same earth with our blood here in
 troyland for neither shall the old knight peleus welcome me back home
 within his halls nor my mother thetis but even here shall earth keep
 hold on me yet now o patroklos since i follow thee under earth i
 will not hold thy funeral till i have brought hither the armour and the
 head of hector thy highhearted slayer and before thy pyre i will cut
 the throats of twelve noble sons of the men of troy for mine anger thou
 art slain till then beside the beaked ships shalt thou lie as thou art
 and around thee deepbosomed women trojan and dardanian shall mourn
 thee weeping night and day even they whom we toiled to win by our
 strength and our long spears when we sacked rich cities of mortal men"

 thus spake noble achilles and bade his comrades set a great tripod on
 the fire that with all speed they might wash from patroklos the bloody
 gore so they set a tripod of ablution on the burning fire and poured
 therein water and took wood and kindled it beneath and the fire wrapped
 the belly of the tripod and the water grew hot and when the water
 boiled in the bright bronze then washed they him and anointed with
 olive oil and filled his wounds with fresh ointment and laid him on a
 bier and covered him with soft cloth from head to foot and thereover a
 white robe then all night around achilles fleet of foot the myrmidons
 made lament and moan for patroklos

 meanwhile zeus spake unto hera his sister and wife "thou hast
 accomplished this o hera oxeyed queen thou hast aroused achilles
 fleet of foot verily of thine own children must the flowinghaired
 achaians be"

 then answered unto him hera the oxeyed queen "most dread son of
 kronos what is this word thou hast said truly even a man i ween is
 to accomplish what he may for another man albeit he is mortal and hath
 not wisdom as we how then was i who avow me the first of goddesses both
 by birth and for that i am called thy wife and thou art king among all
 immortalshow was i not in mine anger to devise evil against the men of
 troy"

 so debated they on this wise with one another but thetis of the silver
 feet came unto the house of hephaistos imperishable starlike far seen
 among the dwellings of immortals a house of bronze wrought by the
 crookfooted god himself him found she sweating in toil and busy about
 his bellows for he was forging tripods twenty in all to stand around
 the wall of his stablished hall and beneath the base of each he had set
 golden wheels that of their own motion they might enter the assembly of
 the gods and again return unto his house a marvel to look upon thus
 much were they finished that not yet were away from the fire and
 gathered all his gear wherewith he worked into a silver chest and with
 a sponge he wiped his face and hands and sturdy neck and shaggy breast
 and did on his doublet and took a stout staff and went forth limping
 but there were handmaidens of gold that moved to help their lord the
 semblances of living maids in them is understanding at their hearts in
 them are voice and strength and they have skill of the immortal gods
 these moved beneath their lord and he gat him haltingly near to where
 thetis was and set him on a bright seat and clasped her hand in his
 and spake and called her by her name "wherefore longrobed thetis
 comest thou to our house honoured that thou art and dear no frequent
 comer art thou hitherto speak what thou hast at heart my soul is fain
 to accomplish it if accomplish it i can and if it be appointed for
 accomplishment"

 then answered unto him thetis shedding tears "hephaistos hath there
 verily been any of all goddesses in olympus that hath endured so many
 grievous sorrows at heart as are the woes that kronian zeus hath laid
 upon me above all others he chose me from among the sisters of the sea
 to enthrall me to a man even peleus aiakos' son and with a man i
 endured wedlock sore against my will now lieth he in his halls forspent
 with grievous age but other griefs are mine a son he gave me to bear
 and nourish the chief of heroes and he shot up like a young branch
 like a plant in a very fruitful field i reared him and sent him forth on
 beaked ships to ilios to fight against the men of troy but never again
 shall i welcome him back to his home within the house of peleus and
 while he yet liveth in my sight and beholdeth the light of the sun he
 sorroweth neither can i help him any whit though i go unto him the
 maiden whom the sons of the achaians chose out to be his prize her hath
 the lord agamemnon taken back out of his hands in grief for her wasted
 he his heart while the men of troy were driving the achaians on their
 ships nor suffered them to come forth and the elders of the argives
 entreated him and told over many noble gifts then albeit himself he
 refused to ward destruction from them he put his armour on patroklos
 and sent him to the war and much people with him all day they fought
 around the skaian gates and that same day had sacked the town but that
 when now menoitios' valiant son had wrought much harm apollo slew him
 in the forefront of the battle and gave glory unto hector therefore
 now come i a suppliant unto thy knees if haply thou be willing to give
 my shortlived son shield and helmet and goodly greaves fitted with
 anklepieces and cuirass for the armour that he had erst his trusty
 comrade lost when he fell beneath the men of troy and my son lieth on
 the earth with anguish in his soul"

 then made answer unto her the lame god of great renown "be of good
 courage let not these things trouble thy heart would that so might i
 avail to hide him far from dolorous death when dread fate cometh upon
 him as surely shall goodly armour be at his need such as all men
 afterward shall marvel at whatsoever may behold"

 thus saying he left her there and went unto his bellows and turned them
 upon the fire and bade them work and the bellows twenty in all blew
 on the crucibles sending deft blasts on every side now to aid his
 labour and now anon howsoever hephaistos willed and the work went on
 and he threw bronze that weareth not into the fire and tin and precious
 gold and silver and next he set on an anvilstand a great anvil and
 took in his hand a sturdy hammer and in the other he took the tongs

 first fashioned he a shield great and strong adorning it all over and
 set thereto a shining rim triple brightglancing and therefrom a
 silver baldric five were the folds of the shield itself and therein
 fashioned he much cunning work from his wise heart

 there wrought he the earth and the heavens and the sea and the
 unwearying sun and the moon waxing to the full and the signs every one
 wherewith the heavens are crowned pleiads and hyads and orion's might
 and the bear that men call also the wain her that turneth in her place
 and watcheth orion and alone hath no part in the baths of ocean

 also he fashioned therein two fair cities of mortal men in the one were
 espousals and marriage feasts and beneath the blaze of torches they
 were leading the brides from their chambers through the city and loud
 arose the bridal song and young men were whirling in the dance and
 among them flutes and viols sounded high and women standing each at her
 door were marvelling but the folk were gathered in the assembly place
 for there a strife was arisen two men striving about the bloodprice of
 a man slain the one claimed to pay full atonement expounding to the
 people but the other denied him and would take naught and the folk
 were cheering both as they took part on either side and heralds kept
 order among the folk while the elders on polished stones were sitting
 in the sacred circle and holding in their hands staves from the
 loudvoiced heralds then before the people they rose up and gave
 judgment each in turn and in the midst lay two talents of gold to be
 given unto him who should plead among them most righteously

 but around the other city were two armies in siege with glittering arms
 and two counsels found favour among them either to sack the town or to
 share all with the townsfolk even whatsoever substance the fair city
 held within but the besieged were not yet yielding but arming for an
 ambushment on the wall there stood to guard it their dear wives and
 infant children and with these the old men but the rest went forth
 and their leaders were ares and pallas athene both wrought in gold and
 golden was the vesture they had on goodly and great were they in their
 armour even as gods far seen around and the folk at their feet were
 smaller and when they came where it seemed good to them to lay ambush
 in a river bed where there was a common wateringplace of herds there
 they set them clad in glittering bronze and two scouts were posted by
 them afar off to spy the coming of flocks and of oxen with crooked
 horns and presently came the cattle and with them two herdsmen playing
 on pipes that took no thought of the guile then the others when they
 beheld these ran upon them and quickly cut off the herds of oxen and
 fair flocks of white sheep and slew the shepherds withal but the
 besiegers as they sat before the speechplaces from which the orators
 spoke and heard much din among the oxen mounted forthwith behind their
 highstepping horses and came up with speed then they arrayed their
 battle and fought beside the river banks and smote one another with
 bronzeshod spears and among them mingled strife and tumult and fell
 death grasping one man alive freshwounded another without wound and
 dragging another dead through the mellay by the feet and the raiment on
 her shoulders was red with the blood of men like living mortals they
 hurled together and fought and haled the corpses each of the other's
 slain

 furthermore he set in the shield a soft freshploughed field rich tilth
 and wide the third time ploughed and many ploughers therein drave
 their yokes to and fro as they wheeled about whensoever they came to
 the boundary of the field and turned then would a man come to each and
 give into his hands a goblet of sweet wine while others would be
 turning back along the furrows fain to reach the boundary of the deep
 tilth and the field grew black behind and seemed as it were
 aploughing albeit of gold for this was the great marvel of the work

 furthermore he set therein the demesneland of a king where hinds were
 reaping with sharp sickles in their hands some armfuls along the swathe
 were falling in rows to the earth whilst others the sheafbinders were
 binding in twisted bands of straw three sheafbinders stood over them
 while behind boys gathering corn and bearing it in their arms gave it
 constantly to the binders and among them the king in silence was
 standing at the swathe with his staff rejoicing in his heart and
 henchmen apart beneath an oak were making ready a feast and preparing a
 great ox they had sacrificed while the women were strewing much white
 barley to be a supper for the hinds

 also he set therein a vineyard teeming plenteously with clusters
 wrought fair in gold black were the grapes but the vines hung
 throughout on silver poles and around it he ran a ditch of cyanus and
 round that a fence of tin and one single pathway led to it whereby the
 vintagers might go when they should gather the vintage and maidens and
 striplings in childish glee bare the sweet fruit in plaited baskets and
 in the midst of them a boy made pleasant music on a cleartoned viol
 and sang thereto a sweet linossong probably a lament for departing
 summer with delicate voice while the rest with feet falling together
 kept time with the music and song

 also he wrought therein a herd of kine with upright horns and the kine
 were fashioned of gold and tin and with lowing they hurried from the
 byre to pasture beside a murmuring river beside the waving reed and
 herdsmen of gold were following with the kine four of them and nine
 dogs fleet of foot came after them but two terrible lions among the
 foremost kine had seized a loudroaring bull that bellowed mightily as
 they haled him and the dogs and the young men sped after him the lions
 rending the great bull's hide were devouring his vitals and his black
 blood while the herdsmen in vain tarred on their fleet dogs to set on
 for they shrank from biting the lions but stood hard by and barked and
 swerved away

 also the glorious lame god wrought therein a pasture in a fair glen a
 great pasture of white sheep and a steading and roofed huts and
 folds

 also did the glorious lame god devise a dancingplace like unto that
 which once in wide knosos daidalos wrought for ariadne of the lovely
 tresses there were youths dancing and maidens of costly wooing their
 hands upon one another's wrists fine linen the maidens had on and the
 youths wellwoven doublets faintly glistening with oil fair wreaths had
 the maidens and the youths daggers of gold hanging from silver
 baldrics and now would they run round with deft feet exceeding lightly
 as when a potter sitting by his wheel that fitteth between his hands
 maketh trial of it whether it run and now anon they would run in lines
 to meet each other and a great company stood round the lovely dance in
 joy and through the midst of them leading the measure two tumblers
 whirled

 also he set therein the great might of the river of ocean around the
 uttermost rim of the cunninglyfashioned shield

 now when he had wrought the shield great and strong then wrought he him
 a corslet brighter than a flame of fire and he wrought him a massive
 helmet to fit his brows goodly and graven and set thereon a crest of
 gold and he wrought him greaves of pliant tin

 so when the renowned lame god had finished all the armour he took and
 laid it before the mother of achilles then she like a falcon sprang
 down from snowy olympus bearing from hephaistos the glittering arms



 book xix

 how achilles and agamemnon were reconciled before the
 assembly of the achaians and achilles went forth with them
 to battle

 now morning saffronrobed arose from the streams of ocean to bring light
 to gods and men and thetis came to the ships bearing his gift from the
 god her dear son she found fallen about patroklos and uttering loud
 lament and round him many of his company made moan and the bright
 goddess stood beside him in their midst and clasped her hand in his and
 spake and called upon his name "my child him who lieth here we must
 let be for all our pain for by the will of gods from the beginning was
 he brought low but thou take from hephaistos arms of pride arms
 passing goodly such as no man on his shoulders yet hath borne"

 thus spake the goddess and in front of aehifies laid the arms and they
 rang all again in their glory and awe fell on all the myrmidons nor
 dared any to gaze thereon for they were awestricken but when achilles
 looked thereon then came fury upon him the more and his eyes blazed
 terribly forth as it were a flame beneath their lids glad was he as he
 held in his hands that splendid gift of a god but when he had satisfied
 his soul in gazing on the glory of the arms straightway to his mother
 spake he winged words "my mother the arms the god has given are such
 as it beseemeth that the work of immortals should be and that no mortal
 man should have wrought now therefore will i arm me in them but i have
 grievous fear lest meantime on the gashed wounds of menoitios' valiant
 son flies light and breed worms therein and defile his corpsefor the
 life is slain out of himand so all his flesh shall rot"

 then answered him thetis goddess of the silver feet "child have no
 care for this within thy mind i will see to ward from him the cruel
 tribes of flies which prey on men slain in fight for even though he lie
 till a whole year's course be run yet his flesh shall be sound
 continually or better even than now but call thou the achaian warriors
 to the place of assembly and unsay thy wrath against agamemnon shepherd
 of the host and then arm swiftly for battle and clothe thee with thy
 strength"

 thus saying she filled him with adventurous might while on patroklos
 she shed ambrosia and red nectar through his nostrils that his flesh
 might abide the same continually

 but noble achilles went down the beach of the sea crying his terrible
 cry and roused the achaian warriors and they who before were wont to
 abide in the circle of the ships and they who were helmsmen and kept
 the steerage of the ships or were stewards there and dealt out food
 even these came then to the place of assembly because achilles was come
 forth after long ceasing from grievous war limping came two of ares'
 company tydeus' son staunch in fight and noble odysseus each leaning
 on his spear for their wounds were grievous still and they went and
 sate them down in the forefront of the assembly and last came agamemnon
 king of men with his wound upon him for him too in the stress of
 battle kooen antenor's son had wounded with his bronzetipped spear but
 when all the achaians were gathered then uprose fleetfooted achilles
 and spake in their midst "son of atreus was this in any wise the
 better way for both thee and me what time with grief at our hearts we
 waxed fierce in souldevouring strife for the sake of a girl would that
 artemis had slain her with her arrow at the ships on the day whereon i
 took her to me when i had spoiled lyrnessos so should not then so many
 achaians have bitten the wide earth beneath their enemies' hands by
 reason of my exceeding wrath it hath been well for hector and the
 trojans but the achaians i think shall long remember the strife that
 was betwixt thee and me but bygones will we let be for all our pain
 and curb under necessity the spirit within our breasts i now will stay
 my anger it beseems me not implacably for ever to be wroth but come
 rouse speedily to the fight the flowinghaired achaians that i may go
 forth against the men of troy and put them yet again to the proof if
 they be fain to couch hard by the ships methinks that some among them
 shall be glad to rest their knees when they are fled out of the
 fierceness of the battle and from before our spear"

 he spake and the wellgreaved achaians rejoiced that the greathearted
 son of peleus had made renouncement of his wrath then among them spake
 agamemnon king of men speaking from the place where he sat not arisen
 to stand forth in their midst "o danaan friends and heroes men of
 ares' company seemly is it to listen to him who standeth up to speak
 nor behoveth it to break in upon his words even toward a skilled man
 that were hard for amid the uproar of many men how should one listen
 or yet speak even the clearestvoiced speech is marred to the son of
 peleus i will declare myself but ye other argives give heed and each
 mark well my word oft have the achaians spoken thus to me and
 upbraided me but it is not i who am the cause but zeus and destiny and
 erinys that walketh in the darkness who put into my soul fierce madness
 on the day when in the assembly i even i bereft achilles of his meed
 what could i do it is god who accomplisheth all eldest daughter of
 zeus is ate who blindeth all a power of bane delicate are her feet
 for not upon the earth she goeth but walketh over the heads of men
 making men fall and entangleth this one or that ye even zeus was
 blinded upon a time he who they say is greatest among gods and men yet
 even him hera with a female wile deceived on the day when alkmene in
 faircrowned thebes was to bring forth the strength of herakles for
 then proclaimed he solemnly among the gods 'here me ye all both gods
 and goddesses while i utter the council of my soul within my heart
 this day shall eileithuia the help of travailing women bring to the
 light a man who shall be lord over all that dwell round about among the
 raise of men who are sprung of me by blood' and to him in subtlety
 queen hera spake 'though wilt play the cheat and not accomplish thy
 word come now olympian swear me a firm oath that verily and indeed
 shall that man be lord over all that dwell round about who this day
 shall fall between a woman's feet even he among all men who are of the
 lineage of thy blood' so spake she and zeus no wise perceived her
 subtlety but sware a mighty oath and therewith was he sore blinded for
 hera darted from olympus' peak and came swiftly to achaian argus were
 she knew was the stately wife of sthenelos son of perseus who was also
 great with child and her seventh month had come her son hera brought
 to the light though his tale of months was untold but she stayed
 alkmene's bearing and kept the eileithuiai from her aid then she
 brought the tidings herself and to kronos' son zeus she spake 'father
 zeus of the bright lightning a word will i speak to thee for my heed
 today is born a man of valor who shall rule among the archives
 eurystheus son of sthenelos the son of perseus of thy lineage not
 unmeet is it that he be lord among argives' she said but sharp pain
 smote him in the depths of his soul and straightway he seized ate by
 her brighthaired head in the anger of his soul and sware a mighty oath
 that never again to olympus and the starry heaven should ate come who
 blindeth all alike he said and whirling her in his hand flung her from
 the starry heaven and quickly came she down among the works of men yet
 ever he groaned against her when he beheld his beloved son in cruel
 travail at eurystheus' hest thus also i what time great hector of the
 glancing helm was slaying argives at the sterns of our ships could not
 be unmindful of ate who blinded me at the first but since thus blinded
 was i and zeus bereft me of my wit fain am i to make amends and
 recompense manifold for the wrong only arise thou to the battle and
 rouse the rest of the host gifts am i ready to offer even all that
 noble odysseus went yesterday to promise in thy hut so if thou wilt
 stay awhile though eager from battle and squires shall take the gifts
 from my ship and carry them to thee that thou mayest see that what i
 give sufficeth thee"

 then answered him achilles swift of foot "most noble son of atreus
 agamemnon king of men for the gifts to give them as it beseemeth if
 so thou wilt or to withhold is in thy choice but now let us bethink
 us of battle with all speed this is no time to dally here with
 subtleties for a great work is yet undone once more must achilles be
 seen in the forefront of the battle laying waste with his brazen spear
 the battalions of the men of troy thereof let each of you think as he
 fighteth with his man"

 then odysseus of many counsels answered him and said "nay yet for all
 thy valour godlike achilles not against ilios lead thou the sons of
 achaians fasting to fight the men of troy since not of short spell
 shall the battle be when once the ranks of men are met and god shall
 breathe valour into both but bid the achaians taste at the swift ships
 food and wine for thence is vigour and might for no man fasting from
 food shall be able to fight with the foe all day till the going down of
 the sun for though his spirit be eager for battle yet his limbs unaware
 grow weary and thirst besetteth him and hunger and his knees in his
 going fail but the man who having his fill of food and wine fighteth
 thus all day against the enemy his heart is of good cheer within him
 nor anywise tire his limbs ere all give back from battle so come
 disperse the host and bid them make ready their meal and the gifts let
 agamemnon king of men bring forth into the midst of the assembly that
 all achaians may behold them with their eyes and thou be glad at heart
 and let him swear to thee an oath standing in the midst of the argives
 that he hath never gone up into the damsel's bed or lain with her o
 prince as is the wont of man with woman and let thine own spirit be
 placable within thy breast then let him make thee a rich feast of
 reconcilement in his hut that thou have nothing lacking of thy right
 and thou son of atreus toward others also shalt be more righteous
 hereafter for no shame it is that a man that is a king should make
 amends if he have been the first to deal violently"

 then to him spake agamemnon king of men "son of laertes i rejoice to
 listen to thy speech for rightfully hast thou told over all and the
 oath i am willing to swear yea my heart biddeth it nor will i forswear
 myself before god let achilles abide for a space eager for battle
 though he be and all ye others abide together until the gifts come
 forth from my hut and we make faithful oath with sacrifice but thee
 thyself i thus charge and bid choose thee young men princes of the
 achaian folk and bear my gifts from my ship even all that we promised
 yesterday to achilles and take with thee the women and let talthybios
 speedily make me ready a boarswine in the midst of the wide achaian
 host to sacrifice to zeus and to the sun"

 and to him in answer swiftfooted achilles spake "most noble son of
 atreus agamemnon king of men at some other time were it even better ye
 should be busied thus when haply there shall be some pause of war and
 the spirit within my breast shall be less fierce but now they lie
 mangled on the fieldeven they whom hector son of priam slew when zeus
 gave him gloryand ye call men to their food verily for my part i
 would bid the sons of the achaians to fight now unfed and fasting and
 with the setting sun make ready a mighty meal when we shall have
 avenged the shame till then down my throat at least nor food nor drink
 shall go since my comrade is dead who in my hut is lying mangled by
 the sharp spear with his feet toward the door and round him our
 comrades mourn wherefore in my heart to no thought of those matters
 but of slaying and blood and grievous moans of men"

 then answered him odysseus of many counsels "o achilles peleus' son
 mightiest of achaians far better and mightier not a little art thou
 than i with the spear but in counsel i may surpass thee greatly since
 i was born first and know more things wherefore let thy heart endure to
 listen to my speech quickly have men surfeit of battle of that wherein
 the sword streweth most straw yet is the harvest scantiest ie in a
 pitched battle there is little plunder the hope of which might help to
 sustain men's efforts in storming a town when zeus inclineth his
 balance who is disposer of the wars of men but it cannot be that the
 achaians fast to mourn a corpse for exceeding many and thick fall such
 on every day when then should there be rest from toil nay it behoveth
 to bury him who is dead steeling our hearts when once we have wept him
 for a day but such as are left alive from hateful war must take thought
 of meat and drink that yet more against our foes we may fight
 relentlessly ever clad in unyielding bronze then let none of the host
 hold back awaiting other summons this is the summons and ill shall it
 be for whoso is left behind at the argive ships but all together as one
 we will rouse against the horsetaming trojans the fury of war"

 he spoke and took with him the sons of noble nestor and meges son of
 phyleus and thoas and meriones and lykomedes son of kreiontes and
 melanippos and they went on their way to the hut of agamemnon atreus'
 son forthwith as the word was spoken so was the deed done seven
 tripods they bare from the hut as he promised him and twenty bright
 caldrons and twelve horses and anon they led forth women skilled in
 goodly arts seven and the eighth was fairfaced briseis then
 odysseus having weighed ten talents of gold in all led the way and
 with him young men of the achaians bare the gifts these they set in the
 midst of the place of assembly and agamemnon rose up and beside that
 shepherd of the host stood talthybios whose voice was like a god's and
 held a boar between his hands and the son of atreus drawing with his
 hands his knife which ever hung beside the mighty scabbard of his
 sword cut off the first hairs from the boar and lifting up his hands
 he prayed to zeus and all the argives sat silent in their places duly
 hearkening to the king and he prayed aloud looking up to the wide
 heaven "be zeus before all witness highest and best of the gods and
 earth and sun and erinyes who under earth take vengeance upon men
 whosoever forsweareth himself that never have i laid hand on the
 damsel briseis neither to lie with her nor anywise else but she has
 abode untouched within my huts and if aught that i swear be false may
 the gods give me all sorrows manifold that they send on him who sinneth
 against them in his oath"

 he said and cut the boar's throat with the pitiless knife and the body
 taithybios whirled and threw into the great wash of the hoary sea to be
 the food of fishes but achilles arose up and spake in the midst of the
 warrior argives "father zeus sore madness dealest thou verily to men
 never could the son of atreus have stirred the soul within my breast
 nor led off the damsel implacably against my will had not zeus willed
 that on many of the achaians death should come but now go forth to your
 meal that we may join battle thereupon"

 thus he spake and dispersed the assembly with all speed the rest were
 scattered each to his own ship but the greathearted myrmidons took up
 the gifts and bare them to the ship of godlike achilles and they laid
 them in the huts and set the women there and gallant squires drave the
 horses among their troop

 but briseis that was like unto golden aphrodite when she beheld
 patroklos mangled by the keen spear fell about him and made shrill
 lament and tore with her hands her breast and tender neck and
 beautiful face and she spake amid her weeping that woman like unto
 goddesses "patroklos dearest to my hapless heart alive i left thee
 when i left this hut but now o prince of the people i am come back to
 find thee dead thus evil ever followeth evil in my lot my husband
 unto whom my father and lady mother gave me i beheld before our city
 mangled with the keen spear and my three brothers whom my own mother
 bore my near and dear who all met their day of doom but thou when
 swift achilles slew my husband and wasted godlike mynes' city wouldest
 ever that i should not even weep and saidest that thou wouldst make me
 godlike achilles' wedded wife and that ye would take me in your ships
 to phthia and make me a marriage feast among the myrmidons therefore
 with all my soul i mourn thy death for thou wert ever kind"

 thus spake she weeping and thereon the women wailed in semblance for
 patroklos but each for her own woe but round achilles gathered the
 elders of the achaians praying him that he would eat but he denied
 them with a groan "i pray you if any kind comrade will hearken to me
 bid me not sate my heart with meat and drink since terrible grief is
 come upon me till the sun go down i will abide and endure continually
 until then"

 he spoke and his speech made the other chiefs depart but the two sons
 of atreus stayed and noble odysseus and nestor and idomeneus and
 phoinox ancient knight soothing him in his exceeding sorrow but he
 could no whit be soothed until he had entered the mouth of bloody war
 and bethinking him he sighed very heavily and spake aloud "thou too o
 hapless dearest of my friends thyself wouldst verily of yore set forth
 in out hut with ready speed a savoury meal what time the achaians
 hasted to wage against the horsetaming trojans dolorous war but now
 thou liest mangled and my heart will none of meat and drink that stand
 within for desire of thee nought worse than this could i endure not
 though i should hear of my father's death who now i ween in phthia is
 shedding big tears for lack of a son so dear even me that in an alien
 land for sake of baleful helen do battle with the men of troy nor
 though it were my beloved son who is reared for me in skyros if still
 at least is godlike neoptolemos alive for hitherto had my soul within
 me trusted that i alone should perish far from horsepasturing argos
 here in the trojan land but that thou shouldest return to phthia so
 that thou mightest take me the child in thy swift black ship from skyros
 and show him everythingmy substance and servants and highroofed
 mighty hall for peleus i ween already must be dead and gone or else in
 feeble life he hath sorrow of age and of waiting ever for bitter news
 of me till he hear that i am dead"

 thus spake he weeping and the elders mourned with him bethinking them
 what each had left at home and when the son of kronos beheld them
 sorrowing he pitied them and forthwith to athene spake he winged words
 "my child thou hast then left utterly the man of thy heart hath
 achilles then no longer a place within thy thought he before the
 steepprowed ships sits mourning his dear comrade the rest are gone to
 their meal but he is fasting and unfed but go distil into his breast
 nectar and pleasant ambrosia that no pains of hunger come on him"

 thus saying he sped forward athene who before was fain and she like a
 falcon widewinged and shrillvoiced hurled herself forth from heaven
 through the upper air so while the achaians were arming presently
 throughout the camp she in achilles' breast distilled nectar and
 pleasant ambrosia that grievous hunger might not assail his knees and
 then herself was gone to the firm house of her mighty father then the
 achaians poured forth from the swift ships as when thick snowflakes
 flutter down from zeus chill beneath the blast of boreas born in the
 upper air so thick from the ships streamed forth bright glittering
 helms and bossy shields strongplaited cuirasses and ashen spears and
 the sheen thereof went up to heaven and all the earth around laughed in
 the flash of bronze and there went a sound beneath the feet of the men
 and in the midst of them noble achilles harnessed him his teeth gnashed
 together and his eyes blazed as it were the flame of a fire for into
 his heart was intolerable anguish entered in thus wroth against the men
 of troy he put on the gift of the god which hephaistos wrought him by
 his art first on his legs he set the fair greaves fitted with silver
 anklepieces and next he donned the cuirass about his breast then
 round his shoulders he slung the bronze sword silverstudded then
 lastly he took the great and strong shield and its brightness shone
 afar off as the moon's or as when over the sea there appeareth to
 sailors the brightness of a burning fire and it burneth on high among
 the mountains in some lonely steadingsailors whom stormblasts bear
 unwilling over the sea the home of fishes afar from them they love
 so from achilles' goodly welldight shield the brightness thereof shot
 up toward heaven and he lifted the stout helmet and set it on his head
 and like a star it shone the horsehair crested helmet and around it
 waved plumes of gold that hephaistos had set thick about the crest then
 noble achilles proved him in his armour to know whether it fitted unto
 him and whether his glorious limbs ran free and it became to him as it
 were wings and buoyed up the shepherd of hosts

 and forth from its stand he drew his father's spear heavy and great and
 strong that spear could none other of the achaians wield but achilles
 alone awaited to wield it the pelian ashen spear that cheiron gave to
 his father dear from a peak of pelion to be the death of warriors and
 automedon and alkimos went about to yoke the horses and put on them
 fair breaststraps and bits within their jaws and stretched the reins
 behind to the firmbuilt chariot then automedon took the bright lash
 fitted to his hand and sprang up behind the horses and after him
 mounted achilles armed effulgent in his armour like bright hyperion
 and terribly he called upon the horses of his sire "xanthos and balios
 famed children of podarge in other sort take heed to bring your
 charioteer safe back to the danaan host when we have done with battle
 and leave him not as ye left patroklos to lie there dead"

 then the horse xanthos of glancing feet made answer unto him from
 beneath the yokeand he bowed with his head and all his mane fell
 from the yokecushion beside the yoke and touched the groundfor the
 whitearmed goddess hera gave him speech "yea verily for this hour
 dread achilles we will still bear thee safe yet is thy death day nigh
 at hand neither shall we be cause thereof but a mighty god and
 forceful fate for not through sloth or heedlessness of ours did the men
 of troy from patrokios' shoulders strip his arms but the best of the
 gods whom brighthaired leto bore slew him in the forefront of the
 battle and to hector gave renown we even with the wind of zephyr
 swiftest they say of all winds well might run nathless to thee
 thyself it is appointed to be slain in fight by a god and by a man"

 now when he had thus spoken the erinyes stayed his voice and sore
 troubled did fleetfooted achilles answer him "xanthos why prophesiest
 thou my death no wise behoveth it thee well know i of myself that it
 is appointed me to perish here far from my father dear and mother
 howbeit anywise i will not refrain till i give the trojans surfeit of
 war"

 he said and with a cry among the foremost held on his wholehooved
 steeds



 book xx

 how achilles made havoc among the men of troy

 so by the beaked ships around thee son of peleus hungry for war the
 achaians armed and over against them the men of troy upon the high
 ground of the plain

 but zeus bade themis call the gods to council from manyfolded olympus'
 brow and she ranged all about and bade them to the house of zeus there
 was no river came not up save only ocean nor any nymph of all that
 haunt fair thickets and springs of rivers and grassy watermeadows and
 they came to the house of zeus who gathereth the clouds and sat them
 down in the polished colonnades which hephaistos in the cunning of his
 heart had wrought for father zeus

 thus gathered they within the doors of zeus nor was the earthshaker
 heedless of the goddess' call but from the salt sea came up after the
 rest and set him in the midst and inquired concerning the purpose of
 zeus "wherefore o lord of the bright lightning hast thou called the
 gods again to council say ponderest thou somewhat concerning the
 trojans and achaians for lo the war and the fighting of them are
 kindled very nigh"

 and zeus who gathered the clouds answered him saying "thou knowest
 o earthshaker the purpose within my breast wherefor i gathered you
 hither even in their perishing have i regard unto them but for me i
 will abide here sitting within a fold of olympus where i will gladden
 my heart with gazing but go all ye forth that ye come among the trojans
 and achaians and succour these or those howsoever each of you hath a
 mind for if achilles alone shall fight against the trojans not even a
 little while shall they hold back the son of peleus the fleet of foot
 nay but even aforetime they trembled when they looked upon him now
 therefore that his wrath for his friend is waxen terrible i fear me lest
 he overleap the bound of fate and storm the wall"

 thus spake the son of kronos and roused unabating war for on this side
 and on that the gods went forth to war to the company of the ships went
 hera and pallas athene and poseidon earthenfolder and the helper
 hermes proeminent in subtle thoughts and with these went hephaistos
 in the greatness of his strength halting but his shrunk legs moved
 nimbly under him but to the trojans went ares of the glancing helm and
 with him phoebus of the unshorn hair and archer artemis and leto and
 xanthos and laughterloving aphrodite

 now for so long as gods were afar from mortal men so long waxed the
 achaians glorious for that achilles was come forth among them and his
 long ceasing from grim battle was at an end and the trojans were
 smitten with sore trembling in the limbs of every one of them in terror
 when they beheld the son of peleus fleet of foot blazing in his arms
 peer of manslaying ares but when among the mellay of men the olympians
 were come down then leapt up in her might strife rouser of hosts then
 sent forth athene a cry now standing by the hollowed trench without the
 wall and now on the echoing shores she shouted aloud and a shout
 uttered ares against her terrible as the blackness of the storm now
 from the height of the city to the trojans calling clear or again along
 simois shore over kallikolon he sped

 so urged the blessed gods both hosts to battle then themselves burst
 into fierce war and terribly thundered the father of gods and men from
 heaven above and from beneath poseidon made the vast earth shake and
 the steep mountain tops then trembled all the spurs of manyfountained
 ida and all her crests and the city of the trojans and the ships of
 the achaians and the lord of the underworld aiedoneus had terror in
 hell and leapt from his throne in that terror and cried aloud lest the
 world be cloven above him by poseidon shaker of earth and his
 dwellingplace be laid bare to mortals and immortalsgrim halls and
 vast and lothly to the gods so loud the roar rose of that battle of
 gods for against king poseidon stood phoebus apollo with his winged
 arrows and against enyalios stood athene brighteyed goddess and
 against hera she of the golden shafts and echoing chase even archer
 artemis sister of the fardarter and against leto the strong helper
 hermes and against hephaistos the great deepeddying river whom gods
 call xanthos and men skamandros

 thus gods with gods were matched meanwhile achilles yearned above all
 to meet hector son of priam in the fray for with that blood
 chiefliest his spirit bade him sate ares stubborn lord of war but
 straightway apollo rouser of hosts moved aineias to go to meet the son
 of peleus and filled him with brave spirit and he made his own voice
 like the voice of lykaon the son of priam in his semblance spake
 apollo son of zeus "aineias counsellor of trojans where now are thy
 threats wherewith thou didst boast to the trojan lords over thy wine
 saying thou wouldest stand up in battle against achilles peleus' son"

 and to him aineias answered and said "son of priam why biddest thou me
 thus face the fierce son of peleus in battle though i be not fain
 thereto not for the first time now shall i match me with achilles
 fleet of foot once before drave he me with his spear from ida when he
 harried our kine and wasted lyrnessos and pedasos but zeus delivered me
 out of his hand and put strength into my knees that they were swift
 else had i fallen beneath the hands of achilles and of athene who went
 before and gave him light and urged him to slay leleges and trojans
 with his spear of bronze therefore it is impossible for man to face
 achilles in fight for that ever some god is at his side to ward off
 death ay and at any time his spear flieth straight neither ceaseth
 till it have pierced through flesh of man but if god once give us fair
 field of battle not lightly shall he overcome me not though he boast
 him made of bronze throughout"

 and to him in answer spake apollo son of zeus "yea hero pray thou too
 to the everliving gods for thou too men say wast born of aphrodite
 daughter of zeus and achilles' mother is of less degree among the gods
 for thy mother is child of zeus his but of the ancient one of the sea
 come bear up thy unwearying spear against him let him no wise turn
 thee back with revilings and bitter words"

 he said and breathed high spirit into the shepherd of the host and he
 went onward through the forefront of the fighting harnessed in flashing
 bronze but whitearmed hera failed not to discern anchises' son as he
 went through the press of men to meet the son of peleus and gathering
 the gods about her she spake among them thus "consider ye twain
 poseidon and athene within your hearts what shall come of these things
 that are done here is aineias gone forth harnessed in flashing bronze
 to meet the son of peleus and it is phoebus apollo that hath sent him
 come then be it ours to turn him back straightway or else let some one
 of us stand likewise beside achilles and give him mighty power so that
 he fail not in his spirit but know that they who love him are the best
 of the immortals and that they who from of old ward war and fighting
 from the trojans are vain as wind all we from olympus are come down to
 mingle in this fight that he take no hurt among the trojans on this
 dayafterward he shall suffer whatsoever things fate span for him with
 her thread at his beginning when his mother bare him if achilles
 learn not this from voice divine then shall he be afraid when some god
 shall come against him in the battle for gods revealed are hard to look
 upon"

 then to her made answer poseidon shaker of the earth "hera be not
 fierce beyond wisdom it behoveth thee not not fain am i at least to
 match gods with gods in strife let us go now into some high place apart
 and seat us there to watch and battle shall be left to men only if
 ares or phoebus apollo fall to fighting or put constraint upon achilles
 and hinder him from fight then straightway among us too shall go up the
 battlecry of strife right soon methinks shall they hie them from the
 issue of the fray back to olympus to the company of the gods overcome
 by the force of our hands"

 thus spake the bluehaired god and led the way to the mounded wall of
 heavensprung herakles that lofty wall built him by the trojans and
 pallas athene that he might escape the monster and be safe from him
 what time he should make his onset from the beach to the plain there
 sate them down poseidon and the other gods and clothed their shoulders
 with impenetrable cloud and they of the other part sat down on the
 brows of kallikolon around thee archer phoebus and ares waster of
 cities thus they on either side sat devising counsels but shrank all
 from falling to grievous war and zeus from his high seat commanded
 them

 meanwhile the whole plain was filled with men and horses and ablaze with
 bronze and the earth rang with the feet of them as they rushed together
 in the fray two men far better than the rest were meeting in the midst
 between the hosts eager for battle aineias anchises' son and noble
 achilles first came on aineias threateningly tossing his strong helm
 his rapid shield he held before his breast and brandished his bronze
 spear and on the other side the son of peleus rushed to meet him like a
 lion a ravaging lion whom men desire to slay a whole tribe assembled
 and first he goeth his way unheeding but when some warrior youth hath
 smitten him with a spear the he gathereth himself openmouthed and
 foam cometh forth about his teeth and his stout spirit groaneth in his
 heart and with his tail he scourgeth either side his ribs and flanks
 and goadeth himself on to fight and glaring is borne straight on them
 by his passion to try whether he shall slay some man of them or
 whether himself shall perish in the forefront of the throng thus was
 achilles driven of his passion and valiant spirit to go forth to meet
 aineias great of heart and when they were come near against each other
 then first to aineias spake fleetfooted noble achilles "aineias
 wherefore hast thou so far come forward from the crowd to stand against
 me doth thy heart bid thee fight with me in hope of holding priam's
 honour and lordship among the horsetaming trojans nay though thou
 slay me not for that will priam lay his kingdom in thy hands for he
 hath sons and is sound and of unshaken mind or have the trojans
 allotted thee some lot of ground more choice than all the rest fair
 land of tilth and orchard that thou mayest dwell therein if thou slay
 me but methinks thou wilt find the slaying hard for once before i
 ween have i made thee flee before my spear host thou forgotten the day
 when thou wert alone with the kine and i made thee run swiftfooted
 down ida's steeps in hastethen didst thou not look behind thee in thy
 flight thence fleddest thou to lernessos but i wasted it having
 fought against it with the help of athene and of father zeus and
 carried away women captive bereaving them of their day of freedom only
 thee zeus shielded and other gods but not this time methinks shall
 they shield thee as thou imaginest in thy heart therefore i bid thee
 go back into the throng and come not forth against me while as yet thou
 art unhurtafter the event even a fool is wise"

 then to him in answer again aineias spake "son of peleus think not
 with words to affright me as a child since i too well know myself how
 to speak taunts and unjust speech we know each other's race and lineage
 in that we have heard the fame proclaimed by mortal men but never hast
 thou set eyes on my parents or i on thine thou they say art son of
 nobie peleus and of thetis of the fair tresses the daughter of the
 sea the sire i boast is anchises great of heart and my mother is
 aphrodite of these shall one pair or the other mourn their dear son
 today for verily not with idle words shall we two satisfy our strife
 and depart out of the battle but if thou wilt learn also this that
 thou mayest well know our lineage known to full many men first zeus
 the cloudgatherer begat dardanos and he stablished dardania for not
 yet was holy ilios built upon the plain to be a city of mortal men but
 still they dwelt on slopes of manyfountained ida then dardanos begat a
 son king erichthonios who became richest of mortal men three thousand
 mares had he that pastured along the marsh meadow rejoicing in their
 tender foals of them was boreas enamoured as they grazed and in
 semblance of a darkmaned horse he covered them then they having
 conceived bare twelve fillies these when they bounded over earth the
 graingiver would run upon the topmost ripened ears of corn and break
 them not and when they bounded over the broad backs of the sea they
 would run upon the crests of the breakers of the hoary brine then
 erichthonios begat tros to be load over the trojans and to tros three
 noble sons were born ilos and assarakos and godlike ganymedes who
 became the most beautiful of mortal men him the gods caught up to be
 cupbearer to zeus for sake of his beauty that he might dwell among
 immortals then ilos again begat a son noble laomedon and laomedon
 begat tithonos and priam and lamppos and klytios and hiketaon of the
 stock of ares and assarakos begat kapys and kapys anchises and
 anchises me but priam begat the goodly hector

 "lo then of this blood and lineage declare i myself unto thee but for
 valour zeus increaseth it in men or minisheth it according as he will
 for he is lord of all but come let us talk thus together no longer
 like children standing in mid onset of war for there are revilings in
 plenty for both of us to uttera hundredthwarted ship would not
 suffice for the load of them glib is the tongue of man and many words
 are therein of every kind and wide is the range of his speech hither
 and thither whatsoever word thou speak such wilt thou hear in answer
 but what need that we should bandy strife and wrangling each against
 each not by speech shalt thou turn me from the battle that i desire
 until we have fought together point to point come then and
 straightway we will each try the other with bronzeheaded spears"

 he said and against that other's dread and mighty shield hurled his
 great spear and the shield rang loud beneath the spearpoint and the
 son of peleus held away the shield from him with his stout hand in
 fear for he thought that the farshadowing spear of aineias great of
 heart would lightly pierce it throughfond man and knew not in his
 mind and heart that not lightly do the glorious gifts of gods yield to
 force of mortal men so did not the great spear of wise aineias pierce
 that shield for the gold resisted it even the gift of the god yet
 through two folds he drave it but three remained for five folds had
 the lame god welded two bronze and two inside of tin and one of gold
 therein was stayed the ashen spear

 then achilles in his turn hurled his farshadowing spear and smote upon
 the circle of the shield of aineias beneath the edge of the rim where
 the bronze ran thinnest round and the bullhide was thinnest thereon
 and right through sped the pelian ashen spear and the shield cracked
 under it and aineias crouched and held up the shield away from him in
 dread and the spear flew over his back and fixed itself in the earth
 having divided asunder the two circles of the sheltering shield and
 having escaped the long spear he stood still and a vast anguish drowned
 his eyes affrighted that the spear was planted by him so nigh but
 achilles drew his sharp sword and furiously made at him crying his
 terrible cry then aineias grasped in his hand a stone a mighty deed
 such as two men as men now are would not avail to lift but he with
 ease wielded it all alone then would aineias have smitten him with the
 stone as he charged either on helm or shield which had warded from him
 bitter death and then would the son of peleus have closed and slain him
 with his sword had not poseidon shaker of earth marked it with speed
 and straightway spoken among the immortal gods "alas woe is me for
 aineias great of heart who quickly will go down to hades slain by the
 son of peleus for that he will obey the words of apollo the fardarter
 fond man but nowise shall the god help him from grievous death but
 wherefore now is he to suffer ill in his innocence causelessly for
 others' wickedness yet welcome ever are his offerings to the gods who
 inhabit the spacious heaven come let us guide him out of death's way
 lest the son of kronos be wroth if achilles slay him for it is
 appointed to him to escape that the race of dardanos perish not without
 seed or sign even dardanos whom the son of kronos loved above all the
 children born to him from the daughters of men for the race of priam
 hath zeus already hated but thus shall the might of aineias reign among
 the trojans and his children's children who shall be born in the
 aftertime"

 and him then answered hera the oxeyed queen "shaker of earth thyself
 with thine own mind take counsel whether thou wilt save aineias or
 leave him to be slain brave though he be by achilles peleus' son
 for by many oaths among all the immortals have we two sworn even pallas
 athene and i never to help the trojans from their evil day not even
 when all troy shall burn in the burning of fierce fire and they that
 burn her shall be the warlike sons of the achaians"

 now when poseidon shaker of earth heard that he went up amid the battle
 and the clash of spears and came where aineias and renowned achilles
 were then presently he shed mist over the eyes of achilles peleus'
 son and drew the bronzeheaded ashen spear from the shield of aineias
 great of heart and set it before achilles' feet and lifted aineias
 and swung him high from off the earth over many ranks of warriors of
 horses many sprang aineias soaring in the hand of the god and lighted
 at the farthest verge of the battle of many onsets where the kaukones
 were arraying them for the fight then hard beside him came poseidon
 shaker of earth and spake aloud to him winged words "aineias what god
 is it that biddeth thee fight infatuate against peleus' vehement son
 who is both a better man than thou and dearer to immortals rather
 withdraw thee whensoever thou fallest in with him lest even contrary to
 thy fate thou enter the house of hades but when achilles shall have met
 his death and doom then be thou of good courage to fight among the
 foremost for there shall none other of the achaians slay thee"

 he spoke and left him there when he had shown him all these things
 then quickly from achilles' eyes he purged the magic mist and he stared
 with wide eyes and in trouble spake unto his proud soul "ha verily a
 great marvel behold i here with mine eyes my spear lieth here upon the
 ground nor can i anywise see the man at whom i hurled it with intent to
 slay him truly then is aineias likewise dear to the immortal gods
 howbeit i deemed that his boosting thereof was altogether vanity away
 with him not again will he find heart to make trial of me now that
 once more he has escaped death to his joy but come i will call on the
 warlike danaans and go forth to make trial of some other trojan face to
 face"

 he said and leapt along the lines and called upon each man "no longer
 stand afar from the men of troy noble achaians but come let man match
 man and throw his soul into the fight hard is it for me though i be
 strong to assail so vast a folk and fight them all not even ares
 though an immortal god nor athene could plunge into the jaws of such a
 fray and toil therein but to my utmost power with hands and feet and
 strength no whit i say will i be slack nay never so little but
 right through their line will i go forward nor deem i that any trojan
 shall be glad who shall come nigh my spear"

 thus spake he urging them but to the trojans glorious hector called
 aloud and proclaimed that he would go forth against achilles
 "highhearted trojans fear not peleus' son i too in words could fight
 even immortals but with the spear it were hard for they are stronger
 far neither shall achilles accomplish all his talk but part thereof he
 is to accomplish and part to break asunder in the midst and against
 him will i go forth though the hands of him be even as fire yea though
 his hands be as fire and his fierceness as the flaming steel"

 thus spake he urging them and the trojans raised their spears for
 battle and their fierceness was mingled confusedly and the battlecry
 arose then phoebus apollo stood by hector and spake to him "hector no
 longer challenge achilles at all before the lines but in the throng
 await him and from amid the roar of the battle lest haply he spear thee
 or come near and smite thee with his sword"

 thus spake he and hector again fell back into the crowd of men for he
 was amazed when he heard the sound of a god's voice

 but achilles sprang in among the trojans his heart clothed with
 strength crying his terrible cry and first he took iphition
 otrynteus' valiant son a leader of much people born of a naiad nymph
 to otrynteus waster of cities beneath snowy tmolos in hyde's rich
 domain him as he came right on did goodly achilles smite with his
 hurled spear down through the midst of his head and it was rent
 asunder utterly and he fell with a crash and goodly achilles exulted
 over him "here is thy death thy birth was on the gygaian lake where is
 thy sire's demesne by hyllos rich in fish and eddying hermos"

 thus spake he exultant but darkness fell upon the eyes of iphition him
 the chariots of the achaians clave with their tires asunder in the
 forefront of the battle and over him achilles pierced in the temples
 through his bronzecheeked helmet demoleon brave stemmer of battle
 antenor's son no stop made the bronze helmet but therethrough sped the
 spearhead and clave the bone and the brain within was all scattered
 that stroke made ending of his zeal then hippodamas as he leapt from
 his chariot and fled before him achilles wounded in the back with his
 spear and he breathed forth his spirit with a roar as when a dragged
 bull roareth that the young men drag to the altar of the lord of helike
 for in such hath the earthshaker his delight thus roared hippodamas as
 from his bones fled forth his haughty spirit but achilles with his
 spear went on after godlike polydoros priam's son him would his sire
 continually forbid to fight for that among his children he was youngest
 born and best beloved and overcame all in fleetness of foot just then
 in boyish folly displaying the swiftness of his feet he was rushing
 through the forefighters until he lost his life him in the midst did
 fleetfooted noble achilles smite with a javelin in his back as he
 darted by where his belt's golden buckles clasped and the breast and
 back plates overlapped and right through beside the navel went the
 spearhead and he fell on his knee with a cry and dark cloud covered
 him round about and he clasped his bowels to him with his hands as he
 sank

 then when hector saw his brother polydoros clasping his bowels with his
 hands and sinking to the earth a mist fell over his eyes nor longer
 might he endure to range so far apart but he came up against achilles
 brandishing his sharp spear and like flame of fire and achilles when
 he saw him sprang up and spake exultingly "behold the man who hath
 deepest stricken into my soul who slew my dearprized friend not long
 shall we now shrink from each other along the highways of the war"

 he said and looking grimly spake unto goodly hector "come thou near
 that the sooner thou mayest arrive at the goal of death"

 then to him unterrified said hector of the glancing helm "son of
 peleus think not with words to affright me as a child since i too know
 myself how to speak taunts and unjust speech and i know that thou art a
 man of might and a far better man than i yet doth this issue lie in
 the lap of the gods whether i though weaker shall take thy life with my
 hurled spear for mine too hath been found keen ere now"

 he said and poised his spear and hurled it and athene with a breath
 turned it back from glorious achilles breathing very lightly and it
 came back to goodly hector and fell there before his feet then
 achilles set fiercely upon him eager to slay him crying his terrible
 cry but apollo caught hector up very easily as a god may and hid him
 in thick mist thrice then did fleetfooted noble achilles make onset
 with his spear of bronze and thrice smote the thick mist but when the
 fourth time he had come godlike on then with dread shout he spake to
 him winged words "dog thou art now again escaped from death yet came
 ill very nigh thee but now hath phoebus apollo saved thee to whom thou
 must surely pray when thou goest forth amid the clash of spears verily
 i will slay thee yet when i meet thee hereafter if any god is helper of
 me too now will i make after the rest whomsoever i may seize"

 thus speaking he pierced dryops in the midst of his neck with his spear
 and he fell down before his feet but he left him where he lay and
 hurled at demuchos philetor's son a good man and a tall and stayed him
 with a stroke upon his knees then smote him with his mighty sword and
 reft him of life then springing on laogonos and dardanos sons of bias
 he thrust both from their chariot to the ground one with a spearcast
 smiting and the other in close battle with his sword then tros
 alastor's sonhe came and clasped his knees to pray him to spare him
 and let him live and slay him not having compassion on his like
 age fond fool and knew not that he might not gain his prayers for
 nowise soft of heart or tender was that man but of fierce moodwith
 his hands he touched achilles' knees eager to entreat him but he smote
 him in the liver with his sword and his liver fell from him and black
 blood therefrom filled his bosom and he swooned and darkness covered
 his eyes then achilles came near and struck mulios in the ear and
 right through the other ear went the bronze spearhead then he smote
 agenor's son echeklos on the midst of the head with his hilted sword
 and all the sword grew hot thereat with blood and dark death seized his
 eyes and forceful fate then next deukalion just where the sinews of
 the elbow join there pierced he him through the forearm with his bronze
 spearhead so abode he with his arm weighed down beholding death
 before him and achilles smiting the neck with his sword swept far both
 head and helm and the marrow rose out of the backbone and the corpse
 lay stretched upon the earth then went he onward after peires' noble
 son rhigmos who had come from deepsoiled thrace him in the midst he
 smote with his hurled javelin and the point fixed in his lung and he
 fell forth of his chariot and areithoos his squire as he turned the
 horses round he pierced in the back with his sharp spear and thrust
 him from the car and the horse ran wild with fear

 as through deep glens rageth fierce fire on some parched mountainside
 and the deep forest burneth and the wind driving it whirleth every way
 the flame so raged he every way with his spear as it had been a god
 pressing hard on the men he slew and the black earth ran with blood
 for even as when one yoketh widebrowed bulls to tread white barley in a
 stablished threshingfloor and quickly is it trodden out beneath the
 feet of the loudlowing bulls thus beneath greathearted achilles his
 wholehooved horses trampled corpses and shields together and with
 blood all the axletree below was sprinkled and the rims that ran around
 the car for blooddrops from the horses' hooves splashed them and
 blooddrops from the tires of the wheels but the son of peleus pressed
 on to win him glory flecking with gore his irresistible hands



 book xxi

 how achilles fought with the river and chased the men of
 troy within their gates

 but when now they came unto the ford of the fairflowing river even
 eddying xanthos whom immortal zeus begat there sundering them he
 chased the one part to the plain toward the city even where the
 achaians were flying in affright the day before when glorious hector
 was in his furythither poured some in flight and hera spread before
 them thick mist to hinder thembut half were pent into the
 deepflowing silver eddied river and fell therein with a mighty noise
 and the steep channel sounded and the banks around rang loudly for
 with shouting they swam therein hither and thither whirled round the
 eddies and as when at the rush of fire locusts take wing to fly unto a
 river and the unwearying fire flameth forth on them with sudden onset
 and they huddle in the water so before achilles was the stream of
 deepeddying xanthos filled with the roar and the throng of horses and
 men

 then the seed of zeus left behind him his spear upon the bank leant
 against tamarisk bushes and leapt in as it were a god keeping his
 sword alone and devised grim work at heart and smote as he turned him
 every way about and their groaning went up ghastly as they were
 stricken by the sword and the water reddened with blood as before a
 dolphin of huge maw fly other fish and fill the nooks of some
 fairhavened bay in terror for he devoureth amain whichsoever of them
 he may catch so along the channels of that dread stream the trojans
 crouched beneath the precipitous sides and when his hands were weary of
 slaughter he chose twelve young men alive out of the river an atonement
 for patroklos menoitios' son that was dead these brought he forth
 amazed like fawns and bound behind them their hands with wellcut
 thongs which they themselves wore on their pliant doublets and gave
 them to his comrades to lead down to the hollow ships then again he
 made his onset athirst for slaying

 there met he a son of dardanid priam in flight out of the river
 lykaon whom once himself he took and brought unwilling out of his
 father's orchard in a night assault he was cutting with keen bronze
 young shoots of a wild fig tree to be handrails of a chariot but to
 him an unlookedfor bane came goodly achilles and at that time he sold
 him into wellpeopled lemnos sending him on ship board and the son of
 jason gave a price for him and thence a guest friend freed him with a
 great ransom eetion of imbros and sent him to goodly arisbe whence
 flying secretly he came to his father's house eleven days he rejoiced
 among his friends after he was come from lemnos but on the twelfth once
 more god brought him into the hands of achilles who was to send him to
 the house of hades though nowise fain to go him when fleetfooted noble
 achilles saw bare of helm and shield neither had he a spear but had
 thrown all to the ground for he sweated grievously as he tried to flee
 out of the river and his knees were failing him for weariness then in
 wrath spake achilles to his great heart "ha verily great marvel is
 this that i behold with my eyes surely then will the proud trojans whom
 i have slain rise up again from beneath the murky gloom since thus hath
 this man come back escaped from his pitiless fate though sold into
 goodly lemnos neither hath the deep of the hoary sea stayed him that
 holdeth many against their will but come then of our spear's point
 shall he taste that i may see and learn in my mind whether likewise he
 shall come back even from beneath or whether the lifegiving earth
 shall hold him down she that holdeth so even the strong"

 thus pondered he in his place but the other came near amazed fain to
 touch his knees for his soul longed exceedingly to flee from evil death
 and black destruction then goodly achilles lifted his long spear with
 intent to smite him but he stooped and ran under it and caught his
 knees and the spear went over his back and stood in the ground
 hungering for flesh of men then lykaon besought him with one hand
 holding his knees while with the other he held the sharp spear and
 loosed it not and spake to him winged words "i cry thee mercy
 achilles have thou regard and pity for me to thee o fosterling of
 zeus am i in the bonds of suppliantship for at thy table first i
 tasted meal of demeter on the day when thou didst take me captive in the
 wellordered orchard and didst sell me away from my father and my
 friends unto goodly lemnos and i fetched thee the price of a hundred
 oxen and now have i been ransomed for thrice that and this is my
 twelfth morn since i came to ilios after much pain now once again hath
 ruinous fate delivered me unto thy hands surely i must be hated of
 father zeus that he hath given me a second time unto thee and to short
 life my mother bare me laothoe old altes' daughteraltes who ruleth
 among the warloving leleges holding steep pedasos on the satnioeis
 his daughter priam had to wife with many others and of her were we two
 born and thou wilt butcher both him among the foremost of the
 footsoldiers didst thou lay low even godlike polydoros when thou
 smotest him with they sharp spear and now will it go hard with me here
 for no hope have i to escape thy hands since god hath delivered me
 thereunto yet one thing will i tell thee and do thou lay it to heart
 slay me not since i am not of the same mother as hector who slew thy
 comrade the gentle and brave"

 thus spake to him the noble son of priam beseeching him with words but
 he heard a voice implacable "fond fool proffer me no ransom nor these
 words until patroklos met his fated day then was it welcomer to my
 soul to spare the men of troy and many i took alive and sold beyond the
 sea but now there is none shall escape death whomsoever before ilios
 god shall deliver into my handsyes even among all trojans but
 chiefest among priam's sons ay friend thou too must die why
 lamentest thou patroklos is dead who was better far than thou seest
 thou not also what manner of man am i for might and goodliness and a
 good man was my father and a goddess mother bare me yet over me too
 hang death and forceful fate there cometh morn or eve or some noonday
 when my life too some man shall take in battle whether with spear he
 smite or arrow from the string"

 thus spake he and the other's knees and heart were unstrung he let go
 achilles' spear and sat with both hands outspread but achilles drew
 his sharp sword and smote on the collarbone beside the neck and all
 the twoedged sword sank into him and he lay stretched prone upon the
 earth and blood flowed dark from him and soaked the earth him seized
 achilles by the foot and sent him down the stream and over him exulting
 spake winged words "there lie thou among the fishes which shall lick
 off thy wound's blood heedlessly nor shall thy mother lay thee on a bed
 and mourn for thee but skamandros shall bear thee on his eddies into
 the broad bosom of the sea leaping along the wave shall many a fish
 dart up to the dark ripple to eat of the white flesh of lykaon so
 perish all until we reach the citadel of sacred ilios ye flying and i
 behind destroying nor even the river fairflowing silvereddied
 shall avail you to whom long time forsooth ye sacrifice many bulls and
 among his eddies throw wholehooved horses down alive for all this yet
 shall ye die the death until ye pay all for patroklos' slaying and the
 slaughter of achaians whom at the swift ships ye slew while i tarried
 afar"

 thus spake he but the river waxed ever more wroth in his heart and
 sought in his soul how he should stay goodly achilles from his work and
 ward destruction from the trojans meanwhile the son of peleus with his
 farshadowing spear leapt fain to slay him upon asteropaios son of
 pelegon whom wideflowing axios begat of periboia eldest of the
 daughters of akessamenos upon him set achilles and asteropaios stood
 against him from the river holding two spears for xanthos put courage
 into his heart being angered for the slaughtered youths whom achilles
 was slaughtering along the stream and had no pity on them then when the
 twain were come nigh in onset on each other unto him first spake
 fleetfooted noble achilles "who and whence art thou of men that
 darest to come against me illfated are they whose children match them
 with my might"

 and to him made answer pelegon's noble son "highhearted son of
 peleus why askest thou my lineage i come from deepsoiled paionia a
 land far off leading paionian men with their long spears and this now
 is the eleventh morn since i am come to ilios my lineage is of
 wideflowing axios who begat pelegon famous with the spear and he men
 say was my father now fight we noble achilles"

 thus spake he in defiance and goodly achilles lifted the pelian ash
 but the warrior asteropaios hurled with both spears together for he
 could use both hands alike and with the one spear smote the shield but
 pierced it not right through for the gold stayed it the gift of a god
 and with the other he grazed the elbow of achilles' right arm and there
 leapt forth dark blood but the point beyond him fixed itself in the
 earth eager to batten on flesh then in his turn achilles hurled on
 asteropaios his straightflying ash fain to have slain him but missed
 the man and struck the high bank and quivering half its length in the
 bank he left the ashen spear then the son of peleus drew his sharp
 sword from his thigh and leapt fiercely at him and he availed not to
 draw with his stout hand achilles' ashen shaft from the steep bank
 thrice shook he it striving to draw it forth and thrice gave up the
 strain but the fourth time he was fain to bend and break the ashen
 spear of the seed of aiakos but ere that achilles closing on him reft
 him of life with his sword for in the belly he smote him beside the
 navel and all his bowels gushed out to the earth and darkness covered
 his eyes as he lay gasping then achilles trampling on his breast
 stripped off his armour and spake exultingly "lie there it is hard to
 strive against children of kronos' mighty son even though one be sprung
 from a rivergod thou truly declarest thyself the seed of a
 wideflowing river but i avow me of the linkage of great zeus my sire
 is a man ruling many myrmidons peleus the son of aiakos and aiakos was
 begotten of zeus as zeus is mightier than seawardmurmuring rivers so
 is the seed of zeus made mightier than the seed of a river nay there
 is hard beside thee a great river if he may anywise avail but against
 zeus the son of kronos it is not possible to fight for him not even
 king acheloios is match nor yet the great strength of deepflowing
 ocean from whom all rivers flow and every sea and all springs and deep
 wells yea even he hath fear of the lightning of great zeus and his
 dread thunder when it pealeth out of heaven"

 he said and from the steep bank drew his bronze spear and left there
 asteropaios whom he had slain lying in the sands and the dark water
 flooded him around him eels and fishes swarmed tearing and gnawing the
 fat about his kidneys but achilles went on after the charioted paiones
 who still along the eddying river huddled in fear when they saw their
 best man in the stress of battle slain violently by the hands and the
 sword of the son of peleus there slew he thersilochos and mydon and
 astypylos and mnesos and thrasios and ainios and ophelestes and more
 yet of the paiones would swift achilles have slain had not the
 deepeddying river called unto him in wrath in semblance of a man and
 from an eddy's depth sent forth a voice "o achilles thy might and thy
 evil work are beyond the measure of men for gods themselves are ever
 helping thee if indeed the son of kronos hath delivered thee all the
 trojans to destroy at least drive them forth from me and do thy grim
 deeds on the plain for filled with dead men is my pleasant bed nor
 can i pour my stream to the great sea being choked with dead and thou
 slayest ruthlessly come then let be i am astonished o captain of
 hosts"

 and to him answered achilles fleet of foot "so be it heavensprung
 skamandros even as thou biddest but the proud trojans i will not cease
 from slaying until i have driven them into their city and have made
 trial with hector face to face whether he is to vanquish me or i him"

 thus saying he set upon the trojans like a god then unto apollo spake
 the deepeddying river "out on it lord of the silver bow child of
 zeus thou hast not kept the ordinance of kronos' son who charged thee
 straitly to stand by the trojans and to help them until eve come with
 light latesetting and darken the deepsoiled earth"

 he said and spearfamed achilles sprang from the bank and leapt into
 his midst but he rushed on him in a furious wave and stirred up all
 his streams in tumult and swept down the many dead who lay thick in
 him slain by achilles these out to land he cast with bellowing like a
 bull and saved the living under his fair streams hiding them within
 eddies deep and wide but terribly around achilles arose his tumultuous
 wave and the stream smote violently against his shield nor availed he
 to stand firm upon his feet then he grasped a tall fairgrown elm and
 it fell uprooted and tore away all the bank and reached over the fair
 river bed with its thick shoots and stemmed the river himself falling
 all within him and achilles struggling out of the eddy made haste to
 fly over the plain with his swift feet for he was afraid but the great
 god ceased not but arose upon him with darkness on his crest that he
 might stay noble achilles from slaughter and ward destruction from the
 men of troy and the son of peleus rushed away a spear's throw with the
 swoop of a black eagle the mighty hunter strongest at once and
 swiftest of winged birds like him he sped and on his breast the bronze
 rang terribly as he fled from beneath the onset and behind him the
 river rushed on with a mighty roar as when a fieldwaterer from a dark
 spring leadeth water along a bed through crops and garden grounds a
 mattock in his hands casting forth hindrances from the ditch and as it
 floweth all pebbles are swept down and swiftly gliding it murmureth
 down a sloping place and outrunneth him that is its guidethus ever
 the river wave caught up achilles for all his speed for gods are
 mightier than men for whensoever fleetfooted noble achilles struggled
 to stand against it and know whether all immortals be upon him who
 inhabit spacious heaven then would a great wave of the heavensprung
 river beat upon his shoulders from above and he sprang upward with his
 feet sore vexed at heart and the river was wearying his knees with
 violent rush beneath devouring the earth from under his feet then the
 son of peleus cried aloud looking up to the broad heaven "zeus
 father how doth none of the gods take it on him in pity to save me from
 the river after that let come to me what may none other of the
 inhabitants of heaven is chargeable so much but only my dear mother
 who beguiled me with false words saying that under the wall of the
 mailclad men of troy i must die by the swift arrows of apollo would
 that hector had slain me the best of men bred here then brave had been
 the slayer and a brave man had he slain but now by a sorry death am i
 doomed to die pent in this mighty river like a swineherd boy whom a
 torrent sweepeth down as he essayeth to cross it in a storm"

 thus spake he and quickly poseidon and athene came near and stood
 beside him in the likeness of men and taking his hands in theirs
 pledged him in words and the first that spake was poseidon shaker of
 the earth "son of peleus tremble not neither be afraid such helpers
 of thee are we from the gods approved of zeus even pallas athene and
 i for to be vanquished of a river is not appointed thee but he will
 soon give back and thou wilt thyself perceive it but we will give thee
 wise counsel if thou wilt obey it hold not thy hand from hazardous
 battle until within ilios' famous walls thou have pent the trojan host
 even all that flee before thee but do thou when thou hast taken the
 life of hector go back unto the ships this glory we give unto thee to
 win"

 they having thus spoken departed to the immortals but he toward the
 plainfor the bidding of gods was strong upon himwent onward and all
 the plain was filled with waterflood and many beautiful arms and
 corpses of slain youths were drifting there so upward sprang his knees
 as he rushed against the stream right on nor stayed him the
 wideflowing river for athene put great strength in him neither did
 skamandros slacken his fierceness but yet more raged against the son of
 peleus and he curled crestwise the billow of his stream lifting
 himself on high and on simoeis he called with a shout "dear brother
 the strength of this man let us both join to stay since quickly he will
 lay waste the great city of king priam and the trojans abide not in the
 battle help me with speed and fill thy streams with water from thy
 springs and urge on all thy torrents and raise up a great wave and
 stir huge roaring of treestumps and stones that we may stay the fierce
 man who now is lording it and deeming himself match for gods for
 neither i ween will strength avail him nor comeliness anywise nor
 that armour beautiful which deep beneath the flood shall be o'erlaid
 with slime and himself i will wrap him in my sands and pour round him
 countless shingle without stint nor shall the achaians know where to
 gather his bones so vast a shroud of silt will i heap over them where
 he dieth there shall be his tomb neither shall he have need of any
 barrow to be raised when the achaians make his funeral"

 he said and rushed in tumult on achilles raging from on high
 thundering with foam and blood and bodies of dead men then did a dark
 wave of the heavensprung river stand towering up and overwhelm the son
 of peleus but hera cried aloud in terror of achilles lest the great
 deepeddying river sweep him away and straightway she called to
 hephaistos her dear son "rise lame god o my son it was against thee
 we thought that eddying xanthos was matched in fight help with all
 speed put forth large blast of flame then will i go to raise a strong
 storm out of the sea of the west wind and the white south which shall
 utterly consume the dead trojans and their armour blowing the angry
 flame thou along xanthos' banks burn up his trees and wrap himself in
 fire nor let him anywise turn thee back by soft words or by threat nor
 stay thy rageonly when i cry to thee with my voice then hold the
 unwearying fire"

 thus spake she and hephaistos made ready fierceblazing fire first on
 the plain fire blazed and burnt the many dead who lay there thick
 slain by achilles and all the plain was parched and the bright water
 stayed and as when in late summer the north wind swiftly parcheth a new
 watered orchard and he that tilleth it is glad thus was the whole
 plain parched and hephaistos consumed the dead then against the river
 he turned his gleaming flame elms burnt and willow trees and tamarisks
 and lotos burnt and rush and galingale which round the fair streams of
 the river grew in multitude and the eels and fishes beneath the eddies
 were afflicted which through the fair streams tumbled this way and
 that in anguish at the blast of crafty hephaistos and the strong river
 burned and spake and called to him by name "hephaistos there is no
 god can match with thee nor will i fight thee thus ablaze with fire
 cease strife yea let noble achilles drive the trojans forthwith out of
 their city what have i to do with strife and succour"

 thus spake he burnt with fire for his fair streams were bubbling and
 as a cauldron boileth within beset with much fire melting the lard of
 some fatted hog spurting up on all sides and logs of firewood lie
 thereunderso burned his fair streams in the fire and the water
 boiled he had no mind to flow but refrained him for the breath of
 cunning hephaistos violently afflicted him then unto hera earnestly
 beseeching her' he spake winged words "hera wherefore hath thy son
 assailed my stream to vex it above others i am less chargeable than all
 the rest that are helpers of the trojans but lo i will give over if
 thou wilt and let thy son give over too and i further will swear even
 this that never will i ward the day of evil from the trojans not even
 when all troy is burning in the blaze of hungry fire and the warlike
 sons of achaians are the burners thereof"

 then when the whitearmed goddess hera heard his speech straightway she
 spake unto hephaistos her dear son "hephaistos hold famed son it
 befitteth not thus for mortals' sake to do violence to an immortal god"

 thus said she and hephaistos quenched the fierceblazing fire and the
 wave once more rolled down the fair riverbed

 so when the rage of xanthos was overcome both ceased for hera stayed
 them though in wrath but among the other gods fell grievous bitter
 strife and their hearts were carried diverse in their breasts and they
 clashed together with a great noise and the wide earth groaned and the
 clarion of great heaven rang around zeus heard as he sate upon olympus
 and his heart within him laughed pleasantly when he beheld that strife
 of gods then no longer stood they asunder for ares piercer of shields
 began the battle and first made for athene with his bronze spear and
 spake a taunting word "wherefore o dogfly dost thou match gods with
 gods in strife with stormy daring as thy great spirit moveth thee
 rememberest thou not how thou movedst diomedes tydeus' son to wound me
 and thyself didst take a visible spear and thrust it straight at me and
 pierce through my fair skin therefore deem i now that thou shalt pay me
 for all that thou hast done"

 thus saying he smote on the dread tasselled aegis that not even the
 lightning of zeus can overcomethereon smote bloodstained ares with his
 long spear but she giving back grasped with stout hand a stone that
 lay upon the plain black rugged huge which men of old time set to be
 the landmark of a field this hurled she and smote impetuous ares on
 the neck and unstrung his limbs seven roods he covered in his fall
 and soiled his hair with dust and his armour rang upon him and pallas
 athene laughed and spake to him winged words exultingly "fool not
 even yet hast thou learnt how far better than thou i claim to be that
 thus thou matchest thy might with mine thus shalt thou satisfy thy
 mother's curses who deviseth mischief against thee in her wrath for
 that thou hast left the achaians and givest the proud trojan's aid"

 thus having said she turned from him her shining eyes him did aphrodite
 daughter of zeus take by the hand and lead away groaning continually
 for scarce gathered he his spirit back to him but when the whitearmed
 goddess hera was aware of them straightway she spake unto athene winged
 words "out on it child of aegisbearing zeus maiden invincible lo
 there the dogfly is leading ares destroyer of men out of the fray of
 battle down the throngnay then pursue her"

 she said and athene sped after her with heart exultant and made at her
 and smote her with stout hand upon the breast and straightway her knees
 and heart were unstrung so they twain lay on the bounteous earth and
 she spake winged words exultingly "such let all be who give the trojans
 aid when they fight against the mailed argives be they even so bold and
 brave as aphrodite when she came to succour ares and defied my might
 then should we long ago have ceased from war having laid waste the
 stablished citadel of ilios"

 she said and the whitearmed goddess hera smiled then to apollo
 spake the earthshaking lord "phoebus why stand we apart it befitteth
 not after the rest have begun that were the more shameful if without
 fighting we should go to olympus to the bronzethresholded house of
 zeus begin for thou art younger it were not meet for me since i was
 born first and know more fond god how foolish is thy heart thou
 rememberest not all the ills we twain alone of gods endured at ilios
 when by ordinance of zeus we came to proud laomedon and served him
 through a year for promised recompense and he laid on us his commands
 i round their city built the trojans a wall wide and most fair that
 the city might be unstormed and thou phoebus didst herd shambling
 crookhorned kine among the spurs of woody manyfolded ida but when the
 joyous seasons were accomplishing the term of hire then redoubtable
 laomedon robbed us of all hire and sent us off with threats he
 threatened that he would bind together our feet and hands and sell us
 into faroff isles and the ears of both of us he vowed to shear off
 with the sword so we went home with angry hearts wroth for the hire he
 promised and gave us not to his folk not thou showest favour nor
 essayest with us how the proud trojans may be brought low and perish
 miserably with their children and noble wives"

 then to him answered king apollo the fardarter "shaker of the earth
 of no sound mind wouldst thou repute me if i should fight against thee
 for the sake of pitiful mortals who like unto leaves now live in
 glowing life consuming the fruit of the earth and now again pine into
 death let us with all speed cease from combat and let them do battle
 by themselves"

 thus saying he turned away for he felt shame to deal in blows with his
 father's brother but his sister upbraided him sore the queen of wild
 beasts huntress artemis and spake a taunting word "so then thou
 fleest fardarter hast quite yielded to poseidon the victory and
 given him glory for naught fond god why bearest thou an ineffectual
 bow in vain let me not hear thee again in the halls of our sire boast
 as before among the immortal gods thou wouldst stand up to fight against
 poseidon"

 thus spake she but fardarting apollo answered her not but angrily the
 noble spouse of zeus upbraided the archer queen with taunting words
 "how now art thou fain bold vixen to set thyself against me hard were
 it for thee to match my might bowbearer though thou art since against
 women zeus made thee a lion and giveth thee to slay whomso of them thou
 wilt truly it is better on the mountains to slay wild beasts and deer
 than to fight amain with mightier than thou but if thou wilt try war
 that thou mayest know well how far stronger am i since thou matchest
 thy might with mine"

 she said and with her left hand caught both the other's hands by the
 wrist and with her right took the bow from off her shoulders and
 therewith smiling beat her on the ears as she turned this way and
 that and the swift arrows fell out of her quiver and weeping from
 before her the goddess fled like a dove that from before a falcon flieth
 to a hollow rock a cleftfor she was not fated to be caughtthus
 artemis fled weeping and left her bow and arrows where they lay then
 to leto spake the guide the slayer of argus "leto with thee will i no
 wise fight a grievous thing it is to come to blows with wives of
 cloudgathering zeus but boast to thy heart's content among the
 immortal gods that thou didst vanquish me by might and main"

 thus said he and leto gathered up the curved bow and arrows fallen
 hither and thither amid the whirl of dust so taking her daughter's bow
 she went back and the maiden came to olympus to the bronzethresholded
 house of zeus and weeping set herself on her father's knee while round
 her her divine vesture quivered and her father kronos' son took her
 to him and asked of her laughing gently "who of the inhabitants of
 heaven dear child hath dealt with thee thus hastily as though thou
 hadst been doing some wrong thing openly"

 and to him in answer spake the faircrowned queen of the echoing chase
 "it was thy wife that buffeted me father the whitearmed hera from
 whom are strife and contention come upon the immortals"

 thus talked they unto one another then phoebus apollo entered into
 sacred ilios for he was troubled for the wall of the wellbuilded city
 lest the danaans waste it before its hour upon that day but the other
 everliving gods went to olympus some angry and some greatly
 triumphing and sat down beside zeus who hideth himself in dark clouds

 now achilles was still slaying the trojans both themselves and their
 wholehooved horses and as when a smoke goeth up to the broad heaven
 when a city burneth kindled by the wrath of gods and causeth toil to
 all and griefs to many thus caused achilles toil and griefs to the
 trojans and the old man priam stood on the sacred tower and was aware
 of dread achilles how before him the trojans thronged in rout nor was
 any succour found of them then with a cry he went down from the tower
 to rouse the gallant warders along the walls "hold open the gates in
 your hands until the folk come to the city in their rout for closely is
 achilles chasing themnow trow i there will be deadly deeds and when
 they are gathered within the wall and are taking breath then again shut
 back the gatewings firmly builded for i fear lest that murderous man
 spring in within the wall"

 thus spake he and they opened the gates and thrust back the bolts and
 the gates flung back gave safety then apollo leapt forth to the front
 that he might ward destruction from the trojans they straight for the
 city and the high wall were fleeing parched with thirst and dustgrimed
 from the plain and achilles chased them vehemently with his spear for
 strong frenzy possessed his heart continually and he thirsted to win
 him renown then would the sons of the achaians have taken highgated
 troy had not phoebus apollo aroused goodly agenor antenor's son a
 princely man and strong in his heart he put good courage and himself
 stood by his side that he might ward off the grievous visitations of
 death leaning against the oak and he was shrouded in thick mist so
 when agenor was aware of achilles waster of cities he halted and his
 heart much wavered as he stood and in trouble he spake to his great
 heart "ay me if i flee before mighty achilles there where the rest
 are driven terrorstruck nathless will he overtake me and slaughter me
 as a coward or what if i leave these to be driven before achilles the
 son of peleus and flee upon my feet from the wall by another way to the
 ileian plain until i come to the spurs of ida and hide me in the
 underwood so then at evening having bathed in the river and refreshed
 me of sweat i might return to ilios nay why doth my heart debate thus
 within me lest he might be aware of me as i get me from the city for
 the plain and speeding after overtake me with swift feet then will it
 no more be possible to avoid the visitation of death for he is
 exceeding mighty above all mankind what then if in front of the city i
 go forth to meet him surely his flesh too is penetrable by sharp
 bronze and there is but one life within and men say he is mortal
 howbeit zeus the son of kronos giveth him renown"

 thus saying he gathered himself to await achilles and within him his
 stout heart was set to strive and fight as a leopardess goeth forth
 from a deep thicket to affront a huntsman nor is afraid at heart nor
 fleeth when she heareth the bay of hounds for albeit the man first
 smite her with thrust or throw yet even pierced through with the spear
 she ceaseth not from her courage until she either grapple or be slain
 so noble antenor's son goodly agenor refused to flee till he should
 put achilles to the proof but held before him the circle of his shield
 and aimed at him with his spear and cried aloud "doubtless thou hopest
 in thy heart noble achilles on this day to sack the city of the proud
 men of troy fond man there shall many woful things yet be wrought
 before it for within it we are many men and staunch who in front of
 our parents dear and wives and sons keep ilios safe but thou shalt here
 meet death albeit so redoubtable and bold a man of war"

 he said and hurled his sharp spear with weighty hand and smote him on
 the leg beneath the knee nor missed his mark and the greave of
 newwrought tin rang terribly on him but the bronze bounded back from
 him it smote nor pierced him for the god's gift drave it back then
 the son of peleus in his turn made at godlike agenor but apollo
 suffered him not to win renown but caught away agenor and shrouded him
 in thick mist and sent him in peace to be gone out of the war then by
 wile kept the son of peleus away from the folk for in complete
 semblance of agenor himself he stood before the feet of achilles who
 hasted to run upon him and chase him and while he chased him over the
 wheatbearing plain edging him toward the deepeddying river
 skamandros as he ran but a little in front of him for by wile apollo
 beguiled him that he kept ever hoping to overtake him in the race
 meantime the other trojans in common rout came gladly unto their
 fastness and the city was filled with the throng of them neither had
 they heart to await one another outside the city and wall and to know
 who might have escaped and who had perished in the fight but
 impetuously they poured into the city whomsoever of them his feet and
 knees might save



 book xxii

 how achilles fought with hector and slew him and brought
 his body to the ships

 thus they throughout the city scared like fawns were cooling their
 sweat and drinking and slaking their thirst leaning on the fair
 battlements while the achaians drew near the wall setting shields to
 shoulders but hector deadly fate bound to abide in his place in front
 of ilios and the skaian gates then to the son of peleus spake phoebus
 apollo "wherefore son of peleus pursuest thou me with swift feet
 thyself being mortal and i a deathless god thou hast not even yet known
 me that i am a god but strivest vehemently truly thou regardest not
 thy task among the affliction of the trojans whom thou affrightedst who
 now are gathered into the city while thou heat wandered hither me thou
 wilt never slay for i am not subject unto death"

 then mightily moved spake unto him achilles fleet of foot "thou hast
 baulked me fardarter most mischievous of all the gods in that thou
 hast turned me hither from the wall else should full many yet have
 bitten the dust or ever within ilios had they come now hast thou robbed
 me of great renown and lightly hast saved them because thou hadst no
 vengeance to fear thereafter verily i would avenge me on thee had i
 but the power"

 thus saying toward the city he was gone in pride of heart rushing like
 some victorious horse in a chariot that runneth lightly at full speed
 over the plain so swiftly plied achilles his feet and knees him the
 old man priam first beheld as he sped across the plain blazing as the
 star that cometh forth at harvesttime and plain seen his rays shine
 forth amid the host of stars in the darkness of night the star whose
 name men call orion's dog brightest of all is he yet for an evil sign
 is he set and bringeth much fever upon hapless men even so on
 achilles' breast the bronze gleamed as he ran and the old man cried
 aloud and beat upon his head with his hands raising them on high and
 with a cry called aloud beseeching his dear son for he before the gates
 was standing all hot for battle with achilles and the old man spake
 piteously unto him stretching forth his hands "hector beloved son i
 pray thee await not this man alone with none beside thee lest thou
 quickly meet thy doom slain by the son of peleus since he is mightier
 far a merciless man would the gods loved him even as do i then
 quickly would dogs and vultures devour him on the fieldthereby would
 cruel pain go from my heartthe man who hath bereft me of many valiant
 sons slaying them and selling them captive into faroff isles ay even
 now twain of my children lykaon and polydoros i cannot see among the
 trojans that throng into the fastness sons whom laothoe bare me a
 princess among women if they be yet alive amid the enemy's host then
 will we ransom them with bronze and gold for there is store within for
 much goods gave the old man famous altes to his child if they be dead
 then even in the house of hades shall they be a sorrow to my soul and to
 their mother even to us who gave them birth but to the rest of the
 folk a briefer sorrow if but thou die not by achilles' hand nay come
 within the wall my child that thou preserve the men and women of troy
 neither give great triumph to the son of peleus and be thyself bereft
 of sweet life have compassion also on me the helpless one who still
 can feel illfated whom the father kronos' son will bring to naught
 by a grievous doom in the path of old age having seen full many ills
 his sons perishing and his daughters carried away captive and his
 chambers laid waste and infant children hurled to the ground in terrible
 war and his sons' wives dragged away by the ruinous hands of the
 achaians myself then last of all at the street door will ravening dogs
 tear when some one by stroke or throw of the sharp bronze hath bereft
 my limbs of lifeeven the dogs i reared in my halls about my table and
 to guard my door which then having drunk my blood maddened at heart
 shall lie in the gateway a young man all beseemeth even to be slain in
 war to be torn by the sharp bronze and lie on the field though he be
 dead yet is all honourable to him whate'er be seen but when dogs
 defile the hoary head and hoary beard of an old man slain this is the
 most piteous thing that cometh upon hapless men"

 thus spake the old man and grasped his hoary hairs plucking them from
 his head but he persuaded not hector's soul then his mother in her turn
 wailed tearfully loosening the folds of her robe while with the other
 hand she showed her breast and through her tears spake to him winged
 words "hector my child have regard unto this bosom and pity me if
 ever i gave thee consolation of my breast think of it dear child and
 from this side the wall drive back the foe nor stand in front to meet
 him he is merciless if he slay thee it will not be on a bed that i or
 thy wife shall bewail thee my own dear child but far away from us by
 the ships of the argives will swift dogs devour thee"

 thus they with wailing spake to their dear son beseeching him sore yet
 they persuaded not hector's soul but he stood awaiting achilles as he
 drew nigh in giant might as a serpent of the mountains upon his den
 awaiteth a man having fed on evil poisons and fell wrath hath entered
 into him and terribly he glared as he coileth himself about his den so
 hector with courage unquenchable gave not back leaning his shining
 shield against a jutting tower then sore troubled he spake to his great
 heart "ay me if i go within the gates and walls polydamas will be
 first to bring reproach against me since he bade me lead the trojans to
 the city during this ruinous night when noble achilles arose but i
 regarded him not yet surely it had been better far and now that i have
 undone the host by my wantonness i am ashamed before the men of troy
 and women of trailing robes lest at any time some worse man than i
 shall say 'hector by trusting his own might undid the host' so will
 they speak then to me would it be better far to face achilles and
 either slay him and go home or myself die gloriously before the city
 or what if i lay down my bossy shield and my stout helm and lean my
 spear against the wall and go of myself to meet noble achilles and
 promise him that helen and with her all possessions that alexandros
 brought in hollow ships to troy the beginning of strife we will give
 to the sons of atreus to take away and therewithal to divide in half
 with the achaians all else that this city holdeth and if thereafter i
 obtain from the trojans an oath of the elders that they will hide
 nothing but divide all in twain whatever wealth the pleasant city hold
 within but wherefore doth my heart debate thus i might come unto him
 and he would not pity or regard me at all but presently slay me unarmed
 as it were but a woman if i put off my armour no time is it now to
 dally with him from oaktree or from rock like youth with maiden as
 youth and maiden hold dalliance one with another better is it to join
 battle with all speed let us know upon which of us twain the olympian
 shall bestow renown"

 thus pondered he as he stood but nigh on him came achilles peer of
 enyalios warrior of the waving helm brandishing from his right shoulder
 the pelian ash his terrible spear and all around the bronze on him
 flashed like the gleam of blazing fire or of the sun as he ariseth and
 trembling seized hector as he was aware of him nor endured he to abide
 in his place but left the gates behind him and fled in fear and the
 son of peleus darted after him trusting in his swift feet as a falcon
 upon the mountains swiftest of winged things swoopeth fleetly after a
 trembling dove and she before him fleeth while he with shrill screams
 hard at hand still darteth at her for his heart urgeth him to seize
 her so achilles in hot haste flew straight for him and hector fled
 beneath the trojans' wall and plied swift knees they past the
 watchplace and windwaved wild figtree sped ever away from under the
 wall along the waggontrack and came to the two fairflowing springs
 where two fountains rise that feed deepeddying skamandros the one
 floweth with warm water and smoke goeth up therefrom around as it were
 from a blazing fire while the other even in summer floweth forth like
 cold hail or snow or ice that water formeth and there beside the
 springs are broad washingtroughs hard by fair troughs of stone where
 wives and fair daughters of the men of troy were wont to wash bright
 raiment in the old time of peace before the sons of the achaians came
 thereby they ran he flying he pursuing valiant was the flier but far
 mightier he who fleetly pursued him for not for beast of sacrifice or
 for an oxhide were they striving such as are prizes for men's speed of
 foot but for the life of horsetaming hector was their race and as
 when victorious wholehooved horses run rapidly round the
 turningpoints and some great prize lieth in sight be it a tripod or a
 woman in honour of a man that is dead so thrice around priam's city
 circled those twain with flying feet and all the gods were gazing on
 them then among them spake first the father of gods and men "ay me a
 man beloved i see pursued around the wall my heart is woe for hector
 who hath burnt for me many thighs of oxen amid the crests of manyfolded
 ida and other times on the cityheight but now is goodly achilles
 pursuing him with swift feet round priam's town come give your
 counsel gods and devise whether we shall save him from death or now at
 last slay him valiant though he be by the hand of achilles peleus'
 son"

 then to him answered the brighteyed goddess athene "o father lord of
 the bright lightning and the dark cloud what is this thou hast said a
 man that is a mortal doomed long ago by fate wouldst thou redeem back
 from illboding death do it but not all we other gods approve"

 and unto her in answer spake cloudgathering zeus "be of good cheer
 tritoborn dear child not in full earnest speak i and i would fain be
 kind to thee do as seemeth good to thy mind and draw not back"

 thus saying he roused athene that already was set thereon and from the
 crests of olympus she darted down

 but after hector sped fleet achilles chasing him vehemently and as when
 on the mountains a hound hunteth the fawn of a deer having started it
 from its covert through glens and glades and if it crouch to baffle
 him under a bush yet scenting it out the hound runneth constantly until
 he find it so hector baffled not peleus' fleetfooted son oft as he
 set himself to dart under the wellbuilt walls over against the
 dardanian gates if haply from above they might succour him with darts
 so oft would achilles gain on him and turn him toward the plain while
 himself he sped ever on the cityside and as in a dream one faileth in
 chase of a flying man the one faileth in his flight and the other in
 his chaseso failed achilles to overtake him in the race and hector to
 escape and thus would hector have avoided the visitation of death had
 not this time been utterly the last wherein apollo came nigh to him who
 nerved his strength and his swift knees for to the host did noble
 achilles sign with his head and forbade them to hurl bitter darts
 against hector lest any smiting him should gain renown and he himself
 come second but when the fourth time they had reached the springs then
 the father hung his golden balances and set therein two lots of dreary
 death one of achilles one of horsetaming hector and held them by the
 midst and poised then hector's fated day sank down and fell to the
 house of hades and phoebus apollo left him but to peleus' son came the
 brighteyed goddess athene and standing near spake to him winged words
 "now verily glorious achilles dear to zeus i have hope that we twain
 shall carry off great glory to the ships for the achaians having slain
 hector for all his thirst for fight no longer is it possible for him
 to escape us not even though fardarting apollo should travail sore
 grovelling before the father aegisbearing zeus but do thou now stand
 and take breath and i will go and persuade this man to confront thee in
 fight"

 thus spake athene and he obeyed and was glad at heart and stood
 leaning on his bronzepointed ashenspear and she left him and came to
 noble hector like unto deiphobos in shape and in strong voice and
 standing near spake to him winged words "dear brother verily fleet
 achilles doth thee violence chasing thee round priam's town with swift
 feet but come let us make a stand and await him on our defence"

 then answered her great hector of the glancing helm "deiphobos verily
 aforetime wert thou far dearest of my brothers but now methinks i shall
 honour thee even more in that thou hast dared for my sake when thou
 sawest me to come forth of the wall while the others tarry within"

 then to him again spake the brighteyed goddess athene "dear brother
 of a truth my father and lady mother and my comrades around besought me
 much entreating me in turn to tarry there so greatly do they all
 tremble before him but my heart within was sore with dismal grief and
 now fight we with straightset resolve and let there be no sparing of
 spears that we may know whether achilles is to slay us and carry our
 bloody spoils to the hollow ships or whether he might be vanquished by
 thy spear"

 thus saying athene in her subtlety led him on and when they were come
 nigh in onset on one another to achilles first spake great hector of
 the glancing helm "no longer son of peleus will i fly thee as before
 i thrice ran round the great town of priam and endured not to await thy
 onset now my heart biddeth me stand up against thee i will either slay
 or be slain but come hither and let us pledge us by our gods for they
 shall be best witnesses and beholders of covenants i will entreat thee
 in no outrageous sort if zeus grant me to outstay thee and if i take
 thy life but when i have despoiled thee of thy glorious armour o
 achilles i will give back thy dead body to the achaians and do thou
 the same"

 but unto him with grim gaze spake achilles fleet of foot "hector talk
 not to me thou madman of covenants as between men and lions there is
 no pledge of faith nor wolves and sheep can be of one mind but imagine
 evil continually against each other so is it impossible for thee and me
 to be friends neither shall be any pledge between us until one or other
 shall have fallen and glutted with blood ares the stubborn god of war
 bethink thee of all thy soldiership now behoveth it thee to quit thee
 as a good spearman and valiant man of war no longer is there way of
 escape for thee but pallas athene will straightway subdue thee to my
 spear and now in one hour shalt thou pay back for all my sorrows for my
 friends whom thou hast slain in the fury of thy spear"

 he said and poised his farshadowing spear and hurled and noble hector
 watched the coming thereof and avoided it for with his eye on it he
 crouched and the bronze spear flew over him and fixed itself in the
 earth but pallas athene caught it up and gave it back to achilles
 unknown of hector shepherd of hosts then hector spake unto the noble
 son of peleus "thou hast missed so no wise yet godlike achilles has
 thou known from zeus the hour of my doom though thou thoughtest it
 cunning of tongue art thou and a deceiver in speech that fearing thee i
 might forget my valour and strength not as i flee shalt thou plant thy
 spear in my reins but drive it straight through my breast as i set on
 thee if god hath given thee to do it now in thy turn avoid my spear of
 bronze o that thou mightst take it all into thy flesh then would the
 war be lighter to the trojans if but thou wert dead for thou art their
 greatest bane"

 he said and poised his longshadowed spear and hurled it and smote the
 midst of the shield of peleus' son and missed him not but far from the
 shield the spear leapt back and hector was wroth that his swift weapon
 had left his hand in vain and he stood downcast for he had no second
 ashen spear and he called with a loud shout to deiphobos of the white
 shield and asked of him a long spear but he was no wise nigh then
 hector knew he truth in his heart and spake and said "ay me now
 verily the gods have summoned me to death i deemed the warrior
 deiphobos was by my side but he is within the wall and it was athene
 who played me false now therefore is evil death come very nigh me not
 far off nor is there way of escape this then was from of old the
 pleasure of zeus and of the fardarting son of zeus who yet before were
 fain to succour me but now my fate hath found me at least let me not
 die without a struggle or ingloriously but in some great deed of arms
 whereof men yet to be born shall hear"

 thus saying he drew his sharp sword that by his flank hung great and
 strong and gathered himself and swooped like a soaring eagle that
 darteth to the plain through the dark clouds to seize a tender lamb or
 crouching hare so hector swooped brandishing his sharp sword and
 achilles made at him for his heart was filled with wild fierceness and
 before his breast he made a covering with his fair graven shield and
 tossed his bright fourplated helm and round it waved fair golden
 plumes that hephaistos had set thick about the crest as a star goeth
 among stars in the darkness of night hesperos fairest of all stars set
 in heaven so flashed there forth a light from the keen spear achilles
 poised in his right hand devising mischief against noble hector eyeing
 his fair flesh to find the fittest place now for the rest of him his
 flesh was covered by the fair bronze armour he stripped from strong
 patroklos when he slew him but there was an opening where the collar
 bones coming from the shoulders clasp the neck even at the gullet
 where destruction of life cometh quickliest there as he came on noble
 achilles drave at him with his spear and right through the tender neck
 went the point yet the bronzeweighted ashen spear clave not the
 windpipe so that he might yet speak words of answer to his foe and he
 fell down in the dust and noble achilles spake exultingly "hector
 thou thoughtest whilst thou wert spoiling patroklos that thou wouldst
 be safe and didst reck nothing of me who was afar thou fool but away
 among the hollow ships his comrade a mightier far even i was left
 behind who now have unstrung thy knees thee shall dogs and birds tear
 foully but his funeral shall the achaians make"

 then with faint breath spake unto him hector of the glancing helm "i
 pray thee by thy life and knees and parents leave me not for dogs of the
 achaians to devour by the ships but take good store of bronze and gold
 gifts that my father and lady mother shall give to thee and give them
 home my body back again that the trojans and trojans' wives give me my
 due of fire after my death"

 but unto him with grim gaze spake achilles fleet of foot "entreat me
 not dog by knees or parents would that my heart's desire could so bid
 me myself to carve and eat raw thy flesh for the evil thou hast wrought
 me as surely is there none that shall keep the dogs from thee not even
 should they bring ten or twenty fold ransom and here weigh it out and
 promise even more not even were priam dardanos' son to bid pay thy
 weight in gold not even so shall thy lady mother lay thee on a bed to
 mourn her son but dogs and birds shall devour thee utterly"

 then dying spake unto him hector of the glancing helm "verily i know
 thee and behold thee as thou art nor was i destined to persuade thee
 truly thy heart is iron in thy breast take heed now lest i draw upon
 thee wrath of gods in the day when paris and phoebus apollo slay thee
 for all thy valour at the skaian gate"

 he ended and the shadow of death came down upon him and his soul flew
 forth of his limbs and was gone to the house of hades wailing her fate
 leaving her vigour and youth then to the dead man spake noble achilles
 "die for my death i will accept it whensoever zeus and the other
 immortal gods are minded to accomplish it"

 he said and from the corpse drew forth his bronze spear and set it
 aside and stripped the bloody armour from the shoulders and other sons
 of achaians ran up around who gazed upon the stature and marvellous
 goodliness of hector nor did any stand by but wounded him and thus
 would many a man say looking toward his neighbour "go to of a truth
 far easier to handle is hector now than when he burnt the ships with
 blazing fire" thus would many a man say and wound him as he stood hard
 by and when fleet noble achilles had despoiled him he stood up among
 the achaians and spake winged words "friends chiefs and counsellors of
 the argives since the gods have vouchsafed us to vanquish this man who
 hath done us more evil than all the rest together come let us make
 trial in arms round about the city that we may know somewhat of the
 trojans' purpose whether since he hath fallen they will forsake the
 citadel or whether they are minded to abide albeit hector is no more
 but wherefore doth my heart debate thus there lieth by the ships a dead
 man unbewailed unburied patroklos him will i not forget while i
 abide among the living and my knees can stir nay if even in the house
 of hades the dead forget their dead yet will i even there be mindful of
 my dear comrade but come ye sons of the achaians let us now singing
 our song of victory go back to the hollow ships and take with us our
 foe great glory have we won we have slain the noble hector unto whom
 the trojans prayed throughout their city as he had been a god"

 he said and devised foul entreatment of noble hector the tendons of
 both feet behind he slit from heel to anklejoint and thrust
 therethrough thongs of oxhide and bound him to his chariot leaving
 his head to trail and when he had mounted the chariot and lifted
 therein the famous armour he lashed his horses to speed and they
 nothing loth flew on and dust rose around him that was dragged and his
 dark hair flowed loose on either side and in the dust lay all his once
 fair head for now had zeus given him over to his foes to entreat foully
 in his own native land

 thus was his head all grimed with dust but his mother when she beheld
 her son tore her hair and cast far from her her shining veil and cried
 aloud with an exceeding bitter cry and piteously moaned his father and
 around them the folk fell to crying and moaning throughout the town
 most like it seemed as though all beetling ilios were burning utterly in
 fire scarcely could the folk keep back the old man in his hot desire to
 get him forth of the dardanian gates for he besought them all casting
 himself down in the mire and calling on each man by his name "hold
 friends and though you love me leave me to get me forth of the city
 alone and go unto the ships of the achaians let me pray this accursed
 horrorworking man if haply he may feel shame before his agefellows
 and pity an old man he also hath a father such as i am peleus who
 begat and reared him to be a bane of trojansand most of all to me hath
 he brought woe so many sons of mine hath he slain in their floweryet
 for all my sorrow for the rest i mourn them all less than this one
 alone for whom my sharp grief will bring me down to the house of
 hadeseven hector would that he had died in my arms then would we
 have wept and wailed our fill his mother who bore him to her ill hap
 and i myself"

 thus spake he wailing and all the men of the city made moan with him
 and among the women of troy hekabe led the wild lament "my child ah
 woe is me wherefore should i live in my pain now thou art dead who
 night and day wert my boast through the city and blessing to all both
 men and women of troy throughout the town who hailed thee as a god for
 verily an exceeding glory to them wert thou in thy lifenow death and
 fate have overtaken thee"

 thus spake she wailing but hector's wife knew not as yet for no true
 messenger had come to tell her how her husband abode without the gates
 but in an inner chamber of the lofty house she was weaving a double
 purple web and broidering therein manifold flowers then she called to
 her goodlyhaired handmaids through the house to set a great tripod on
 the fire that hector might have warm washing when he came home out of
 the battle fond heart and was unaware how far from all washings
 brighteyed athene had slain him by the hand of achilles but she heard
 shrieks and groans from the battlements and her limbs reeled and the
 shuttle fell from her hands to earth then again among her goodlyhaired
 maids she spake "come two of ye this way with me that i may see what
 deeds are done it was the voice of my husband's noble mother that i
 heard and in my own breast my heart leapeth to my mouth and my knees
 are numbed beneath me surely some evil thing is at hand against the
 children of priam would that such word might never reach my ear yet
 terribly i dread lest noble achilles have cut off bold hector from the
 city by himself and chased him to the plain and ere this ended his
 perilous pride that possessed him for never would he tarry among the
 throng of men but ran out before them far yielding place to no man in
 his hardihood"

 thus saying she sped through the chamber like one mad with beating
 heart and with her went her handmaidens but when she came to the
 battlements and the throng of men she stood still upon the wall and
 gazed and beheld him dragged before the cityswift horses dragged him
 recklessly toward the hollow ships of the achaians then dark night came
 on her eyes and shrouded her and she fell backward and gasped forth her
 spirit from off her head she shook the bright attiring thereof
 frontlet and net and woven band and veil the veil that golden
 aphrodite gave her on the day when hector of the glancing helm led her
 forth of the house of eetion having given bridegifts untold and
 around her thronged her husband's sisters and his brothers' wives who
 held her up among them distraught even to death but when at last she
 came to herself and her soul returned into her breast then wailing with
 deep sobs she spake among the women of troy "o hector woe is me to
 one fate then were we both born thou in troy in the house of priam and
 i in thebe under woody plakos in the house of eetion who reared me
 from a little oneillfated sire of cruelfated child ah would he
 have begotten me not now thou to the house of hades beneath the secret
 places of the earth departest and me in bitter mourning thou leavest a
 widow in thy halls and thy son is but an infant childson of unhappy
 parents thee and menor shalt thou profit him hector since thou art
 dead neither he thee for even if he escape the achaians' woful war
 yet shall labour and sorrow cleave unto him hereafter for other men
 shall seize his lands the day of orphanage sundereth a child from his
 fellows and his head is bowed down ever and his cheeks are wet with
 tears and in his need the child seeketh his father's friends plucking
 this one by cloak and that by coat and one of them that pity him
 holdeth his cup a little to his mouth and moisteneth his lips but his
 palate he moisteneth not and some child unorphaned thrusteth him from
 the feast with blows and taunting words 'out with thee no father of
 thine is at our board' then weeping to his widowed mother shall he
 return even astyanax who erst upon his father's knee ate only marrow
 and fat flesh of sheep and when sleep fell on him and he ceased from
 childish play then in bed in his nurse's arms he would slumber softly
 nested having satisfied his heart with good things but now that he
 hath lost his father he will suffer many ills astyanaxthat name the
 trojans gave him because thou only wet the defence of their gates and
 their long walls but now by the beaked ships far from thy parents
 shall coiling worms devour thee when the dogs have had their fill as
 thou liest naked yet in these halls lieth raiment of thine delicate
 and fair wrought by the hands of women but verily all these will i
 consume with burning fireto thee no profit since thou wilt never lie
 therein yet that his be honour to thee from the men and the women of
 troy"

 thus spake she wailing and the women joined their moan



 book xxiii

 of the funeral of patroklos and the funeral games

 thus they throughout the city made moan but the achaians when they were
 come to the ships and to the hellespont were scattered each to his own
 ship only the myrmidons achilles suffered not to be scattered but
 spake among his comrades whose delight was in war "fleethorsed
 myrmidons my trusty comrades let us not yet unyoke our wholehooved
 steeds from their cars but with horses and chariots let us go near and
 mourn patroklos for such is the honour of the dead then when we have
 our fill of grievous wailing we will unyoke the horses and all sup
 here"

 he said and they with one accord made lamentation and achilles led
 their mourning so thrice around the dead they drave their wellmaned
 steeds moaning and thetis stirred among them desire of wailing
 bedewed were the sands with tears bedewed the warriors' arms so great
 a lord of fear they sorrowed for and peleus' son led their loud wail
 laying his manslaying hands on his comrade's breast "all hail
 patroklos even in the house of hades for all that i promised thee
 before am i accomplishing seeing i have dragged hither hector to give
 raw unto dogs to devour and twelve noble children of the trojans to
 slaughter before thy pyre because of mine anger at thy slaying"

 he said and devised foul entreatment of noble hector stretching him
 prone in the dust beside the bier of menoitios' son and the rest put
 off each his glittering bronze arms and unyoked their highneighing
 horses and sate them down numberless beside the ship of fleetfooted
 aiakides and he gave them ample funeral feast many sleek oxen were
 stretched out their throats cut with steel and many sheep and bleating
 goats and many whitetusked boars well grown in fat were spitted to
 singe in the flame of hephaistos so on all sides round the corpse in
 cupfuls blood was flowing

 but the fleetfooted prince the son of peleus was brought to noble
 agamemnon by the achaian chiefs hardly persuading him thereto for his
 heart was wroth for his comrade and when they were come to agamemnon's
 hut forthwith they bade clearvoiced heralds set a great tripod on the
 fire if haply they might persuade the son of peleus to wash from him
 the bloody gore but he denied them steadfastly and sware moreover an
 oath "nay verily by zeus who is highest and best of gods not lawful
 is it that water should come nigh my head or ever i shall have laid
 patroklos on the fire and heaped a barrow and shaved my hair since
 never again shall second grief thus reach my heart while i remain among
 the living yet now for the present let us yield us to our mournful
 meal but with the morning o king of men agamemnon rouse the folk to
 bring wood and furnish all that it beseemeth a dead man to have when he
 goeth beneath the misty gloom to the end that untiring fire may burn
 him quickly from sight and the host betake them to their work"

 thus spake he and they listened readily to him and obeyed and eagerly
 making ready each his meal they supped and no lack had their soul of
 equal feast but when they had put off from them the desire of meat and
 drink the rest went down each man to his tent to take his rest but the
 son of peleus upon the beach of the sounding sea lay groaning heavily
 amid the host of myrmidons in an open place where waves were breaking
 on the shore now when sleep took hold on him easing the cares of his
 heart deep sleep that fell about him for sore tired were his glorious
 knees with onset upon hector toward windy ilios then came there unto
 him the spirit of hapless patroklos in all things like his living self
 in stature and fair eyes and voice and the raiment of his body was
 the same and he stood above achilles' head and spake to him "thou
 sleepest and hast forgotten me o achilles not in my life wast thou
 ever unmindful of me but in my death bury me with all speed that i
 pass the gates of hades far off the spirits banish me the phantoms of
 men outworn nor suffer me to mingle with them beyond the river but
 vainly i wander along the widegated dwelling of hades now give me i
 pray pitifully of thee thy hand for never more again shall i come back
 from hades when ye have given me my due of fire never among the living
 shall we sit apart from our dear comrades and take counsel together but
 me hath the harsh fate swallowed up which was appointed me even from my
 birth yea and thou too thyself achilles peer of gods beneath the wall
 of the noble trojans art doomed to die yet one thing will i say and
 charge thee if haply thou wilt have regard thereto lay not my bones
 apart from thine achilles but together even as we were nurtured in
 your house when menoitios brought me yet a little one from opoeis to
 your country by reason of a grievous manslaying on the day when i slew
 amphidamas' son not willing it in childish wrath over the dice then
 took me the knight peleus into his house and reared me kindly and named
 me thy squire so therefore let one coffer hide our bones a golden
 coffer two handled thy lady mother's gift"

 then made answer unto him achilles fleet of foot "wherefore o my
 brother hast thou come hither and chargest me everything that i should
 do verily i will accomplish all and have regard unto thy bidding but
 stand more nigh me for one moment let us throw our arms around each
 other and take our fill of dolorous lament"

 he spake and reached forth with his hands but clasped him not for
 like a vapour the spirit was gone beneath the earth with a faint shriek
 and achilles sprang up marvelling and smote his hands together and
 spake a word of woe "ay me there remaineth then even in the house of
 hades a spirit and phantom of the dead albeit the life be not anywise
 therein for all night long hath the spirit of hapless patroklos stood
 over me wailing and making moan and charged me everything that i
 should do and wondrous like his living self it seemed"

 thus said he and stirred in all of them yearning to make lament and
 rosyfingered morn shone forth on them while they still made moan around
 the piteous corpse then lord agamemnon sped mules and men from all the
 huts to fetch wood and a man of valour watched thereover even
 meriones squire of kindly idomeneus and they went forth with
 woodcutting axes in their hands and wellwoven ropes and before them
 went the mules and uphill and downhill and sideways and across they
 went but when they came to the spurs of manyfountained ida
 straightway they set them lustily to hew highfoliaged oaks with the
 longedged bronze and with loud noise fell the trees then splitting
 them asunder the achaians bound them behind the mules and they tore up
 the earth with their feet as they made for the plain through the thick
 underwood and all the woodcutters bare logs for thus bade meriones
 squire of kindly idomeneus and on the shore they threw them down in
 line where achilles purposed a mighty tomb for patroklos and for
 himself

 then when they had laid down all about great piles of wood they sate
 them down all together and abode then straightway achilles bade the
 warlike myrmidons gird on their arms and each yoke the horses to his
 chariot and they arose and put their armour on and mounted their
 chariots both fighting men and charioteers in front were the men in
 chariots and a cloud of footmen followed after numberless and in the
 midst his comrades bare patroklos and they heaped all the corpse with
 their hair that they cut off and threw thereon and behind did goodly
 achilles bear the head sorrowing for a noble comrade was he speeding
 forth unto the realm of hades

 and when they came to the place where achilles had bidden them they set
 down the dead and piled for him abundant wood then fleetfooted noble
 achilles bethought him of one thing more standing apart from the pyre
 he shore off a golden lock the lock whose growth he nursed to offer
 unto the river spercheios and sore troubled spake be looking forth
 over the winedark sea "spercheios in other wise vowed my father
 peleus unto thee that i returning thither to my native land should shear
 my hair for thee and offer a holy hecatomb and fifty rams should
 sacrifice there above thy springs where is the sacred close and altar
 burning spice so vowed the old man but thou hast not accomplished him
 his desire and now since i return not to my dear native land unto the
 hero patroklos i may give this hair to take away"

 thus saying he set the hair in the hands of his dear comrade and
 stirred in all of them yearning to make lament and so would the light
 of the sun have gone down on their lamentation had not achilles said
 quickly to agamemnon as he stood beside him "son of atreusfor to thy
 words most will the host of the achaians have regardof lamentation
 they may sate them to the full but now disperse them from the burning
 and bid them make ready their meal and we to whom the dead is dearest
 will take pains for these things yet let the chiefs tarry nigh unto
 us"

 then when agamemnon king of men heard that he forthwith dispersed the
 host among the trim ships but the nearest to the dead tarried there and
 piled the wood and made a pyre a hundred feet this way and that and on
 the pyre's top set the corpse with anguish at their hearts and many
 lusty sheep and shambling crookhorned oxen they flayed and made ready
 before the pyre and taking from all of them the fat great hearted
 achilles wrapped the corpse therein from head to foot and heaped the
 flayed bodies round and he set therein twohandled jars of honey and
 oil leaning them against the bier and four strongnecked horses he
 threw swiftly on the pyre and groaned aloud nine housedogs had the
 dead chief of them did achilles slay twain and throw them on the pyre
 and twelve valiant sons of greathearted trojans he slew with the
 swordfor he devised mischief in his heart and he set to the merciless
 might of the fire to feed thereon then moaned he aloud and called on
 his dear comrade by his name "all hail to thee o patroklos even in
 the house of hades for all that i promised thee before am i now
 accomplishing twelve valiant sons of greathearted trojans behold
 these all in company with thee the fire devoureth but hector son of
 priam will i nowise give to the fire to feed upon but to dogs"

 thus spake he threatening but no dogs might deal with hector for day
 and night aphrodite daughter of zeus kept off the dogs and anointed him
 with rosesweet oil ambrosial that achilles might not tear him when he
 dragged him and over him phoebus apollo brought a dark cloud from
 heaven to earth and covered all that place whereon the dead man lay
 lest meanwhile the sun's strength shrivel his flesh round about upon his
 sinews and limbs

 but the pyre of dead patroklos kindled not then fleetfooted noble
 achilles had a further thought standing aside from the pyre he prayed
 to the two winds of north and west and promised them fair offerings
 and pouring large libations from a golden cup besought them to come
 that the corpses might blaze up speedily in the fire and the wood make
 haste to be enkindled then iris when she heard his prayer went
 swiftly with the message to the winds they within the house of the
 gusty west wind were feasting all together at meat when iris sped
 thither and halted on the threshold of stone and when they saw her
 with their eyes they sprang up and called to her every one to sit by
 him but she refused to sit and spake her word "no seat for me i must
 go back to the streams of ocean to the ethiopians' land where they
 sacrifice hecatombs to the immortal gods that i too may feast at their
 rites but achilles is praying the north wind and the loud west to come
 and promising them fair offerings that ye may make the pyre be kindled
 whereon lieth patroklos for whom all the achaians are making moan"

 she having thus said departed and they arose with a mighty sound
 rolling the clouds before them and swiftly they came blowing over the
 sea and the wave rose beneath their shrill blast and they came to
 deepsoiled troy and fell upon the pile and loudly roared the mighty
 fire so all night drave they the flame of the pyre together blowing
 shrill and all night fleet achilles holding a twohandled cup drew
 wine from a golden bowl and poured it forth and drenched the earth
 calling upon the spirit of hapless patroklos as a father waileth when
 he burneth the bones of his son newmarried whose death is woe to his
 hapless parents so wailed achilles as he burnt the bones of his
 comrade going heavily round the burning pile with many moans

 but at the hour when the morning star goeth forth to herald light upon
 the earth the star that saffronmantled dawn cometh after and
 spreadeth over the salt sea then grew the burning faint and the flame
 died down and the winds went back again to betake them home over the
 thracian main and it roared with a violent swell then the son of
 peleus turned away from the burning and lay down wearied and sweet
 sleep leapt on him but they who were with atreus' son gathered all
 together and the noise and clash of their approach aroused him and he
 sate upright and spake a word to them "son of atreus and ye other
 chiefs of the achaians first quench with gleaming wine all the burning
 so far as the fire's strength hath reached and then let us gather up
 the bones of patroklos menoitios' son singling them well and easy are
 they to discern for he lay in the middle of the pyre while the rest
 apart at the edge burntconfusedly horses and men and his bones let us
 put within a golden urn and doublefolded fat until that i myself be
 hidden in hades but no huge barrow i bid you toil to raisea seemly
 one no more then afterward do ye achaians build it broad and high
 whosoever of you after i am gone may be left in the benched ships"

 thus spake he and they hearkened to the fleetfooted son of peleus
 first quenched they with gleaming wine the burning so far as the flame
 went and the ash had settled deep then with lamentation they gathered
 up the white bones of their gentle comrade into a golden urn and
 doublefolded fat and placed the urn in the hut and covered it with a
 linen veil and they marked the circle of the barrow and set the
 foundations thereof around the pyre and straightway heaped thereon a
 heap of earth then when they had heaped up the barrow they were for
 going back but achilles stayed the folk in that place and made them
 sit in wide assembly and from his ships he brought forth prizes
 caldrons and tripods and horses and mules and strong oxen and
 fairgirdled women and grey iron

 first for fleet chariotracers he ordained a noble prize a woman
 skilled in fair handiwork for the winner to lead home and an eared
 tripod that held twoandtwenty measures these for the first man and
 for the second he ordained a sixyearold mare unbroke with a mule foal
 in her womb and for the third he gave a goodly caldron yet untouched by
 fire holding four measures bright as when first made and for the
 fourth he ordained two talents of gold and for the fifth a twohandled
 urn untouched of fire then he stood up and spake a word among the
 argives "son of atreus and ye other wellgreaved achaians for the
 chariotracers these prizes lie awaiting them in the lists if in some
 other's honour we achaians were now holding our games it would be i who
 should win the first prize and bear it to my hut for ye know how far my
 pair of horses are first in excellence for they are immortal and
 poseidon gave them to my father peleus and he again to me but verily i
 will abide i and my wholehooved horses so glorious a charioteer have
 they lost and one so kind who on their manes full often poured smooth
 oil when he had washed them in clear water for him they stand and
 mourn and their manes are trailing on the ground and there stand they
 with sorrow at their hearts but ye others throughout the host get ye to
 your places whosoever of the achalans hath trust in his horses and
 firmjointed car"

 thus spake the son of peleus and the fleet chariotracers were
 gathered first of all arose up eumelos king of men admetos' son a
 skilful charioteer and next to him arose tydeus' son valiant diomedes
 and yoked his horses of the breed of tros which on a time he seized
 from aineias when apollo saved their lord and after him arose atreus'
 son fairhaired heavensprung menelaos and yoked him a swift pair
 aithe agamemnon's mare and his own horse podargos her unto agamemnon
 did anchises' son echepolos give in fee that he might escape from
 following him to windy ilios and take his pleasure at home for great
 wealth had zeus given him and he dwelt in sikyon of spacious lawns
 so menelaos yoked her and she longed exceedingly for the race and
 fourth antilochos made ready his fairmaned horses even the noble son
 of nestor highhearted king who was the son of neleus and fleet
 horses bred at pylos drew his car and his father standing by his side
 spake counselling him to his profit though himself was well advised
 "antilochos verily albeit thou art young zeus and poseidon have loved
 thee and taught thee all skill with horses wherefore to teach thee is
 no great need for thou well knowest how to wheel round the post yet
 are thy horses very slow in the race therefore methinks there will be
 sad work for thee for the horses of the others are fleeter yet the men
 know not more cunning than thou hast so come dear son store thy mind
 with all manner of cunning that the prize escape thee not by cunning
 is a woodman far better than by force by cunning doth a helmsman on the
 winedark deep steer his swift ship buffeted by winds by cunning hath
 charioteer the better of charioteer for whoso trusting in his horses
 and car alone wheeleth heedlessly and wide at either end his horses
 swerve on the course and he keepeth them not in hand but whoso is of
 crafty mind though he drive worse horses he ever keeping his eye upon
 the post turneth closely by it neither is unaware how far at first to
 force his horses by the oxhide reins but holdeth them safe in hand and
 watcheth the leader in the race now will i tell thee a certain sign
 and it shall not escape thee a fathom's height above the ground
 standeth a withered stump whether of oak or pine it decayeth not in
 the rain and two white stones on either side thereof are fixed at the
 joining of the track and all round it is smooth driving ground whether
 it be a monument of some man dead long ago or have been made their goal
 in the race by ancient men this now is the mark fixed by fleetfooted
 achilles wherefore do thou drive close and bear thy horses and chariot
 hard thereon and lean thy body on the wellknit car slightly to their
 left and call upon the offhorse with voice and lash and give him rein
 from thy hand but let the near horse hug the post so that the nave of
 the wellwrought wheel seem to graze ityet beware of touching the
 stone lest thou wound the horses and break the chariot so would that
 be triumph to the rest and reproach unto thyself but dear son be wise
 and on thy guard for if at the turningpost thou drive past the rest
 there is none shall overtake thee from behind or pass thee by not
 though he drave the goodly arion in pursuit the fleet horse of
 adrastos of divine descent or the horses of laomedon best of all bred
 in this land"

 thus spake neleian nestor and sate him down again in his place when he
 had told his son the sum of every matter

 and meriones was the fifth to make ready his sleekcoated steeds then
 went they up into their chariots and cast in the lots and achilles
 shook them and forth leapt the lot of antilochos nestor's son and the
 next lot had lord eumelos and next to him the son of atreus
 spearfamed menelaos and next to him drew meriones his place then
 lastly tydeides far the best of all drew his lot for his chariot's
 place then they stood side by side and achilles showed to them the
 turning post far off in the smooth plain and beside it he placed an
 umpire godlike phoinix his father's follower that he might note the
 running and tell the truth thereof

 then all together lifted the lash above their steeds and smote them
 with the reins and called on them eagerly with words and they
 forthwith sped swiftly over the plain leaving the ships behind and
 beneath their breasts stood the rising dust like a cloud or whirlwind
 and their manes waved on the blowing wind and the chariots ran
 sometimes on the bounteous earth and other whiles would bound into the
 air and the drivers stood in the cars and the heart of every man beat
 in desire of victory and they called every man to his horses that flew
 amid their dust across the plain

 but when the fleet horses were now running the last part of the course
 back toward the grey sea then was manifest the prowess of each and the
 horses strained in the race and presently to the front rushed the fleet
 mares of pheres' grandson and next to them diomedes' stallions of the
 breed of tros not far apart but hard anigh for they seemed ever as
 they would mount eumelos' car and with their breath his back was warm
 and his broad shoulders for they bent their heads upon him as they flew
 along thus would tydeus' son have either outstripped the other or made
 it a dead heat had not phoebus apollo been wroth with him and smitten
 from his hand the shining lash then from his eyes ran tears of anger
 for that he saw the mares still at speed even swiftlier than before
 while his own horses were thrown out as running without spur but
 athene was not unaware of apollo's guile against tydeides and presently
 sped after the shepherd of hosts and gave him back the lash and put
 spirit into his steeds then in wrath after the son of admetos was the
 goddess gone and brake his steeds' yoke and the mares ran sideways off
 the course and the pole was twisted to the ground and eumelos was
 hurled out of the car beside the wheel and his elbows and mouth and
 nose were flayed and his forehead bruised above his eyebrows and his
 eyes filled with tears and his lusty voice was choked then tydeides
 held his wholehooved horses on one side darting far out before the
 rest for athene put spirit into his steeds and shed glory on himself
 now next after him came goldenhaired menelaos atreus' son but
 antilochos called to his father's horses "go ye too in strain to your
 fleetest pace truly i nowise bid you strive with those the horses of
 wise tydeides unto which athene hath now given speed and shed glory on
 their charioteer but overtake atreides' horses with all haste and be
 not outstripped by them lest aithe that is but a mare pour scorn on
 you why are ye outstripped brave steeds thus will i tell you and
 verily it shall be brought to passye will find no tendance with nestor
 shepherd of hosts but straightway he will slay you with the edge of the
 sword if through heedlessness we win but the worse prize have after
 them at your utmost speed and i for my part will devise a plan to pass
 them in the strait part of the course and this shall fail me not"

 thus spake he and they fearing the voice of the prince ran swiftlier
 some little while and presently did the good warrior antilochos espy a
 strait place in a sunk part of the way there was a rift in the earth
 where torrent water gathered and brake part of the track away and
 hollowed all the place there drave menelaos shunning the encounter of
 the wheels but antilochos turned his wholehooved horses out of the
 track and followed him a little at one side and the son of atreus took
 alarm and shouted to antilochos "antilochos thou art driving
 recklesslyhold in thy horses the road is straitened soon thou mayest
 pass me in a wider place lest thou foul my chariot and undo us both"

 thus spake he but antilochos drave even fiercelier than before plying
 his lash as though he heard him not as far as is the range of a disk
 swung from the shoulder when a young man hurleth it making trial of his
 force even so far ran they on then the mares of atreus' son gave back
 for he ceased of himself to urge them on lest the wholehooved steeds
 should encounter on the track and overset the wellknit cars and the
 drivers fall in the dust in their zeal for victory so upbraiding
 antilochos spake goldenhaired menelaos "antilochos no mortal man is
 more malicious than thou go thy mad way since falsely have we achaians
 called thee wise yet even so thou shalt not bear off the prize
 unchallenged to an oath"

 thus saying he called aloud to his horses "hold ye not back nor stand
 still with sorrow at heart their feet and knees will grow weary before
 yours for they both lack youth"

 thus spake he and they fearing the voice of the prince sped faster on
 and were quickly close upon the others

 now the argives sitting in concourse were gazing at the horses and they
 came flying amid their dust over the plain and the first aware of them
 was idomeneus chief of the cretans for he was sitting outside the
 concourse in the highest place of view and when he heard the voice of
 one that shouted though afar off he knew it and he was aware of a
 horse showing plainly in the front a chestnut all the rest of him but
 in the forehead marked with a white star round like the moon and he
 stood upright and spoke among the argives "friends chiefs and
 counsellors of the argives is it i alone who see the horses or do ye
 also a new pair seem to me now to be in front and a new charioteer
 appeareth the mares which led in the outward course must have been
 thrown out there in the plain for i saw them turning first the hither
 post but now can see them nowhere though my eyes are gazing everywhere
 along the trojan plain did the reins escape the charioteer so that he
 could not drive aright round the post and failed in the turn there
 methinks must he have been cast forth and have broken his chariot and
 the mares must have left the course in the wildness of their heart but
 stand up ye too and look for myself i discern not certainly but the
 first man seemeth to me one of aitolian race and he ruleth among
 argives the son of horsetaming tydeus stalwart diomedes"

 then fleet aias oileus' son rebuked him in unseemly sort "idomeneus
 why art thou a braggart of old as yet far off the highstepping mares
 are coursing over the wide plain neither art thou so far the youngest
 among the argives nor do thy eyes look so far the keenliest from thy
 head yet continually braggest thou it beseemeth thee not to be a
 braggart for there are here better men and the mares leading are they
 that led before eumelos' mares and he standeth and holdeth the reins
 within the car"

 then wrathfully in answer spake the chief of cretans "aias master of
 railing illcounselled in all else art thou behind other argives for
 thy mind is unfriendly come then let us wager a tripod or caldron and
 make agamemnon atreus' son our umpire which mares are leading that
 thou mayest pay and learn"

 thus said he and straightway fleet aias oileus' son arose angrily to
 answer with harsh words and strife between the twain would have gone
 further had not achilles himself stood up and spake a word "no longer
 answer each other with harsh words aias and idomeneus ill words for
 it beseemeth not surely ye are displeased with any other who should do
 thus sit ye in the concourse and keep your eyes upon the horses soon
 they in zeal for victory will come hither and then shall ye know each
 of you the argives' horses which follow and which lead"

 he said and the son of tydeus came driving up and with his lash smote
 now and again from the shoulder and his horses were stepping high as
 they sped swiftly on their way and sprinklings of dust smote ever the
 charioteer and his chariot overlaid with gold and tin ran behind his
 fleetfooted steeds and small trace was there of the wheeltires behind
 in the fine dust as they flew speeding on then he drew up in the mid
 concourse and much sweat poured from the horses' heads and chests to
 the ground and diomedes leapt to earth from the shining car and leant
 his lash against the yoke then stalwart sthenelos tarried not but
 promptly took the prize and gave to his proud comrades the woman to
 lead and the eared tripod to bear away and he loosed the horses from
 the yoke

 and next after him drave neleian antilochos his horses by craft not
 swiftness having passed by menelaos yet even now menelaos held his
 swift steeds hard anigh as far as a horse is from the wheel which
 draweth his master straining with the car over the plainhis hindmost
 tailhairs touch the tire for the wheel runneth hard anigh nor is much
 space between as he speedeth far over the plainby so much was
 menelaos behind highborn antilochos howbeit at first he was a whole
 diskcast behind but quickly he was catching antilochos up for the
 high mettle of agamemnon's mare sleekcoated aithe was rising in her
 and if yet further both had had to run he would have passed his rival
 nor left it even a dead heat but meriones stout squire of idomeneus
 came in a spearthrow behind famous menelaos for tardiest of all were
 his sleekcoated horses and slowest he himself to drive a chariot in
 the race last of them all came admetos' son dragging his goodly car
 driving his steeds in front him when fleetfooted noble achilles beheld
 he pitied him and he stood up and spake winged words among the argives
 "last driveth his wholehooved horses the best man of them all but come
 let us give him a prize as is seemly prize for the second place but
 the first let the son of tydeus take"

 thus spake he and all applauded that he bade and he would have given
 him the mare for the achaians applauded had not antilochos son of
 greathearted nestor risen up and answered peleian achilles on behalf
 of his right "o achilles i shall be sore angered with thee if thou
 accomplish this word for thou art minded to take away my prize because
 thou thinkest of how his chariot and fleet steeds miscarried and
 himself withal good man though he be nay it behoved him to pray to
 the immortals then would he not have come in last of all in the race
 but if thou pitiest him and he be dear to thy heart there is much gold
 in thy hut bronze is there and sheep handmaids are there and
 wholehooved horses thereof take thou and give unto him afterward even
 a richer prize or even now at once that the achaians may applaud thee
 but the mare i will not yield for her let what man will essay the
 battle at my hands"

 thus spake he and fleetfooted noble achilles smiled pleased with
 antilochos for he was his dear comrade and spake in answer to him
 winged words "antilochos if thou wouldst have me give eumelos some
 other thing beside from out my house that also will i do i will give
 unto him a breastplate that i took from asteropaios of bronze whereon
 a casting of bright tin is overlaid and of great worth will it be to
 him" he said and bade his dear comrade automedon bring it from the
 hut and he went and brought it then he placed it in eumelos' hands
 and he received it gladly

 but menelaos also arose among them sore at heart angered exceedingly
 against antilochos and the herald set the staff in his hand and called
 for silence among the argives then spake among them that godlike man
 "antilochos who once wert wise what thing is this thou hast done thou
 hast shamed my skill and made my horses fail thrusting thine own in
 front that are far worse come now ye chiefs and counsellors of the
 argives give judgment between us both and favour neither lest some
 one of the mailclad achalans say at any time 'by constraining
 antilochos through false words hath menelaos gone off with the mare for
 his horses were far worse howbeit he hath advantage in rank and power'
 nay i myself will bring the issue about and i deem that none other of
 the danaans shall reproach me for the trial shall be just antilochos
 fosterling of zeus come thou hither and as it is ordained stand up
 before thy horses and chariot and take in thy hand the pliant lash
 wherewith thou dravest erst and touching thy horses swear by the
 enfolder and shaker of the earth that not wilfully didst thou hinder
 my chariot by guile"

 then answered him wise antilochos "bear with me now for far younger am
 i than thou king menelaos and thou art before me and my better thou
 knowest how a young man's transgressions come about for his mind is
 hastier and his counsel shallow so let thy heart suffer me and i will
 of myself give to thee the mare i have taken yea if thou shouldst ask
 some other greater thing from my house i were fain to give it thee
 straightway rather than fall for ever from my place in thy heart o
 fosterling of zeus and become a sinner against the gods"

 thus spake greathearted nestor's son and brought the mare and put her
 in the hand of menelaos and his heart was gladdened as when the dew
 cometh upon the ears of ripening harvestcorn what time the fields are
 bristling so gladdened was thy soul menelaos within thy heart and he
 spake unto antilochos and uttered winged words "antilochos now will i
 of myself put away mine anger against thee since no wise formerly wert
 thou flighty or lightminded howbeit now thy reason was overcome of
 youthfulness another time be loth to outwit better men not easily
 should another of the achaians have persuaded me but thou hast suffered
 and toiled greatly and thy brave father and brother for my sake
 therefore will i hearken to thy prayer and will even give unto thee the
 mare though she is mine that these also may know that my heart was
 never overweening or implacable"

 he said and gave the mare to noemon antilochos' comrade to lead away
 and then took the shining caldron and meriones took up the two talents
 of gold in the fourth place as he had come in so the fifth prize was
 left unclaimed a twohandled cup to nester gave achilles this
 bearing it to him through the concourse of argives and stood by him and
 said "lo now for thee too old man be this a treasure a memorial of
 patroklos' burying for no more shalt thou behold him among the argives
 now give i thee this prize unwon for not in boxing shalt thou strive
 neither wrestle nor enter on the javelin match nor race with thy feet
 for grim old age already weigheth on thee"

 thus saying he placed it in his hand and nestor received it gladly and
 spake unto him winged words "ay truly all this my son thou hast
 meetly said for no longer are my limbs friend firm nor my feet nor
 do my arms at all swing lightly from my shoulders either side would
 that my youth were such and my force so firm as when the epeians were
 burying lord amarynkes at buprasion and his sons held the king's
 funeral games then was no man found like me neither of the epeians nor
 of the pylians themselves or the greathearted aitolians in boxing i
 overcame klytomedes son of enops and in wrestling ankaios of pleuron
 who stood up against me and in the footrace i outran iphiklos a right
 good man and with the spear outthrew phyleus and polydoros only in the
 chariotrace the two sons of aktor beat me by crowding their horses in
 front of me jealous for victory because the chief prizes were left at
 home now they were twinsone ever held the reins the reins he ever
 held the other called on the horses with the lash thus was i once but
 now let younger men join in such feats i must bend to grievous age but
 then was i of mark among heroes but come hold funeral for thy comrade
 too with with games this gift do i accept with gladness and my heart
 rejoiceth that thou rememberest ever my friendship to theenor forget
 i theeand the honour wherewith it is meet that i be honoured among
 the achaians and may the gods for this grant thee due grace"

 thus spake he and peleides was gone down the full concourse of
 achaians when he had hearkened to all the thanks of neleus' son then
 he ordained prizes of the violent boxing match a sturdy mule he led
 forth and tethered amid the assembly a sixyear mule unbroken hardest
 of all to break and for the loser set a twohandled cup then he stood
 up and spake a word among the argives "son of atreus and ye other
 wellgreaved achaians for these rewards we summon two men of the best
 to lift up their hands to box amain he to whom apollo shall grant
 endurance to the end and all the achaians acknowledge it let him take
 the sturdy mule and return with her to his hut and the loser shall take
 with him the twohandledcup"

 thus spake he and forthwith arose a man great and valiant and skilled
 in boxing epeios son of panopeus and laid his hand on the sturdy mule
 and said aloud "let one come nigh to bear off the twohandled cup the
 mule i say none other of the achaians shall take for victory with his
 fists for i claim to be the best man here sufficeth it not that i fall
 short of you in battle not possible is it that in all arts a man be
 skilled thus proclaim i and it shall be accomplished i will utterly
 bruise mine adversary's flesh and break his bones so let his friends
 abide together here to bear him forth when vanquished by my hands"

 thus spake he and they all kept deep silence and alone arose against
 him euryalos a godlike man son of king mekisteus the son of talaos
 mekisteus who came on a time to thebes when oedipus had fallen to his
 burial and there he overcame all the sons of kadmos thus tydeides
 famous with the spear made ready euryalos for the fight cheering him
 with speech and greatly desired for him victory and first he cast
 about him a girdle and next gave him wellcut thongs of the hide of an
 ox of the field and the two boxers being girt went into the midst of
 the ring and both lifting up their stalwart hands fell to and their
 hands joined battle grievously then was there terrible grinding of
 teeth and sweat flowed from all their limbs and noble epeios came on
 and as the other spied for an opening smote him on the cheek nor could
 he much more stand for his limbs failed straightway under him and as
 when beneath the north wind's ripple a fish leapeth on a tanglecovered
 beach and then the black wave hideth it so leapt up euryalos at that
 blow but greathearted epeios took him in his hands and set him
 upright and his dear comrades stood around him and led him through the
 ring with trailing feet spitting out clotted blood drooping his head
 awry and they set him down in his swoon among them and themselves went
 forth and fetched the twohandled cup

 then peleus' son ordained straightway the prizes for a third contest
 offering them to the danaans for the grievous wrestling match for the
 winner a great tripod for standing on the fire prized by the achaians
 among them at twelve oxens' worth and for the loser he brought a woman
 into the midst skilled in manifold work and they prized her at four
 oxen and he stood up and spake a word among the argives "rise ye who
 will essay this match"

 thus said he and there arose great aias son of telamon and odysseus of
 many wiles stood up the craftyminded and the twain being girt went
 into the midst of the ring and clasped each the other in his arms with
 stalwart hands like gable rafters of a lofty house which some famed
 craftsman joineth that he may baffle the wind's force and their backs
 creaked gripped firmly under the vigorous hands and sweat ran down in
 streams and frequent weals along their ribs and shoulders sprang up
 red with blood while ever they strove amain for victory to win the
 wrought tripod neither could odysseus trip aias and bear him to the
 ground nor aias him for odysseus' strength withheld him but when they
 began to irk the wellgreaved achaians then said to odysseus great
 aias telamon's son "heavensprung son of laertes odysseus of many
 wiles or lift thou me or i will thee and the issue shall be with
 zeus"

 having thus said he lifted him but odysseus was not unmindful of his
 craft he smote deftly from behind the hollow of aias' knee and loosed
 his limbs and threw him down backward and odysseus fell upon his
 chest and the folk gazed and marvelled then in his turn muchenduring
 noble odysseus tried to lift and moved him a little from the ground
 but lifted him not so he crooked his knee within the other's and both
 fell on the ground nigh to each other and were soiled with dust and
 now starting up again a third time would they have wrestled had not
 achilles himself arisen and held them back "no longer press each the
 other nor wear you out with pain victory is with both take equal
 prizes and depart that other achaians may contend"

 thus spake he and they were fain to hear and to obey and wiped the
 dust from them and put their doublets on

 then straightway the son of peleus set forth other prizes for fleetness
 of foot a mixingbowl of silver chased six measures it held and in
 beauty it was far the best in all the earth for artificers of sidon
 wrought it cunningly and men of the phoenicians brought it over the
 misty sea and landed it in harbour and gave it a gift to thoas and
 euneos son of jason gave it to the hero patroklos a ransom for lykaon
 priam's son now this cup did achilles set forth as a prize in honour of
 his friend for whoso should be fleetest in speed of foot for the
 second he set an ox great and very fat and for the last prize half a
 talent of gold and he stood up and spake a word among the argives
 "rise ye who will essay this match"

 thus spake he and straightway arose fleet aias oileus' son and
 odysseus of many wiles and after them nestor's son antilochos for he
 was best of all the youth in the footrace then they stood side by
 side and achilles showed to them the goal right eager was the running
 from the start but oileus' son forthwith shot to the front and close
 behind him came noble odysseus as close as is a weavingrod to a
 fairgirdled woman's breast when she pulleth it deftly with her hands
 drawing the spool along the warp and holdeth the rod nigh her breast
 so close ran odysseus behind aias and trod in his footsteps or ever the
 dust had settled there and on his head fell the breath of noble
 odysseus as he ran ever lightly on and all the achaians applauded his
 struggle for the victory and called on him as he laboured hard but when
 they were running the last part of the course forthwith odysseus prayed
 in his soul to brighteyed athene "hearken goddess come thou a good
 helper of my feet"

 thus prayed he and pallas athene hearkened to him and made his limbs
 feel light both feet and hands but when they were now nigh darting on
 the prize then aias slipped as he ran for athene marred his race
 where filth was strewn from the slaughter of loudbellowing oxen that
 fleet achilles slew in honour of patroklos and aias' mouth and nostrils
 were filled with that filth of oxen so muchenduring noble odysseus as
 he came in first took up the mixingbowl and famous aias took the ox
 and he stood holding in his hand the horn of the ox of the field
 sputtering away the filth and spake among the argives "out on it it
 was the goddess who marred my running she who from of old like a mother
 standeth by odysseus' side and helpeth him"

 so spake he but they all laughed pleasantly to behold him then
 antilochos smiling bore off the last prize and spake his word among the
 argives "friends ye will all bear me witness when i say that even
 herein also the immortals favour elder men for aias is a little older
 than i but odysseus of an earlier generation and earlier race of men a
 green old age is his they say and hard were it for any achaian to
 rival him in speed save only achilles"

 thus spake he and gave honour to the fleet son of peleus and achilles
 answered him and said "antilochos not unheeded shall thy praise be
 given a halftalent of gold i will give thee over and above" he said
 and set it in his hands and antilochos received it gladly

 then peleus' son brought and set in the ring a farshadowing spear and a
 chaldron that knew not the fire an ox's worth embossed with flowers
 and men that were casters of the javelin arose up there rose atreus'
 son wideruling agamemnon and meriones idomeneus' brave squire and
 swiftfooted noble achilles spake among them "son of atreus for that
 we know how far thou excellest all and how far the first thou art in
 the might of thy throw take thou this prize with thee to the hollow
 ships and to the hero meriones let us give the spear if thou art
 willing in thy heart thus i at least advise"

 thus spake he nor disregarded him agamemnon king of men so to meriones
 he gave the spear of bronze but to the herald talthybios the hero gave
 the goodliest prize



 book xxiv

 how the body of hector was ransomed and of his funeral

 then the assembly was broken up and the tribes were scattered to betake
 them each to their own swift ships the rest bethought them of supper
 and sweet sleep to have joy thereof but achilles wept remembering his
 dear comrade nor did sleep that conquereth all take hold on him but he
 kept turning him to this side and to that yearning for patroklos'
 manhood and excellent valour and all the toils he achieved with him and
 the woes he bare cleaving the battles of men and the grievous waves as
 he thought thereon be shed big tears now lying on his side now on his
 back now on his face and then anon he would arise upon his feet and
 roam wildly beside the beach of the salt sea nor would he be unaware of
 the dawn when she arose over the sea and shores but when he had yoked
 the swift steeds to his car he would bind hector behind his chariot to
 drag him withal and having thrice drawn him round the barrow of the
 dead son of menoitios he rested again in his hut and left hector lying
 stretched on his face in the dust but apollo kept away all defacement
 from his flesh for he had pity on him even in death and covered him
 all with his golden aegis that achilles might not tear him when he
 dragged him

 thus achilles in his anger entreated noble hector shamefully but the
 blessed gods when they beheld him pitied him and urged the
 clearsighted slayer of argus to steal the corpse away so to all the
 others seemed it good yet not to hera or poseidon or the brighteyed
 maiden but they continued as when at the beginning sacred ilios became
 hateful to them and priam and his people by reason of the sin of
 alexandros in that he contemned those goddesses when they came to his
 steading and preferred her who brought him deadly lustfulness but when
 the twelfth morn from that day arose then spake among the immortals
 phoebus apollo "hard of heart are ye o gods and cruel hath hector
 never burnt for you thighbones of unblemished bulls and goats now have
 ye not taken heart to rescue even his corpse for his wife to look upon
 and his mother and his child and his father priam and his people who
 speedily would burn him in the fire and make his funeral but fell
 achilles o gods ye are fain to abet whose mind is nowise just nor the
 purpose in his breast to be turned away but he is cruelly minded as a
 lion that in great strength and at the bidding of his proud heart goeth
 forth against men's flocks to make his meal even thus achilles hath
 cast out pity neither hath he shame that doth both harm and profit men
 greatly it must be that many a man lose even some dearer one than was
 this a brother of the same womb born or perchance a son yet bringeth
 he his wailing and lamentation to an end for an enduring soul have the
 fates given unto men but achilles after bereaving noble hector of his
 life bindeth him behind his horses and draggeth him around the tomb of
 his dear comrade not verily is that more honourable or better for
 him let him take heed lest we wax wroth with him good man though he
 be for in his fury he is entreating shamefully the senseless clay"

 then in anger spake unto him whitearmed hera "even thus mightest thou
 speak o lord of the silver bow if ye are to give equal honour to
 achilles and to hector hector is but a mortal and was suckled at a
 woman's breast but achilles is child of a goddess whom i myself bred up
 and reared and gave to a man to be his wife even to peleus who was
 dearest of all men to the immortals' heart and all ye gods came to her
 bridal and thou among them wert feasting with thy lyre o lover of ill
 company faithless ever"

 then to her in answer spake zeus who gathereth the clouds "hera be not
 wroth utterly with the gods for these men's honour is not to be the
 same yet hector also was dearest to the gods of all mortals that are in
 ilios so was he to me at least for nowise failed he in the gifts i
 loved never did my altar lack seemly feast drinkoffering and the
 steam of sacrifice even the honour that falleth to our due but verily
 we will say no more of stealing away brave hector for it cannot be
 hidden from achilles for his mother abideth ever nigh to him night and
 day but i were fain that some one of the gods would call thetis to come
 near to me that i may speak unto her a wise word so that achilles may
 take gifts from priam and give hector back" thus spake he and
 airyfooted iris sped forth upon the errand and between samothrace and
 rocky imbros leapt into the black sea and the waters closed above her
 with a noise and she sped to the bottom like a weight of lead that
 mounted on horn of a fieldox goeth down bearing death to ravenous
 fishes and she found thetis in a hollow cave about her sat gathered
 other goddesses of the seas and she in their midst was wailing for the
 fate of her noble son who must perish in deepsoiled troy far from his
 native land and standing near fleetfooted iris spake to her "rise
 thetis zeus of immortal counsels calleth thee"

 and to her made answer thetis the silverfooted goddess "wherefore
 biddeth me that mighty god i shrink from mingling among the immortals
 for i have countless woes at heart yet go i nor shall his word be in
 vain whatsoever he saith"

 thus having said the noble goddess took to her a darkhued robe no
 blacker raiment was there found than that then she went forth and
 windfooted swift iris led the way before her and around them the surge
 of the sea was sundered and when they had come forth upon the shore
 they sped up to heaven and found the farseeing son of kronos and
 round him sat gathered all the other blessed gods that are for ever
 then she sat down beside father zeus and athene gave her place and
 hera set a fair golden cup in her hand and cheered her with words and
 thetis drank and gave back the cup then began speech to them the
 father of gods and men "thou art come to olympus divine thetis in thy
 sorrow with violent grief at thy heart i know it of myself
 nevertheless will i tell thee wherefore i called thee hither nine days
 hath dispute arisen among the immortals concerning the corpse of hector
 and achilles waster of cities fain are they to send clearsighted
 hermes to steal the body away but now hear what glory i accord herein
 to achilles that i may keep through times to come thy honour and good
 will go with all speed to the host and bear to thy son my bidding say
 to him that the gods are displeased at him and that i above all
 immortals am wroth because with furious heart be holdeth hector at the
 beaked ships and hath not given him back if haply he may fear me and
 give hector back but i will send iris to greathearted priam to bid him
 go to the ships of the achaians to ransom his dear son and carry gifts
 to achilles that may gladden his heart"

 thus spake he and thetis the silverfooted goddess was not disobedient
 to his word and sped darting upon her way down from the peaks of
 olympus and she came to her son's hut there found she him making
 grievous moan and his dear comrades round were swiftly making ready and
 furnishing their early meal and a sheep great and fleecy was being
 sacrificed in the hut then his ladymother sate her down close beside
 him and stroked him with her hand and spake to him by his name "my
 child how long with lamentation and woe wilt thou devour thine heart
 taking thought of neither food nor rest good were even a woman's
 embrace for not long shalt thou be left alive to me already death and
 forceful fate are standing nigh thee but hearken forthwith unto me for
 i am the messenger of zeus to thee he saith that the gods are
 displeased at thee and that himself above all immortals is wroth
 because with furious heart thou holdest hector at the beaked ships and
 hast not given him back but come restore him and take ransom for the
 dead"

 then to her in answer spake fleetfooted achilles "so be it whoso
 bringeth ransom let him take back the dead if verily with heart's
 intent the olympian biddeth it himself"

 so they in the assembly of the ships mother and son spake to each
 other many winged words but the son of kronos thus bade iris go to holy
 ilios "go forth fleet iris leave the abode of olympus and bear my
 message within ilios to greathearted priam that he go to the ships of
 the achaians and ransom his dear son and carry gifts to achilles that
 may gladden his heart let him go alone and no other man of the trojans
 go with him only let some elder herald attend on him to guide the mules
 and smoothwheeled waggon and carry back to the city the dead man whom
 noble achilles slew let not death be in his thought nor any fear such
 guide will we give unto him even the slyer of argus who shall lead him
 until his leading bring him to achilles and when he shall have led him
 within the hut neither shall achilles himself slay him nor suffer any
 other herein for not senseless is he or unforeseeing or wicked but
 with all courtesy he will spare a suppliant man"

 thus spake he and airyfooted iris sped forth upon the errand and she
 came to the house of priam and found therein crying and moan his
 children sitting around their father within the court were bedewing
 their raiment with their tears and the old man in their midst was close
 wrapped all over in his cloak and on his head and neck was much mire
 that he had gathered in his hands as he grovelled upon the earth and
 his daughters and his sons' wives were wailing throughout the house
 bethinking them of all those valiant men who had lost their lives at the
 hands of the argives and were lying low and the messenger of zeus stood
 beside priam and spake softly unto him and trembling came upon his
 limbs "be of good cheer in thy heart o priam son of dardanos and be
 not dismayed for anything for no evil come i hither to forebode to
 thee but with good will i am the messenger of zeus to thee who
 though he be afar off hath great care and pity for thee the olympian
 biddeth thee ransom noble hector and carry gifts to achilles that may
 gladden his heart go thou alone let none other of the trojans go with
 thee only let some elder herald attend on thee to guide the mules and
 the smoothwheeled waggon to carry back to the city the dead man whom
 noble achilles slew let not death be in thy thought nor any fear such
 guide shall go with thee even the slayer of argus who shall lead thee
 until his leading bring thee to achilles and when he shall have led
 thee into the hut neither shall achilles himself slay thee nor suffer
 any other herein for not senseless is he or unforeseeing or wicked but
 with all courtesy he will spare a suppliant man"

 thus having spoken fleet iris departed from him and he bade his sons
 make ready the smoothwheeled mule waggon and bind the wicker carriage
 thereon and himself he went down to his fragrant chamber of cedar
 wood highroofed that held full many jewels and to hekabe his wife he
 called and spake "lady from zeus hath an olympian messenger come to
 me that i go to the ships of the achaians and ransom my dear son and
 carry gifts to achilles that may gladden his heart come tell me how
 seemeth it to thy mind for of myself at least my desire and heart bid
 me mightily to go thither to the ships and enter the wide camp of the
 achaians"

 thus spake he but his wife lamented aloud and made answer to him "woe
 is me whither is gone thy mind whereby aforetime thou wert famous among
 stranger men and among them thou rulest how art thou fain to go alone
 to the ships of the achaians to meet the eyes of the man who hath slain
 full many of thy brave sons of iron verily is thy heart for if he
 light on thee and behold thee with his eyes a savage and illtrusted
 man is this and he will not pity thee neither reverence thee at all
 nay now let us sit in the hall and make lament afar off even thus did
 forceful fate erst spin for hector with her thread at his beginning when
 i bare him even i that he should glut fleetfooted dogs far from his
 parents in the dwelling of a violent man whose inmost vitals i were
 fain to fasten and feed upon then would his deeds against my son be
 paid again to him for not playing the coward was he slain of him but
 championing the men and deepbosomed women of troy neither bethought he
 him of shelter or of flight"

 the to her in answer spake the old man godlike priam "stay me not for
 i am fain to go neither be thyself a bird of ill boding in my halls
 for thou wilt not change my mind were it some other and a child of
 earth that bade me this whether some seer or of the priests that divine
 from sacrifice then would we declare it false and have no part
 therein but now since i have heard the voice of the goddess myself and
 looked upon her face i will go forth and her word shall not be void
 and if it be my fate to die by the ships of the mailclad achaians so
 would i have it let achilles slay me with all speed when once i have
 taken in my arms my son and have satisfied my desire with moan"

 he spake and opened fair lids of chests wherefrom he chose twelve very
 goodly women's robes and twelve cloaks of single fold and of coverlets a
 like number and of fair sheets and of doublets thereupon and he
 weighed and brought forth talents of gold ten in all and two shining
 tripods and four caldrons and a goblet exceeding fair that men of
 thrace had given him when he went thither on an embassy a chattel of
 great price yet not that even did the old man grudge from his halls
 for he was exceeding fain at heart to ransom his dear son then he drave
 out all the trojans from the colonnade chiding them with words of
 rebuke "begone ye that dishonour and do me shame have ye no mourning
 of your own at home that ye come to vex me here think ye it a small
 thing that zeus kronos' son hath given me this sorrow to lose him that
 was the best man of my sons nay but ye too shall feel it for easier
 far shall ye be to the achaians to slay now he is dead but for me ere
 i behold with mine eyes the city sacked and wasted let me go down into
 the house of hades"

 he said and with his staff chased forth the men and they went forth
 before the old man in his haste then he called unto his sons chiding
 helenos and paris and noble agathon and pammon and antiphonos and
 polites of the loud warcry and deiphobos and hippothoos and proud
 dios nine were they whom the old man called and bade unto him "haste
 ye ill sons my shame would that ye all in hector's stead had been
 slain at the swift ships woe is me all unblest since i begat sons the
 best men in wide troyland but none of them is left for me to claim
 neither godlike mestor nor troilos with his chariot of war nor hector
 who was a god among men neither seemed he as the son of a mortal man
 but of a godall these hath ares slain and here are my shames all
 left to me falsetongued lightheeled the heroes of dance plunderers
 of your own people's sheep and kids will ye not make me ready a wain
 with all speed and lay all these thereon that we get us forward on our
 way"

 thus spake he and they fearing their father's voice brought forth the
 smoothrunning mule chariot fair and new and bound the body thereof on
 the frame and from its peg they took down the mule yoke a boxwood yoke
 with knob well fitted with guidingrings and they brought forth the
 yokeband of nine cubits with the yoke the yoke they set firmly on the
 polished pole on the rest at the end thereof and slipped the ring over
 the upright pin which with three turns of the band they lashed to the
 knob and then belayed it close round the pole and turned the tongue
 thereunder then they brought from the chamber and heaped on the
 polished wain the countless ransom of hector's head and yoked
 stronghooved harness mules which on a time the mysians gave to priam
 a splendid gift but to priam's car they yoked the horses that the old
 man kept for his use and reared at the polished crib

 thus in the high palace were priam and the herald letting yoke their
 cars with wise thoughts at their hearts when nigh came hekabe sore at
 heart with honeysweet wine in her right hand in a golden cup that they
 might make libation ere they went and she stood before the horses and
 spake a word to priam by name "lo now make libation to father zeus and
 pray that thou mayest come back home from among the enemy since thy
 heart speedeth thee forth to the ships though fain were i thou wentest
 not and next pray to kronion of the stormcloud the gods of ida that
 beholdeth all troyland beneath and ask of him a bird of omen even the
 swift messenger that is dearest of all birds to him and of mightiest
 strength to appear upon thy right that seeing the sign with thine own
 eyes thou mayest go in trust thereto unto the ships of the fleethorsed
 danaans but if farseeing zeus shall not grant unto thee his messenger
 i at least shall not bid thee on to go among the ships of the achaians
 how fain soever thou mayest be"

 then answered and spake unto her godlike priam "lady i will not
 disregard this hest of thine for good it is to lift up hands to zeus
 if haply he will have pity"

 thus spake the old man and bade a housedame that served him pour pure
 water on his hands and she came near to serve him with water in a ewer
 to wash withal and when he had washed his hands he took a goblet from
 his wife then he stood in the midst of the court and prayed and poured
 forth wine as he looked up to heaven and spake a word aloud "father
 zeus that bearest sway from ida most glorious and most great grant
 that i find welcome and pity under achilles' roof and send a bird of
 omen even the swift messenger that is dearest of all birds to thee and
 of mightiest strength to appear upon the right that seeing this sign
 with mine eyes i may go trusting therein unto the ships of the
 fleethorsed danaans"

 thus spake he praying and zeus of wise counsels hearkened unto him and
 straightway sent forth an eagle surest omen of winged birds the dusky
 hunter called of men the black eagle wide as the door well locking
 fitted close of some rich man's highroofed hall so wide were his
 wings either way and he appeared to them speeding on the right hand
 above the city and when they saw the eagle they rejoiced and all their
 hearts were glad within their breasts

 then the old man made haste to go up into his car and drave forth from
 the doorway and the echoing portico in front the mules drew the
 fourwheeled wain and wise idaios drave them behind came the horses
 which the old man urged with the lash at speed along the city and his
 friends all followed lamenting loud as though he were faring to his
 death and when they were come down from the city and were now on the
 plain then went back again to ilios his sons and marriage kin but the
 two coming forth upon the plain were not unbeheld of farseeing zeus
 but he looked upon the old man and had compassion on him and
 straightway spake unto hermes his dear son "hermes since unto thee
 especially is it dear to companion men and thou hearest whomsoever thou
 wilt go forth and so guide priam to the hollow ships of the achaians
 that no man behold or be aware of him among all the danaans' host
 until he come to the son of peleus"

 thus spake he and the messenger the slayer of argus was not
 disobedient unto his word straightway beneath his feet he bound on his
 fair sandals golden divine that bare him over wet sea and over the
 boundless land with the breathings of the wind and he took up his wand
 wherewith he entranceth the eyes of such men as he will and others he
 likewise waketh out of sleep this did the strong slayer of argus take
 in his hand and flew and quickly came he to troyland and the
 hellespont and went on his way in semblance as a young man that is
 a prince with the new down on his chin as when the youth of men is
 the comeliest

 now the others when they had driven beyond the great barrow of ilios
 halted the mules and horses at the river to drink for darkness was come
 down over the earth then the herald beheld hermes from hard by and
 marked him and spake and said to priam "consider son of dardanos
 this is matter of prudent thought i see a man methinks we shall full
 soon be rent in pieces come let us flee in our chariot or else at
 least touch his knees and entreat him that he have mercy on us"

 thus spake he and the old man was confounded and he was dismayed
 exceedingly and the hair on his pliant limbs stood up and he stood
 still amazed but the helper came nigh of himself and took the old man's
 hand and spake and questioned him "whither father dost thou thus
 guide these horses and mules through the divine night when other
 mortals are asleep hadst thou no fear of the fiercebreathing achaians
 thy bitter foes that are hard anigh thee if one of them should espy
 thee carrying such treasures through the swift black night what then
 would be thy thought neither art thou young thyself and thy companion
 here is old that ye should make defence against a man that should
 assail thee first but i will no wise harm thee yea i will keep any
 other from thy hurt for the similitude of my dear father i see in
 thee"

 and to him in answer spake the old man godlike priam "even so kind
 son are all these things as thou sayest nevertheless hath some god
 stretched forth his hand even over me in that he hath sent a wayfarer
 such as thou to meet me a bearer of good luck by the nobleness of thy
 form and semblance and thou art wise of heart and of blessed parents
 art thou sprung"

 and to him again spake the messenger the slayer of argus "all this
 old sire hast thou verily spoken aright but come say this and tell me
 truly whether thou art taking forth a great and goodly treasure unto
 alien men where it may abide for thee in safety or whether by this ye
 are all forsaking holy ilios in fear so far the best man among you hath
 perished even thy son for of battle with the achaians abated he never
 a jot"

 and to him in answer spake the old man godlike priam "who art thou
 noble sir and of whom art born for meetly hast thou spoken of the fate
 of my hapless son"

 and to him again spake the messenger the slayer of argus "thou art
 proving me old sire in asking me of noble hector him have i full oft
 seen with mine eyes in glorious battle and when at the ships he was
 slaying the argives he drave thither piercing them with the keen
 bronze and we stood still and marvelled thereat for achilles suffered
 us not to fight being wroth against atreus' son his squire am i and
 came in the same wellwrought ship from the myrmidons i come and my
 father is polyktor wealthy is he and an old man even as thou and six
 other sons hath he and i am his seventh with the others i cast lots
 and it fell to me to fare hither with the host and now am i come from
 the ships to the plain for at daybreak the glancingeyed achaians will
 set the battle in array around the town for it chafeth them to be
 sitting here nor can the achaian lords hold in their fury for the
 fray"

 and the old man godlike priam answered him saying "if verily thou
 art a squire of achilles peleus' son come tell me all the truth
 whether still my son is by the ships or whether ere now achilles hath
 riven him limb from limb and cast him to the dogs"

 then to him again spake the messenger the slayer of argus "old sire
 not yet have dogs or birds devoured him but there lieth he still by
 achilles' ship even as he fell among the huts and the twelfth morn
 now hath risen upon him nor doth his flesh corrupt at all neither
 worms consume it such as devour men slain in war truly achilles
 draggeth him recklessly around the barrow of his dear comrade so oft as
 divine day dawneth yet marreth he him not thou wouldst marvel if thou
 couldst go see thyself how dewy fresh he lieth and is washed clean of
 blood nor anywhere defiled and all his wounds wherewith he was
 stricken are closed howbeit many of thy son though he be but a dead
 corpse for they held him dear at heart"

 thus spake he and the old man rejoiced and answered him saying "my
 son it is verily a good thing to give due offerings withal to the
 immortals for never did my childif that child indeed i hadforget
 in our halls the gods who inhabit olympus therefore have they
 remembered this for him albeit his portion is death but come now take
 from me this goodly goblet and guard me myself and guide me under
 heaven that i may come unto the hut of peleus' son"

 then spake unto him again the messenger the slayer of argus "thou art
 proving me old sire who am younger than thou but thou wilt not
 prevail upon me in that thou biddest me take gifts from thee without
 achilles' privity i were afraid and shamed at heart to defraud him
 lest some evil come to pass on me hereafter but as thy guide i would go
 even unto famous argos accompanying thee courteously in swift ship or
 on foot not from scorn of thy guide would any assail thee then"

 thus spake the helper and leaping on the chariot behind the horses he
 swiftly took lash and reins into his hand and breathed brave spirit
 into horses and mules but when they were come to the towers and trench
 of the ships there were the sentinels just busying them about their
 supper then the messenger the slayer of argus shed sleep upon them
 all and straightway opened the gates and thrust back the bars and
 brought within priam and the splendid gifts upon his wain and they came
 to the lofty hut of the son of peleus which the myrmidons made for
 their king and hewed therefor timber of the pine and thatched it with
 downy thatchingrush that they mowed in the meadows and around it made
 for him their lord a great court with closeset palisades and the door
 was barred by a single bolt of pine that three achaians wont to drive
 home and three drew back that mighty barthree of the rest but
 achilles by himself would drive it home then opened the helper hermes
 the door for the old man and brought in the splendid gifts for peleus'
 fleetfooted son and descended from the chariot to the earth and spake
 aloud "old sire i that have come to thee am an immortal god even
 hermes for my father sent me to companion thee on thy way but now
 will i depart from thee nor come within achilles' sight it were cause
 of wrath that an immortal god should thus show favour openly unto
 mortals but thou go in and clasp the knees of peleus' son and entreat
 him for his father's sake and his mother's of the lovely hair and for
 his child's sake that thou mayest move his soul"

 thus hermes spake and departed unto high olympus but priam leapt from
 the car to the earth and left idaios in his place he stayed to mind
 the horses and mules but the old man made straight for the house where
 achilles dear to zeus was wont to sit and therein he found the man
 himself and his comrades sate apart two only the hero automedon and
 alkimos of the stock of ares were busy in attendance and he was
 lately ceased from meat even from eating and drinking and still the
 table stood beside him but they were unaware of great priam as he came
 in and so stood he anigh and clasped in his hands the knees of
 achilles and kissed his hands terrible manslaying that slew many of
 priam's sons and as when a grievous curse cometh upon a man who in his
 own country hath slain another and escapeth to a land of strangers to
 the house of some rich man and wonder possesseth them that look on
 himso achilles wondered when he saw godlike priam and the rest
 wondered likewise and looked upon one another then priam spake and
 entreated him saying "bethink thee o achilles like to gods of thy
 father that is of like years with me on the grievous pathway of old
 age him haply are the dwellers round about entreating evilly nor is
 there any to ward from him ruin and bane nevertheless while he heareth
 of thee as yet alive he rejoiceth in his heart and hopeth withal day
 after day that he shall see his dear son returning from troyland but
 i i am utterly unblest since i begat sons the best men in wide
 troyland but declare unto thee that none of them is left fifty i had
 when the sons of the achaians came nineteen were born to me of one
 mother and concubines bare the rest within my halls now of the more
 part had impetuous ares unstrung the knees and he who was yet left and
 guarded city and men him slewest thou but now as he fought for his
 country even hector for his sake come i unto the ships of the achaians
 that i may win him back from thee and i bring with me untold ransom
 yea fear thou the gods achilles and have compassion on me even me
 bethinking thee of thy father lo i am yet more piteous than he and
 have braved what none other man on earth hath braved before to stretch
 forth my hand toward the face of the slayer of my sons"

 thus spake he and stirred within achilles desire to make lament for his
 father and he touched the old man's hand and gently moved him back and
 as they both bethought them of their dead so priam for manslaying
 hector wept sore as he was fallen before achilles' feet and achilles
 wept for his own father and now again for patroklos and their moan
 went up throughout the house but when noble achilles had satisfied him
 with lament and the desire thereof departed from his heart and limbs
 straightway he sprang from his seat and raised the old man by his hand
 pitying his hoary head and hoary beard and spake unto him winged words
 and said "ah hapless many ill things verily thou hast endured in thy
 heart how durst thou come alone to the ships of the achaians and to
 meet the eyes of the man who hath slain full many of the brave sons of
 iron verily is thy heart but come then set thee on a seat and we will
 let our sorrows lie quiet in our hearts for all our pain for no avail
 cometh of chill lament this is the lot the gods have spun for miserable
 men that they should live in pain yet themselves are sorrowless for
 two urns stand upon the floor of zeus filled with his evil gifts and
 one with blessings to whomsoever zeus whose joy is in the lightning
 dealeth a mingled lot that man chanceth now upon ill and now again on
 good but to whom he giveth but of the bad kind him he bringeth to
 scorn and evil famine chaseth him over the goodly earth and he is a
 wanderer honoured of neither gods nor men even thus to peleus gave the
 gods splendid gifts from his birth for he excelled all men in good
 fortune and wealth and was king of the myrmidons and mortal though he
 was the gods gave him a goddess to be his bride yet even on him god
 brought evil seeing that there arose to him no offspring of princely
 sons in his halls save that he begat one son to an untimely death
 neither may i tend him as he groweth old since very far from my country
 i am dwelling in troyland to vex thee and thy children and of thee
 old sire we have heard how of old time thou wert happy even how of all
 that lesbos seat of makar boundeth to the north thereof and phrygia
 farther up and the vast hellespontof all these folk men say thou
 wert the richest in wealth and in sons but after that the powers of
 heaven brought this bane on thee ever are battles and manslayings
 around thy city keep courage and lament not unabatingly in thy heart
 for nothing wilt thou avail by grieving for thy son neither shalt thou
 bring him back to life or ever some new evil come upon thee"

 then made answer unto him the old man godlike priam "bid me not to a
 seat o fosterling of zeus so long as hector lieth uncared for at the
 huts but straightway give him back that i may behold him with mine
 eyes and accept thou the great ransom that we bring so mayest thou
 have pleasure thereof and come unto thy native land since thou hast
 spared me from the first"

 then fleetfooted achilles looked sternly upon him and said "no longer
 chafe me old sire of myself am i minded to give hector back to thee
 for there came to me a messenger from zeus even my mother who bare me
 daughter of the ancient one of the sea and i know o priam in my mind
 nor am unaware that some god it is that hath guided thee to the swift
 ships of the achaians for no mortal man even though in prime of youth
 would dare to come among the host for neither could he escape the
 watch nor easily thrust back the bolt of our doors therefore now stir
 my heart no more amid my troubles lest i leave not even thee in peace
 old sire within my hut albeit thou art my suppliant and lest i
 transgress the commandment of zeus"

 thus spake he and the old man feared and obeyed his word and the son
 of peleus leapt like a lion through the door of the house not alone
 for with him went two squires the hero automedon and alkimos they whom
 above all his comrades achilles honoured save only patroklos that was
 dead they then loosed from under the yoke the horses and mules and led
 in the old man's crierherald and set him on a chair and from the wain
 of goodly felloes they took the countless ransom set on hector's head
 but they left two robes and a wellspun doublet that achilles might
 wrap the dead therein when he gave him to be carried home and he called
 forth handmaids and bade them wash and anoint him when they had borne
 him apart so that priam should not look upon his son lest he should
 not refrain the wrath at his sorrowing heart when he should look upon
 his son and lest achilles' heart be vexed thereat and he slay him and
 transgress the commandment of zeus so when the handmaids had washed the
 body and anointed it with oil and had thrown over it a fair robe and a
 doublet then achilles himself lifted it and laid it on a bier and his
 comrades with him lifted it on to the polished waggon then he groaned
 aloud and called on his dear comrade by his name "patroklos be not
 vexed with me if thou hear even in the house of hades that i have given
 back noble hector unto his dear father for not unworthy is the ransom
 he hath given me whereof i will deal to thee again thy rightful share"

 thus spake noble achilles and went back into the hut and sate him down
 on the cunninglywrought couch whence he had arisen by the opposite
 wall and spake a word to priam "thy son old sire is given back as
 thou wouldest and lieth on a bier and with the break of day thou shalt
 see him thyself as thou carriest him but now bethink we us of supper
 for even fairhaired niobe bethought her of meat she whose twelve
 children perished in her halls six daughters and six lusty sons the
 sons apollo in his anger against niobe slew with arrows from his
 silver bow and the daughters archer artemis for that niobe matched
 herself against faircheeked leto saying that the goddess bare but
 twain but herself many children so they though they were but twain
 destroyed the other all nine days they lay in their blood nor was
 there any to bury them for kronion turned the folk to stones yet on
 the tenth day the gods of heaven buried them and she then bethought her
 of meat when she was wearied out with weeping tears and somewhere now
 among the cliffs on the lonely mountains even on sipylos where they
 say are the couchingplaces of nymphs that dance around acheloos there
 she albeit a stone broodeth still over her troubles from the gods but
 come let us too noble father take thought of meat and afterward thou
 shalt mourn over thy dear son as thou carriest him to ilios and many
 tears shall be his due"

 thus spake fleet achilles and sprang up and slew a pure white sheep
 and his comrades skinned and made it ready in seemly fashion and
 divided it cunningly and pierced it with spits and roasted it carefully
 and drew all off and automedon took bread and served it on a table in
 fair baskets while achilles dealt out the flesh and they stretched
 forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them but when
 they had put off the desire of meat and drink then priam son of
 dardanos marvelled at achilles to see how great he was and how goodly
 for he was like a god to look upon and achilles marvelled at priam son
 of dardanos beholding his noble aspect and hearkening to his words but
 when they had gazed their fill upon one another then first spake the
 old man godlike priam to achilles "now presently give me whereon to
 lie fosterling of zeus that of sweet sleep also we may now take our
 fill at rest for never yet have mine eyes closed beneath their lids
 since at thy hands my son lost his life but i continually mourn and
 brood over countless griefs grovelling in the courtyardclose amid the
 mire now at last have i tasted bread and poured bright wine down my
 throat but till now i had tasted naught"

 he said and achilles bade his comrades and handmaids to set a bedstead
 beneath the portico and to cast thereon fair shining rugs and spread
 coverlets above and thereon to lay thick mantles to be a clothing over
 all and the maids went forth from the inner hail with torches in their
 hands and quickly spread two beds in haste then with bitter meaning
 in his reference to agamemnon said fleetfooted achilles unto priam
 "lie thou without dear sire lest there come hither one of the
 counsellors of the achaians such as ever take counsel with me by my
 side as custom is if any of such should behold thee through the swift
 black night forthwith he might haply tell it to agamemnon shepherd of
 the host and thus would there be delay in giving back the dead but
 come say this to me and tell it true how many days' space thou art fain
 to make funeral for noble hector so that for so long i may myself abide
 and may keep back the host"

 and the old man godlike priam answered him saying "if thou art
 verily willing that i accomplish noble hector's funeral by doing as
 thou sayest o achilles thou wilt do me grace for thou knowest how we
 are pent within the city and wood from the mountain is far to fetch
 and the trojans are much in fear nine days will we make moan for him in
 our halls and on the tenth we will hold funeral and the folk shall
 feast and on the eleventh we will make a barrow over him and on the
 twelfth we will do battle if need be"

 then again spake the fleet noble achilles unto him saying "all this o
 ancient priam shall be as thou biddest for i will hold back the battle
 even so long a time as thou tellest me"

 thus speaking he clasped the old man's right hand at the wrist lest he
 should be anywise afraid at heart so they in the forepart of the house
 laid them down priam and the herald with wise thoughts at their
 hearts but achilles slept in a recess of the firmwrought hut and
 beside him lay faircheeked briseis

 now all other gods and warriors lords of chariots slumbered all night
 by soft sleep overcome but not on the helper hermes did sleep take hold
 as he sought within his heart how he should guide forth king priam from
 the ships unespied of the trusty sentinels and he stood above his head
 and spake a word to him "old sire no thought then hast thou of any
 evil seeing thou yet sleepest among men that are thine enemies for
 that achilles spared thee truly now hast thou won back thy dear son
 and at great price but for thy life will thy sons thou hast left behind
 be offering threefold ransom if but agamemnon atreus' son be aware of
 thee and aware be all the achaians"

 thus spake he and the old man feared and roused the herald and hermes
 yoked the horses and mules for them and himself drave them lightly
 through the camp and none was aware of them

 but when they came to the ford of the fairflowing river even eddying
 xanthos begotten of immortal zeus then hermes departed up to high
 olympus and morning of the saffron robe spread over all the earth and
 they with wail and moan drave the horses to the city and the mules drew
 the dead nor marked them any man or fairgirdled woman until kassandra
 peer of golden aphrodite having gone up upon pergamos was aware of her
 dear father as he stood in the car and the herald that was crier to the
 town then beheld she him that lay upon the bier behind the mules and
 thereat she wailed and cried aloud throughout all the town "o men and
 women of troy come ye hither and look upon hector if ever while he was
 alive ye rejoiced when he came back from battle since great joy was he
 to the city and all the folk"

 thus spake she nor was man or woman left within the city for upon all
 came unendurable grief and near the gates they met priam bringing home
 the dead first bewailed him his dear wife and lady mother as they cast
 them on the fairwheeled wain and touched his head and around them
 stood the throng and wept so all day long unto the setting of the sun
 they had lamented hector in tears without the gate had not the old man
 spoken from the car among the folk "give me place for the mules to pass
 through hereafter ye shall have your fill of wailing when i have
 brought him unto his home"

 thus spake he and they parted asunder and gave place to the wain and
 the others when they had brought him to the famous house laid him on a
 fretted bed and set beside him minstrel leaders of the dirge who
 wailed a mournful lay while the women made moan with them and among
 the women whitearmed andromache led the lamentation while in her hands
 she held the head of hector slayer of men "husband thou art gone young
 from life and leavest me a widow in thy halls and the child is yet but
 a little one child of illfated parents thee and me nor methinks
 shall he grow up to manhood for ere then shall this city be utterly
 destroyed for thou art verily perished who didst watch over it who
 guardedst it and keptest safe its noble wives and infant little ones
 these soon shall be voyaging in the hollow ships yea and i too with
 them and thou my child shalt either go with me unto a place where
 thou shalt toil at unseemly tasks labouring before the face of some
 harsh lord or else some achaian will take thee by the arm and hurl thee
 from the battlement a grievous death for that he is wroth because
 hector slew his brother or father or son since full many of the
 achaians in hector's hands have bitten the firm earth for no light hand
 had thy father in the grievous fray therefore the folk lament him
 throughout the city and woe unspeakable and mourning hast thou left to
 thy parents hector but with me chiefliest shall grievous pain abide
 for neither didst thou stretch thy hands to me from a bed in thy death
 neither didst speak to me some memorable word that i might have thought
 on evermore as my tears fall night and day"

 thus spake she wailing and the women joined their moan and among them
 hekabe again led the loud lament "hector of all my children far
 dearest to my heart verily while thou wert alive dear wert thou to the
 gods and even in thy doom of death have they had care for thee for
 other sons of mine whom he took captive would fleet achilles sell beyond
 the unvintaged sea unto samos and imbros and smoking lemnos but when
 with keenedged bronze he had bereft thee of thy life he was fain to
 drag thee oft around the tomb of his comrade even patroklos whom thou
 slewest yet might he not raise him up thereby but now all dewy and
 fresh thou liest in our halls like one on whom apollo lord of the
 silver bow hath descended and slain him with his gentle darts"

 thus spake she wailing and stirred unending moan then thirdly helen
 led their sore lament "hector of all my brethren of troy far dearest
 to my heart truly my lord is godlike alexandros who brought me to
 troylandwould i had died ere then for this is now the twentieth year
 since i went thence and am gone from my own native land but never yet
 heard i evil or despiteful word from thee nay if any other haply
 upbraided me in the palacehalls whether brother or sister of thine or
 brother's fairrobed wife or thy motherbut thy father is ever kind to
 me as he were my ownthen wouldst thou soothe such with words and
 refrain them by the gentleness of thy spirit and by thy gentle words
 therefore bewail i thee with pain at heart and my hapless self with
 thee for no more is any left in wide troyland to be my friend and kind
 to me but all men shudder at me"

 thus spake she wailing and therewith the great multitude of the people
 groaned but the old man priam spake a word among the folk "bring wood
 men of troy unto the city and be not anywise afraid at heart of a
 crafty ambush of the achaians for this message achilles gave me when he
 sent me from the black ships that they should do us no hurt until the
 twelfth morn arise"

 thus spake he and they yoked oxen and mules to wains and quickly then
 they flocked before the city so nine days they gathered great store of
 wood but when the tenth morn rose with light for men then bare they
 forth brave hector weeping tears and on a lofty pyre they laid the
 dead man and thereon cast fire

 but when the daughter of dawn rosyfingered morning shone forth then
 gathered the folk around glorious hector's pyre first quenched they
 with bright wine all the burning so far as the fire's strength went
 and then his brethren and comrades gathered his white bones lamenting
 and big tears flowed down their cheeks and the bones they took and laid
 in a golden urn shrouding them in soft purple robes and straightway
 laid the urn in a hollow grave and piled thereon great closeset stones
 and heaped with speed a barrow while watchers were set everywhere
 around lest the wellgreaved achaians should make onset before the
 time and when they had heaped the barrow they went back and gathered
 them together and feasted right well in noble feast at the palace of
 priam zeusfostered king

 thus held they funeral for hector tamer of horses

 argument

 in a council of the gods minerva calls their attention to ulysses still
 a wanderer they resolve to grant him a safe return to ithaca minerva
 descends to encourage telemachus and in the form of mentes directs him
 in what manner to proceed throughout this book the extravagance and
 profligacy of the suitors are occasionally suggested


 muse make the man thy theme for shrewdness famed
 and genius versatile who far and wide
 a wand'rer after ilium overthrown
 discover'd various cities and the mind
 and manners learn'd of men in lands remote
 he num'rous woes on ocean toss'd endured
 anxious to save himself and to conduct
 his followers to their home yet all his care
 preserved them not they perish'd selfdestroy'd
 by their own fault infatuate who devoured 10
 the oxen of the allo'erseeing sun
 and punish'd for that crime return'd no more
 daughter divine of jove these things record
 as it may please thee even in our ears
 the rest all those who had perdition 'scaped
 by war or on the deep dwelt now at home
 him only of his country and his wife
 alike desirous in her hollow grots
 calypso goddess beautiful detained
 wooing him to her arms but when at length 20
 many a long year elapsed the year arrived
 of his return by the decree of heav'n
 to ithaca not even then had he
 although surrounded by his people reach'd
 the period of his suff'rings and his toils
 yet all the gods with pity moved beheld
 his woes save neptune he alone with wrath
 unceasing and implacable pursued
 godlike ulysses to his native shores
 but neptune now the �thiopians fought 30
 the �thiopians utmost of mankind
 these eastward situate those toward the west
 call'd to an hecatomb of bulls and lambs
 there sitting pleas'd he banqueted the gods
 in jove's abode meantime assembled all
 'midst whom the sire of heav'n and earth began
 for he recall'd to mind �gisthus slain
 by agamemnon's celebrated son
 orestes and retracing in his thought
 that dread event the immortals thus address'd 40
 alas how prone are humankind to blame
 the pow'rs of heav'n from us they say proceed
 the ills which they endure yet more than fate
 herself inflicts by their own crimes incur
 so now �gisthus by no force constrained
 of destiny atrides' wedded wife
 took to himself and him at his return
 slew not unwarn'd of his own dreadful end
 by us for we commanded hermes down
 the watchful argicide who bade him fear 50
 alike to slay the king or woo the queen
 for that atrides' son orestes soon
 as grown mature and eager to assume
 his sway imperial should avenge the deed
 so hermes spake but his advice moved not
 �gisthus on whose head the whole arrear
 of vengeance heap'd at last hath therefore fall'n
 whom answer'd then pallas c�ruleaneyed
 oh jove saturnian sire o'er all supreme
 and well he merited the death he found 60
 so perish all who shall like him offend
 but with a bosom anguishrent i view
 ulysses hapless chief who from his friends
 remote affliction hath long time endured
 in yonder woodland isle the central boss
 of ocean that retreat a goddess holds
 daughter of sapient atlas who the abyss
 knows to its bottom and the pillars high
 himself upbears which sep'rate earth from heav'n
 his daughter there the sorrowing chief detains 70
 and ever with smooth speech insidious seeks
 to wean his heart from ithaca meantime
 ulysses happy might he but behold
 the smoke ascending from his native land
 death covets canst thou not olympian jove
 at last relent hath not ulysses oft
 with victims slain amid achaia's fleet
 thee gratified while yet at troy he fought
 how hath he then so deep incensed thee jove
 to whom the cloudassembler god replied 80
 what word hath pass'd thy lips daughter belov'd
 can i forget ulysses him forget
 so noble who in wisdom all mankind
 excels and who hath sacrific'd so oft
 to us whose dwelling is the boundless heav'n
 earthcircling neptunehe it is whose wrath
 pursues him ceaseless for the cyclops' sake
 polypheme strongest of the giant race
 whom of his eye ulysses hath deprived

 impregnated in caverns of the deep

 so neptune shall his wrath remit whose pow'r

 to whom minerva goddess azureeyed
 oh jupiter above all kings enthroned
 if the immortals everblest ordain
 that wise ulysses to his home return

 myself will hence to ithaca meantime 110
 his son to animate and with new force
 inspire that the achaians all convened
 in council he may instant bid depart
 the suitors from his home who day by day
 his num'rous flocks and fatted herds consume
 and i will send him thence to sparta forth
 and into sandy pylus there to hear
 if hear he may some tidings of his sire
 and to procure himself a glorious name
 this said her golden sandals to her feet 120
 she bound ambrosial which o'er all the earth
 and o'er the moist flood waft her fleet as air
 then seizing her strong spear pointed with brass
 in length and bulk and weight a matchless beam
 with which the joveborn goddess levels ranks
 of heroes against whom her anger burns
 from the olympian summit down she flew
 and on the threshold of ulysses' hall
 in ithaca and within his vestibule
 apparent stood there grasping her bright spear 130
 mentes1 she seem'd the hospitable chief
 of taphos' isleshe found the haughty throng
 the suitors they before the palace gate
 with iv'ry cubes sported on num'rous hides
 reclined of oxen which themselves had slain
 the heralds and the busy menials there
 minister'd to them these their mantling cups
 with water slaked with bibulous sponges those
 made clean the tables set the banquet on
 and portioned out to each his plenteous share 140
 long ere the rest telemachus himself
 mark'd her for sad amid them all he sat
 pourtraying in deep thought contemplative
 his noble sire and questioning if yet
 perchance the hero might return to chase
 from all his palace that imperious herd
 to his own honour lord of his own home
 amid them musing thus sudden he saw
 the goddess and sprang forth for he abhorr'd
 to see a guest's admittance long delay'd 150
 approaching eager her right hand he seized
 the brazen spear took from her and in words
 with welcome wing'd minerva thus address'd
 stranger all hail to share our cordial love
 thou com'st the banquet finish'd thou shalt next
 inform me wherefore thou hast here arrived
 so saying toward the spacious hall he moved
 follow'd by pallas and arriving soon
 beneath the lofty roof placed her bright spear
 within a pillar's cavity long time 160
 the armoury where many a spear had stood
 bright weapons of his own illustrious sire
 then leading her toward a footstool'd throne
 magnificent which first he overspread
 with linen there he seated her apart
 from that rude throng and for himself disposed
 a throne of various colours at her side
 lest stunn'd with clamour of the lawless band
 the newarrived should loth perchance to eat
 and that more free he might the stranger's ear 170
 with questions of his absent sire address
 and now a maiden charg'd with golden ew'r
 and with an argent laver pouring first
 pure water on their hands supplied them next
 with a resplendent table which the chaste
 directress of the stores furnish'd with bread
 and dainties remnants of the last regale
 then in his turn the sewer2 with sav'ry meats
 dish after dish served them of various kinds
 and golden cups beside the chargers placed 180
 which the attendant herald fill'd with wine
 ere long in rush'd the suitors and the thrones
 and couches occupied on all whose hands
 the heralds pour'd pure water then the maids
 attended them with bread in baskets heap'd
 and eager they assail'd the ready feast
 at length when neither thirst nor hunger more
 they felt unsatisfied to new delights
 their thoughts they turn'd to song and sprightly dance
 enlivening sequel of the banquet's joys 190
 an herald then to phemius' hand consign'd
 his beauteous lyre he through constraint regaled
 the suitors with his song and while the chords
 he struck in prelude to his pleasant strains
 telemachus his head inclining nigh
 to pallas' ear lest others should his words
 witness the blueeyed goddess thus bespake
 my inmate and my friend far from my lips
 be ev'ry word that might displease thine ear
 the songthe harpwhat can they less than charm 200
 these wantons who the bread unpurchased eat
 of one whose bones on yonder continent
 lie mould'ring drench'd by all the show'rs of heaven
 or roll at random in the billowy deep
 ah could they see him once to his own isle
 restored both gold and raiment they would wish
 far less and nimbleness of foot instead
 but he alas hath by a wretched fate
 past question perish'd and what news soe'er
 we hear of his return kindles no hope 210
 in us convinced that he returns no more
 but answer undissembling tell me true
 who art thou whence where stands thy city where
 thy father's mansion in what kind of ship
 cam'st thou why steer'd the mariners their course
 to ithaca and of what land are they
 for that on foot thou found'st us not is sure
 this also tell me hast thou now arrived
 new to our isle or wast thou heretofore
 my father's guest since many to our house 220
 resorted in those happier days for he
 drew pow'rful to himself the hearts of all
 then pallas thus goddess c�ruleaneyed
 i will with all simplicity of truth
 thy questions satisfy behold in me
 mentes the offspring of a chief renown'd
 in war anchialus and i rule myself
 an island race the taphians oarexpert
 with ship and mariners i now arrive
 seeking a people of another tongue 230
 athwart the gloomy flood in quest of brass
 for which i barter steel ploughing the waves
 to temesa my ship beneath the woods
 of ne�us at yonder field that skirts
 your city in the haven rhethrus rides
 we are hereditary guests our sires
 were friends long since as when thou seest him next
 the hero old laertes will avouch
 of whom i learn that he frequents no more
 the city now but in sequester'd scenes 240
 dwells sorrowful and by an antient dame
 with food and drink supplied oft as he feels
 refreshment needful to him while he creeps
 between the rows of his luxuriant vines
 but i have come drawn hither by report
 which spake thy sire arrived though still it seems
 the adverse gods his homeward course retard
 for not yet breathless lies the noble chief
 but in some island of the boundless flood
 resides a prisoner by barbarous force 250
 of some rude race detained reluctant there
 and i will now foreshow thee what the gods
 teach me and what though neither augur skill'd
 nor prophet i yet trust shall come to pass
 he shall not henceforth live an exile long
 from his own shores no not although in bands
 of iron held but will ere long contrive
 his own return for in expedients framed
 with wond'rous ingenuity he abounds
 but tell me true art thou in stature such 260
 son of himself ulysses for thy face
 and eyes brightsparkling strongly indicate
 ulysses in thee frequent have we both
 conversed together thus thy sire and i
 ere yet he went to troy the mark to which
 so many princes of achaia steer'd
 him since i saw not nor ulysses me
 to whom telemachus discrete replied
 stranger i tell thee true my mother's voice
 affirms me his but since no mortal knows 270
 his derivation i affirm it not
 would i had been son of some happier sire
 ordain'd in calm possession of his own
 to reach the verge of life but now report
 proclaims me his whom i of all mankind
 unhappiest deemthy question is resolved
 then answer thus pallas blueeyed return'd
 from no ignoble race in future days
 the gods shall prove thee sprung whom so endow'd
 with ev'ry grace penelope hath borne 280
 but tell me true what festival is this
 this throngwhence are they wherefore hast thou need
 of such a multitude behold i here
 a banquet or a nuptial for these
 meet not by contribution3 to regale
 with such brutality and din they hold
 their riotous banquet a wise man and good
 arriving now among them at the sight
 of such enormities would much be wroth
 to whom replied telemachus discrete 290
 since stranger thou hast ask'd learn also this
 while yet ulysses with his people dwelt
 his presence warranted the hope that here
 virtue should dwell and opulence but heav'n
 hath cast for us at length a diff'rent lot
 and he is lost as never man before
 for i should less lament even his death
 had he among his friends at ilium fall'n
 or in the arms of his companions died
 troy's siege accomplish'd then his tomb the greeks 300
 of ev'ry tribe had built and for his son
 he had immortal glory atchieved but now
 by harpies torn inglorious beyond reach
 of eye or ear he lies and hath to me
 grief only and unceasing sighs bequeath'd
 nor mourn i for his sake alone the gods
 have plann'd for me still many a woe beside
 for all the rulers of the neighbour isles
 samos dulichium and the forestcrown'd
 zacynthus others also rulers here 310
 in craggy ithaca my mother seek
 in marriage and my household stores consume
 but neither she those nuptial rites abhorr'd
 refuses absolute nor yet consents
 to end them they my patrimony waste
 meantime and will not long spare even me
 to whom with deep commiseration pang'd
 pallas replied alas great need hast thou
 of thy long absent father to avenge
 these num'rous wrongs for could he now appear 320
 there at yon portal arm'd with helmet shield
 and grasping his two spears such as when first
 i saw him drinking joyous at our board
 from ilus son of mermeris who dwelt
 in distant ephyre just then return'd
 for thither also had ulysses gone
 in his swift bark seeking some pois'nous drug
 wherewith to taint his brazen arrows keen
 which drug through fear of the eternal gods
 ilus refused him and my father free 330
 gave to him for he loved him past belief
 could now ulysses clad in arms as then
 mix with these suitors short his date of life
 to each and bitter should his nuptials prove
 but these events whether he shall return
 to take just vengeance under his own roof
 or whether not lie all in the gods lap
 meantime i counsel thee thyself to think
 by what means likeliest thou shalt expel
 these from thy doors now mark me close attend 340
 tomorrow summoning the grecian chiefs
 to council speak to them and call the gods
 to witness that solemnity bid go
 the suitors hence each to his own abode
 thy motherif her purpose be resolved
 on marriage let her to the house return
 of her own potent father who himself
 shall furnish forth her matrimonial rites
 and ample dow'r such as it well becomes
 a darling daughter to receive bestow 350
 but hear me now thyself i thus advise
 the prime of all thy ships preparing mann'd
 with twenty rowers voyage hence to seek
 intelligence of thy longabsent sire
 some mortal may inform thee or a word4
 perchance by jove directed safest source
 of notice to mankind may reach thine ear
 first voyaging to pylus there enquire
 of noble nestor thence to sparta tend
 to question menelaus amberhair'd 360
 latest arrived of all the host of greece
 there should'st thou learn that still thy father lives
 and hope of his return although
 distress'd thou wilt be patient yet a year
 but should'st thou there hear tidings that he breathes
 no longer to thy native isle return'd
 first heap his tomb then with such pomp perform
 his funeral rites as his great name demands
 and make thy mother's spousals next thy care
 these duties satisfied delib'rate last 370
 whether thou shalt these troublers of thy house
 by stratagem or by assault destroy
 for thou art now no child nor longer may'st
 sport like one hast thou not the proud report
 heard how orestes hath renown acquired
 with all mankind his father's murtherer
 �gisthus slaying the deceiver base
 who slaughter'd agamemnon oh my friend
 for with delight thy vig'rous growth i view
 and just proportion be thou also bold 380
 and merit praise from ages yet to come
 but i will to my vessel now repair
 and to my mariners whom absent long
 i may perchance have troubled weigh thou well
 my counsel let not my advice be lost
 to whom telemachus discrete replied
 stranger thy words bespeak thee much my friend
 who as a father teaches his own son
 hast taught me and i never will forget
 but though in haste thy voyage to pursue 390
 yet stay that in the bath refreshing first
 thy limbs now weary thou may'st sprightlier seek
 thy gallant bark charged with some noble gift
 of finish'd workmanship which thou shalt keep
 as my memorial ever such a boon
 as men confer on guests whom much they love
 then pallas thus goddess c�ruleaneyed
 retard me not for go i must the gift
 which liberal thou desirest to bestow
 give me at my return that i may bear 400
 the treasure home and in exchange thyself
 expect some gift equivalent from me
 she spake and as with eaglewings upborne
 vanish'd incontinent but him inspired
 with daring fortitude and on his heart
 dearer remembrance of his sire impress'd
 than ever conscious of the wond'rous change
 amazed he stood and in his secret thought
 revolving all believed his guest a god
 the youthful hero to the suitors then 410
 repair'd they silent listen'd to the song
 of the illustrious bard he the return
 deplorable of the achaian host
 from ilium by command of pallas sang
 penelope icarius' daughter mark'd
 meantime the song celestial where she sat
 in the superior palace down she came
 by all the num'rous steps of her abode
 not sole for two fair handmaids follow'd her
 she then divinest of her sex arrived 420
 in presence of that lawless throng beneath
 the portal of her stately mansion stood
 between her maidens with her lucid veil
 her lovely features mantling there profuse
 she wept and thus the sacred bard bespake
 phemius for many a sorrowsoothing strain
 thou know'st beside such as exploits record
 of gods and men the poet's frequent theme
 give them of those a song and let themselves
 their wine drink noiseless but this mournful strain 430
 break off unfriendly to my bosom's peace
 and which of all hearts nearest touches mine
 with such regret my dearest lord i mourn
 rememb'ring still an husband praised from side
 to side and in the very heart of greece
 then answer thus telemachus return'd
 my mother wherefore should it give thee pain
 if the delightful bard that theme pursue
 to which he feels his mind impell'd the bard
 blame not but rather jove who as he wills 440
 materials for poetic art supplies
 no fault is his if the disastrous fate
 he sing of the achaians for the song
 wins ever from the hearers most applause
 that has been least in use of all who fought
 at troy ulysses hath not lost alone
 his day of glad return but many a chief
 hath perish'd also seek thou then again
 thy own apartment spindle ply and loom
 and task thy maidens management belongs 450
 to men of joys convivial and of men
 especially to me chief ruler here
 she heard astonish'd and the prudent speech
 reposing of her son deep in her heart
 again with her attendant maidens sought
 her upper chamber there arrived she wept
 her lost ulysses till minerva bathed
 her weary lids in dewy sleep profound
 then echoed through the palace darkbedimm'd
 with evening shades the suitors boist'rous roar 460
 for each the royal bed burn'd to partake
 whom thus telemachus discrete address'd
 all ye my mother's suitors though addict
 to contumacious wrangling fierce suspend
 your clamour for a course to me it seems
 more decent far when such a bard as this
 godlike for sweetness sings to hear his song
 tomorrow meet we in full council all
 that i may plainly warn you to depart
 from this our mansion seek ye where ye may 470
 your feasts consume your own alternate feed
 each at the other's cost but if it seem
 wisest in your account and best to eat
 voracious thus the patrimonial goods
 of one man rend'ring no account of all5
 bite to the roots but know that i will cry
 ceaseless to the eternal gods in hope
 that jove for retribution of the wrong
 shall doom you where ye have intruded there
 to bleed and of your blood ask no account5 480
 he ended and each gnaw'd his lip aghast
 at his undaunted hardiness of speech
 then thus antino�s spake eupithes' son
 telemachus the gods methinks themselves
 teach thee sublimity and to pronounce
 thy matter fearless ah forbid it jove
 that one so eloquent should with the weight
 of kingly cares in ithaca be charged
 a realm by claim hereditary thine
 then prudent thus telemachus replied 490
 although my speech antino�s may perchance
 provoke thee know that i am not averse
 from kingly cares if jove appoint me such
 seems it to thee a burthen to be fear'd
 by men above all others trust me no
 there is no ill in royalty the man
 so station'd waits not long ere he obtain
 riches and honour but i grant that kings
 of the achaians may no few be found
 in seagirt ithaca both young and old 500
 of whom since great ulysses is no more
 reign whoso may but king myself i am
 in my own house and over all my own
 domestics by ulysses gained for me
 to whom eurymachus replied the son
 of polybus what grecian chief shall reign
 in seagirt ithaca must be referr'd
 to the gods' will telemachus meantime
 thou hast unquestionable right to keep
 thy own and to command in thy own house 510
 may never that man on her shores arrive
 while an inhabitant shall yet be left
 in ithaca who shall by violence wrest
 thine from thee but permit me noble sir
 to ask thee of thy guest whence came the man
 what country claims him where are to be found
 his kindred and his patrimonial fields
 brings he glad tidings of thy sire's approach
 homeward or came he to receive a debt
 due to himself how swift he disappear'd 520
 nor opportunity to know him gave
 to those who wish'd it for his face and air
 him speak not of plebeian birth obscure
 whom answered thus telemachus discrete
 eurymachus my father comes no more
 i can no longer now tidings believe
 if such arrive nor he'd i more the song
 of soothsayers whom my mother may consult
 but this my guest hath known in other days
 my father and he came from taphos son 530
 of brave anchialus mentes by name
 and chief of the seapractis'd taphian race
 so spake telemachus but in his heart
 knew well his guest a goddess from the skies
 then they to dance and heartenlivening song
 turn'd joyous waiting the approach of eve
 and dusky evening found them joyous still
 then each to his own house retiring sought
 needful repose meantime telemachus
 to his own lofty chamber built in view 540
 of the wide hall retired but with a heart
 in various musings occupied intense
 sage euryclea bearing in each hand
 a torch preceded him her sire was ops
 pisenor's son and in her early prime
 at his own cost laertes made her his
 paying with twenty beeves her purchaseprice
 nor in less honour than his spotless wife
 he held her ever but his consort's wrath
 fearing at no time call'd her to his bed 550
 she bore the torches and with truer heart
 loved him than any of the female train
 for she had nurs'd him in his infant years
 he open'd his broad chambervalves and sat
 on his couchside then putting off his vest
 of softest texture placed it in the hands
 of the attendant dame discrete who first
 folding it with exactest care beside
 his bed suspended it and going forth
 drew by its silver ring the portal close 560
 and fasten'd it with bolt and brace secure
 there lay telemachus on finest wool
 reposed contemplating all night his course
 prescribed by pallas to the pylian shore

 book ii

 argument

 telemachus having convened an assembly of the greecians publicly calls
 on the suitors to relinquish the house of ulysses during the continuance
 of the council he has much to suffer from the petulance of the suitors
 from whom having informed them of his design to undertake a voyage in
 hope to obtain news of ulysses he asks a ship with all things necessary
 for the purpose he is refused but is afterwards furnished with what he
 wants by minerva in the form of mentor he embarks in the evening
 without the privity of his mother and the goddess sails with him


 aurora rosy daughter of the dawn
 now ting'd the east when habited again
 uprose ulysses' offspring from his bed
 athwart his back his faulchion keen he flung
 his sandals bound to his unsullied feet
 and godlike issued from his chamberdoor
 at once the clearvoic'd heralds he enjoin'd
 to call the greeks to council they aloud
 gave forth the summons and the throng began
 when all were gather'd and the assembly full 10
 himself his hand arm'd with a brazen spear
 went also nor alone he went his hounds
 fleetfooted follow'd him a faithful pair
 o'er all his form minerva largely shed
 majestic grace divine and as he went
 the whole admiring concourse gaz'd on him
 the seniors gave him place and down he sat
 on his paternal throne then grave arose
 the hero old �gyptius bow'd with age
 was he and by experience deepinform'd 20
 his son had with ulysses godlike chief
 on board his fleet to steedfam'd ilium gone
 the warrior antiphus whom in his cave
 the savage cyclops slew and on his flesh
 at ev'ning made obscene his last regale
 three sons he had beside a suitor one
 eurynomus the other two employ
 found constant managing their sire's concerns
 yet he forgat not father as he was
 of these his absent eldest whom he mourn'd 30
 ceaseless and thus his speech weeping began
 hear me ye men of ithaca my friends
 nor council here nor session hath been held
 since great ulysses left his native shore
 who now convenes us what especial need
 hath urged him whether of our youth he be
 or of our senators by age matured
 have tidings reach'd him of our host's return
 which here he would divulge or brings he aught
 of public import on a diff'rent theme 40
 i deem him whosoe'er he be a man
 worthy to prosper and may jove vouchsafe
 the full performance of his chief desire
 he ended and telemachus rejoiced
 in that good omen ardent to begin
 he sat not long but moving to the midst
 received the sceptre from pisenor's hand
 his prudent herald and addressing next
 the hoary chief �gyptius thus began
 not far remote as thou shalt soon thyself 50
 perceive oh venerable chief he stands
 who hath convened this council i am he
 i am in chief the suff'rer tidings none
 of the returning host i have received
 which here i would divulge nor bring i aught
 of public import on a different theme
 but my own trouble on my own house fall'n
 and twofold fall'n one is that i have lost
 a noble father who as fathers rule
 benign their children govern'd once yourselves 60
 the other and the more alarming ill
 with ruin threatens my whole house and all
 my patrimony with immediate waste
 suitors their children who in this our isle
 hold highest rank importunate besiege
 my mother though desirous not to wed
 and rather than resort to her own sire
 icarius who might give his daughter dow'r
 and portion her to whom he most approves
 a course which only named moves their disgust 70
 they chuse assembling all within my gates
 daily to make my beeves my sheep my goats
 their banquet and to drink without restraint
 my wine whence ruin threatens us and ours
 for i have no ulysses to relieve
 me and my family from this abuse
 ourselves are not sufficient we alas
 too feeble should be found and yet to learn
 how best to use the little force we own
 else had i pow'r i would myself redress 80
 the evil for it now surpasses far
 all suff'rance now they ravage uncontroul'd
 nor show of decency vouchsafe me more
 oh be ashamed6 yourselves blush at the thought
 of such reproach as ye shall sure incur
 from all our neighbour states and fear beside
 the wrath of the immortals lest they call
 yourselves one day to a severe account
 i pray you by olympian jove by her
 whose voice convenes all councils and again 90
 dissolves them themis that henceforth ye cease
 that ye permit me oh my friends to wear
 my days in solitary grief away
 unless ulysses my illustrious sire
 hath in his anger any greecian wrong'd
 whose wrongs ye purpose to avenge on me
 inciting these to plague me better far
 were my condition if yourselves consumed
 my substance and my revenue from you
 i might obtain perchance righteous amends 100
 hereafter you i might with vehement suit
 o'ercome from house to house pleading aloud
 for recompense till i at last prevail'd
 but now with darts of anguish ye transfix
 my inmost soul and i have no redress
 he spake impassion'd and to earth cast down
 his sceptre weeping pity at that sight
 seiz'd all the people mute the assembly sat
 long time none dared to greet telemachus
 with answer rough till of them all at last 110
 antino�s sole arising thus replied
 telemachus intemp'rate in harangue
 highsounding orator it is thy drift
 to make us all odious but the offence
 lies not with us the suitors she alone
 thy mother who in subtlety excels
 and deepwrought subterfuge deserves the blame
 it is already the third year and soon
 shall be the fourth since with delusive art
 practising on their minds she hath deceived 120
 the greecians message after message sent
 brings hope to each by turns and promise fair
 but she meantime far otherwise intends
 her other arts exhausted all she framed
 this stratagem a web of amplest size
 and subtlest woof beginning thus she spake
 princes my suitors since the noble chief
 ulysses is no more press not as yet
 my nuptials wait till i shall finish first
 a fun'ral robe lest all my threads decay 130
 which for the antient hero i prepare
 laertes looking for the mournful hour
 when fate shall snatch him to eternal rest
 else i the censure dread of all my sex
 should he so wealthy want at last a shroud
 so spake the queen and unsuspicious we
 with her request complied thenceforth all day
 she wove the ample web and by the aid
 of torches ravell'd it again at night
 three years by such contrivance she deceived 140
 the greecians but when three whole years elaps'd
 the fourth arriv'd then conscious of the fraud
 a damsel of her train told all the truth
 and her we found rav'ling the beauteous work
 thus through necessity she hath at length
 perform'd the task and in her own despight
 now therefore for the information clear
 of thee thyself and of the other greeks
 we answer send thy mother hence with charge
 that him she wed on whom her father's choice 150
 shall fall and whom she shall herself approve
 but if by long procrastination still
 she persevere wearing our patience out
 attentive only to display the gifts
 by pallas so profusely dealt to her
 works of surpassing skill ingenious thought
 and subtle shifts such as no beauteous greek
 for aught that we have heard in antient times
 e'er practised tyro or alcemena fair
 or fair mycene of whom none in art 160
 e'er match'd penelope although we yield
 to this her last invention little praise
 then know that these her suitors will consume
 so long thy patrimony and thy goods
 as she her present purpose shall indulge
 with which the gods inspire her great renown
 she to herself insures but equal woe
 and devastation of thy wealth to thee
 for neither to our proper works at home
 go we of that be sure nor yet elsewhere 170
 till him she wed to whom she most inclines
 him prudent then answer'd telemachus
 antino�s it is not possible
 that i should thrust her forth against her will
 who both produced and reared me be he dead
 or still alive my sire is far remote
 and should i voluntary hence dismiss
 my mother to icarius i must much
 refund which hardship were and loss to me
 so doing i should also wrath incur 180
 from my offended sire and from the gods
 still more for she departing would invoke
 erynnis to avenge her and reproach
 beside would follow me from all mankind
 that word i therefore never will pronounce
 no if ye judge your treatment at her hands
 injurious to you go ye forth yourselves
 forsake my mansion seek where else ye may
 your feasts consume your own alternate feed
 each at the other's cost but if it seem 190
 wisest in your account and best to eat
 voracious thus the patrimonial goods
 of one man rend'ring no account of all
 bite to the roots but know that i will cry
 ceaseless to the eternal gods in hope
 that jove in retribution of the wrong
 shall doom you where ye have intruded there
 to bleed and of your blood ask no account
 so spake telemachus and while he spake
 the thund'rer from a lofty mountaintop 200
 turn'd off two eagles on the winds awhile
 with outspread pinions ample side by side
 they floated but ere long hov'ring aloft
 right o'er the midst of the assembled chiefs
 they wheel'd around clang'd all their num'rous plumes
 and with a downward look eyeing the throng
 death boded ominous then rending each
 the other's face and neck they sprang at once
 toward the right and darted through the town
 amazement universal at that sight 210
 seized the assembly and with anxious thought
 each scann'd the future amidst whom arose
 the hero halitherses antient seer
 offspring of mastor for in judgment he
 of portents augural and in forecast
 unerring his coevals all excell'd
 and prudent thus the multitude bespake
 ye men of ithaca give ear hear all
 though chief my speech shall to the suitors look
 for on their heads devolved comes down the woe 220
 ulysses shall not from his friends henceforth
 live absent long but hasting to his home
 comes even now and as he comes designs
 a bloody death for these whose bitter woes
 no few shall share inhabitants with us
 of pleasant ithaca but let us frame
 effectual means maturely to suppress
 their violent deeds or rather let themselves
 repentant cease and soonest shall be best
 not inexpert but wellinform'd i speak 230
 the future and the accomplishment announce
 of all which when ulysses with the greeks
 embark'd for troy i to himself foretold
 i said that after many woes and loss
 of all his people in the twentieth year
 unknown to all he should regain his home
 and my prediction shall be now fulfill'd
 him then eurymachus thus answer'd rough
 the son of polybus hence to thy house
 thou hoary dotard there prophetic teach 240
 thy children to escape woes else to come
 birds num'rous flutter in the beams of day
 not all predictive death far hence remote
 hath found ulysses and i would to heav'n
 that where he died thyself had perish'd too
 thou hadst not then run o'er with prophecy
 as now nor provocation to the wrath
 giv'n of telemachus in hope to win
 perchance for thine some favour at his hands
 but i to _thee_ foretell skilled as thou art 250
 in legends old nor shall my threat be vain
 that if by artifice thou move to wrath
 a younger than thyself no matter whom
 woe first the heavier on himself shall fall
 nor shalt thou profit him by thy attempt
 and we will charge thee also with a mulct
 which thou shalt pay with difficulty and bear
 the burthen of it with an aching heart
 as for telemachus i him advise
 myself and press the measure on his choice 260
 earnestly that he send his mother hence
 to her own father's house who shall himself
 set forth her nuptial rites and shall endow
 his daughter sumptuously and as he ought
 for this expensive wooing as i judge
 till then shall never cease since we regard
 no mannonot telemachus although
 in words exub'rant neither fear we aught
 thy vain prognostics venerable sir
 but only hate thee for their sake the more 270
 waste will continue and disorder foul
 unremedied so long as she shall hold
 the suitors in suspense for day by day
 our emulation goads us to the strife
 nor shall we going hence seek to espouse
 each his own comfort suitable elsewhere
 to whom discrete telemachus replied
 eurymachus and ye the suitor train
 illustrious i have spoken ye shall hear
 no more this supplication urged by me 280
 the gods and all the greeks now know the truth
 but give me instantly a gallant bark
 with twenty rowers skill'd their course to win
 to whatsoever haven for i go
 to sandy pylus and shall hasten thence
 to lacedemon tidings to obtain
 of my longabsent sire or from the lips
 of man or by a word from jove vouchsafed
 himself best source of notice to mankind
 if there inform'd that still my father lives 290
 i hope conceive of his return although
 distress'd i shall be patient yet a year
 but should i learn haply that he survives
 no longer then returning i will raise
 at home his tomb will with such pomp perform
 his fun'ral rites as his great name demands
 and give my mother's hand to whom i may
 this said he sat and after him arose
 mentor illustrious ulysses' friend
 to whom embarking thence he had consign'd 300
 all his concerns that the old chief might rule
 his family and keep the whole secure
 arising thus the senior sage began
 hear me ye ithacans be never king
 henceforth benevolent gracious humane
 or righteous but let every sceptred hand
 rule merciless and deal in wrong alone
 since none of all his people whom he sway'd
 with such paternal gentleness and love
 remembers the divine ulysses more 310
 that the imperious suitors thus should weave
 the web of mischief and atrocious wrong
 i grudge not since at hazard of their heads
 they make ulysses' property a prey
 persuaded that the hero comes no more
 but much the people move me how ye sit
 all mute and though a multitude yourselves
 opposed to few risque not a single word
 to check the license of these bold intruders
 then thus liocritus evenor's son 320
 injurious mentor headlong orator
 how dar'st thou move the populace against
 the suitors trust me they should find it hard
 numerous as they are to cope with us
 a feast the prize or should the king himself
 of ithaca returning undertake
 t' expell the jovial suitors from his house
 much as penelope his absence mourns
 his presence should afford her little joy
 for fighting sole with many he should meet 330
 a dreadful death thou therefore speak'st amiss
 as for telemachus let mentor him
 and halytherses furnish forth the friends
 long valued of his sire with all dispatch
 though him i judge far likelier to remain
 longtime contented an enquirer here
 than to perform the voyage now proposed
 thus saying liocritus dissolved in haste
 the council and the scattered concourse sought
 their sev'ral homes while all the suitors flock'd 340
 thence to the palace of their absent king
 meantime telemachus from all resort
 retiring in the surf of the gray deep
 first laved his hands then thus to pallas pray'd
 o goddess who wast yesterday a guest
 beneath my roof and didst enjoin me then
 a voyage o'er the sable deep in quest
 of tidings of my long regretted sire
 which voyage all in ithaca but most
 the haughty suitors obstinate impede 350
 now hear my suit and gracious interpose
 such pray'r he made then pallas in the form
 and with the voice of mentor drawing nigh
 in accents wing'd him kindly thus bespake
 telemachus thou shalt hereafter prove
 nor base nor poor in talents if in truth
 thou have received from heav'n thy father's force
 instill'd into thee and resemblest him
 in promptness both of action and of speech
 thy voyage shall not useless be or vain 360
 but if penelope produced thee not
 his son i then hope not for good effect
 of this design which ardent thou pursuest
 few sons their fathers equal most appear
 degenerate but we find though rare sometimes
 a son superior even to his sire
 and since thyself shalt neither base be found
 nor spiritless nor altogether void
 of talents such as grace thy royal sire
 i therefore hope success of thy attempt 370
 heed not the suitors' projects neither wise
 are they nor just nor aught suspect the doom
 which now approaches them and in one day
 shall overwhelm them all no long suspense
 shall hold thy purposed enterprise in doubt
 such help from me of old thy father's friend
 thou shalt receive who with a bark welloar'd
 will serve thee and myself attend thee forth
 but haste join thou the suitors and provide
 in sep'rate vessels stow'd all needful stores 380
 wine in thy jars and flour the strength of man
 in skins closeseam'd i will meantime select
 such as shall voluntary share thy toils
 in seagirt ithaca new ships and old
 abound and i will chuse myself for thee
 the prime of all which without more delay
 we will launch out into the spacious deep
 thus pallas spake daughter of jove nor long
 so greeted by the voice divine remain'd
 telemachus but to his palace went 390
 distress'd in heart he found the suitors there
 goats slaying in the hall and fatted swine
 roasting when with a laugh antino�s flew
 to meet him fasten'd on his hand and said
 telemachus in eloquence sublime
 and of a spirit not to be controul'd
 give harbour in thy breast on no account
 to aftergrudge or enmity but eat
 far rather cheerfully as heretofore
 and freely drink committing all thy cares 400
 to the achaians who shall furnish forth
 a gallant ship and chosen crew for thee
 that thou may'st hence to pylus with all speed
 tidings to learn of thy illustrious sire
 to whom telemachus discrete replied
 antino�s i have no heart to feast
 with guests so insolent nor can indulge
 the pleasures of a mind at ease with you
 is't not enough suitors that ye have used
 my noble patrimony as your own 410
 while i was yet a child now grown mature
 and competent to understand the speech
 of my instructors feeling too a mind
 within me conscious of augmented pow'rs
 i will attempt your ruin be assured
 whether at pylus or continuing here
 i go indeed nor shall my voyage prove
 of which i speak bootless or vain i go
 an humble passenger who neither bark
 nor rowers have to boast my own denied 420
 that honour so ye judg'd it best by you
 he said and from antino�s' hand his own
 drew sudden then their delicate repast
 the busy suitors on all sides prepar'd
 still taunting as they toil'd and with sharp speech
 sarcastic wantoning of whom a youth
 arrogant as his fellows thus began
 i see it plain telemachus intends
 our slaughter either he will aids procure
 from sandy pylus or will bring them arm'd 430
 from sparta such is his tremendous drift
 even to fruitful ephyre perchance
 he will proceed seeking some baneful herb
 which cast into our cup shall drug us all
 to whom some haughty suitor thus replied
 who knows but that himself wand'ring the sea
 from all his friends and kindred far remote
 may perish like ulysses whence to us
 should double toil ensue on whom the charge
 to parcel out his wealth would then devolve 440
 and to endow his mother with the house
 for his abode whom she should chance to wed
 so sported they but he ascending sought
 his father's lofty chamber where his heaps
 he kept of brass and gold garments in chests
 and oils of fragrant scent a copious store
 there many a cask with season'd nectar fill'd
 the grape's pure juice divine beside the wall
 stood orderly arranged waiting the hour
 should e'er such hour arrive when after woes 450
 num'rous ulysses should regain his home
 secure that chamber was with folding doors
 of massy planks compact and night and day
 within it antient euryclea dwelt
 guardian discrete of all the treasures there
 whom thither call'd telemachus address'd
 nurse draw me forth sweet wine into my jars
 delicious next to that which thou reserv'st
 for our poor wand'rer if escaping death
 at last divine ulysses e'er return 460
 fill twelve and stop them close pour also meal
 well mill'd full twenty measures into skins
 closeseam'd and mention what thou dost to none
 place them together for at eventide
 i will convey them hence soon as the queen
 retiring to her couch shall seek repose
 for hence to sparta will i take my course
 and sandy pylus tidings there to hear
 if hear i may of my lov'd sire's return
 he ceas'd then wept his gentle nurse that sound 470
 hearing and in wing'd accents thus replied
 my child ah wherefore hath a thought so rash
 possess'd thee whither only and belov'd
 seek'st thou to ramble travelling alas
 to distant climes ulysses is no more
 dead lies the hero in some land unknown
 and thou no sooner shalt depart than these
 will plot to slay thee and divide thy wealth
 no stay with us who love thee need is none
 that thou should'st on the barren deep distress 480
 encounter roaming without hope or end
 whom prudent thus answer'd telemachus
 take courage nurse for not without consent
 of the immortals i have thus resolv'd
 but swear that till eleven days be past
 or twelve or till enquiry made she learn
 herself my going thou wilt not impart
 of this my purpose to my mother's ear
 lest all her beauties fade by grief impair'd
 he ended and the antient matron swore 490
 solemnly by the gods which done she fill'd
 with wine the vessels and the skins with meal
 and he returning join'd the throng below
 then pallas goddess azureeyed her thoughts
 elsewhere directing all the city ranged
 in semblance of telemachus each man
 exhorting at the dusk of eve to seek
 the gallant ship and from no�mon son
 renown'd of phronius ask'd herself a bark
 which soon as ask'd he promis'd to supply 500
 now set the sun and twilight dimm'd the ways
 when drawing down his bark into the deep
 he gave her all her furniture oars arms
 and tackle such as wellbuilt galleys bear
 then moor'd her in the bottom of the bay
 meantime his mariners in haste repair'd
 down to the shore for pallas urged them on
 and now on other purposes intent
 the goddess sought the palace where with dews
 of slumber drenching ev'ry suitor's eye 510
 she fool'd the drunkard multitude and dash'd
 the goblets from their idle hands away
 they through the city reeled happy to leave
 the dull carousal when the slumb'rous weight
 oppressive on their eyelids once had fall'n
 next pallas azureeyed in mentor's form
 and with the voice of mentor summoning
 telemachus abroad him thus bespake
 telemachus already at their oars
 sit all thy fellowvoyagers and wait 520
 thy coming linger not but haste away
 this said minerva led him thence whom he
 with nimble steps follow'd and on the shore
 arrived found all his mariners prepared
 whom thus the princely voyager address'd
 haste my companions bring we down the stores
 already sorted and set forth but nought
 my mother knows or any of her train
 of this design one matron sole except
 he spake and led them they obedient brought 530
 all down and as ulysses' son enjoin'd
 within the gallant bark the charge bestow'd
 then led by pallas went the prince on board
 where down they sat the goddess in the stern
 and at her side telemachus the crew
 cast loose the hawsers and embarking fill'd
 the benches blueeyed pallas from the west
 call'd forth propitious breezes fresh they curled
 the sable deep and sounding swept the waves
 he loudexhorting them his people bade 540
 hand brisk the tackle they obedient reared
 the pinetree mast which in its socket deep
 they lodg'd then strain'd the cordage and with thongs
 welltwisted drew the shining sail aloft
 a landbreeze fill'd the canvas and the flood
 roar'd as she went against the steady bark
 that ran with even course her liquid way
 the rigging thus of all the galley set
 their beakers crowning high with wine they hail'd
 the everliving gods but above all 550
 minerva daughter azureeyed of jove
 thus all night long the galley and till dawn
 had brighten'd into day cleaved swift the flood

 6 the reader is to be reminded that this is not an assembly of the
 suitors only but a general one which affords telemachus an opportunity
 to apply himself to the feelings of the ithacans at large




 book iii

 argument

 telemachus arriving at pylus enquires of nestor concerning ulysses
 nestor relates to him all that he knows or has heard of the greecians
 since their departure from the siege of troy but not being able to give
 him any satisfactory account of ulysses refers him to menelaus at
 evening minerva quits telemachus but discovers herself in going nestor
 sacrifices to the goddess and the solemnity ended telemachus sets forth
 for sparta in one of nestor's chariots and accompanied by nestor's son
 pisistratus


 the sun emerging from the lucid waves
 ascended now the brazen vault with light
 for the inhabitants of earth and heav'n
 when in their bark at pylus they arrived
 city of neleus on the shore they found
 the people sacrificing bulls they slew
 black without spot to neptune azurehair'd
 on ranges nine of seats they sat each range
 received five hundred and to each they made
 allotment equal of nine sable bulls 10
 the feast was now begun these eating sat
 the entrails those stood off'ring to the god
 the thighs his portion when the ithacans
 push'd right ashore and furling close the sails
 and making fast their moorings disembark'd
 forth came telemachus by pallas led
 whom thus the goddess azureeyed address'd
 telemachus there is no longer room
 for bashful fear since thou hast cross'd the flood
 with purpose to enquire what land conceals 20
 thy father and what fate hath follow'd him
 advance at once to the equestrian chief
 nestor within whose bosom lies perhaps
 advice well worthy of thy search entreat
 himself that he will tell thee only truth
 who will not lye for he is passing wise
 to whom telemachus discrete replied
 ah mentor how can i advance how greet
 a chief like him unpractis'd as i am
 in manag'd phrase shame bids the youth beware 30
 how he accosts the man of many years
 but him the goddess answer'd azureeyed
 telemachus thou wilt in part thyself
 fit speech devise and heav'n will give the rest
 for thou wast neither born nor hast been train'd
 to manhood under unpropitious pow'rs
 so saying minerva led him thence whom he
 with nimble steps attending soon arrived
 among the multitude there nestor sat
 and nestor's sons while busily the feast 40
 tending his num'rous followers roasted some
 the viands some transfix'd them with the spits
 they seeing guests arrived together all
 advanced and grasping courteously their hands
 invited them to sit but first the son
 of nestor young pisistratus approach'd
 who fast'ning on the hands of both beside
 the banquet placed them where the beach was spread
 with fleeces and where thrasymedes sat
 his brother and the hoary chief his sire 50
 to each a portion of the inner parts
 he gave then fill'd a golden cup with wine
 which tasted first he to the daughter bore
 of jove the thund'rer and her thus bespake
 oh guest the king of ocean now adore
 for ye have chanced on neptune's festival
 and when thou hast thyself libation made
 duly and pray'r deliver to thy friend
 the gen'rous juice that he may also make
 libation for he doubtless seeks in prayer 60
 the immortals of whose favour all have need
 but since he younger is and with myself
 coeval first i give the cup to thee
 he ceas'd and to her hand consign'd the cup
 which pallas gladly from a youth received
 so just and wise who to herself had first
 the golden cup presented and in pray'r
 fervent the sov'reign of the seas adored
 hear earthencircler neptune o vouchsafe
 to us thy suppliants the desired effect 70
 of this our voyage glory first bestow
 on nestor and his offspring both then grant
 to all the pylians such a gracious boon
 as shall requite their noble off'ring well
 grant also to telemachus and me
 to voyage hence possess'd of what we sought
 when hither in our sable bark we came
 so pallas pray'd and her own pray'r herself
 accomplish'd to telemachus she gave
 the splendid goblet next and in his turn 80
 like pray'r ulysses' son also preferr'd
 and now the banquet from the spits withdrawn
 they next distributed sufficient share
 to each and all were sumptuously regaled
 at length both hunger satisfied and thirst
 thus nestor the gerenian chief began
 now with more seemliness we may enquire
 after repast what guests we have received
 our guests who are ye whence have ye the waves
 plough'd hither come ye to transact concerns 90
 commercial or at random roam the deep
 like pirates who with mischief charged and woe
 to foreign states oft hazard life themselves
 him answer'd bolder now but still discrete
 telemachus for pallas had his heart
 with manly courage arm'd that he might ask
 from nestor tidings of his absent sire
 and win himself distinction and renown
 oh nestor neleus' son glory of greece
 thou askest whence we are i tell thee whence 100
 from ithaca by the umbrageous woods
 of neritus o'erhung by private need
 not public urged we come my errand is
 to seek intelligence of the renown'd
 ulysses of my noble father prais'd
 for dauntless courage whom report proclaims
 conqueror with thine aid of sacred troy
 we have already learn'd where other chiefs
 who fought at ilium died but jove conceals
 even the death of my illustrious sire 110
 in dull obscurity for none hath heard
 or confident can answer where he dy'd
 whether he on the continent hath fall'n
 by hostile hands or by the waves o'erwhelm'd
 of amphitrite welters in the deep
 for this cause at thy knees suppliant i beg
 that thou would'st tell me his disast'rous end
 if either thou beheld'st that dread event
 thyself or from some wanderer of the greeks
 hast heard it for my father at his birth 120
 was sure predestin'd to no common woes
 neither through pity or o'erstrain'd respect
 flatter me but explicit all relate
 which thou hast witness'd if my noble sire
 e'er gratified thee by performance just
 of word or deed at ilium where ye fell
 so num'rous slain in fight oh recollect
 now his fidelity and tell me true
 then nestor thus gerenian hero old
 young friend since thou remind'st me speaking thus 130
 of all the woes which indefatigable
 we sons of the achaians there sustain'd
 both those which wand'ring on the deep we bore
 wherever by achilles led in quest
 of booty and the many woes beside
 which under royal priam's spacious walls
 we suffer'd know that there our bravest fell
 there warlike ajax lies there peleus' son
 there too patroclus like the gods themselves
 in council and my son beloved there 140
 brave virtuous swift of foot and bold in fight
 antilochus nor are these sorrows all
 what tongue of mortal man could all relate
 should'st thou abiding here five years employ
 or six enquiring of the woes endured
 by the achaians ere thou should'st have learn'd
 the whole thou would'st depart tir'd of the tale
 for we nine years stratagems of all kinds
 devised against them and saturnian jove
 scarce crown'd the difficult attempt at last 150
 there no competitor in wiles wellplann'd
 ulysses found so far were all surpass'd
 in shrewd invention by thy noble sire
 if thou indeed art his as sure thou art
 whose sight breeds wonder in me and thy speech
 his speech resembles more than might be deem'd
 within the scope of years so green as thine
 there never in opinion or in voice
 illustrious ulysses and myself
 divided were but one in heart contrived 160
 as best we might the benefit of all
 but after priam's lofty city sack'd
 and the departure of the greeks on board
 their barks and when the gods had scatter'd them
 then jove imagin'd for the argive host
 a sorrowful return for neither just
 were all nor prudent therefore many found
 a fate disast'rous through the vengeful ire
 of joveborn pallas who between the sons
 of atreus sharp contention interposed 170
 they both irregularly and against
 just order summoning by night the greeks
 to council of whom many came with wine
 oppress'd promulgated the cause for which
 they had convened the people then it was
 that menelaus bade the general host
 their thoughts bend homeward o'er the sacred deep
 which agamemnon in no sort approved
 his counsel was to slay them yet at troy
 that so he might assuage the dreadful wrath 180
 of pallas first by sacrifice and pray'r
 vain hope he little thought how ill should speed
 that fond attempt for once provok'd the gods
 are not with ease conciliated again
 thus stood the brothers altercation hot
 maintaining till at length uprose the greeks
 with deaf'ning clamours and with diff'ring minds
 we slept the night but teeming with disgust
 mutual for jove great woe prepar'd for all
 at dawn of day we drew our gallies down 190
 into the sea and hasty put on board
 the spoils and female captives half the host
 with agamemnon son of atreus stay'd
 supreme commander and embarking half
 push'd forth swift course we made for neptune smooth'd
 the waves before us of the monstrous deep
 at tenedos arriv'd we there perform'd
 sacrifice to the gods ardent to reach
 our native land but unpropitious jove
 not yet designing our arrival there 200
 involved us in dissension fierce again
 for all the crews followers of the king
 thy noble sire to gratify our chief
 the son of atreus chose a diff'rent course
 and steer'd their oary barks again to troy
 but i assured that evil from the gods
 impended gath'ring all my gallant fleet
 fled thence in haste and warlike diomede
 exhorting his attendants also fled
 at length the hero menelaus join'd 210
 our fleets at lesbos there he found us held
 in deep deliberation on the length
 of way before us whether we should steer
 above the craggy chios to the isle
 psyria that island holding on our left
 or under chios by the windswept heights
 of mimas then we ask'd from jove a sign
 and by a sign vouchsafed he bade us cut
 the wide sea to euboea sheer athwart
 so soonest to escape the threat'ned harm 220
 shrill sang the rising gale and with swift prows
 cleaving the fishy flood we reach'd by night
 ger�stus where arrived we burn'd the thighs
 of num'rous bulls to neptune who had safe
 conducted us through all our perilous course
 the fleet of diomede in safety moor'd
 on the fourth day at argos but myself
 held on my course to pylus nor the wind
 one moment thwarted us or died away
 when jove had once commanded it to blow 230
 thus uninform'd i have arrived my son
 nor of the greecians who are saved have heard
 or who have perish'd but what news soe'er
 i have obtain'd since my return with truth
 i will relate nor aught conceal from thee
 the spearfamed myrmidons as rumour speaks
 by neoptolemus illustrious son
 of brave achilles led have safe arrived
 safe philoctetes also son renown'd
 of p�as and idomeneus at crete 240
 hath landed all his followers who survive
 the bloody war the waves have swallow'd none
 ye have yourselves doubtless although remote
 of agamemnon heard how he return'd
 and how �gisthus cruelly contrived
 for him a bloody welcome but himself
 hath with his own life paid the murth'rous deed
 good is it therefore if a son survive
 the slain since agamemnon's son hath well
 avenged his father's death slaying himself 250
 �gisthus foul assassin of his sire
 young friend for pleas'd thy vig'rous youth i view
 and just proportion be thou also bold
 that thine like his may be a deathless name
 then prudent him answer'd telemachus
 oh nestor neleus' son glory of greece
 and righteous was that vengeance _his_ renown
 achaia's sons shall far and wide diffuse
 to future times transmitting it in song
 ah would that such ability the gods 260
 would grant to me that i as well the deeds
 might punish of our suitors whose excess
 enormous and whose bitter taunts i feel
 continual object of their subtle hate
 but not for me such happiness the gods
 have twined into my thread no not for me
 or for my father patience is our part
 to whom gerenian nestor thus replied
 young friend since thou remind'st me of that theme
 fame here reports that num'rous suitors haunt 270
 thy palace for thy mother's sake and there
 much evil perpetrate in thy despight
 but say endur'st thou willing their controul
 imperious or because the people sway'd
 by some response oracular incline
 against thee but who knows the time may come
 when to his home restored either alone
 or aided by the force of all the greeks
 ulysses may avenge the wrong at least
 should pallas azureeyed thee love as erst 280
 at troy the scene of our unnumber'd woes
 she lov'd ulysses for i have not known
 the gods assisting so apparently
 a mortal man as him minerva there
 should pallas view thee also with like love
 and kind solicitude some few of those
 should dream perchance of wedlock never more
 then answer thus telemachus return'd
 that word's accomplishment i cannot hope
 it promises too much the thought alone 290
 o'erwhelms me an event so fortunate
 would unexpected on my part arrive
 although the gods themselves should purpose it
 but pallas him answer'd c�ruleaneyed
 telemachus what word was that which leap'd
 the iv'ry guard7 that should have fenced it in
 a god so willing could with utmost ease
 save any man howe'er remote myself
 i had much rather many woes endured
 revisit home at last happy and safe 300
 than sooner coming die in my own house
 as agamemnon perish'd by the arts
 of base �gisthus and the subtle queen
 yet not the gods themselves can save from death
 alllevelling the man whom most they love
 when fate ordains him once to his last sleep
 to whom telemachus discrete replied
 howe'er it interest us let us leave
 this question mentor he i am assured
 returns no more but hath already found 310
 a sad sad fate by the decree of heav'n
 but i would now interrogate again
 nestor and on a different theme for him
 in human rights i judge and laws expert
 and in all knowledge beyond other men
 for he hath govern'd as report proclaims
 three generations therefore in my eyes
 he wears the awful impress of a god
 oh nestor son of neleus tell me true
 what was the manner of atrides' death 320
 wideruling agamemnon tell me where
 was menelaus by what means contrived
 �gisthus to inflict the fatal blow
 slaying so much a nobler than himself
 had not the brother of the monarch reach'd
 achaian argos yet but wand'ring still
 in other climes his long absence gave
 �gisthus courage for that bloody deed
 whom answer'd the gerenian chief renown'd
 my son i will inform thee true meantime 330
 thy own suspicions border on the fact
 had menelaus hero amber hair'd
 �gisthus found living at his return
 from ilium never on _his_ bones the greeks
 had heap'd a tomb but dogs and rav'ning fowls
 had torn him lying in the open field
 far from the town nor him had woman wept
 of all in greece for he had foul transgress'd
 but we in many an arduous task engaged
 lay before ilium he the while secure 340
 within the green retreats of argos found
 occasion apt by flatt'ry to delude
 the spouse of agamemnon she at first
 the royal clytemnestra firm refused
 the deed dishonourable for she bore
 a virtuous mind and at her side a bard
 attended ever whom the king to troy
 departing had appointed to the charge
 but when the gods had purposed to ensnare
 �gisthus then dismissing far remote 350
 the bard into a desart isle he there
 abandon'd him to rav'ning fowls a prey
 and to his own home willing as himself
 led clytemnestra num'rous thighs he burn'd
 on all their hallow'd altars to the gods
 and hung with tap'stry images and gold
 their shrines his great exploit past hope atchiev'd
 we menelaus and myself had sailed
 from troy together but when we approach'd
 sunium headland of th' athenian shore 360
 there phoebus sudden with his gentle shafts
 slew menelaus' pilot while he steer'd
 the volant bark phrontis onetor's son
 a mariner past all expert whom none
 in steerage match'd what time the tempest roar'd
 here therefore menelaus was detained
 giving his friend due burial and his rites
 funereal celebrating though in haste
 still to proceed but when with all his fleet
 the wide sea traversing he reach'd at length 370
 malea's lofty foreland in his course
 rough passage then and perilous he found
 shrill blasts the thund'rer pour'd into his sails
 and wild waves sent him mountainous his ships
 there scatter'd some to the cydonian coast
 of crete he push'd near where the jardan flows
 beside the confines of gortyna stands
 amid the gloomy flood a smooth rock steep
 toward the sea against whose leftward point
 ph�stus by name the south wind rolls the surge 380
 amain which yet the rock though small repells
 hither with part he came and scarce the crews
 themselves escaped while the huge billows broke
 their ships against the rocks yet five he saved
 which winds and waves drove to the �gyptian shore
 thus he provision gath'ring as he went
 and gold abundant roam'd to distant lands
 and nations of another tongue meantime
 �gisthus these enormities at home
 devising slew atrides and supreme 390
 rul'd the subjected land sev'n years he reign'd
 in opulent mycen� but the eighth
 from athens brought renown'd orestes home
 for his destruction who of life bereaved
 �gisthus base assassin of his sire
 orestes therefore the funereal rites
 performing to his shameless mother's shade
 and to her lustful paramour a feast
 gave to the argives on which selfsame day
 the warlike menelaus with his ships 400
 all treasureladen to the brink arrived
 and thou young friend from thy forsaken home
 rove not long time remote thy treasures left
 at mercy of those proud lest they divide
 and waste the whole rend'ring thy voyage vain
 but hence to menelaus is the course
 to which i counsel thee for he hath come
 of late from distant lands whence to escape
 no man could hope whom tempests first had driv'n
 devious into so wide a sea from which 410
 themselves the birds of heaven could not arrive
 in a whole year so vast is the expanse
 go then with ship and shipmates or if more
 the land delight thee steeds thou shalt not want
 nor chariot and my sons shall be thy guides
 to noble lacedemon the abode
 of menelaus ask from him the truth
 who will not lye for he is passing wise
 while thus he spake the sun declined and night
 approaching blueeyed pallas interposed 420
 o antient king well hast thou spoken all
 but now delay not cut ye forth the tongues8
 and mingle wine that neptune first invoked
 with due libation and the other gods
 we may repair to rest for even now
 the sun is sunk and it becomes us not
 long to protract a banquet to the gods
 devote but in fit season to depart
 so spake jove's daughter they obedient heard
 the heralds then pour'd water on their hands 430
 and the attendant youths filling the cups
 served them from left to right next all the tongues
 they cast into the fire and ev'ry guest
 arising pour'd libation to the gods
 libation made and all with wine sufficed
 godlike telemachus and pallas both
 would have return'd incontinent on board
 but nestor urged them still to be his guests
 forbid it jove and all the pow'rs of heav'n
 that ye should leave me to repair on board 440
 your vessel as i were some needy wretch
 cloakless and destitute of fleecy stores
 wherewith to spread the couch soft for myself
 or for my guests no i have garments warm
 an ample store and rugs of richest dye
 and never shall ulysses' son belov'd
 my frend's own son sleep on a galley's plank
 while i draw vital air grant also heav'n
 that dying i may leave behind me sons
 glad to accommodate whatever guest 450
 him answer'd then pallas c�ruleaneyed
 old chief thou hast well said and reason bids
 telemachus thy kind commands obey
 let _him_ attend thee hence that he may sleep
 beneath thy roof but i return on board
 myself to instruct my people and to give
 all needful orders for among them none
 is old as i but they are youths alike
 coevals of telemachus with whom
 they have embark'd for friendship's sake alone 460
 i therefore will repose myself on board
 this night and to the caucons bold in arms
 will sail tomorrow to demand arrears
 long time unpaid and of no small amount
 but since he is become thy guest afford
 my friend a chariot and a son of thine
 who shall direct his way nor let him want
 of all thy steeds the swiftest and the best
 so saying the blueeyed goddess as upborne
 on eagle's wings vanish'd amazement seized 470
 the whole assembly and the antient king
 o'erwhelmed with wonder at that sight the hand
 grasp'd of telemachus whom he thus bespake
 my friend i prophesy that thou shalt prove
 nor base nor dastard whom so young the gods
 already take in charge for of the pow'rs
 inhabitants of heav'n none else was this
 than jove's own daughter pallas who among
 the greecians honour'd most thy gen'rous sire
 but thou o queen compassionate us all 480
 myself my sons my comfort give to each
 a glorious name and i to thee will give
 for sacrifice an heifer of the year
 broadfronted one that never yet hath borne
 the yoke and will incase her horns with gold
 so nestor pray'd whom pallas gracious heard
 then the gerenian warrior old before
 his sons and sons in law to his abode
 magnificent proceeded they arrived
 within the splendid palace of the king 490
 on thrones and couches sat in order ranged
 whom nestor welcom'd charging high the cup
 with wine of richest sort which she who kept
 that treasure now in the eleventh year
 first broach'd unsealing the delicious juice
 with this the hoary senior fill'd a cup
 and to the daughter of jove �gisarm'd
 pouring libation offer'd fervent pray'r
 when all had made libation and no wish
 remain'd of more then each to rest retired 500
 and nestor the gerenian warrior old
 led thence telemachus to a carved couch
 beneath the sounding portico prepared
 beside him he bade sleep the spearman bold
 pisistratus a gallant youth the sole
 unwedded in his house of all his sons
 himself in the interior palace lay
 where couch and cov'ring for her antient spouse
 the consort queen had diligent prepar'd
 but when aurora daughter of the dawn 510
 had tinged the east arising from his bed
 gerenian nestor issued forth and sat
 before his palacegate on the white stones
 resplendent as with oil on which of old
 his father neleus had been wont to sit
 in council like a god but he had sought
 by destiny dismiss'd long since the shades
 on those stones therefore now nestor himself
 achaia's guardian sat sceptre in hand
 where soon his num'rous sons leaving betimes 520
 the place of their repose also appeared
 echephron stratius perseus thrasymedes
 aretus and pisistratus they placed
 godlike telemachus at nestor's side
 and the gerenian hero thus began
 sons be ye quickexecute with dispatch
 my purpose that i may propitiate first
 of all the gods minerva who herself
 hath honour'd manifest our hallow'd feast
 haste one into the field to order thence 530
 an ox and let the herdsman drive it home
 another hasting to the sable bark
 of brave telemachus bring hither all
 his friends save two and let a third command
 laerceus that he come to enwrap with gold
 the victim's horns abide ye here the rest
 and bid my female train for i intend
 a banquet with all diligence provide
 seats stores of wood and water from the rock
 he said whom instant all obey'd the ox 540
 came from the field and from the gallant ship
 the shipmates of the brave telemachus
 next charged with all his implements of art
 his mallet anvil pincers came the smith
 to give the horns their gilding also came
 pallas herself to her own sacred rites
 then nestor hoary warrior furnish'd gold
 which hammer'd thin the artist wrapp'd around
 the victim's horns that seeing him attired
 so costly pallas might the more be pleased 550
 stratius and brave echephron introduced
 the victim by his horns aretus brought
 a laver in one hand with flow'rs emboss'd
 and in his other hand a basket stored
 with cakes while warlike thrasymedes arm'd
 with his longhafted ax prepared to smite
 the ox and perseus to receive the blood
 the hoary nestor consecrated first
 both cakes and water and with earnest pray'r
 to pallas gave the forelock to the flames 560
 when all had worshipp'd and the broken cakes
 sprinkled then godlike thrasymedes drew
 close to the ox and smote him deep the edge
 enter'd and senseless on the floor he fell
 then nestor's daughters and the consorts all
 of nestor's sons with his own consort chaste
 eurydice the daughter eldestborn
 of clymenus in one shrill orison
 vocif'rous join'd while they lifting the ox
 held him supported firmly and the prince 570
 of men pisistratus his gullet pierced
 soon as the sable blood had ceased and life
 had left the victim spreading him abroad
 with nice address they parted at the joint
 his thighs and wrapp'd them in the double cawl
 which with crude slices thin they overspread
 nestor burn'd incense and libation pour'd
 large on the hissing brands while him beside
 busy with spit and prong stood many a youth
 train'd to the task the thighs consumed each took
 his portion of the maw then slashing well 581
 the remnant they transpierced it with the spits
 neatly and held it reeking at the fire
 meantime the youngest of the daughters fair
 of nestor beauteous polycaste laved
 anointed and in vest and tunic cloathed
 telemachus who so refresh'd stepp'd forth
 from the bright laver graceful as a god
 and took his seat at antient nestor's side
 the viands dress'd and from the spits withdrawn 590
 they sat to share the feast and princely youths
 arising gave them wine in cups of gold
 when neither hunger now nor thirst remain'd
 unsated thus gerenian nestor spake
 my sons arise lead forth the sprightly steeds
 and yoke them that telemachus may go
 so spake the chief to whose commands his sons
 obedient yoked in haste the rapid steeds
 and the intendant matron of the stores
 disposed meantime within the chariot bread 600
 and wine and dainties such as princes eat
 telemachus into the chariot first
 ascended and beside him next his place
 pisistratus the son of nestor took
 then seiz'd the reins and lash'd the coursers on
 they nothing loth into the open plain
 flew leaving lofty pylus soon afar
 thus journeying they shook on either side
 the yoke all day and now the setting sun
 to dusky evening had resign'd the roads 610
 when they to pher� came and the abode
 reach'd of diocles whose illustrious sire
 orsilochus from alpheus drew his birth
 and there with kindness entertain'd they slept
 but when aurora daughter of the dawn
 look'd rosy from the east yoking the steeds
 they in their sumptuous chariot sat again
 the son of nestor plied the lash and forth
 through vestibule and sounding portico
 the royal coursers not unwilling flew 620
 a corninvested land receiv'd them next
 and there they brought their journey to a close
 so rapidly they moved and now the sun
 went down and eventide dimm'd all the ways

 book iv

 argument

 telemachus with pisistratus arrives at the palace of menelaus from
 whom he receives some fresh information concerning the return of the
 greecians and is in particular told on the authority of proteus that
 his father is detained by calypso the suitors plotting against the life
 of telemachus lie in wait to intercept him in his return to ithaca
 penelope being informed of his departure and of their designs to slay
 him becomes inconsolable but is relieved by a dream sent to her from
 minerva


 in hollow laced�mon's spacious vale
 arriving to the house they drove direct
 of royal menelaus him they found
 in his own palace all his num'rous friends
 regaling at a nuptial banquet giv'n
 both for his daughter and the prince his son
 his daughter to renown'd achilles' heir
 he sent to whom he had at troy engaged
 to give her and the gods now made her his
 with chariots and with steeds he sent her forth 10
 to the illustrious city where the prince
 achilles' offspring ruled the myrmidons
 but to his son he gave a spartan fair
 alector's daughter from an handmaid sprang
 that son to menelaus in his age
 brave megapenthes for the gods no child
 to helen gave made mother once of her
 who vied in perfect loveliness of form
 with golden venus' self hermione
 thus all the neighbour princes and the friends 20
 of noble menelaus feasting sat
 within his spacious palace among whom
 a sacred bard sang sweetly to his harp
 while in the midst two dancers smote the ground
 with measur'd steps responsive to his song
 and now the heroes nestor's noble son
 and young telemachus arrived within
 the vestibule whom issuing from the hall
 the noble eteoneus of the train
 of menelaus saw at once he ran 30
 across the palace to report the news
 to his lord's ear and standing at his side
 in accents wing'd with haste thus greeted him
 oh menelaus heav'n descended chief
 two guests arrive both strangers but the race
 of jove supreme resembling each in form
 say shall we loose ourselves their rapid steeds
 or hence dismiss them to some other host
 but menelaus hero goldenhair'd
 indignant answer'd him boethe's son 40
 thou wast not eteoneus heretofore
 a babbler who now pratest as a child
 we have ourselves arrived indebted much
 to hospitality of other men
 if jove shall even here some pause at last
 of woe afford us therefore loose at once
 their steeds and introduce them to the feast
 he said and issuing eteoneus call'd
 the brisk attendants to his aid with whom
 he loos'd their foaming coursers from the yoke 50
 them first they bound to mangers which with oats
 and mingled barley they supplied then thrust
 the chariot sidelong to the splendid wall9
 themselves he next into the royal house
 conducted who survey'd wond'ring the abode
 of the heav'nfavour'd king for on all sides
 as with the splendour of the sun or moon
 the lofty dome of menelaus blazed
 satiate at length with wonder at that sight
 they enter'd each a bath and by the hands 60
 of maidens laved and oil'd and cloath'd again
 with shaggy mantles and resplendent vests
 sat both enthroned at menelaus' side
 and now a maiden charged with golden ew'r
 and with an argent laver pouring first
 pure water on their hands supplied them next
 with a bright table which the maiden chief
 in office furnish'd plenteously with bread
 and dainties remnants of the last regale
 then came the sew'r who with delicious meats 70
 dish after dish served them and placed beside
 the chargers cups magnificent of gold
 when menelaus grasp'd their hands and said
 eat and rejoice and when ye shall have shared
 our nuptial banquet we will then inquire
 who are ye both for certain not from those
 whose generation perishes are ye
 but rather of some race of sceptred chiefs
 heav'nborn the base have never sons like you
 so saying he from the board lifted his own 80
 distinguish'd portion and the fatted chine
 gave to his guests the sav'ry viands they
 with outstretch'd hands assail'd and when the force
 no longer now of appetite they felt
 telemachus inclining close his head
 to nestor's son lest others should his speech
 witness in whisper'd words him thus address'd
 dearest pisistratus observe my friend
 how all the echoing palace with the light
 of beaming brass of gold and amber shines 90
 silver and ivory for radiance such
 th' interior mansion of olympian jove
 i deem what wealth how various how immense
 is here astonish'd i survey the sight
 but menelaus goldenhair'd his speech
 o'erhearing thus in accents wing'd replied
 my children let no mortal man pretend
 comparison with jove for jove's abode
 and all his stores are incorruptible
 but whether mortal man with me may vie 100
 in the display of wealth or whether not
 this know that after many toils endured
 and perilous wand'rings wide in the eighth year
 i brought my treasures home remote i roved
 to cyprus to phoenice to the shores
 of �gypt �thiopia's land i reach'd
 th' erembi the sidonians and the coasts
 of lybia where the lambs their foreheads shew
 at once with horns defended soon as yean'd
 there thrice within the year the flocks produce 110
 nor master there nor shepherd ever feels
 a dearth of cheese of flesh or of sweet milk
 delicious drawn from udders never dry
 while thus commodities on various coasts
 gath'ring i roam'd another by the arts
 of his pernicious spouse aided of life
 bereav'd my brother privily and when least
 he fear'd to lose it therefore little joy
 to me results from all that i possess
 your fathers be those fathers who they may 120
 these things have doubtless told you for immense
 have been my suff'rings and i have destroy'd
 a palace well inhabited and stored
 with precious furniture in ev'ry kind
 such that i would to heav'n i own'd at home
 though but the third of it and that the greeks
 who perish'd then beneath the walls of troy
 far from steedpastured argos still survived
 yet while sequester'd here i frequent mourn
 my slaughter'd friends by turns i sooth my soul 130
 with tears shed for them and by turns again
 i cease for grief soon satiates free indulged
 but of them all although i all bewail
 none mourn i so as one whom calling back
 to memory i both sleep and food abhor
 for of achaia's sons none ever toiled
 strenuous as ulysses but his lot
 was woe and unremitting sorrow mine
 for his long absence who if still he live
 we know not aught or be already dead 140
 him doubtless old laertes mourns and him
 discrete penelope nor less his son
 telemachus born newly when he sail'd
 so saying he kindled in him strong desire
 to mourn his father at his father's name
 fast fell his tears to ground and with both hands
 he spread his purple cloak before his eyes
 which menelaus marking doubtful sat
 if he should leave him leisure for his tears
 or question him and tell him all at large 150
 while thus he doubted helen as it chanced
 leaving her fragrant chamber came august
 as dian goddess of the golden bow
 adrasta for her use set forth a throne
 alcippe with soft arras cover'd it
 and philo brought her silver basket gift
 of fair alcandra wife of polybus
 whose mansion in �gyptian thebes is rich
 in untold treasure and who gave himself
 ten golden talents and two silver baths 160
 to menelaus with two splendid tripods
 beside the noble gifts which at the hand
 of his illustrious spouse helen receiv'd
 a golden spindle and a basket wheel'd
 itself of silver and its lip of gold
 that basket philo her own handmaid placed
 at beauteous helen's side charged to the brim
 with slender threads on which the spindle lay
 with wool of purple lustre wrapp'd around
 approaching on her footstool'd throne she sat 170
 and instant of her royal spouse enquired
 know we my menelaus dear to jove
 these guests of ours and whence they have arrived
 erroneous i may speak yet speak i must
 in man or woman never have i seen
 such likeness to another wonderfixt
 i gaze as in this stranger to the son
 of brave ulysses whom that hero left
 newborn at home when shameless as i was
 for my unworthy sake the greecians sailed 180
 to ilium with fierce rage of battle fir'd
 then menelaus thus the goldenhair'd
 i also such resemblance find in him
 as thou such feet such hands the cast of eye10
 similar and the head and flowing locks
 and even now when i ulysses named
 and his great sufferings mention'd in my cause
 the bitter tear dropp'd from his lids while broad
 before his eyes his purple cloak he spread
 to whom the son of nestor thus replied 190
 atrides menelaus chief renown'd
 he is in truth his son as thou hast said
 but he is modest and would much himself
 condemn if at his first arrival here
 he should loquacious seem and bold to thee
 to whom we listen captived by thy voice
 as if some god had spoken as for me
 nestor my father the gerenian chief
 bade me conduct him hither for he wish'd
 to see thee promising himself from thee 200
 the benefit of some kind word or deed
 for destitute of other aid he much
 his father's tedious absence mourns at home
 so fares telemachus his father strays
 remote and in his stead no friend hath he
 who might avert the mischiefs that he feels
 to whom the hero amberhair'd replied
 ye gods the offspring of indeed a friend
 hath reach'd my house of one who hath endured
 arduous conflicts num'rous for my sake 210
 and much i purpos'd had olympian jove
 vouchsaf'd us prosp'rous passage o'er the deep
 to have receiv'd him with such friendship here
 as none beside in argos i had then
 founded a city for him and had rais'd
 a palace for himself i would have brought
 the hero hither and his son with all
 his people and with all his wealth some town
 evacuating for his sake of those
 ruled by myself and neighb'ring close my own 220
 thus situate we had often interchanged
 sweet converse nor had other cause at last
 our friendship terminated or our joys
 than death's black cloud o'ershadowing him or me
 but such delights could only envy move
 ev'n in the gods who have of all the greeks
 amerc'd _him_ only of his wish'd return
 so saying he kindled the desire to weep
 in ev'ry bosom argive helen wept
 abundant jove's own daughter wept as fast 230
 telemachus and menelaus both
 nor nestor's son with tearless eyes remain'd
 calling to mind antilochus11 by the son12
 illustrious of the bright aurora slain
 rememb'ring whom in accents wing'd he said
 atrides antient nestor when of late
 conversing with him we remember'd thee
 pronounced thee wise beyond all humankind
 now therefore let not even my advice
 displease thee it affords me no delight 240
 to intermingle tears with my repast
 and soon aurora daughter of the dawn
 will tinge the orient not that i account
 due lamentation of a friend deceased
 blameworthy since to sheer the locks and weep
 is all we can for the unhappy dead
 i also have my grief call'd to lament
 one not the meanest of achaia's sons
 my brother him i cannot but suppose
 to thee wellknown although unknown to me 250
 who saw him never13 but report proclaims
 antilochus superior to the most
 in speed superior and in feats of arms
 to whom the hero of the yellow locks
 o friend belov'd since nought which thou hast said
 or recommended now would have disgraced
 a man of years maturer far than thine
 for wise thy father is and such art thou
 and easy is it to discern the son
 of such a father whom saturnian jove 260
 in marriage both and at his birth ordain'd
 to great felicity for he hath giv'n
 to nestor gradually to sink at home
 into old age and while he lives to see
 his sons past others wise and skill'd in arms
 the sorrow into which we sudden fell
 shall pause comenow remember we the feast
 pour water on our hands for we shall find
 telemachus and i no dearth of themes
 for mutual converse when the day shall dawn 270
 he ended then asphalion at his word
 servant of glorious menelaus poured
 pure water on their hands and they the feast
 before them with keen appetite assail'd
 but joveborn helen otherwise meantime
 employ'd into the wine of which they drank
 a drug infused antidote to the pains
 of grief and anger a most potent charm
 for ills of ev'ry name whoe'er his wine
 so medicated drinks he shall not pour 280
 all day the tears down his wan cheek although
 his father and his mother both were dead
 nor even though his brother or his son
 had fall'n in battle and before his eyes
 such drugs jove's daughter own'd with skill prepar'd
 and of prime virtue by the wife of thone
 �gyptian polydamna giv'n her
 for �gypt teems with drugs yielding no few
 which mingled with the drink are good and many
 of baneful juice and enemies to life 290
 there ev'ry man in skill medicinal
 excels for they are sons of p�on all
 that drug infused she bade her servant pour
 the bev'rage forth and thus her speech resumed
 atrides menelaus dear to jove
 these also are the sons of chiefs renown'd
 for jove as pleases him to each assigns
 or good or evil whom all things obey
 now therefore feasting at your ease reclin'd
 listen with pleasure for myself the while 300
 will matter seasonable interpose
 i cannot all rehearse nor even name
 omitting none the conflicts and exploits
 of brave ulysses but with what address
 successful one atchievement he perform'd
 at ilium where achaia's sons endured
 such hardship will i speak inflicting wounds
 dishonourable on himself he took
 a tatter'd garb and like a servingman
 enter'd the spacious city of your foes 310
 so veil'd some mendicant he seem'd although
 no greecian less deserved that name than he
 in such disguise he enter'd all alike
 misdeem'd him me alone he not deceived
 who challeng'd him but shrewd he turn'd away
 at length however when i had myself
 bathed him anointed cloath'd him and had sworn
 not to declare him openly in troy
 till he should reach again the camp and fleet
 he told me the whole purpose of the greeks 320
 then many a trojan slaughter'd he regain'd
 the camp and much intelligence he bore
 to the achaians oh what wailing then
 was heard of trojan women but my heart
 exulted alter'd now and wishing home
 for now my crime committed under force
 of venus' influence i deplored what time
 she led me to a country far remote
 a wand'rer from the matrimonial bed
 from my own child and from my rightful lord 330
 alike unblemish'd both in form and mind
 her answer'd then the hero goldenhair'd
 helen thou hast well spoken all is true
 i have the talents fathom'd and the minds
 of num'rous heroes and have travell'd far
 yet never saw i with these eyes in man
 such firmness as the calm ulysses own'd
 none such as in the wooden horse he proved
 where all our bravest sat designing woe
 and bloody havoc for the sons of troy 340
 thou thither cam'st impell'd as it should seem
 by some divinity inclin'd to give
 victory to our foes and with thee came
 godlike deiphobus thrice round about
 the hollow ambush striking with thy hand
 its sides thou went'st and by his name didst call
 each prince of greece feigning his consort's voice
 myself with diomede and with divine
 ulysses seated in the midst the call
 heard plain and loud we diomede and i 350
 with ardour burn'd either to quit the horse
 so summon'd or to answer from within
 but all impatient as we were ulysses
 controul'd the rash design so there the sons
 of the achaians silent sat and mute
 and of us all anticlus would alone
 have answer'd but ulysses with both hands
 compressing close his lips saved us nor ceased
 till pallas thence conducted thee again
 then thus discrete telemachus replied 360
 atrides menelaus prince renown'd
 hard was his lot whom these rare qualities
 preserved not neither had his dauntless heart
 been iron had he scaped his cruel doom
 but haste dismiss us hence that on our beds
 reposed we may enjoy sleep needful now
 he ceas'd then argive helen gave command
 to her attendant maidens to prepare
 beds in the portico with purple rugs
 resplendent and with arras overspread 370
 and cover'd warm with cloaks of shaggy pile
 forth went the maidens bearing each a torch
 and spread the couches next the herald them
 led forth and in the vestibule the son
 of nestor and the youthful hero slept
 telemachus but in the interior house
 atrides with the loveliest of her sex
 beside him helen of the sweeping stole
 but when aurora daughter of the dawn
 glow'd in the east then from his couch arose 380
 the warlike menelaus fresh attir'd
 his faulchion o'er his shoulders slung he bound
 his sandals fair to his unsullied feet
 and like a god issuing at the side
 sat of telemachus to whom he spake
 hero telemachus what urgent cause
 hath hither led thee to the land farfamed
 of laced�mon o'er the spacious deep
 public concern or private tell me true
 to whom telemachus discrete replied 390
 atrides menelaus prince renown'd
 news seeking of my sire i have arrived
 my household is devour'd my fruitful fields
 are desolated and my palace fill'd
 with enemies who while they mutual wage
 proud competition for my mother's love
 my flocks continual slaughter and my beeves
 for this cause at thy knees suppliant i beg
 that thou wouldst tell me his disastrous end
 if either thou beheld'st with thine own eyes 400
 his death or from some wand'rer of the greeks
 hast heard it for no common woes alas
 was he ordain'd to share ev'n from the womb
 neither through pity or o'erstrain'd respect
 flatter me but explicit all relate
 which thou hast witness'd if my noble sire
 e'er gratified thee by performance just
 of word or deed at ilium where ye fell
 so num'rous slain in fight oh recollect
 now his fidelity and tell me true 410
 then menelaus sighing deep replied
 gods their ambition is to reach the bed
 of a brave man however base themselves
 but as it chances when the hart hath lay'd
 her fawns newyean'd and sucklings yet to rest
 within some dreadful lion's gloomy den
 she roams the hills and in the grassy vales
 feeds heedless till the lion to his lair
 return'd destroys her and her littleones
 so them thy sire shall terribly destroy 420
 jove pallas and apollo oh that such
 as erst in wellbuilt lesbos where he strove
 with philomelides and threw him flat
 a sight at which achaia's sons rejoic'd
 such now ulysses might assail them all
 short life and bitter nuptials should be theirs
 but thy enquiries neither indirect
 will i evade nor give thee false reply
 but all that from the antient of the deep14
 i have receiv'd will utter hiding nought 430
 as yet the gods on �gypt's shore detained
 me wishing home angry at my neglect
 to heap their altars with slain hecatombs
 for they exacted from us evermore
 strict rev'rence of their laws there is an isle
 amid the billowy flood pharos by name
 in front of �gypt distant from her shore
 far as a vessel by a sprightly gale
 impell'd may push her voyage in a day
 the haven there is good and many a ship 440
 finds wat'ring there from riv'lets on the coast
 there me the gods kept twenty days no breeze
 propitious granting that might sweep the waves
 and usher to her home the flying bark
 and now had our provision all consumed
 left us exhausted but a certain nymph
 pitying saved me daughter fair was she
 of mighty proteus antient of the deep
 idothea named her most my sorrows moved
 she found me from my followers all apart 450
 wand'ring for they around the isle with hooks
 the fishes snaring roamed by famine urged
 and standing at my side me thus bespake
 stranger thou must be ideot born or weak
 at least in intellect or thy delight
 is in distress and mis'ry who delay'st
 to leave this island and no egress hence
 canst find although thy famish'd people faint
 so spake the goddess and i thus replied
 i tell thee whosoever of the pow'rs 460
 divine thou art that i am prison'd here
 not willingly but must have doubtless sinn'd
 against the deathless tenants of the skies
 yet say for the immortals all things know
 what god detains me and my course forbids
 hence to my country o'er the fishy deep
 so i to whom the goddess alldivine
 stranger i will inform thee true a seer
 oracular the antient of the deep
 immortal proteus the �gyptian haunts 470
 these shores familiar with all ocean's gulphs
 and neptune's subject he is by report
 my father him if thou art able once
 to seize and bind he will prescribe the course
 with all its measured distances by which
 thou shalt regain secure thy native shores
 he will moreover at thy suit declare
 thou favour'd of the skies what good what ill
 hath in thine house befall'n while absent thou
 thy voyage difficult perform'st and long 480
 she spake and i repliedthyself reveal
 by what effectual bands i may secure
 the antient deity marine lest warn'd
 of my approach he shun me and escape
 hard task for mortal hands to bind a god
 then thus idothea answer'd alldivine
 i will inform thee true soon as the sun
 hath climb'd the middle heav'ns the prophet old
 emerging while the breezy zephyr blows
 and cover'd with the scum of ocean seeks 490
 his spacious cove in which outstretch'd he lies
 the phoc�15 also rising from the waves
 offspring of beauteous halosydna sleep
 around him num'rous and the fishy scent
 exhaling rank of the unfathom'd flood
 thither conducting thee at peep of day
 i will dispose thee in some safe recess
 but from among thy followers thou shalt chuse
 the bravest three in all thy gallant fleet
 and now the artifices understand 500
 of the old prophet of the sea the sum
 of all his phoc� numb'ring duly first
 he will pass through them and when all by fives
 he counted hath will in the midst repose
 content as sleeps the shepherd with his flock
 when ye shall see him stretch'd then call to mind
 that moment all your prowess and prevent
 howe'er he strive impatient his escape
 all changes trying he will take the form
 of ev'ry reptile on the earth will seem 510
 a river now and now devouring fire
 but hold him ye and grasp him still the more
 and when himself shall question you restored
 to his own form in which ye found him first
 reposing then from farther force abstain
 then hero loose the antient of the deep
 and ask him of the gods who checks thy course
 hence to thy country o'er the fishy flood
 so saying she plunged into the billowy waste
 i then in various musings lost my ships 520
 along the seabeach station'd sought again
 and when i reach'd my galley on the shore
 we supp'd and sacred night falling from heav'n
 slept all extended on the oceanside
 but when aurora daughter of the dawn
 look'd rosy forth pensive beside the shore
 i walk'd of ocean frequent to the gods
 praying devout then chose the fittest three
 for bold assault and worthiest of my trust
 meantime the goddess from the bosom wide 530
 of ocean rising brought us thence four skins
 of phoc� and all newly stript a snare
 contriving subtle to deceive her sire
 four cradles in the sand she scoop'd then sat
 expecting us who in due time approach'd
 she lodg'd us side by side and over each
 a raw skin cast horrible to ourselves
 proved that disguise whom the pernicious scent
 of the seanourish'd phoc� sore annoy'd
 for who would lay him down at a whale's side 540
 but she a potent remedy devised
 herself to save us who the nostrils sooth'd
 of each with pure ambrosia thither brought
 odorous which the fishy scent subdued
 all morning patient watchers there we lay
 and now the num'rous phoc� from the deep
 emerging slept along the shore and he
 at noon came also and perceiving there
 his fatted monsters through the flock his course
 took regular and summ'd them with the first 550
 he number'd us suspicion none of fraud
 conceiving then couch'd also we at once
 loudshouting flew on him and in our arms
 constrain'd him fast nor the seaprophet old
 call'd not incontinent his shifts to mind
 first he became a longmaned lion grim
 then dragon panther then a savage boar
 a limpid stream and an o'ershadowing tree
 we persevering held him till at length
 the antient of the deep skill'd as he is 560
 in wiles yet weary question'd me and said
 oh atreus' son by what confed'rate god
 instructed liest thou in wait for me
 to seize and hold me what is thy desire
 so he to whom thus answer i return'd
 old seer thou know'st why fraudful should'st thou ask
 it is because i have been prison'd long
 within this isle whence i have sought in vain
 deliv'rance till my wonted courage fails
 yet say for the immortals all things know 570
 what god detains me and my course forbids
 hence to my country o'er the fishy deep
 so i when thus the old one of the waves
 but thy plain duty16 was to have adored
 jove first in sacrifice and all the gods
 that then embarking by propitious gales
 impell'd thou might'st have reach'd thy country soon
 for thou art doom'd ne'er to behold again
 thy friends thy palace or thy native shores
 till thou have seen once more the hallow'd flood 580
 of �gypt and with hecatombs adored
 devout the deathless tenants of the skies
 then will they speed thee whither thou desir'st
 he ended and my heart broke at his words
 which bade me pass again the gloomy gulph
 to �gypt tedious course and hard to atchieve
 yet though in sorrow whelm'd i thus replied
 old prophet i will all thy will perform
 but tell me and the truth simply reveal
 have the achaians with their ships arrived 590
 all safe whom nestor left and i at troy
 or of the chiefs have any in their barks
 or in their followers' arms found a dire death
 unlook'd for since that city's siege we closed
 i spake when answer thus the god return'd
 atrides why these questions need is none
 that thou should'st all my secrets learn which once
 reveal'd thou would'st not long dryeyed remain
 of those no few have died and many live
 but leaders two alone in their return 600
 have died thou also hast had war to wage
 and one still living roams the boundless sea
 ajax17 surrounded by his galleys died
 him neptune first against the bulky rocks
 the gyr� drove but saved him from the deep
 nor had he perish'd hated as he was
 by pallas but for his own impious boast
 in frenzy utter'd that he would escape
 the billows even in the gods' despight
 neptune that speech vainglorious hearing grasp'd 610
 his trident and the huge gyr�an rock
 smiting indignant dash'd it half away
 part stood and part on which the boaster sat
 when first the brainsick fury seiz'd him fell
 bearing him with it down into the gulphs
 of ocean where he drank the brine and died
 but thy own brother in his barks escaped
 that fate by juno saved yet when at length
 he should have gain'd malea's craggy shore
 then by a sudden tempest caught he flew 620
 with many a groan far o'er the fishy deep
 to the land's utmost point where once his home
 thyestes had but where thyestes' son
 dwelt then �gisthus easy lay his course
 and open thence and as it pleased the gods
 the shifted wind soon bore them to their home
 he high in exultation trod the shore
 that gave him birth kiss'd it and at the sight
 the welcome sight of greece shed many a tear
 yet not unseen he landed for a spy 630
 one whom the shrewd �gisthus had seduced
 by promise of two golden talents mark'd
 his coming from a rock where he had watch'd
 the year complete lest passing unperceived
 the king should reassert his right in arms
 swift flew the spy with tidings to this lord
 and he incontinent this project framed
 insidious twenty men the boldest hearts
 of all the people from the rest he chose
 whom he in ambush placed and others charged 640
 diligent to prepare the festal board
 with horses then and chariots forth he drove
 fullfraught with mischief and conducting home
 the unsuspicious king amid the feast
 slew him as at his crib men slay an ox
 nor of thy brother's train nor of his train
 who slew thy brother one survived but all
 welt'ring in blood together there expired
 he ended and his words beat on my heart
 as they would break it on the sands i sat 650
 weeping nor life nor light desiring more
 but when i had in dust roll'd me and wept
 to full satiety mine ear again
 the oracle of ocean thus address'd
 sit not o son of atreus weeping here
 longer for remedy can none be found
 but quick arising trial make how best
 thou shalt and soonest reach thy home again
 for either him still living thou shalt find
 or ere thou come orestes shall have slain 660
 the traytor and thine eyes shall see his tomb
 he ceas'd and i afflicted as i was
 yet felt my spirit at that word refresh'd
 and in wing'd accents answer thus return'd
 of these i am inform'd but name the third
 who dead or living on the boundless deep
 is still detain'd i dread yet wish to hear
 so i to whom thus proteus in return
 laertes' son the lord of ithaca
 him in an island weeping i beheld 670
 guest of the nymph calypso by constraint
 her guest and from his native land withheld
 by sad necessity for ships welloar'd
 or faithful followers hath he none whose aid
 might speed him safely o'er the spacious flood
 but menelaus dear to jove thy fate
 ordains not thee the stroke of death to meet
 in steedfam'd argos but far hence the gods
 will send thee to elysium and the earth's
 extremest bounds there rhadamanthus dwells 680
 the goldenhair'd and there the human kind
 enjoy the easiest life no snow is there
 no biting winter and no drenching show'r
 but zephyr always gently from the sea
 breathes on them to refresh the happy race
 for that fair helen is by nuptial bands
 thy own and thou art soninlaw of jove
 so saying he plunged into the billowy waste
 i then with my brave comrades to the fleet
 return'd deepmusing as i went and sad 690
 no sooner had i reach'd my ship beside
 the ocean and we all had supp'd than night
 from heav'n fell on us and at ease reposed
 along the margin of the sea we slept
 but when aurora daughter of the dawn
 look'd rosy forth drawing our galleys down
 into the sacred deep we rear'd again
 the mast unfurl'd the sail and to our seats
 on board returning thresh'd the foamy flood
 once more at length within the hallow'd stream 700
 of �gypt mooring on the shore i slew
 whole hecatombs and the displeasure thus
 of the immortal gods appeased i reared
 to agamemnon's neverdying fame
 a tomb and finishing it sail'd again
 with such a gale from heaven vouchsafed as sent
 my ships swiftscudding to the shores of greece
 but comeeleven days wait here or twelve
 a guest with me when i will send thee hence
 nobly and honour'd with illustrious gifts 710
 with polish'd chariot with three princely steeds
 and with a gorgeous cup that to the gods
 libation pouring ever while thou liv'st
 from that same cup thou may'st remember me
 him prudent then answer'd telemachus
 atrides seek not to detain me here
 long time for though contented i could sit
 the year beside thee nor regret my home
 or parents so delightful thy discourse
 sounds in my ear yet even now i know 720
 that my attendants to the pylian shore
 wish my return whom thou thus long detain'st
 what boon soe'er thou giv'st me be it such
 as i may treasur'd keep but horses none
 take i to ithaca them rather far
 keep thou for thy own glory thou art lord
 of an extended plain where copious springs
 the lotus herbage of all savours wheat
 pulse and white barley of luxuriant growth
 but ithaca no level champaign owns 730
 a nursery of goats and yet a land
 fairer than even pastures to the eye
 no seaencircled isle of ours affords
 smooth course commodious and expanse of meads
 but my own ithaca transcends them all
 he said the hero menelaus smiled
 and stroaking tenderly his cheek replied
 dear youth thy speech proclaims thy noble blood
 i can with ease supply thee from within
 with what shall suit thee better and the gift 740
 of all that i possess which most excels
 in beauty and the noblest shall be thine
 i give thee wrought elaborate a cup
 itself all silver bound with lip of gold
 it is the work of vulcan which to me
 the hero ph�dimus imparted king
 of the sidonians when on my return
 his house received me that shall be thy own
 thus they conferr'd and now the busy train
 of menials culinary18 at the gate 750
 enter'd of menelaus chief renown'd
 they brought him sheep with heartennobling wine
 while all their wives their brows with frontlets bound
 came charg'd with bread thus busy they prepared
 a banquet in the mansion of the king
 meantime before ulysses' palace gate
 the suitors sported with the quoit and spear
 on the smooth area customary scene
 of all their strife and angry clamour loud
 there sat antino�s and the godlike youth 760
 eurymachus superior to the rest
 and chiefs among them to whom phronius' son
 no�mon drawing nigh with anxious mien
 question'd antino�s and thus began
 know we antino�s or know we not
 when to expect telemachus at home
 again from pylus in my ship he went
 which now i need that i may cross the sea
 to elis on whose spacious plain i feed
 twelve mares each suckling a mulecolt as yet 770
 unbroken but of which i purpose one
 to ferry thence and break him into use
 he spake whom they astonish'd heard for him
 they deem'd not to nel�ian pylus gone
 but haply into his own fields his flocks
 to visit or the steward of his swine
 then thus eupithes' son antino�s spake
 say true when sail'd he forth of all our youth
 whom chose he for his followers his own train
 of slaves and hirelings hath he pow'r to effect 780
 this also tell me too for i would learn
 took he perforce thy sable bark away
 or gav'st it to him at his first demand
 to whom no�mon phronius' son replied
 i gave it voluntary what could'st thou
 should such a prince petition for thy bark
 in such distress hard were it to refuse
 brave youths our bravest youths except yourselves
 attend him forth and with them i observed
 mentor embarking ruler o'er them all 790
 or if not him a god for such he seem'd
 but this much moves my wonder yestermorn
 i saw at daybreak noble mentor here
 whom shipp'd for pylus i had seen before
 he ceas'd and to his father's house return'd
 they hearing sat aghast their games meantime
 finish'd the suitors on their seats reposed
 to whom eupithes' son antino�s next
 much troubled spake a black storm overcharged
 his bosom and his vivid eyes flash'd fire 800
 ye gods a proud exploit is here atchieved
 this voyage of telemachus by us
 pronounced impracticable yet the boy
 in downright opposition to us all
 hath headlong launched a ship and with a band
 selected from our bravest youth is gone
 he soon will prove more mischievous whose pow'r
 jove wither ere we suffer its effects
 but give me a swift bark with twenty rowers
 that watching his return within the streights 810
 of rocky samos and of ithaca
 i may surprise him so shall he have sail'd
 to seek his sire fatally for himself
 he ceased and loud applause heard in reply
 with warm encouragement then rising all
 into ulysses' house at once they throng'd
 nor was penelope left uninformed
 long time of their clandestine plottings deep
 for herald medon told her all whose ear
 their councils caught while in the outercourt 820
 he stood and they that project framed within
 swift to penelope the tale he bore
 who as he pass'd the gate him thus address'd
 for what cause herald have the suitors sent
 thee foremost wou'd they that my maidens lay
 their tasks aside and dress the board for them
 here end their wooing may they hence depart
 never and may the banquet now prepared
 this banquet prove your last19 who in such throngs
 here meeting waste the patrimony fair 830
 of brave telemachus ye never sure
 when children heard how gracious and how good
 ulysses dwelt among your parents none
 of all his people or in word or deed
 injuring as great princes oft are wont
 by favour influenc'd now now by disgust
 he no man wrong'd at any time but plain
 your wicked purpose in your deeds appears
 who sense have none of benefits conferr'd
 then medon answer'd thus prudent return'd 840
 oh queen may the gods grant this prove the worst
 but greater far and heavier ills than this
 the suitors plan whose counsels jove confound
 their base desire and purpose are to slay
 telemachus on his return for he
 to gather tidings of his sire is gone
 to pylus or to sparta's land divine
 he said and where she stood her trembling knees
 fail'd under her and all her spirits went
 speechless she long remain'd tears filled her eyes 850
 and inarticulate in its passage died
 her utt'rance till at last with pain she spake
 herald why went my son he hath no need
 on board swift ships to ride which are to man
 his steeds that bear him over seas remote
 went he that with himself his very name
 might perish from among mankind for ever
 then answer thus medon the wise return'd
 i know not whether him some god impell'd
 or his own heart to pylus there to hear 860
 news of his sire's return or by what fate
 at least he died if he return no more
 he said and traversing ulysses' courts
 departed she with heart consuming woe
 o'erwhelm'd no longer could endure to take
 repose on any of her num'rous seats
 but on the threshold of her chamberdoor
 lamenting sat while all her female train
 around her moan'd the antient and the young
 whom sobbing thus penelope bespake 870
 hear me ye maidens for of women born
 coeval with me none hath e'er received
 such plenteous sorrow from the gods as i
 who first my noble husband lost endued
 with courage lionlike of all the greeks
 the chief with ev'ry virtue most adorn'd
 a prince allexcellent whose glorious praise
 through hellas and all argos flew diffused
 and now my darling sonhim storms have snatch'd
 far hence inglorious and i knew it not 880
 ah treach'rous servants conscious as ye were
 of his design not one of you the thought
 conceived to wake me when he went on board
 for had but the report once reach'd my ear
 he either had not gone how much soe'er
 he wish'd to leave me or had left me dead
 but haste yebid my antient servant come
 dolion whom when i left my father's house
 he gave me and whose office is to attend
 my num'rous gardenplants that he may seek 890
 at once laertes and may tell him all
 who may contrive some remedy perchance
 or fit expedient and shall come abroad
 to weep before the men who wish to slay
 even the prince godlike ulysses' son
 then thus the gentle euryclea spake
 nurse of telemachus alas my queen
 slay me or spare deal with me as thou wilt
 i will confess the truth i knew it all
 i gave him all that he required from me 900
 both wine and bread and at his bidding swore
 to tell thee nought in twelve whole days to come
 or till enquiry made thou should'st thyself
 learn his departure lest thou should'st impair
 thy lovely features with excess of grief
 but lave thyself and fresh attired ascend
 to thy own chamber there with all thy train
 to worship pallas who shall save thenceforth
 thy son from death what ills soe'er he meet
 add not fresh sorrows to the present woes 910
 of the old king for i believe not yet
 arcesias' race entirely by the gods
 renounced but trust that there shall still be found
 among them who shall dwell in royal state
 and reap the fruits of fertile fields remote
 so saying she hush'd her sorrow and her eyes
 no longer stream'd then bathed and fresh attired
 penelope ascended with her train
 the upper palace and a basket stored
 with hallow'd cakes off'ring to pallas pray'd 920
 hear matchless daughter of jove �gisarm'd
 if ever wise ulysses offer'd here
 the thighs of fatted kine or sheep to thee
 now mindful of his piety preserve
 his darling son and frustrate with a frown
 the cruelty of these imperious guests
 she said and wept aloud whose earnest suit
 pallas received and now the spacious hall
 and gloomy passages with tumult rang
 and clamour of that throng when thus a youth 930
 insolent as his fellows dared to speak
 much woo'd and long the queen at length prepares
 to chuse another mate20 and nought suspects
 the bloody death to which her son is doom'd
 so he but they meantime themselves remain'd
 untaught what course the dread concern elsewhere
 had taken whom antino�s thus address'd
 sirs one and all i counsel you beware
 of such bold boasting unadvised lest one
 o'erhearing you report your words within 940
 norather thus in silence let us move
 to an exploit so pleasant to us all
 he said and twenty chose the bravest there
 with whom he sought the galley on the shore
 which drawing down into the deep they placed
 the mast and sails on board and sitting next
 each oar in order to its proper groove
 unfurl'd and spread their canvas to the gale
 their bold attendants then brought them their arms
 and soon as in deep water they had moor'd 950
 the ship themselves embarking supp'd on board
 and watch'd impatient for the dusk of eve
 but when penelope the palace stairs
 remounting had her upper chamber reach'd
 there unrefresh'd with either food or wine
 she lay'd her down her noble son the theme
 of all her thoughts whether he should escape
 his haughty foes or perish by their hands
 num'rous as are the lion's thoughts who sees
 not without fear a multitude with toils 960
 encircling him around such num'rous thoughts
 her bosom occupied till sleep at length
 invading her she sank in soft repose
 then pallas teeming with a new design
 set forth an airy phantom in the form
 of fair iphthima daughter of the brave
 icarius and eumelus' wedded wife
 in pher� shaped like her the dream she sent
 into the mansion of the godlike chief
 ulysses with kind purpose to abate 970
 the sighs and tears of sad penelope
 ent'ring the chamberportal where the bolt
 secured it at her head the image stood
 and thus in terms compassionate began
 sleep'st thou distress'd penelope the gods
 happy in everlasting rest themselves
 forbid thy sorrows thou shalt yet behold
 thy son again who hath by no offence
 incurr'd at any time the wrath of heav'n
 to whom sweetslumb'ring in the shadowy gate 980
 by which dreams pass penelope replied
 what cause my sister brings thee who art seen
 unfrequent here for that thou dwell'st remote
 and thou enjoin'st me a cessation too
 from sorrows num'rous and which fretting wear
 my heart continual first my spouse i lost
 with courage lionlike endow'd a prince
 allexcellent whose neverdying praise
 through hellas and all argos flew diffused
 and now my only son new to the toils 990
 and hazards of the sea nor less untaught
 the arts of traffic in a ship is gone
 far hence for whose dear cause i sorrow more
 than for his sire himself and even shake
 with terror lest he perish by their hands
 to whom he goes or in the stormy deep
 for num'rous are his foes and all intent
 to slay him ere he reach his home again
 then answer thus the shadowy form return'd
 take courage suffer not excessive dread 1000
 to overwhelm thee such a guide he hath
 and guardian one whom many wish their friend
 and ever at their side knowing her pow'r
 minerva she compassionates thy griefs
 and i am here her harbinger who speak
 as thou hast heard by her own kind command
 then thus penelope the wise replied
 oh if thou art a goddess and hast heard
 a goddess' voice rehearse to me the lot
 of that unhappy one if yet he live 1010
 spectator of the cheerful beams of day
 or if already dead he dwell below
 whom answer'd thus the fleeting shadow vain
 i will not now inform thee if thy lord
 live or live not vain words are best unspoken
 so saying her egress swift beside the bolt
 she made and melted into air upsprang
 from sleep icarius' daughter and her heart
 felt heal'd within her by that dream distinct
 visited in the noiseless night serene 1020
 meantime the suitors urged their wat'ry way
 to instant death devoting in their hearts
 telemachus there is a rocky isle
 in the mid sea samos the rude between
 and ithaca not large named asteris
 it hath commodious havens into which
 a passage clear opens on either side
 and there the ambush'd greeks his coming watch'd

 argument

 mercury bears to calypso a command from jupiter that she dismiss ulysses
 she after some remonstrances promises obedience and furnishes him with
 instruments and materials with which he constructs a raft he quits
 calypso's island is persecuted by neptune with dreadful tempests but by
 the assistance of a sea nymph after having lost his raft is enabled to
 swim to ph�acia


 aurora from beside her glorious mate
 tithonus now arose light to dispense
 through earth and heav'n when the assembled gods
 in council sat o'er whom highthund'ring jove
 presided mightiest of the pow'rs above
 amid them pallas on the num'rous woes
 descanted of ulysses whom she saw
 with grief still prison'd in calypso's isle
 jove father hear me and ye other pow'rs
 who live for ever hear be never king 10
 henceforth to gracious acts inclined humane
 or righteous but let ev'ry sceptred hand
 rule merciless and deal in wrong alone
 since none of all his people whom he sway'd
 with such paternal gentleness and love
 remembers now divine ulysses more
 he in yon distant isle a suff'rer lies
 of hopeless sorrow through constraint the guest
 still of the nymph calypso without means
 or pow'r to reach his native shores again 20
 alike of gallant barks and friends depriv'd
 who might conduct him o'er the spacious deep
 nor is this all but enemies combine
 to slay his son ere yet he can return
 from pylus whither he hath gone to learn
 there or in sparta tidings of his sire
 to whom the cloudassembler god replied
 what word hath pass'd thy lips daughter belov'd
 hast thou not purpos'd that arriving soon
 at home ulysses shall destroy his foes 30
 guide thou telemachus for well thou canst
 that he may reach secure his native coast
 and that the suitors baffled may return
 he ceas'd and thus to hermes spake his son
 hermes for thou art herald of our will
 at all times to yon brighthair'd nymph convey
 our fix'd resolve that brave ulysses thence
 depart uncompanied by god or man
 borne on a corded raft and suff'ring woe
 extreme he on the twentieth day shall reach 40
 not sooner scherie the deepsoil'd possess'd
 by the ph�acians kinsmen of the gods
 they as a god shall reverence the chief
 and in a bark of theirs shall send him thence
 to his own home much treasure brass and gold
 and raiment giving him to an amount
 surpassing all that had he safe return'd
 he should by lot have shared of ilium's spoil
 thus fate appoints ulysses to regain
 his country his own palace and his friends 50
 he ended nor the argicide refused
 messenger of the skies his sandals fair
 ambrosial golden to his feet he bound
 which o'er the moist wave rapid as the wind
 bear him and o'er th' illimitable earth
 then took his rod with which at will all eyes
 he closes soft or opes them wide again
 so arm'd forth flew the valiant argicide
 alighting on pieria down he stoop'd
 to ocean and the billows lightly skimm'd 60
 in form a sewmew such as in the bays
 tremendous of the barren deep her food
 seeking dips oft in brine her ample wing
 in such disguise o'er many a wave he rode
 but reaching now that isle remote forsook
 the azure deep and at the spacious grot
 where dwelt the ambertressed nymph arrived
 found her within a fire on all the hearth
 blazed sprightly and afardiffused the scent
 of smoothsplit cedar and of cypresswood 70
 odorous burning cheer'd the happy isle
 she busied at the loom and plying fast
 her golden shuttle with melodious voice
 sat chaunting there a grove on either side
 alder and poplar and the redolent branch
 widespread of cypress skirted dark the cave
 there many a bird of broadest pinion built
 secure her nest the owl the kite and daw
 longtongued frequenter of the sandy shores
 a gardenvine luxuriant on all sides 80
 mantled the spacious cavern clusterhung
 profuse four fountains of serenest lymph
 their sinuous course pursuing side by side
 stray'd all around and ev'ry where appear'd
 meadows of softest verdure purpled o'er
 with violets it was a scene to fill
 a god from heav'n with wonder and delight
 hermes heav'n's messenger admiring stood
 that sight and having all survey'd at length
 enter'd the grotto nor the lovely nymph 90
 him knew not soon as seen for not unknown
 each to the other the immortals are
 how far soever sep'rate their abodes
 yet found he not within the mighty chief
 ulysses he sat weeping on the shore
 forlorn for there his custom was with groans
 of sad regret t' afflict his breaking heart
 looking continual o'er the barren deep
 then thus calypso nymph divine the god
 question'd from her resplendent throne august 100
 hermes possessor of the potent rod
 who though by me much reverenc'd and belov'd
 so seldom com'st say wherefore comest now
 speak thy desire i grant it if thou ask
 things possible and possible to me
 stay not but ent'ring farther at my board
 due rites of hospitality receive
 so saying the goddess with ambrosial food
 her table cover'd and with rosy juice
 nectareous charged the cup then ate and drank 110
 the argicide and herald of the skies
 and in his soul with that repast divine
 refresh'd his message to the nymph declared
 questionest thou o goddess me a god
 i tell thee truth since such is thy demand
 not willing but by jove constrain'd i come
 for who would voluntary such a breadth
 enormous measure of the salt expanse
 where city none is seen in which the gods
 are served with chosen hecatombs and pray'r 120
 but no divinity may the designs
 elude or controvert of jove supreme
 he saith that here thou hold'st the most distrest
 of all those warriors who nine years assail'd
 the city of priam and that city sack'd
 departed in the tenth but going thence
 offended pallas who with adverse winds
 opposed their voyage and with boist'rous waves
 then perish'd all his gallant friends but him
 billows and storms drove hither jove commands 130
 that thou dismiss him hence without delay
 for fate ordains him not to perish here
 from all his friends remote but he is doom'd
 to see them yet again and to arrive
 at his own palace in his native land
 he said divine calypso at the sound
 shudder'd and in wing'd accents thus replied
 ye are unjust ye gods and envious past
 all others grudging if a goddess take
 a mortal man openly to her arms 140
 so when the rosyfinger'd morning chose
 orion though ye live yourselves at ease
 yet ye all envied her until the chaste
 diana from her golden throne dispatch'd
 a silent shaft which slew him in ortygia
 so when the goldentressed ceres urged
 by passion took i�sion to her arms
 in a thricelabour'd fallow not untaught
 was jove that secret long and hearing it
 indignant slew him with his candent bolt 150
 so also o ye gods ye envy me
 the mortal man my comfort him i saved
 myself while solitary on his keel
 he rode for with his sulph'rous arrow jove
 had cleft his bark amid the sable deep
 then perish'd all his gallant friends but him
 billows and storms drove hither whom i lov'd
 sincere and fondly destin'd to a life
 immortal unobnoxious to decay
 but since no deity may the designs 160
 elude or controvert of jove supreme
 hence with him o'er the barren deep if such
 the sov'reign's will and such his stern command
 but undismiss'd he goes by me who ships
 myself welloar'd and mariners have none
 to send with him athwart the spacious flood
 yet freely readily my best advice
 i will afford him that escaping all
 danger he may regain his native shore
 then hermes thus the messenger of heav'n 170
 act as thou say'st fearing the frown of jove
 lest if provoked he spare not even thee
 so saying the dauntless argicide withdrew
 and she jove's mandate heard allgraceful went
 seeking the brave ulysses on the shore
 she found him seated tears succeeding tears
 delug'd his eyes while hopeless of return
 life's precious hours to eating cares he gave
 continual with the nymph now charm'd no more
 yet cold as she was am'rous still he pass'd 180
 his nights beside her in the hollow grot
 constrain'd and day by day the rocks among
 which lined the shore heartbroken sat and oft
 while wistfully he eyed the barren deep
 wept groaned desponded sigh'd and wept again
 then drawing near thus spake the nymph divine
 unhappy weep not here nor life consume
 in anguish go thou hast my glad consent
 arise to labour hewing down the trunks
 of lofty trees fashion them with the ax 190
 to a broad raft which closely floor'd above
 shall hence convey thee o'er the gloomy deep
 bread water and the red grape's cheering juice
 myself will put on board which shall preserve
 thy life from famine i will also give
 new raiment for thy limbs and will dispatch
 winds after thee to waft thee home unharm'd
 if such the pleasure of the gods who dwell
 in yonder boundless heav'n superior far
 to me in knowledge and in skill to judge 200
 she ceas'd but horror at that sound the heart
 chill'd of ulysses and in accents wing'd
 with wonder thus the noble chief replied
 ah other thoughts than of my safe return
 employ thee goddess now who bid'st me pass
 the perilous gulph of ocean on a raft
 that wild expanse terrible which even ships
 pass not though form'd to cleave their way with ease
 and joyful in propitious winds from jove
 nolet me never in despight of thee 210
 embark on board a raft nor till thou swear
 o goddess the inviolable oath
 that future mischief thou intend'st me none
 he said calypso beauteous goddess smiled
 and while she spake stroaking his cheek replied
 thou dost asperse me rudely and excuse
 of ignorance hast none far better taught
 what words were these how could'st thou thus reply
 now hear me earth and the wide heav'n above
 hear too ye waters of the stygian stream 220
 under the earth by which the blessed gods
 swear trembling and revere the awful oath
 that future mischief i intend thee none
 no my designs concerning thee are such
 as in an exigence resembling thine
 myself most sure should for myself conceive
 i have a mind more equal not of steel
 my heart is form'd but much to pity inclined
 so saying the lovely goddess with swift pace
 led on whose footsteps he as swift pursued 230
 within the vaulted cavern they arrived
 the goddess and the man on the same throne
 ulysses sat whence hermes had aris'n
 and viands of all kinds such as sustain
 the life of mortal man calypso placed
 before him both for bev'rage and for food
 she opposite to the illustrious chief
 reposed by her attendant maidens served
 with nectar and ambrosia they their hands
 stretch'd forth together to the ready feast 240
 and when nor hunger more nor thirst remain'd
 unsated thus the beauteous nymph began
 laertes' noble son for wisdom famed
 and artifice oh canst thou thus resolve
 to seek incontinent thy native shores
 i pardon thee farewell but could'st thou guess
 the woes which fate ordains thee to endure
 ere yet thou reach thy country wellcontent
 here to inhabit thou would'st keep my grot
 and be immortal howsoe'er thy wife 250
 engage thy ev'ry wish day after day
 yet can i not in stature or in form
 myself suspect inferior aught to her
 since competition cannot be between
 mere mortal beauties and a form divine
 to whom ulysses everwise replied
 awful divinity be not incensed
 i know that my penelope in form
 and stature altogether yields to thee
 for she is mortal and immortal thou 260
 from age exempt yet not the less i wish
 my home and languish daily to return
 but should some god amid the sable deep
 dash me again into a wreck my soul
 shall bear _that_ also for by practice taught
 i have learned patience having much endured
 by tempest and in battle both come then
 this evil also i am well prepared
 he ended and the sun sinking resign'd
 the earth to darkness then in a recess 270
 interior of the cavern side by side
 reposed they took their amorous delight
 but when aurora daughter of the dawn
 look'd rosy forth ulysses then in haste
 put on his vest and mantle and the nymph
 her snowy vesture of transparent woof
 graceful redundant to her waist she bound
 her golden zone and veil'd her beauteous head
 then musing plann'd the noble chief's return
 she gave him fitted to the grasp an ax 280
 of iron pond'rous doubleedg'd with haft
 of olivewood inserted firm and wrought
 with curious art then placing in his hand
 a polish'd adze she led herself the way
 to her isles' utmost verge where tallest trees
 but dry long since and sapless stood which best
 might serve his purposes as buoyant most
 the alder poplar and cloudpiercing fir
 to that tall grove she led and left him there
 seeking her grot again then slept not he 290
 but swinging with both hands the ax his task
 soon finish'd trees full twenty to the ground
 he cast which dext'rous with his adze he smooth'd
 the knotted surface chipping by a line
 meantime the lovely goddess to his aid
 sharp augres brought with which he bored the beams
 then side by side placing them fitted each
 to other and with long cramps join'd them all
 broad as an artist skill'd in naval works
 the bottom of a ship of burthen spreads 300
 such breadth ulysses to his raft assign'd
 he deck'd her over with long planks upborne
 on massy beams he made the mast to which
 he added suitable the yardhe framed
 rudder and helm to regulate her course
 with wickerwork he border'd all her length
 for safety and much ballast stow'd within
 meantime calypso brought him for a sail
 fittest materials which he also shaped
 and to his sail due furniture annex'd 310
 of cordage strong footropes and ropes aloft
 then heav'd her down with levers to the deep
 he finish'd all his work on the fourth day
 and on the fifth calypso nymph divine
 dismiss'd him from her isle but laved him first
 and cloath'd him in sweetscented garments new
 two skins the goddess also placed on board
 one charg'd with crimson wine and ampler one
 with water nor a bag with food replete
 forgot nutritious grateful to the taste 320
 nor yet her latest gift a gentle gale
 and manageable which ulysses spread
 exulting all his canvas to receive
 beside the helm he sat steering expert
 nor sleep fell ever on his eyes that watch'd
 intent the pleiads tardy in decline
 bootes and the bear call'd else the wain
 which in his polar prison circling looks
 direct toward orion and alone
 of these sinks never to the briny deep 330
 that star the lovely goddess bade him hold
 continual on his left through all his course
 ten days and sev'n he navigating cleav'd
 the brine and on the eighteenth day at length
 the shadowy mountains of ph�acia's land
 descried where nearest to his course it lay
 like a broad buckler on the waves afloat
 but neptune now returning from the land
 of ethiopia mark'd him on his raft
 skimming the billows from the mountaintops 340
 of distant solyma21 with tenfold wrath
 inflamed that sight he view'd his brows he shook
 and thus within himself indignant spake
 so thennew counsels in the skies it seems
 propitious to ulysses have prevail'd
 since �thiopia hath been my abode
 he sees ph�acia nigh where he must leap
 the bound'ry of his woes but ere that hour
 arrive i will ensure him many a groan
 so saying he grasp'd his trident gather'd dense 350
 the clouds and troubled ocean ev'ry storm
 from ev'ry point he summon'd earth and sea
 darkening and the night fell black from heav'n
 the east the south the heavyblowing west
 and the cold northwind clear assail'd at once
 his raft and heaved on high the billowy flood
 all hope all courage in that moment lost
 the hero thus within himself complain'd
 wretch that i am what destiny at last
 attends me much i fear the goddess' words 360
 all true which threaten'd me with num'rous ills
 on the wide sea ere i should reach my home
 behold them all fulfill'd with what a storm
 jove hangs the heav'ns and agitates the deep
 the winds combined beat on me now i sink
 thrice blest and more than thrice achaia's sons
 at ilium slain for the atrid�' sake
 ah would to heav'n that dying i had felt
 that day the stroke of fate when me the dead
 achilles guarding with a thousand spears 370
 troy's furious host assail'd funereal rites
 i then had shared and praise from ev'ry greek
 whom now the most inglorious death awaits
 while thus he spake a billow on his head
 bursting impetuous whirl'd the raft around
 and dashing from his grasp the helm himself
 plunged far remote then came a sudden gust
 of mingling winds that in the middle snapp'd
 his mast and hurried o'er the waves afar
 both sail and sailyard fell into the flood 380
 long time submerged he lay nor could with ease
 the violence of that dread shock surmount
 or rise to air again so burthensome
 his drench'd apparel proved but at the last
 he rose and rising sputter'd from his lips
 the brine that trickled copious from his brows
 nor harass'd as he was resign'd he yet
 his raft but buffetting the waves aside
 with desp'rate efforts seized it and again
 fast seated on the middle deck escaped 390
 then roll'd the raft at random in the flood
 wallowing unwieldy toss'd from wave to wave
 as when in autumn boreas o'er the plain
 conglomerated thorns before him drives
 they tangled to each other close adhere
 so her the winds drove wild about the deep
 by turns the south consign'd her to be sport
 for the rude northwind and by turns the east
 yielded her to the worrying west a prey
 but cadmus' beauteous daughter ino once 400
 now named leucothea saw him mortal erst
 was she and trod the earth22 but nymph become
 of ocean since in honours shares divine
 she mark'd his anguish and while toss'd he roam'd
 pitied ulysses from the flood in form
 a cormorant she flew and on the raft
 closecorded perching thus the chief address'd
 alas unhappy how hast thou incensed
 so terribly the shaker of the shores
 that he pursues thee with such num'rous ills 410
 sink thee he cannot wish it as he may
 thus do for i account thee not unwise
 thy garments putting off let drive thy raft
 as the winds will then swimming strive to reach
 ph�acia where thy doom is to escape
 take this this ribbon bind beneath thy breast
 celestial texture thenceforth ev'ry fear
 of death dismiss and laying once thy hands
 on the firm continent unbind the zone
 which thou shalt cast far distant from the shore 420
 into the deep turning thy face away
 so saying the goddess gave into his hand
 the wond'rous zone and cormorant in form
 plunging herself into the waves again
 headlong was hidden by the closing flood
 but still ulysses sat perplex'd and thus
 the toilenduring hero reason'd sad
 alas i tremble lest some god design
 t' ensnare me yet bidding me quit the raft
 but let me well beware how i obey 430
 too soon that precept for i saw the land
 of my foretold deliv'rance far remote
 thus therefore will i do for such appears
 my wiser course so long as yet the planks
 mutual adhere continuing on board
 my raft i will endure whatever woes
 but when the waves shall shatter it i will swim
 my sole resource then left while thus he mused
 neptune a billow of enormous bulk
 hollow'd into an overwhelming arch 440
 on high upheaving smote him as the wind
 tempestuous falling on some stubbleheap
 the arid straws dissipates ev'ry way
 so flew the timbers he a single beam
 bestriding oar'd it onward with his feet
 as he had urged an horse his raiment then
 gift of calypso putting off he bound
 his girdle on and prone into the sea
 with widespread palms prepar'd for swimming fell
 shoreshaker neptune noted him he shook 450
 his awful brows and in his heart he said
 thus suff'ring many mis'ries roam the flood
 till thou shalt mingle with a race of men
 heav'n's special favourites yet even there
 fear not that thou shalt feel thy sorrows light
 he said and scourging his bright steeds arrived
 at �g� where his glorious palace stands
 but other thoughts minerva's mind employ'd
 jove's daughter ev'ry wind binding beside
 she lull'd them and enjoin'd them all to sleep 460
 but roused swift boreas and the billows broke
 before ulysses that deliver'd safe
 from a dire death the noble chief might mix
 with maritime ph�acia's sons renown'd
 two nights he wander'd and two days the flood
 tempestuous death expecting ev'ry hour
 but when aurora radianthair'd had brought
 the third day to a close then ceas'd the wind
 and breathless came a calm he nigh at hand
 the shore beheld darting acute his sight 470
 toward it from a billow's tow'ring top
 precious as to his children seems the life
 of some fond father through disease long time
 and pain stretch'd languid on his couch the prey
 of some vindictive pow'r but now at last
 by gracious heav'n to ease and health restored
 so grateful to ulysses' sight appear'd
 forests and hills impatient with his feet
 to press the shore he swam but when within
 such distance as a shout may fly he came 480
 the thunder of the sea against the rocks
 then smote his ear for hoarse the billows roar'd
 on the firm land belch'd horrible abroad
 and the salt spray dimm'd all things to his view
 for neither port for ships nor shelt'ring cove
 was there but the rude coast a headland bluff
 presented rocks and craggy masses huge
 then hope and strength exhausted both deepgroan'd
 the chief and in his noble heart complain'd
 alas though jove hath given me to behold 490
 unhoped the land again and i have pass'd
 furrowing my way these num'rous waves there seems
 no egress from the hoary flood for me
 sharp stones hem in the waters wild the surge
 raves ev'ry where and smooth the rocks arise
 deep also is the shore on which my feet
 no standing gain or chance of safe escape
 what if some billow catch me from the deep
 emerging and against the pointed rocks
 dash me conflicting with its force in vain 500
 but should i swimming trace the coast in search
 of sloping beach haven or shelter'd creek
 i fear lest groaning i be snatch'd again
 by stormy gusts into the fishy deep
 or lest some monster of the flood receive
 command to seize me of the many such
 by the illustrious amphitrite bred
 for that the mighty shaker of the shores
 hates me implacable too well i know
 while such discourse within himself he held 510
 a huge wave heav'd him on the rugged coast
 where flay'd his flesh had been and all his bones
 broken together but for the infused
 good counsel of minerva azureeyed
 with both hands suddenly he seized the rock
 and groaning clench'd it till the billow pass'd
 so baffled he that wave but yet again
 the refluent flood rush'd on him and with force
 resistless dash'd him far into the sea
 as pebbles to the hollow polypus 520
 extracted from his stony bed adhere
 so he the rough rocks clasping stripp'd his hands
 raw and the billows now whelm'd him again
 then had the hapless hero premature
 perish'd but for sagacity inspired
 by pallas azureeyed forth from the waves
 emerging where the surf burst on the rocks
 he coasted looking landward as he swam
 the shore with hope of port or level beach
 but when still swimming to the mouth he came 530
 of a smoothsliding river there he deem'd
 safest th' ascent for it was undeform'd
 by rocks and shelter'd close from ev'ry wind
 he felt the current and thus ardent pray'd
 o hear whate'er thy name sov'reign who rul'st
 this river at whose mouth from all the threats
 of neptune 'scap'd with rapture i arrive
 even the immortal gods the wand'rer's pray'r
 respect and such am i who reach at length
 thy stream and clasp thy knees after long toil 540
 i am thy suppliant oh king pity me
 he said the river god at once repress'd
 his current and it ceas'd smooth he prepared
 the way before ulysses and the land
 vouchsafed him easy at his channel's mouth
 there once again he bent for ease his limbs
 both arms and knees in conflict with the floods
 exhausted swoln his body was all o'er
 and from his mouth and nostrils stream'd the brine
 breathless and speechless and of life well nigh 550
 bereft he lay through dreadful toil immense
 but when revived his dissipated pow'rs
 he recollected loosing from beneath
 his breast the zone divine he cast it far
 into the brackish stream and a huge wave
 returning bore it downward to the sea
 where ino caught it then the river's brink
 abandoning among the rushes prone
 he lay kiss'd oft the soil and sighing said
 ah me what suff'rings must i now sustain 560
 what doom at last awaits me if i watch
 this woeful night here at the river's side
 what hope but that the frost and copious dews
 weak as i am my remnant small of life
 shall quite extinguish and the chilly air
 breath'd from the river at the dawn of day
 but if ascending this declivity
 i gain the woods and in some thicket sleep
 if sleep indeed can find me overtoil'd
 and coldbenumb'd then i have cause to fear 570
 lest i be torn by wild beasts and devour'd
 long time he mused but at the last his course
 bent to the woods which not remote he saw
 from the seabrink conspicuous on a hill
 arrived between two neighbour shrubs he crept
 both olives this the fruitful that the wild

 so thick a roof the ample branches form'd 580
 close interwoven under these the chief
 retiring with industrious hands a bed
 collected broad of leaves which there he found
 abundant strew'd such store as had sufficed
 two travellers or three for cov'ring warm

 that bed with joy the suff'ring chief renown'd
 contemplated and occupying soon
 the middle space hillock'd it high with leaves
 as when some swain hath hidden deep his torch 590
 beneath the embers at the verge extreme
 of all his farm where having neighbours none
 he saves a seed or two of future flame

 the balm of sleep copious that he might taste
 repose again after long toil severe

 argument

 minerva designing an interview between the daughter of alcino�s and
 ulysses admonishes her in a dream to carry down her clothes to the
 river that she may wash them and make them ready for her approaching
 nuptials that task performed the princess and her train amuse
 themselves with play by accident they awake ulysses he comes forth from
 the wood and applies himself with much address to nausicaa who
 compassionating his distressed condition and being much affected by the
 dignity of his appearance interests himself in his favour and conducts
 him to the city


 there then the noble suff'rer lay by sleep
 oppress'd and labour meantime pallas sought
 the populous city of ph�acia's sons
 they in old time in hypereia dwelt
 the spacious neighbours of a giant race
 the haughty cyclops who endued with pow'r
 superior troubled them with frequent wrongs
 godlike nausitho�s then arose who thence
 to scheria led them from all nations versed
 in arts of cultivated life remote 10
 with bulwarks strong their city he enclosed
 built houses for them temples to the gods
 and gave to each a portion of the soil
 but he already by decree of fate
 had journey'd to the shades and in his stead
 alcino�s by the gods instructed reign'd
 to his abode minerva azureeyed
 repair'd neglecting nought which might advance
 magnanimous ulysses' safe return
 she sought the sumptuous chamber where in form 20
 and feature perfect as the gods the young
 nausicaa daughter of the king reposed
 fast by the pillars of the portal lay
 two damsels one on either side adorn'd
 by all the graces and the doors were shut
 soft as a breathing air she stole toward
 the royal virgin's couch and at her head
 standing address'd her daughter she appear'd
 of dymas famed for maritime exploits
 her friend and her coeval so disguised 30
 c�ruleaneyed minerva thus began
 nausicaa wherefore hath thy mother borne
 a child so negligent thy garments share
 thy most magnificent no thought of thine
 yet thou must marry soon and must provide
 robes for thyself and for thy nuptial train
 thy fame on these concerns and honour stand
 these managed well thy parents shall rejoice
 the dawn appearing let us to the place
 of washing where thy workmate i will be 40
 for speedier riddance of thy task since soon
 the days of thy virginity shall end
 for thou art woo'd already by the prime
 of all ph�acia country of thy birth
 come thensolicit at the dawn of day
 thy royal father that he send thee forth
 with mules and carriage for conveyance hence
 of thy best robes thy mantles and thy zones
 thus more commodiously thou shalt perform
 the journey for the cisterns lie remote 50
 so saying minerva goddess azureeyed
 rose to olympus the reputed seat
 eternal of the gods which never storms
 disturb rains drench or snow invades but calm
 the expanse and cloudless shines with purest day
 there the inhabitants divine rejoice
 for ever and her admonition giv'n
 c�ruleaneyed minerva thither flew
 now came aurora brightenthroned whose rays
 awaken'd fair nausicaa she her dream 60
 remember'd wond'ring and her parents sought
 anxious to tell them them she found within
 beside the hearth her royal mother sat
 spinning soft fleeces with seapurple dyed
 among her menial maidens but she met
 her father whom the nobles of the land
 had summon'd issuing abroad to join
 the illustrious chiefs in council at his side
 she stood and thus her filial suit preferr'd
 sir23 wilt thou lend me of the royal wains 70
 a sumptercarriage for i wish to bear
 my costly cloaths but sullied and unfit
 for use at present to the river side
 it is but seemly that thou should'st repair
 thyself to consultation with the chiefs
 of all ph�acia clad in pure attire
 and my own brothers five who dwell at home
 two wedded and the rest of age to wed
 are all desirous when they dance to wear
 raiment new bleach'd all which is my concern 80
 so spake nausicaa for she dared not name
 her own glad nuptials to her father's ear
 who conscious yet of all her drift replied
 i grudge thee neither mules my child nor aught
 that thou canst ask beside go and my train
 shall furnish thee a sumptercarriage forth
 highbuilt strongwheel'd and of capacious size
 so saying he issued his command whom quick
 his grooms obey'd they in the court prepared
 the sumptercarriage and adjoin'd the mules 90
 and now the virgin from her chamber charged
 with raiment came which on the car she placed
 and in the carriagechest meantime the queen
 her mother viands of all kinds disposed
 and fill'd a skin with wine nausicaa rose
 into her seat but ere she went received
 a golden cruse of oil from the queen's hand
 for unction of herself and of her maids
 then seizing scourge and reins she lash'd the mules
 they trampled loud the soil straining to draw 100
 herself with all her vesture nor alone
 she went but follow'd by her virgin train
 at the delightful rivulet arrived
 where those perennial cisterns were prepared
 with purest crystal of the fountain fed
 profuse sufficient for the deepest stains
 loosing the mules they drove them forth to browze
 on the sweet herb beside the dimpled flood
 the carriage next light'ning they bore in hand
 the garments down to the unsullied wave 110
 and thrust them heap'd into the pools their task
 dispatching brisk and with an emulous haste
 when they had all purified and no spot
 could now be seen or blemish more they spread
 the raiment orderly along the beach
 where dashing tides had cleansed the pebbles most
 and laving next and smoothing o'er with oil
 their limbs all seated on the river's bank
 they took repast leaving the garments stretch'd
 in noonday fervour of the sun to dry 120
 their hunger satisfied at once arose
 the mistress and her train and putting off
 their headattire play'd wanton with the ball
 the princess singing to her maids the while
 such as shaftarm'd diana roams the hills
 t�ygetus skycapt or erymanth
 the wild boar chasing or fleetfooted hind
 all joy the rural nymphs daughters of jove
 sport with her and latona's heart exults
 she high her graceful head above the rest 130
 and features lifts divine though all be fair
 with ease distinguishable from them all
 so all her train she virgin pure surpass'd
 but when the hour of her departure thence
 approach'd the mules now yoked again and all
 her elegant apparel folded neat
 minerva azureeyed mused how to wake
 ulysses that he might behold the fair
 virgin his destin'd guide into the town
 the princess then casting the ball toward 140
 a maiden of her train erroneous threw
 and plunged it deep into the dimpling stream
 all shrieked ulysses at the sound awoke
 and sitting meditated thus the cause
 ah me what mortal race inhabit here
 rude are they contumacious and unjust
 or hospitable and who fear the gods
 so shrill the cry and feminine of nymphs
 fills all the air around such as frequent
 the hills clear fountains and herbaceous meads 150
 is this a neighbourhood of men endued
 with voice articulate but what avails
 to ask i will myself go forth and see
 so saying divine ulysses from beneath
 his thicket crept and from the leafy wood
 a spreading branch pluck'd forcibly design'd
 a decent skreen effectual held before
 so forth he went as goes the lion forth
 the mountainlion conscious of his strength
 whom winds have vex'd and rains fire fills his eyes 160
 and whether herds or flocks or woodland deer
 he find he rends them and adust for blood
 abstains not even from the guarded fold
 such sure to seem in virgin eyes the chief
 all naked as he was left his retreat
 reluctant by necessity constrain'd
 him foul with sea foam horrorstruck they view'd
 and o'er the jutting shores fled all dispersed
 nausicaa alone fled not for her
 pallas courageous made and from her limbs 170
 by pow'r divine all tremour took away
 firm she expected him he doubtful stood
 or to implore the lovely maid her knees
 embracing or aloof standing to ask
 in gentle terms discrete the gift of cloaths
 and guidance to the city where she dwelt
 him so deliberating most at length
 this counsel pleas'd in suppliant terms aloof
 to sue to her lest if he clasp'd her knees
 the virgin should that bolder course resent 180
 then gentle thus and welladvised he spake
 oh queen thy earnest suppliant i approach
 art thou some goddess or of mortal race
 for if some goddess and from heaven arrived
 diana then daughter of mighty jove
 i deem thee most for such as hers appear
 thy form thy stature and thy air divine
 but if of mortal race thou dwell below
 thrice happy then thy parents i account
 and happy thrice thy brethren ah the joy 190
 which always for thy sake their bosoms fill
 when thee they view all lovely as thou art
 ent'ring majestic on the graceful dance
 but him beyond all others blest i deem
 the youth who wealthier than his rich compeers
 shall win and lead thee to his honour'd home
 for never with these eyes a mortal form
 beheld i comparable aught to thine
 in man or woman wonderwrapt i gaze
 such erst in delos i beheld a palm 200
 beside the altar of apollo tall
 and growing still for thither too i sail'd
 and num'rous were my followers in a voyage
 ordain'd my ruin and as then i view'd
 that palm long time amazed for never grew
 so strait a shaft so lovely from the ground
 so princess thee with wonder i behold
 charm'd into fixt astonishment by awe
 alone forbidden to embrace thy knees
 for i am one on whom much woe hath fall'n 210
 yesterday i escaped the twentieth day
 of my distress by sea the dreary deep
 for all those days the waves and rapid storms
 bore me along impetuous from the isle
 ogygia till at length the will of heav'n
 cast me that i might also here sustain
 affliction on your shore for rest i think
 is not for me no the immortal gods
 have much to accomplish ere that day arrive
 but oh queen pity me who after long 220
 calamities endured of all who live
 thee first approach nor mortal know beside
 of the inhabitants of all the land
 shew me your city give me although coarse
 some cov'ring if coarse cov'ring _thou_ canst give
 and may the gods thy largest wishes grant
 house husband concord for of all the gifts
 of heav'n more precious none i deem than peace
 'twixt wedded pair and union undissolved
 envy torments their enemies but joy 230
 fills ev'ry virtuous breast and most their own
 to whom nausicaa the fair replied
 since stranger neither base by birth thou seem'st
 nor unintelligent but jove the king
 olympian gives to good and bad alike
 prosperity according to his will
 and grief to thee which thou must patient bear
 now therefore at our land and city arrived
 nor garment thou shalt want nor aught beside
 due to a suppliant guest like thee forlorn 240
 i will both show thee where our city stands
 and who dwell here ph�acia's sons possess
 this land but i am daughter of their king
 the brave alcino�s on whose sway depends
 for strength and wealth the whole ph�acian race
 she said and to her beauteous maidens gave
 instant commandmentmy attendants stay
 why flee ye thus and whither from the sight
 of a mere mortal seems he in your eyes
 some enemy of ours the heart beats not 250
 nor shall it beat hereafter which shall come
 an enemy to the ph�acian shores
 so dear to the immortal gods are we
 remote amid the billowy deep we hold
 our dwelling utmost of all humankind
 and free from mixture with a foreign race
 this man a miserable wand'rer comes
 whom we are bound to cherish for the poor
 and stranger are from jove and trivial gifts
 to such are welcome bring ye therefore food 260
 and wine my maidens for the guest's regale
 and lave him where the stream is shelter'd most
 she spake they stood and by each other's words
 encouraged placed ulysses where the bank
 o'erhung the stream as fair nausicaa bade
 daughter of king alcino�s the renown'd
 apparel also at his side they spread
 mantle and vest and next the limpid oil
 presenting to him in the golden cruse
 exhorted him to bathe in the clear stream 270
 ulysses then the maidens thus bespake
 ye maidens stand apart that i may cleanse
 myself my shoulders from the briny surf
 and give them oil which they have wanted long
 but in your presence i bathe not ashamed
 to show myself uncloath'd to female eyes
 he said they went and to nausicaa told
 his answer then the hero in the stream
 his shoulders laved and loins incrusted rough
 with the salt spray and with his hands the scum 280
 of the wild ocean from his locks express'd
 thus wash'd all over and refresh'd with oil
 he put the garments on nausicaa's gift
 then pallas progeny of jove his form
 dilated more and from his head diffused
 his curling locks like hyacinthine flowers
 as when some artist by minerva made
 and vulcan wise to execute all tasks
 ingenious binding with a golden verge
 bright silver finishes a graceful work 290
 such grace the goddess o'er his ample chest
 copious diffused and o'er his manly brows
 retiring on the beach he sat with grace
 and dignity illumed where viewing him
 the virgin princess with amazement mark'd
 his beauty and her damsels thus bespake
 my whitearm'd maidens listen to my voice
 not hated sure by all above this man
 among ph�acia's godlike sons arrives
 at first i deem'd him of plebeian sort 300
 dishonourable but he now assumes
 a near resemblance to the gods above
 ah would to heaven it were my lot to call
 husband some native of our land like him
 accomplish'd and content to inhabit here
 give him my maidens food and give him wine
 she ended they obedient to her will
 both wine and food dispatchful placed and glad
 before ulysses he rapacious ate
 toilsuff'ring chief and drank for he had lived 310
 from taste of aliment long time estranged
 on other thoughts meantime intent her charge
 of folded vestments neat the princess placed
 within the royal wain then yoked the mules
 and to her seat herself ascending call'd
 ulysses to depart and thus she spake
 up stranger seek the city i will lead
 thy steps toward my royal father's house
 where all ph�acia's nobles thou shalt see
 but thou for i account thee not unwise 320
 this course pursue while through the fields we pass
 and labours of the rural hind so long
 with my attendants follow fast the mules
 and sumptercarriage i will be thy guide
 but once the summit gain'd on which is built
 our city with proud bulwarks fenced around
 and laved on both sides by its pleasant port
 of narrow entrance where our gallant barks
 line all the road each station'd in her place
 and where adjoining close the splendid fane 330
 of neptune stands the forum with huge stones
 from quarries thither drawn constructed strong
 in which the rigging of their barks they keep
 sailcloth and cordage and make smooth their oars
 for bow and quiver the ph�acian race
 heed not but masts and oars and ships wellpoised
 with which exulting they divide the flood
 then cautious i would shun their bitter taunts
 disgustful lest they mock me as i pass
 for of the meaner people some are coarse 340
 in the extreme and it may chance that one
 the basest there seeing us shall exclaim
 what handsome stranger of athletic form
 attends the princess where had she the chance
 to find him we shall see them wedded soon
 either she hath received some vagrant guest
 from distant lands for no land neighbours ours
 or by her pray'rs incessant won some god
 hath left the heav'ns to be for ever hers
 'tis well if she have found by her own search 350
 an husband for herself since she accounts
 the nobles of ph�acia who her hand
 solicit num'rous worthy to be scorn'd
 thus will they speak injurious i should blame
 a virgin guilty of such conduct much
 myself who reckless of her parents' will
 should so familiar with a man consort
 ere celebration of her spousal rites
 but mark me stranger following my advice
 thou shalt the sooner at my father's hands 360
 obtain safe conduct and conveyance home
 sacred to pallas a delightful grove
 of poplars skirts the road which we shall reach
 ere long within that grove a fountain flows
 and meads encircle it my father's farm
 is there and his luxuriant garden plot
 a shout might reach it from the citywalls
 there wait till in the town arrived we gain
 my father's palace and when reason bids
 suppose us there then ent'ring thou the town 370
 ask where alcino�s dwells my valiant sire
 well known is his abode so that with ease
 a child might lead thee to it for in nought
 the other houses of our land the house
 resemble in which dwells the hero king
 alcino�s once within the court received
 pause not but with swift pace advancing seek
 my mother she beside a column sits
 in the hearth's blaze twirling her fleecy threads
 tinged with seapurple bright magnificent 380
 with all her maidens orderly behind
 there also stands my father's throne on which
 seated he drinks and banquets like a god
 pass that then suppliant clasp my mother's knees
 so shalt thou quickly win a glad return
 to thy own home however far remote
 her favour once and her kind aid secured
 thenceforth thou may'st expect thy friends to see
 thy dwelling and thy native soil again
 so saying she with her splendid scourge the mules 390
 lash'd onward they the stream soon left behind
 with even footsteps graceful smote the ground
 but so she ruled them managing with art
 the scourge as not to leave afar although
 following on foot ulysses and her train
 the sun had now declined when in that grove
 renown'd to pallas sacred they arrived
 in which ulysses sat and fervent thus
 sued to the daughter of jove �gisarm'd
 daughter invincible of jove supreme 400
 oh hear me hear me now because when erst
 the mighty shaker of the shores incensed
 toss'd me from wave to wave thou heard'st me not
 grant me among ph�acia's sons to find
 benevolence and pity of my woes
 he spake whose pray'r wellpleas'd the goddess heard
 but rev'rencing the brother of her sire24
 appear'd not to ulysses yet whom he
 pursued with fury to his native shores

 nausicaa returns from the river whom ulysses follows he halts by her
 direction at a small distance from the palace which at a convenient
 time he enters he is well received by alcino�s and his queen and having
 related to them the manner of his being cast on the shore of scheria and
 received from alcino�s the promise of safe conduct home retires to rest


 such pray'r ulysses toilworn chief renown'd
 to pallas made meantime the virgin drawn
 by her stout mules ph�acia's city reach'd
 and at her father's house arrived the car
 stay'd in the vestibule her brothers five
 all godlike youths assembling quick around
 released the mules and bore the raiment in
 meantime to her own chamber she return'd
 where soon as she arrived an antient dame
 eurymedusa by peculiar charge 10
 attendant on that service kindled fire
 searovers her had from epirus brought
 long since and to alcino�s she had fall'n
 by public gift for that he ruled supreme
 ph�acia and as oft as he harangued
 the multitude was rev'renced as a god
 she waited on the fair nausicaa she
 her fuel kindled and her food prepared
 and now ulysses from his seat arose
 to seek the city around whom his guard 20
 benevolent minerva cast a cloud
 lest haply some ph�acian should presume
 t' insult the chief and question whence he came
 but ere he enter'd yet the pleasant town
 minerva azureeyed met him in form
 a blooming maid bearing her pitcher forth
 she stood before him and the noble chief
 ulysses of the goddess thus enquired
 daughter wilt thou direct me to the house
 of brave alcino�s whom this land obeys 30
 for i have here arrived after long toil
 and from a country far remote a guest
 to all who in ph�acia dwell unknown
 to whom the goddess of the azureeyes
 the mansion of thy search stranger revered
 myself will shew thee for not distant dwells
 alcino�s from my father's own abode
 but hush be silenti will lead the way
 mark no man question no man for the sight
 of strangers is unusual here and cold 40
 the welcome by this people shown to such
 they trusting in swift ships by the free grant
 of neptune traverse his wide waters borne
 as if on wings or with the speed of thought
 so spake the goddess and with nimble pace
 led on whose footsteps he as quick pursued
 but still the seamanthrong through whom he pass'd
 perceiv'd him not minerva goddess dread
 that sight forbidding them whose eyes she dimm'd
 with darkness shed miraculous around 50
 her fav'rite chief ulysses wond'ring mark'd
 their port their ships their forum the resort
 of heroes and their battlements sublime
 fenced with sharp stakes around a glorious show
 but when the king's august abode he reach'd
 minerva azureeyed then thus began
 my father thou behold'st the house to which
 thou bad'st me lead thee thou shalt find our chiefs
 and highborn princes banqueting within
 but enter fearing nought for boldest men 60
 speed ever best come whencesoe'er they may
 first thou shalt find the queen known by her name
 areta lineal in descent from those
 who gave alcino�s birth her royal spouse
 neptune begat nausitho�s at the first
 on perib�a loveliest of her sex
 latestborn daughter of eurymedon
 heroic king of the proud giant race
 who losing all his impious people shared
 the same dread fate himself her neptune lov'd 70
 to whom she bore a son the mighty prince
 nausitho�s in his day king of the land
 nausitho�s himself two sons begat
 rhexenor and alcino�s phoebus slew
 rhexenor at his home a bridegroom yet
 who father of no son one daughter left
 areta wedded to alcino�s now
 and whom the sov'reign in such honour holds
 as woman none enjoys of all on earth
 existing subjects of an husband's pow'r 80
 like veneration she from all receives
 unfeign'd from her own children from himself
 alcino�s and from all ph�acia's race
 who gazing on her as she were divine
 shout when she moves in progress through the town
 for she no wisdom wants but sits herself
 arbitress of such contests as arise
 between her fav'rites and decides aright
 her count'nance once and her kind aid secured
 thou may'st thenceforth expect thy friends to see 90
 thy dwelling and thy native soil again
 so pallas spake goddess c�ruleaneyed
 and o'er the untillable and barren deep
 departing scheria left land of delight
 whence reaching marathon and athens next
 she pass'd into erectheus' fair abode
 ulysses then toward the palace moved
 of king alcino�s but immers'd in thought
 stood first and paused ere with his foot he press'd
 the brazen threshold for a light he saw 100
 as of the sun or moon illuming clear
 the palace of ph�acia's mighty king
 walls plated bright with brass on either side
 stretch'd from the portal to th' interior house
 with azure cornice crown'd the doors were gold
 which shut the palace fast silver the posts
 rear'd on a brazen threshold and above
 the lintels silver architraved with gold
 mastiffs in gold and silver lined the approach
 on either side by art celestial framed 110
 of vulcan guardians of alcino�s' gate
 for ever unobnoxious to decay
 sheer from the threshold to the inner house
 fixt thrones the walls through all their length adorn'd
 with mantles overspread of subtlest warp
 transparent work of many a female hand
 on these the princes of ph�acia sat
 holding perpetual feasts while golden youths
 on all the sumptuous altars stood their hands
 with burning torches charged which night by night 120
 shed radiance over all the festive throng
 full fifty female menials serv'd the king
 in household offices the rapid mills
 these turning pulverize the mellow'd grain
 those seated orderly the purple fleece
 wind off or ply the loom restless as leaves
 of lofty poplars fluttering in the breeze
 bright as with oil the newwrought texture shone25
 far as ph�acian mariners all else
 surpass the swift ship urging through the floods 130
 so far in tissuework the women pass
 all others by minerva's self endow'd
 with richest fancy and superior skill
 without the court and to the gates adjoin'd
 a spacious garden lay fenced all around
 secure four acres measuring complete
 there grew luxuriant many a lofty tree
 pomegranate pear the apple blushing bright
 the honied fig and unctuous olive smooth
 those fruits nor winter's cold nor summer's heat 140
 fear ever fail not wither not but hang
 perennial whose unceasing zephyr breathes
 gently on all enlarging these and those
 maturing genial in an endless course
 pears after pears to full dimensions swell
 figs follow figs grapes clust'ring grow again
 where clusters grew and ev'ry apple stript
 the boughs soon tempt the gath'rer as before
 there too wellrooted and of fruit profuse
 his vineyard grows part wideextended basks 150
 in the sun's beams the arid level glows
 in part they gather and in part they tread
 the winepress while before the eye the grapes
 here put their blossom forth there gather fast
 their blackness on the garden's verge extreme
 flow'rs of all hues smile all the year arranged
 with neatest art judicious and amid
 the lovely scene two fountains welling forth
 one visits into ev'ry part diffus'd
 the gardenground the other soft beneath 160
 the threshold steals into the palacecourt
 whence ev'ry citizen his vase supplies
 such were the ample blessings on the house
 of king alcino�s by the gods bestow'd
 ulysses wond'ring stood and when at length
 silent he had the whole fair scene admired
 with rapid step enter'd the royal gate
 the chiefs he found and senators within
 libation pouring to the vigilant spy
 mercurius whom with wine they worshipp'd last 170
 of all the gods and at the hour of rest
 ulysses toilworn hero through the house
 pass'd undelaying by minerva thick
 with darkness circumfus'd till he arrived
 where king alcino�s and areta sat
 around areta's knees his arms he cast
 and in that moment broken clear away
 the cloud all went shed on him from above
 dumb sat the guests seeing the unknown chief
 and wond'ring gazed he thus his suit preferr'd 180
 areta daughter of the godlike prince
 rhexenor suppliant at thy knees i fall
 thy royal spouse imploring and thyself
 after ten thousand toils and these your guests
 to whom heav'n grant felicity and to leave
 their treasures to their babes with all the rights
 and honours by the people's suffrage theirs
 but oh vouchsafe me who have wanted long
 and ardent wish'd my home without delay
 safe conduct to my native shores again 190
 such suit he made and in the ashes sat
 at the hearthside they mute long time remain'd
 till at the last the antient hero spake
 echeneus eldest of ph�acia's sons
 with eloquence beyond the rest endow'd
 rich in traditionary lore and wise
 in all who thus benevolent began
 not honourable to thyself o king
 is such a sight a stranger on the ground
 at the hearthside seated and in the dust 200
 meantime thy guests expecting thy command
 move not thou therefore raising by his hand
 the stranger lead him to a throne and bid
 the heralds mingle wine that we may pour
 to thunderbearing jove the suppliant's friend
 then let the cat'ress for thy guest produce
 supply a supper from the last regale
 soon as those words alcino�s heard the king
 upraising by his hand the prudent chief
 ulysses from the hearth he made him sit 210
 on a bright throne displacing for his sake
 laodamas his son the virtuous youth
 who sat beside him and whom most he lov'd
 and now a maiden charg'd with golden ew'r
 and with an argent laver pouring first
 pure water on his hands supply'd him next
 with a resplendent table which the chaste
 directress of the stores furnish'd with bread
 and dainties remnants of the last regale
 then ate the hero toilinured and drank 220
 and to his herald thus alcino�s spake
 pontono�s mingling wine bear it around
 to ev'ry guest in turn that we may pour
 to thunderbearer jove the stranger's friend
 and guardian of the suppliant's sacred rights
 he said pontono�s as he bade the wine
 mingled delicious and the cups dispensed
 with distribution regular to all
 when each had made libation and had drunk
 sufficient then alcino�s thus began 230
 ph�acian chiefs and senators i speak
 the dictates of my mind therefore attend
 ye all have feastedto your homes and sleep
 we will assemble at the dawn of day
 more senior chiefs that we may entertain
 the stranger here and to the gods perform
 due sacrifice the convoy that he asks
 shall next engage our thoughts that free from pain
 and from vexation by our friendly aid
 he may revisit joyful and with speed 240
 his native shore however far remote
 no inconvenience let him feel or harm
 ere his arrival but arrived thenceforth
 he must endure whatever lot the fates
 spun for him in the moment of his birth
 but should he prove some deity from heav'n
 descended then the immortals have in view
 designs not yet apparent for the gods
 have ever from of old reveal'd themselves
 at our solemnities have on our seats 250
 sat with us evident and shared the feast
 and even if a single traveller
 of the ph�acians meet them all reserve
 they lay aside for with the gods we boast
 as near affinity as do themselves
 the cyclops or the giant race profane26
 to whom ulysses everwise replied
 alcino�s think not so resemblance none
 in figure or in lineaments i bear
 to the immortal tenants of the skies 260
 but to the sons of earth if ye have known
 a man afflicted with a weight of woe
 peculiar let me be with him compared
 woes even passing his could i relate
 and all inflicted on me by the gods
 but let me eat comfortless as i am
 uninterrupted for no call is loud
 as that of hunger in the ears of man
 importunate unreas'nable it constrains
 his notice more than all his woes beside 270
 so i much sorrow feel yet not the less
 hear i the blatant appetite demand
 due sustenance and with a voice that drowns
 e'en all my suff'rings till itself be fill'd
 but expedite ye at the dawn of day
 my safe return into my native land
 after much mis'ry and let life itself
 forsake me may i but once more behold
 all that is mine in my own lofty abode
 he spake whom all applauded and advised 280
 unanimous the guest's conveyance home
 who had so fitly spoken when at length
 all had libation made and were sufficed
 departing to his house each sought repose
 but still ulysses in the hall remain'd
 where godlike king alcino�s at his side
 sat and areta the attendants clear'd
 meantime the board and thus the queen whitearm'd
 marking the vest and mantle which he wore
 and which her maidens and herself had made 290
 in accents wing'd with eager haste began
 stranger the first enquiry shall be mine
 who art and whence from whom receiv'dst thou these
 saidst noti came a wand'rer o'er the deep
 to whom ulysses everwise replied
 oh queen the task were difficult to unfold
 in all its length the story of my woes
 for i have num'rous from the gods receiv'd
 but i will answer thee as best i may
 there is a certain isle ogygia placed 300
 far distant in the deep there dwells by man
 alike unvisited and by the gods
 calypso beauteous nymph but deeply skill'd
 in artifice and terrible in pow'r
 daughter of atlas me alone my fate
 her miserable inmate made when jove
 had riv'n asunder with his candent bolt
 my bark in the midsea there perish'd all
 the valiant partners of my toils and i
 my vessel's keel embracing day and night 310
 with folded arms nine days was borne along
 but on the tenth dark night as pleas'd the gods
 they drove me to ogygia where resides
 calypso beauteous nymph dreadful in pow'r
 she rescued cherish'd fed me and her wish
 was to confer on me immortal life
 exempt for ever from the sap of age
 but me her offer'd boon sway'd not sev'n years
 i there abode continual with my tears
 bedewing ceaseless my ambrosial robes 320
 calypso's gift divine but when at length
 sev'n years elaps'd the circling eighth arrived
 she then herself my quick departure thence
 advised by jove's own mandate overaw'd
 which even her had influenced to a change
 on a wellcorded raft she sent me forth
 with num'rous presents bread she put and wine
 on board and cloath'd me in immortal robes
 she sent before me also a fair wind
 freshblowing but not dang'rous sev'nteen days 330
 i sail'd the flood continual and descried
 on the eighteenth your shadowy mountains tall
 when my exulting heart sprang at the sight
 all wretched as i was and still ordain'd
 to strive with difficulties many and hard
 from adverse neptune he the stormy winds
 exciting opposite my wat'ry way
 impeded and the waves heav'd to a bulk
 immeasurable such as robb'd me soon
 deepgroaning of the raft my only hope 340
 for her the tempest scatter'd and myself
 this ocean measur'd swimming till the winds
 and mighty waters cast me on your shore
 me there emerging the huge waves had dash'd
 full on the land where incommodious most
 the shore presented only roughest rocks
 but leaving it i swam the deep again
 till now at last a river's gentle stream
 receiv'd me by no rocks deform'd and where
 no violent winds the shelter'd bank annoy'd 350
 i flung myself on shore exhausted weak
 needing repose ambrosial night came on
 when from the jovedescended stream withdrawn
 i in a thicket lay'd me down on leaves
 which i had heap'd together and the gods
 o'erwhelm'd my eyelids with a flood of sleep
 there under wither'd leaves forlorn i slept
 all the long night the morning and the noon
 but balmy sleep at the decline of day
 broke from me then your daughter's train i heard 360
 sporting with whom she also sported fair
 and graceful as the gods to her i kneel'd
 she following the dictates of a mind
 ingenuous pass'd in her behaviour all
 which even ye could from an age like hers
 have hoped for youth is ever indiscrete
 she gave me plenteous food with richest wine
 refresh'd my spirit taught me where to bathe
 and cloath'd me as thou seest thus though a prey
 to many sorrows i have told thee truth 370
 to whom alcino�s answer thus return'd
 my daughter's conduct i perceive hath been
 in this erroneous that she led thee not
 hither at once with her attendant train
 for thy first suit was to herself alone
 thus then ulysses wary chief replied
 blame not o hero for so slight a cause
 thy faultless child she bade me follow them
 but i refused by fear and awe restrain'd
 lest thou should'st feel displeasure at that sight 380
 thyself for we are all in ev'ry clime
 suspicious and to worst constructions prone
 so spake ulysses to whom thus the king
 i bear not stranger in my breast an heart
 causeless irascible for at all times
 a temp'rate equanimity is best
 and oh i would to heav'n that being such
 as now thou art and of one mind with me
 thou would'st accept my daughter would'st become
 my soninlaw and dwell contented here 390
 house would i give thee and possessions too
 were such thy choice else if thou chuse it not
 no man in all ph�acia shall by force
 detain thee jupiter himself forbid
 for proof i will appoint thee convoy hence
 tomorrow and while thou by sleep subdued
 shalt on thy bed repose they with their oars
 shall brush the placid flood till thou arrive
 at home or at what place soe'er thou would'st
 though far more distant than euboea lies 400
 remotest isle from us by the report
 of ours who saw it when they thither bore
 goldenhair'd rhadamanthus o'er the deep
 to visit earthborn tityus to that isle
 they went they reach'd it and they brought him thence
 back to ph�acia in one day with ease
 thou also shalt be taught what ships i boast
 unmatch'd in swiftness and how far my crews
 excel upturning with their oars the brine
 he ceas'd ulysses toilinur'd his words 410
 exulting heard and praying thus replied
 eternal father may the king perform
 his whole kind promise grant him in all lands
 a neverdying name and grant to me
 to visit safe my native shores again
 thus they conferr'd and now areta bade
 her fair attendants dress a fleecy couch
 under the portico with purple rugs
 resplendent and with arras spread beneath
 and over all with cloaks of shaggy pile 420
 forth went the maidens bearing each a torch
 and as she bade prepared in haste a couch
 of depth commodious then returning gave
 ulysses welcome summons to repose
 stranger thy couch is spread hence to thy rest
 so theythrice grateful to his soul the thought
 seem'd of repose there slept ulysses then
 on his carv'd couch beneath the portico
 but in the innerhouse alcino�s found
 his place of rest and hers with royal state 430
 prepared the queen his consort at his side

 pope has given no translation of this line in the text of his work but
 has translated it in a note it is variously interpreted by commentators
 the sense which is here given of it is that recommended by eustathius

 26 the scholiast explains the passage thuswe resemble the gods in
 righteousness as much as the cyclops and giants resembled each other in
 impiety but in this sense of it there is something intricate and
 contrary to homer's manner we have seen that they derived themselves
 from neptune which sufficiently justifies the above interpretation




 book viii

 argument

 the ph�acians consult on the subject of ulysses preparation is made for
 his departure antino�s entertains them at his table games follow the
 entertainment demodocus the bard sings first the loves of mars and
 venus then the introduction of the wooden horse into troy ulysses much
 affected by his song is questioned by alcino�s whence and who he is
 and what is the cause of his sorrow


 but when aurora daughter of the dawn
 blush'd in the east then from his bed arose
 the sacred might of the ph�acian king
 then uprose also citywaster chief
 ulysses whom the king alcino�s
 led forth to council at the ships convened
 there side by side on polish'd stones they sat
 frequent meantime minerva in the form
 of king alcino�s' herald ranged the town
 with purpose to accelerate the return 10
 of brave ulysses to his native home
 and thus to ev'ry chief the goddess spake
 ph�acian chiefs and senators away
 haste all to council on the stranger held
 who hath of late beneath alcino�s' roof
 our king arrived a wand'rer o'er the deep
 but in his form majestic as a god
 so saying she roused the people and at once
 the seats of all the senatecourt were fill'd
 with fastassembling throngs no few of whom 20
 had mark'd ulysses with admiring eyes
 then pallas o'er his head and shoulders broad
 diffusing grace celestial his whole form
 dilated and to the statelier height advanced
 that worthier of all rev'rence he might seem
 to the ph�acians and might many a feat
 atchieve with which they should assay his force
 when therefore the assembly now was full
 alcino�s them addressing thus began
 ph�acian chiefs and senators i speak 30
 the dictates of my mind therefore attend
 this guest unknown to me hath wand'ring found
 my palace either from the east arrived
 or from some nation on our western side
 safe conduct home he asks and our consent
 here wishes ratified whose quick return
 be it our part as usual to promote
 for at no time the stranger from what coast
 soe'er who hath resorted to our doors
 hath long complain'd of his detention here 40
 hastedraw ye down into the sacred deep
 a vessel of prime speed and from among
 the people fifty and two youths select
 approved the best then lashing fast the oars
 leave her that at my palace ye may make
 short feast for which myself will all provide
 thus i enjoin the crew but as for those
 of sceptred rank i bid them all alike
 to my own board that here we may regale
 the stranger nobly and let none refuse 50
 call too demodocus the bard divine
 to share my banquet whom the gods have blest
 with pow'rs of song delectable unmatch'd
 by any when his genius once is fired
 he ceas'd and led the way whom follow'd all
 the sceptred senators while to the house
 an herald hasted of the bard divine
 then fifty mariners and two from all
 the rest selected to the coast repair'd
 and from her station on the seabank launched 60
 the galley down into the sacred deep
 they placed the canvas and the mast on board
 arranged the oars unfurl'd the shining sail
 and leaving her in depth of water moor'd
 all sought the palace of alcino�s
 there soon the portico the court the hall
 were fill'd with multitudes of young and old
 for whose regale the mighty monarch slew
 two beeves twelve sheep and twice four fatted brawns
 they slay'd them first then busily their task 70
 administ'ring prepared the joyous feast
 and now the herald came leading with care
 the tuneful bard dear to the muse was he
 who yet appointed him both good and ill
 took from him sight but gave him strains divine
 for him pontono�s in the midst disposed
 an argentstudded throne thrusting it close
 to a tall column where he hung his lyre
 above his head and taught him where it hung
 he set before him next a polish'd board 80
 and basket and a goblet fill'd with wine
 for his own use and at his own command
 then all assail'd at once the ready feast
 and when nor hunger more nor thirst they felt
 then came the muse and roused the bard to sing
 exploits of men renown'd it was a song
 in that day to the highest heav'n extoll'd
 he sang of a dispute kindled between
 the son of peleus and laertes'27 son
 both seated at a feast held to the gods 90
 that contest agamemnon king of men
 between the noblest of achaia's host
 hearing rejoiced for when in pytho erst
 he pass'd the marble threshold to consult
 the oracle of apollo such dispute
 the voice divine had to his ear announced
 for then it was that first the storm of war
 came rolling on ordain'd long time to afflict
 troy and the greecians by the will of jove
 so sang the bard illustrious then his robe 100
 of purple dye with both hands o'er his head
 ulysses drew behind its ample folds
 veiling his face through fear to be observed
 by the ph�acians weeping at the song
 and ever as the bard harmonious ceased
 he wiped his tears and drawing from his brows
 the mantle pour'd libation to the gods
 but when the chiefs for they delighted heard
 those sounds solicited again the bard
 and he renew'd the strain then cov'ring close 110
 his count'nance as before ulysses wept
 thus unperceiv'd by all the hero mourn'd
 save by alcino�s he alone his tears
 beside him seated mark'd and his deep sighs
 o'erhearing the ph�acians thus bespake
 ph�acia's chiefs and senators attend
 we have regaled sufficient and the harp
 heard to satiety companion sweet
 and seasonable of the festive hour
 now go we forth for honourable proof 120
 of our address in games of ev'ry kind
 that this our guest may to his friends report
 at home arriv'd that none like us have learn'd
 to leap to box to wrestle and to run
 so saying he led them forth whose steps the guests
 all follow'd and the herald hanging high
 the sprightly lyre took by his hand the bard
 demodocus whom he the selfsame way
 conducted forth by which the chiefs had gone
 themselves for that great spectacle prepared 130
 they sought the forum countless swarm'd the throng
 behind them as they went and many a youth
 strong and courageous to the strife arose
 upstood acroneus and ocyalus
 elatreus nauteus prymneus after whom
 anchialus with anabeesineus
 arose eretmeus ponteus proreus bold
 amphialus and th�on then arose
 in aspect dread as homicidal mars
 euryalus and for his graceful form 140
 after laodamas distinguish'd most
 of all ph�acia's sons naubolides
 three also from alcino�s sprung arose
 laodamas his eldest halius next
 his secondborn and godlike clytoneus
 of these some started for the runner's prize
 they gave the race its limits28 all at once
 along the dusty champaign swift they flew
 but clytoneus illustrious youth outstripp'd
 all competition far as mules surpass 150
 slow oxen furrowing the fallow ground
 so far before all others he arrived
 victorious where the throng'd spectators stood
 some tried the wrestler's toil severe in which
 euryalus superior proved to all
 in the long leap amphialus prevail'd
 elatreus most successful hurled the quoit
 and at the cestus29 last the noble son
 of scheria's king laodamas excell'd
 when thus with contemplation of the games 160
 all had been gratified alcino�s' son
 laodamas arising then address'd
 friends ask we now the stranger if he boast
 proficiency in aught his figure seems
 not ill in thighs and legs and arms he shews
 much strength and in his brawny neck nor youth
 hath left him yet though batter'd he appears
 with num'rous troubles and misfortuneflaw'd
 nor know i hardships in the world so sure
 to break the strongest down as those by sea 170
 then answer thus euryalus return'd
 thou hast well said laodamas thyself
 approaching speak to him and call him forth
 which when alcino�s' noble offspring heard
 advancing from his seat amid them all
 he stood and to ulysses thus began
 stand forth oh guest thou also prove thy skill
 if any such thou hast in games like ours
 which likeliest thou hast learn'd for greater praise
 hath no man while he lives than that he know 180
 his feet to exercise and hands aright
 come then make trial scatter wide thy cares
 we will not hold thee long the ship is launch'd
 already and the crew stand all prepared
 to whom replied the wily chief renown'd
 wherefore as in derision have ye call'd
 me forth laodamas to these exploits
 no games have i but many a grief at heart
 and with far other struggles worn here sit
 desirous only of conveyance home 190
 for which both king and people i implore
 then him euryalus aloud reproach'd
 i well believ'd it friend in thee the guise
 i see not of a man expert in feats
 athletic of which various are perform'd
 in ev'ry land thou rather seem'st with ships
 familiar one accustom'd to controul
 some crew of trading mariners welllearn'd
 in stowage pilotage and wealth acquired
 by rapine but of no gymnastic pow'rs 200
 to whom ulysses frowning dark replied
 thou hast ill spoken sir and like a man
 regardless whom he wrongs therefore the gods
 give not endowments graceful in each kind
 of body mind and utt'rance all to one
 this man in figure less excels yet jove
 crowns him with eloquence his hearers charm'd
 behold him while with modest confidence
 he bears the prize of fluent speech from all
 and in the streets is gazed on as a god 210
 another in his form the pow'rs above
 resembles but no grace around his words
 twines itself elegant so thou in form
 hast excellence to boast a god employ'd
 to make a masterpiece in human shape
 could but produce proportions such as thine
 yet hast thou an untutor'd intellect
 thou much hast moved me thy unhandsome phrase
 hath roused my wrath i am not as thou say'st
 a novice in these sports but took the lead 220
 in all while youth and strength were on my side
 but i am now in bands of sorrow held
 and of misfortune having much endured
 in war and buffeting the boist'rous waves
 yet though with mis'ry worn i will essay
 my strength among you for thy words had teeth
 whose bite hath pinch'd and pain'd me to the proof
 he said and mantled as he was a quoit
 upstarting seized in bulk and weight all those
 transcending far by the ph�acians used 230
 swiftly he swung and from his vig'rous hand
 sent it loud sang the stone and as it flew
 the maritime ph�acians low inclined
 their heads beneath it over all the marks
 and far beyond them sped the flying rock
 minerva in a human form the cast
 prodigious measur'd and aloud exclaim'd
 stranger the blind himself might with his hands
 feel out the 'vantage here thy quoit disdains
 fellowship with a crowd borne far beyond 240
 fear not a losing game ph�acian none
 will reach thy measure much less overcast
 she ceased ulysses hardy chief rejoiced
 that in the circus he had found a judge
 so favorable and with brisker tone
 as less in wrath the multitude address'd
 young men reach this and i will quickly heave
 another such or yet a heavier quoit
 then come the man whose courage prompts him forth
 to box to wrestle with me or to run 250
 for ye have chafed me much and i decline
 no strife with any here but challenge all
 ph�acia save laodamas alone
 he is mine host who combats with his friend
 to call to proof of hardiment the man
 who entertains him in a foreign land
 would but evince the challenger a fool
 who so would cripple his own interest there
 as for the rest i none refuse scorn none
 but wish for trial of you and to match 260
 in opposition fair my force with yours
 there is no game athletic in the use
 of all mankind too difficult for me
 i handle well the polish'd bow and first
 amid a thousand foes strike whom i mark
 although a throng of warriors at my side
 imbattled speed their shafts at the same time
 of all achaia's sons who erst at troy
 drew bow the sole who bore the prize from me
 was philoctetes i resign it else 270
 to none now nourish'd with the fruits of earth
 yet mean i no comparison of myself
 with men of antient times with hercules
 or with oechalian eurytus who both
 the gods themselves in archery defied
 soon therefore died huge eurytus ere yet
 old age he reach'd him angry to be call'd
 to proof of archership apollo slew
 but if ye name the spear mine flies a length
 by no man's arrow reach'd i fear no foil 280
 from the ph�acians save in speed alone
 for i have suffer'd hardships dash'd and drench'd
 by many a wave nor had i food on board
 at all times therefore i am much unstrung
 he spake and silent the ph�acians sat
 of whom alone alcino�s thus replied
 since stranger not ungraceful is thy speech
 who hast but vindicated in our ears
 thy question'd prowess angry that this youth
 reproach'd thee in the presence of us all 290
 that no man qualified to give his voice
 in public might affront thy courage more
 now mark me therefore that in time to come
 while feasting with thy children and thy spouse
 thou may'st inform the heroes of thy land
 even of our proficiency in arts
 by jove enjoin'd us in our father's days
 we boast not much the boxer's skill nor yet
 the wrestler's but lightfooted in the race
 are we and navigators wellinform'd 300
 our pleasures are the feast the harp the dance
 garments for change the tepid bath the bed
 come ye ph�acians beyond others skill'd
 to tread the circus with harmonious steps
 come play before us that our guest arrived
 in his own country may inform his friends
 how far in seamanship we all excel
 in running in the dance and in the song
 haste bring ye to demodocus his lyre
 cleartoned left somewhere in our hall at home 310
 so spake the godlike king at whose command
 the herald to the palace quick return'd
 to seek the charming lyre meantime arose
 nine arbiters appointed to intend
 the whole arrangement of the public games
 to smooth the circus floor and give the ring
 its compass widening the attentive throng
 ere long the herald came bearing the harp
 with which demodocus supplied advanced
 into the middle area around whom 320
 stood blooming youths all skilful in the dance
 with footsteps justly timed all smote at once
 the sacred floor ulysses wonderfixt
 the ceaseless play of twinkling30 feet admired
 then tuning his sweet chords demodocus
 a jocund strain began his theme the loves
 of mars and cytherea chapletcrown'd
 how first clandestine they embraced beneath
 the roof of vulcan her by many a gift
 seduced mars won and with adult'rous lust 330
 the bed dishonour'd of the king of fire
 the sun a witness of their amorous sport
 bore swift the tale to vulcan he apprized
 of that foul deed at once his smithy sought
 in secret darkness of his inmost soul
 contriving vengeance to the stock he heav'd
 his anvil huge on which he forged a snare
 of bands indissoluble by no art
 to be untied durance for ever firm
 the net prepared he bore it fierywroth 340
 to his own chamber and his nuptial couch
 where stretching them from post to post he wrapp'd
 with those fine meshes all his bed around
 and hung them num'rous from the roof diffused
 like spiders' filaments which not the gods
 themselves could see so subtle were the toils
 when thus he had encircled all his bed
 on ev'ry side he feign'd a journey thence
 to lemnos of all cities that adorn
 the earth the city that he favours most 350
 nor kept the god of the resplendent reins
 mars drowsy watch but seeing that the famed
 artificer of heav'n had left his home
 flew to the house of vulcan hot to enjoy
 the goddess with the wreathencircled brows
 she newly from her potent sire return'd
 the son of saturn sat mars ent'ring seiz'd
 her hand hung on it and thus urg'd his suit
 to bed my fair and let us love for lo
 thine husband is from home to lemnos gone 360
 and to the sintians men of barb'rous speech
 he spake nor she was loth but bedward too
 like him inclined so then to bed they went
 and as they lay'd them down down stream'd the net
 around them labour exquisite of hands
 by ingenuity divine inform'd
 small room they found so prison'd not a limb
 could either lift or move but felt at once
 entanglement from which was no escape
 and now the glorious artist ere he yet 370
 had reach'd the lemnian isle limping return'd
 from his feign'd journey for his spy the sun
 had told him all with aching heart he sought
 his home and standing in the vestibule
 frantic with indignation roar'd to heav'n
 and roar'd again summoning all the gods
 oh jove and all ye pow'rs for ever blest
 here hither look that ye may view a sight
 ludicrous yet too monstrous to be borne
 how venus always with dishonour loads 380
 her cripple spouse doating on fiery mars
 and wherefore for that he is fair in form
 and sound of foot i ricketboned and weak
 whose fault is this their fault and theirs alone
 who gave me being illemploy'd were they
 begetting me one better far unborn
 see where they couch together on my bed
 lascivious ah sight hateful to my eyes
 yet cooler wishes will they feel i ween
 to press my bed hereafter here to sleep 390
 will little please them fondly as they love
 but these my toils and tangles will suffice
 to hold them here till jove shall yield me back
 complete the sum of all my nuptial gifts
 paid to him for the shameless strumpet's sake
 his daughter as incontinent as fair
 he said and in the brazenfloor'd abode
 of jove the gods assembled neptune came
 earthcircling pow'r came hermes friend of man
 and regent of the farcommanding bow 400
 apollo also came but chaste reserve
 bashful kept all the goddesses at home
 the gods by whose beneficence all live
 stood in the portal infinite arose
 the laugh of heav'n all looking down intent
 on that shrewd project of the smith divine
 and turning to each other thus they said
 bad works speed ill the slow o'ertakes the swift
 so vulcan tardy as he is by craft
 hath outstript mars although the fleetest far 410
 of all who dwell in heav'n and the lightheel'd
 must pay the adult'rer's forfeit to the lame
 so spake the pow'rs immortal then the king
 of radiant shafts thus question'd mercury
 jove's son heaven's herald hermes bounteous god
 would'st _thou_ such stricture close of bands endure
 for golden venus lying at thy side
 whom answer'd thus the messenger of heav'n
 archer divine yea and with all my heart
 and be the bands which wind us round about 420
 thrice these innumerable and let all
 the gods and goddesses in heav'n look on
 so i may clasp vulcan's fair spouse the while
 he spake then laugh'd the immortal pow'rs again
 but not so neptune he with earnest suit
 the glorious artist urged to the release
 of mars and thus in accents wing'd he said
 loose him accept my promise he shall pay
 full recompense in presence of us all
 then thus the limping smith farfamed replied 430
 earthcircler neptune spare me that request
 lame suitor lame security31 what bands
 could i devise for thee among the gods
 should mars emancipated once escape
 leaving both debt and durance far behind
 him answer'd then the shaker of the shores
 i tell thee vulcan that if mars by flight
 shun payment i will pay myself the fine
 to whom the glorious artist of the skies
 thou must not canst not shalt not be refused 440
 so saying the might of vulcan loos'd the snare
 and they detain'd by those coercive bands
 no longer from the couch upstarting flew
 mars into thrace and to her paphian home
 the queen of smiles where deep in myrtle groves
 her incensebreathing altar stands embow'r'd
 her there the graces laved and oils diffused
 o'er all her form ambrosial such as add
 fresh beauty to the gods for ever young
 and cloath'd her in the loveliest robes of heav'n 450
 such was the theme of the illustrious bard
 ulysses with delight that song and all
 the maritime ph�acian concourse heard
 alcino�s then for in the dance they pass'd
 all others call'd his sons to dance alone
 halius and laodamas they gave
 the purple ball into their hands the work
 exact of polybus one resupine
 upcast it high toward the dusky clouds
 the other springing into air with ease 460
 received it ere he sank to earth again
 when thus they oft had sported with the ball
 thrown upward next with nimble interchange
 they pass'd it to each other many a time
 footing the plain while ev'ry youth of all
 the circus clapp'd his hands and from beneath
 the din of stamping feet fill'd all the air
 then turning to alcino�s thus the wise
 ulysses spake alcino�s mighty king
 illustrious above all ph�acia's sons 470
 incomparable are ye in the dance
 ev'n as thou said'st amazementfixt i stand
 so he whom hearing the imperial might
 exulted of alcino�s and aloud
 to his oarskill'd ph�acians thus he spake
 ph�acian chiefs and senators attend
 wisdom beyond the common stint i mark
 in this our guest good cause in my account
 for which we should present him with a pledge
 of hospitality and love the chiefs 480
 are twelve who highest in command controul
 the people and the thirteenth chief am i
 bring each a golden talent with a vest
 wellbleach'd and tunic gratified with these
 the stranger to our banquet shall repair
 exulting bring them all without delay
 and let euryalus by word and gift
 appease him for his speech was unadvised
 he ceas'd whom all applauded and at once
 each sent his herald forth to bring the gifts 490
 when thus euryalus his sire address'd
 alcino�s o'er ph�acia's sons supreme
 i will appease our guest as thou command'st
 this sword shall be his own the blade all steel
 the hilt of silver and the unsullied sheath
 of iv'ry recent from the carver's hand
 a gift like this he shall not need despise
 so saying his silverstudded sword he gave
 into his grasp and courteous thus began
 hail honour'd stranger and if word of mine 500
 have harm'd thee rashly spoken let the winds
 bear all remembrance of it swift away
 may the gods give thee to behold again
 thy wife and to attain thy native shore
 whence absent long thou hast so much endured
 to whom ulysses everwise replied
 hail also thou and may the gods my friend
 grant thee felicity and may never want
 of this thy sword touch thee in time to come
 by whose kind phrase appeas'd my wrath subsides 510
 he ended and athwart his shoulders threw
 the weapon bright emboss'd now sank the sun
 and those rich gifts arrived which to the house
 of king alcino�s the heralds bore
 alcino�s' sons receiv'd them and beside
 their royal mother placed the precious charge
 the king then led the way at whose abode
 arrived again they press'd their lofty thrones
 and to areta thus the monarch spake
 haste bring a coffer bring thy best and store 520
 a mantle and a sumptuous vest within
 warm for him next a brazen bath by which
 refresh'd and viewing in fair order placed
 the noble gifts by the ph�acian lords
 conferr'd on him he may the more enjoy
 our banquet and the bard's harmonious song
 i give him also this my golden cup
 splendid elaborate that while he lives
 what time he pours libation forth to jove
 and all the gods he may remember me 530
 he ended at whose words areta bade
 her maidens with dispatch place o'er the fire
 a tripod amplewomb'd obedient they
 advanced a laver to the glowing hearth
 water infused and kindled wood beneath
 the flames encircling bright the bellied vase
 warm'd soon the flood within meantime the queen
 producing from her chamberstores a chest
 allelegant within it placed the gold
 and raiment gifts of the ph�acian chiefs 540
 with her own gifts the mantle and the vest
 and in wing'd accents to ulysses said
 now take thyself the coffer's lid in charge
 girdle it quickly with a cord lest loss
 befall thee on thy way while thou perchance
 shalt sleep secure on board the sable bark
 which when ulysses heard hero renown'd
 adjusting close the lid he cast a cord
 around it which with many a mazy knot
 he tied by circe taught him long before 550
 and now the mistress of the household charge
 summon'd him to his bath glad he beheld
 the steaming vase uncustom'd to its use
 e'er since his voyage from the isle of fair
 calypso although while a guest with her
 ever familiar with it as a god
 laved by attendant damsels and with oil
 refresh'd he put his sumptuous tunic on
 and mantle and proceeding from the bath
 to the symposium join'd the num'rous guests 560
 but as he pass'd the princess all divine
 beside the pillars of the portal lost
 in admiration of his graceful form
 stood and in accents wing'd him thus address'd
 hail stranger at thy native home arrived
 remember me thy first deliv'rer here
 to whom ulysses everwise replied
 nausicaa daughter of the noble king
 alcino�s so may jove highthund'ring mate
 of juno grant me to behold again 570
 my native land and my delightful home
 as even there i will present my vows
 to thee adoring thee as i adore
 the gods themselves virgin by whom i live
 he said and on his throne beside the king
 alcino�s sat and now they portion'd out
 the feast to all and charg'd the cups with wine
 and introducing by his hand the bard
 ph�acia's glory at the column's side
 the herald placed demodocus again 580
 then carving forth a portion from the loins
 of a huge brawn of which uneaten still
 large part and delicate remain'd thus spake
 ulyssesherald bear it to the bard
 for his regale whom i will soon embrace
 in spite of sorrow for respect is due
 and veneration to the sacred bard
 from all mankind for that the muse inspires
 herself his song and loves the tuneful tribe
 he ended and the herald bore his charge 590
 to the old hero who with joy received
 that meed of honour at the bearer's hand
 then all at once assail'd the ready feast
 and hunger now and thirst both satisfied
 thus to demodocus ulysses spake
 demodocus i give thee praise above
 all mortals for that either thee the muse
 jove's daughter teaches or the king himself
 apollo since thou so record'st the fate
 with such clear method of achaia's host 600
 their deeds heroic and their num'rous toils
 as thou hadst present been thyself or learnt
 from others present there the glorious tale
 come then proceed that rare invention sing
 the horse of wood which by minerva's aid
 epeus framed and which ulysses erst
 convey'd into the citadel of troy
 with warriors fill'd who lay'd all ilium waste
 these things rehearse regular and myself
 will instant publish in the ears of all 610
 thy fame reporting thee a bard to whom
 apollo free imparts celestial song
 he ended then apollo with full force
 rush'd on demodocus and he began
 what time the greeks first firing their own camp
 steer'd all their galleys from the shore of troy
 already in the horse conceal'd his band
 around ulysses sat for ilium's sons
 themselves had drawn it to the citadel
 and there the mischief stood then strife arose 620
 among the trojans compassing the horse
 and threefold was the doubt whether to cleave
 the hollow trunk asunder or updrawn
 aloft to cast it headlong from the rocks
 or to permit the enormous image kept
 entire to stand an off'ring to the gods
 which was their destined course for fate had fix'd
 their ruin sure when once they had received
 within their walls that engine huge in which
 sat all the bravest greecians with the fate 630
 of ilium charged and slaughter of her sons
 he sang how from the horse effused the greeks
 left their capacious ambush and the town
 made desolate to others in his song
 he gave the praise of wasting all beside
 but told how fierce as mars ulysses join'd
 with godlike menelaus to the house
 flew of deiphobus him there engaged
 in direst fight he sang and through the aid
 of glorious pallas conqu'ror over all 640
 so sang the bard illustrious at whose song
 ulysses melted and tear after tear
 fell on his cheeks as when a woman weeps
 her husband who hath fallen in defence
 of his own city and his babes before
 the gates she sinking folds him in her arms
 and gazing on him as he pants and dies
 shrieks at the sight meantime the enemy
 smiting her shoulders with the spear to toil
 command her and to bondage far away 650
 and her cheek fades with horror at the sound
 ulysses so from his moist lids let fall
 the frequent tear unnoticed by the rest
 those drops but not by king alcino�s fell
 who seated at his side his heavy sighs
 remark'd and the ph�acians thus bespake
 ph�acian chiefs and senators attend
 now let demodocus enjoin his harp
 silence for not alike grateful to all
 his music sounds during our feast and since 660
 the bard divine began continual flow
 the stranger's sorrows by remembrance caused
 of some great woe which wraps his soul around
 then let the bard suspend his song that all
 as most befits th' occasion may rejoice
 both guest and hosts together since we make
 this voyage and these gifts confer in proof
 of hospitality and unfeign'd love
 judging with all wise men the strangerguest
 and suppliant worthy of a brother's place 670
 and thou conceal not artfully reserv'd
 what i shall ask far better plain declared
 than smother'd close who art thou speak thy name
 the name by which thy father mother friends
 and fellowcitizens with all who dwell
 around thy native city in times past
 have known thee for of all things human none
 lives altogether nameless whether good
 or whether bad but ev'ry man receives
 ev'n in the moment of his birth a name 680
 thy country people city tell the mark
 at which my ships intelligent shall aim
 that they may bear thee thither for our ships
 no pilot need or helm as ships are wont
 but know themselves our purpose know beside
 all cities and all fruitful regions well
 of all the earth and with dark clouds involv'd
 plough rapid the rough deep fearless of harm
 whate'er betide and of disast'rous wreck
 yet thus long since my father i have heard 690
 nausitho�s speaking neptune he would say
 is angry with us for that safe we bear
 strangers of ev'ry nation to their home
 and he foretold a time when he would smite
 in vengeance some ph�acian gallant bark
 returning after convoy of her charge
 and fix her in the sable flood transform'd
 into a mountain right before the town
 so spake my hoary sire which let the god
 at his own pleasure do or leave undone 700
 but tell me truth and plainly where have been
 thy wand'rings in what regions of the earth
 hast thou arrived what nations hast thou seen
 what cities say how many hast thou found
 harsh savage and unjust how many kind
 to strangers and disposed to fear the gods
 say also from what secret grief of heart
 thy sorrows flow oft as thou hear'st the fate
 of the achaians or of ilium sung
 that fate the gods prepared they spin the thread 710
 of man's destruction that in after days
 the bard may make the sad event his theme
 perish'd thy father or thy brother there
 or hast thou at the siege of ilium lost
 fatherinlaw or soninlaw for such
 are next and dearest to us after those
 who share our own descent or was the dead
 thy bosomfriend whose heart was as thy own
 for worthy as a brother of our love
 the constant friend and the discrete i deem 720

 book ix

 argument

 ulysses discovers himself to the ph�acians and begins the history of his
 adventures he destroys ismarus city of the ciconians arrives among the
 lotophagi and afterwards at the land of the cyclops he is imprisoned by
 polypheme in his cave who devours six of his companions intoxicates the
 monster with wine blinds him while he sleeps and escapes from him


 then answer thus ulysses wise return'd
 alcino�s king illustrious above all
 ph�acia's sons pleasant it is to hear
 a bard like this sweet as the gods in song
 the world in my account no sight affords
 more gratifying than a people blest
 with cheerfulness and peace a palace throng'd
 with guests in order ranged list'ning to sounds
 melodious and the steaming tables spread
 with plenteous viands while the cups with wine 10
 from brimming beakers fill'd pass brisk around
 no lovelier sight know i but thou it seems
 thy thoughts hast turn'd to ask me whence my groans
 and tears that i may sorrow still the more
 what first what next what last shall i rehearse
 on whom the gods have show'r'd such various woes
 learn first my name that even in this land
 remote i may be known and that escaped
 from all adversity i may requite
 hereafter this your hospitable care 20
 at my own home however distant hence
 i am ulysses fear'd in all the earth
 for subtlest wisdom and renown'd to heaven
 the offspring of laertes my abode
 is sunburnt ithaca there waving stands
 the mountain neritus his num'rous boughs
 and it is neighbour'd close by clust'ring isles
 all populous thence samos is beheld
 dulichium and zacynthus forestclad
 flat on the deep she lies farthest removed 30
 toward the west while situate apart
 her sister islands face the rising day
 rugged she is but fruitful nurse of sons
 magnanimous nor shall these eyes behold
 elsewhere an object dear and sweet as she
 calypso beauteous goddess in her grot
 detain'd me wishing me her own espoused
 ��an circe also skill'd profound
 in potent arts within her palace long
 detain'd me wishing me her own espoused 40
 but never could they warp my constant mind
 so much our parents and our native soil
 attract us most even although our lot
 be fair and plenteous in a foreign land
 but comemy painful voyage such as jove
 gave me from ilium i will now relate
 from troy the winds bore me to ismarus
 city of the ciconians them i slew
 and laid their city waste whence bringing forth
 much spoil with all their wives i portion'd it 50
 with equal hand and each received a share
 next i exhorted to immediate flight
 my people but in vain they madly scorn'd
 my sober counsel and much wine they drank
 and sheep and beeves slew num'rous on the shore
 meantime ciconians to ciconians call'd
 their neighbours summoning a mightier host
 and braver natives of the continent
 expert on horses mounted to maintain
 fierce fight or if occasion bade on foot 60
 num'rous they came as leaves or vernal flow'rs
 at dayspring then by the decree of jove
 misfortune found us at the ships we stood
 piercing each other with the brazen spear
 and till the morning brighten'd into noon
 few as we were we yet withstood them all
 but when the sun verged westward then the greeks
 fell back and the ciconian host prevail'd
 six warlike greecians from each galley's crew
 perish'd in that dread field the rest escaped 70
 thus after loss of many we pursued
 our course yet difficult as was our flight
 went not till first we had invoked by name
 our friends whom the ciconians had destroy'd
 but cloudassembler jove assail'd us soon
 with a tempestuous northwind earth alike
 and sea with storms he overhung and night
 fell fast from heav'n their heads deepplunging oft
 our gallies flew and rent and rent again
 our tatter'd sailcloth crackled in the wind 80
 we fearing instant death within the barks
 our canvas lodg'd and toiling strenuous reach'd
 at length the continent two nights we lay
 continual there and two long days consumed
 with toil and grief but when the beauteous morn
 brighthair'd had brought the third day to a close
 our masts erected and white sails unfurl'd
 again we sat on board meantime the winds
 well managed by the steersman urged us on
 and now all danger pass'd i had attain'd 90
 my native shore but doubling in my course
 malea waves and currents and northwinds
 constrain'd me devious to cythera's isle
 nine days by cruel storms thence was i borne
 athwart the fishy deep but on the tenth
 reach'd the lotophagi a race sustain'd
 on sweetest fruit alone there quitting ship
 we landed and drew water and the crews
 beside the vessels took their ev'ning cheer
 when hasty we had thus our strength renew'd 100
 i order'd forth my people to inquire
 two i selected from the rest with whom
 i join'd an herald third what race of men
 might there inhabit they departing mix'd
 with the lotophagi nor hostile aught
 or savage the lotophagi devised
 against our friends but offer'd to their taste
 the lotus of which fruit what man soe'er
 once tasted no desire felt he to come
 with tidings back or seek his country more 110
 but rather wish'd to feed on lotus still
 with the lotophagi and to renounce
 all thoughts of home them therefore i constrain'd
 weeping on board and dragging each beneath
 the benches bound him there then all in haste
 i urged my people to ascend again
 their hollow barks lest others also fed
 with fruit of lotus should forget their home
 they quick embark'd and on the benches ranged
 in order thresh'd with oars the foamy flood 120
 thence o'er the deep proceeding sad we reach'd
 the land at length where giantsized32 and free
 from all constraint of law the cyclops dwell
 they trusting to the gods plant not or plough
 but earth unsow'd untill'd brings forth for them
 all fruits wheat barley and the vinous grape
 large cluster'd nourish'd by the show'rs of jove
 no councils they convene no laws contrive
 but in deep caverns dwell found on the heads
 of lofty mountains judging each supreme 130
 his wife and children heedless of the rest
 in front of the cyclopean haven lies
 a level island not adjoining close
 their land nor yet remote woody and rude
 there wild goats breed numberless by no foot
 of man molested never huntsman there
 inured to winter's cold and hunger roams
 the dreary woods or mountaintops sublime
 no fleecy flocks dwell there nor plough is known
 but the unseeded and unfurrow'd soil 140
 year after year a wilderness by man
 untrodden food for blatant goats supplies
 for no ships crimsonprow'd the cyclops own
 nor naval artizan is there whose toil
 might furnish them with oary barks by which
 subsists all distant commerce and which bear
 man o'er the deep to cities far remote
 who might improve the peopled isle that seems
 not steril in itself but apt to yield
 in their due season fruits of ev'ry kind 150
 for stretch'd beside the hoary ocean lie
 green meadows moist where vines would never fail
 light is the land and they might yearly reap
 the tallest crops so unctuous is the glebe
 safe is its haven also where no need
 of cable is or anchor or to lash
 the hawser fast ashore but pushing in
 his bark the mariner might there abide
 till rising gales should tempt him forth again
 at bottom of the bay runs a clear stream 160
 issuing from a cove hemm'd all around
 with poplars down into that bay we steer'd
 amid the darkness of the night some god
 conducting us for all unseen it lay
 such gloom involved the fleet nor shone the moon
 from heav'n to light us veil'd by pitchy clouds
 hence none the isle descried nor any saw
 the lofty surge roll'd on the strand or ere
 our vessels struck the ground but when they struck
 then low'ring all our sails we disembark'd 170
 and on the seabeach slept till dawn appear'd
 soon as aurora daughter of the dawn
 look'd rosy forth we with admiring eyes
 the isle survey'd roaming it wide around
 meantime the nymphs jove's daughters roused the goats
 bred on the mountains to supply with food
 the partners of my toils then bringing forth
 bows and longpointed javelins from the ships
 divided all into three sep'rate bands
 we struck them and the gods gave us much prey 180
 twelve ships attended me and ev'ry ship
 nine goats received by lot myself alone
 selected ten all day till set of sun
 we eating sat goat's flesh and drinking wine
 delicious without stint for dearth was none
 of ruddy wine on board but much remain'd
 with which my people had their jars supplied
 what time we sack'd ciconian ismarus
 thence looking forth toward the neighbourland
 where dwell the cyclops rising smoke we saw 190
 and voices heard their own and of their flocks
 now sank the sun and night o'ershadowing all
 we slept along the shore but when again
 the rosyfinger'd daughter of the dawn
 look'd forth my crews convened i thus began
 companions of my course here rest ye all
 save my own crew with whom i will explore
 this people whether wild they be unjust
 and to contention giv'n or welldisposed
 to strangers and a race who fear the gods 200
 so speaking i embark'd and bade embark
 my followers throwing quick the hawsers loose
 they ent'ring at my word the benches fill'd
 wellranged and thresh'd with oars the foamy flood
 attaining soon that neighbourland we found
 at its extremity fast by the sea
 a cavern lofty and darkbrow'd above
 with laurels in that cavern slumb'ring lay
 much cattle sheep and goats and a broad court
 enclosed it fenced with stones from quarries hewn 210
 with spiry firs and oaks of ample bough
 here dwelt a giant vast who far remote
 his flocks fed solitary converse none
 desiring sullen savage and unjust
 monster in truth he was hideous in form
 resembling less a man by ceres' gift
 sustain'd than some aspiring mountaincrag
 tufted with wood and standing all alone
 enjoining then my people to abide
 fast by the ship which they should closely guard 220
 i went but not without a goatskin fill'd
 with sable wine which i had erst received
 from maron offspring of evanthes priest
 of phoebus guardian god of ismarus
 because through rev'rence of him we had saved
 himself his wife and children for he dwelt
 amid the grove umbrageous of his god
 he gave me therefore noble gifts from him
 sev'n talents i received of beaten gold
 a beaker argent all and after these 230
 no fewer than twelve jars with wine replete
 rich unadult'rate drink for gods nor knew
 one servant male or female of that wine
 in all his house none knew it save himself
 his wife and the intendant of his stores
 oft as they drank that luscious juice he slaked
 a single cup with twenty from the stream
 and even then the beaker breath'd abroad
 a scent celestial which whoever smelt
 thenceforth no pleasure found it to abstain 240
 charged with an ample goatskin of this wine
 i went and with a wallet well supplied
 but felt a sudden presage in my soul
 that haply with terrific force endued
 some savage would appear strange to the laws
 and privileges of the human race
 few steps convey'd us to his den but him
 we found not he his flocks pastur'd abroad
 his cavern ent'ring we with wonder gazed
 around on all his strainers hung with cheese 250
 distended wide with lambs and kids his penns
 closethrong'd we saw and folded separate
 the various charge the eldest all apart
 apart the middleaged and the newyean'd
 also apart his pails and bowls with whey
 swam all neat vessels into which he milk'd
 me then my friends first importuned to take
 a portion of his cheeses then to drive
 forth from the sheepcotes to the rapid bark
 his kids and lambs and plow the brine again 260
 but me they moved not happier had they moved
 i wish'd to see him and to gain perchance
 some pledge of hospitality at his hands
 whose form was such as should not much bespeak
 when he appear'd our confidence or love
 then kindling fire we offer'd to the gods
 and of his cheeses eating patient sat
 till home he trudged from pasture charged he came
 with dry wood bundled an enormous load
 fuel by which to sup loud crash'd the thorns 270
 which down he cast before the cavern's mouth
 to whose interior nooks we trembling flew
 at once he drove into his spacious cave
 his batten'd flock all those which gave him milk
 but all the males both rams and goats he left
 abroad excluded from the cavernyard
 upheaving next a rocky barrier huge
 to his cave's mouth he thrust it home that weight
 not all the oxen from its place had moved
 of twenty and two wains with such a rock 280
 immense his den he closed then down he sat
 and as he milk'd his ewes and bleating goats
 all in their turns her yeanling gave to each
 coagulating then with brisk dispatch
 the half of his new milk he thrust the curd
 into his wicker sieves but stored the rest
 in pans and bowlshis customary drink
 his labours thus perform'd he kindled last
 his fuel and discerning _us_ enquired
 who are ye strangers from what distant shore 290
 roam ye the waters traffic ye or bound
 to no one port wander as pirates use
 at large the deep exposing life themselves
 and enemies of all mankind beside
 he ceased we dash'd with terrour heard the growl
 of his big voice and view'd his form uncouth
 to whom though sore appall'd i thus replied
 of greece are we and bound from ilium home
 have wander'd wide the expanse of ocean sport
 for ev'ry wind and driven from our course 300
 have here arrived so stood the will of jove
 we boast ourselves of agamemnon's train
 the son of atreus at this hour the chief
 beyond all others under heav'n renown'd
 so great a city he hath sack'd and slain
 such num'rous foes but since we reach at last
 thy knees we beg such hospitable fare
 or other gift as guests are wont to obtain
 illustrious lord respect the gods and us
 thy suitors suppliants are the care of jove 310
 the hospitable he their wrongs resents
 and where the stranger sojourns there is he
 i ceas'd when answer thus he fierce return'd
 friend either thou art fool or hast arrived
 indeed from far who bidd'st me fear the gods
 lest they be wroth the cyclops little heeds
 jove �gisarm'd or all the pow'rs of heav'n
 our race is mightier far nor shall myself
 through fear of jove's hostility abstain
 from thee or thine unless my choice be such 320
 but tell me now where touch'd thy gallant bark
 our country on thy first arrival here
 remote or nigh for i would learn the truth
 so spake he tempting me but artful thus
 i answer'd penetrating his intent
 my vessel neptune shaker of the shores
 at yonder utmost promontory dash'd
 in pieces hurling her against the rocks
 with winds that blew right thither from the sea
 and i with these alone escaped alive 330
 so i to whom relentless answer none
 he deign'd but with his arms extended sprang
 toward my people of whom seizing two
 at once like whelps against his cavernfloor
 he dash'd them and their brains spread on the ground
 these piecemeal hewn for supper he prepared
 and like a mountainlion neither flesh
 nor entrails left nor yet their marrowy bones
 we viewing that tremendous sight upraised
 our hands to jove all hope and courage lost 340
 when thus the cyclops had with human flesh
 fill'd his capacious belly and had quaff'd
 much undiluted milk among his flocks
 outstretch'd immense he press'd his cavernfloor
 me then my courage prompted to approach
 the monster with my sword drawn from the sheath
 and to transfix him where the vitals wrap
 the liver but maturer thoughts forbad
 for so we also had incurred a death
 tremendous wanting pow'r to thrust aside 350
 the rocky mass that closed his cavernmouth
 by force of hand alone thus many a sigh
 heaving we watch'd the dawn but when at length
 aurora dayspring's daughter rosypalm'd
 look'd forth then kindling fire his flocks he milk'd
 in order and her yeanling kid or lamb
 thrust under each when thus he had perform'd
 his wonted task two seizing as before
 he slew them for his next obscene regale
 his dinner ended from the cave he drove 360
 his fatted flocks abroad moving with ease
 that pond'rous barrier and replacing it
 as he had only closed a quiver's lid
 then hissing them along he drove his flocks
 toward the mountain and me left the while
 deep ruminating how i best might take
 vengeance and by the aid of pallas win
 deathless renown this counsel pleas'd me most
 beside the sheepcote lay a massy club
 hewn by the cyclops from an olive stock 370
 green but which dried should serve him for a staff
 to us consid'ring it that staff appear'd
 tall as the mast of a huge trading bark
 impell'd by twenty rowers o'er the deep
 such seem'd its length to us and such its bulk
 part amputating an whole fathom's length
 i gave my men that portion with command
 to shave it smooth they smooth'd it and myself
 shaping its blunt extremity to a point
 season'd it in the fire then cov'ring close 380
 the weapon hid it under litter'd straw
 for much lay scatter'd on the cavernfloor
 and now i bade my people cast the lot
 who of us all should take the pointed brand
 and grind it in his eye when next he slept
 the lots were cast and four were chosen those
 whom most i wish'd and i was chosen fifth
 at eventide he came his fleecy flocks
 pasturing homeward and compell'd them all
 into his cavern leaving none abroad 390
 either through some surmise or so inclined
 by influence haply of the gods themselves
 the huge rock pull'd into its place again
 at the cave's mouth he sitting milk'd his sheep
 and goats in order and her kid or lamb
 thrust under each thus all his work dispatch'd
 two more he seiz'd and to his supper fell
 i then approaching to him thus address'd
 the cyclops holding in my hands a cup
 of ivywood wellcharg'd with ruddy wine 400
 lo cyclops this is wine take this and drink
 after thy meal of man's flesh taste and learn
 what precious liquor our lost vessel bore
 i brought it hither purposing to make
 libation to thee if to pity inclined
 thou would'st dismiss us home but ah thy rage
 is insupportable thou cruel one
 who thinkest thou of all mankind henceforth
 will visit _thee_ guilty of such excess
 i ceas'd he took and drank and hugely pleas'd33 410
 with that delicious bev'rage thus enquir'd
 give me again and spare not tell me too
 thy name incontinent that i may make
 requital gratifying also thee
 with somewhat to thy taste we cyclops own
 a bounteous soil which yields _us_ also wine
 from clusters large nourish'd by show'rs from jove
 but thisthis is from abovea stream
 of nectar and ambrosia all divine
 he ended and received a second draught 420
 like measure thrice i bore it to his hand
 and foolish thrice he drank but when the fumes
 began to play around the cyclops' brain
 with show of amity i thus replied
 cyclops thou hast my noble name enquired
 which i will tell thee give me in return
 the promised boon some hospitable pledge
 my name is outis34 outis i am call'd
 at home abroad wherever i am known
 so i to whom he savage thus replied 430
 outis when i have eaten all his friends
 shall be my last regale be that thy boon
 he spake and downward sway'd fell resupine
 with his huge neck aslant allconqu'ring sleep
 soon seized him from his gullet gush'd the wine
 with human morsels mingled many a blast
 sonorous issuing from his glutted maw
 then thrusting far the spike of olivewood
 into the embers glowing on the hearth
 i heated it and cheer'd my friends the while 440
 lest any should through fear shrink from his part
 but when that stake of olivewood though green
 should soon have flamed for it was glowing hot
 i bore it to his side then all my aids
 around me gather'd and the gods infused
 heroic fortitude into our hearts
 they seizing the hot stake rasp'd to a point
 bored his eye with it and myself advanced
 to a superior stand twirled it about
 as when a shipwright with his wimble bores 450
 tough oaken timber placed on either side
 below his fellowartists strain the thong
 alternate and the restless iron spins
 so grasping hard the stake pointed with fire
 we twirl'd it in his eye the bubbling blood
 boil'd round about the brand his pupil sent
 a scalding vapour forth that sing'd his brow
 and all his eyeroots crackled in the flame
 as when the smith an hatchet or large axe
 temp'ring with skill plunges the hissing blade 460
 deep in cold water whence the strength of steel
 so hiss'd his eye around the olivewood
 the howling monster with his outcry fill'd
 the hollow rock and i with all my aids
 fled terrified he plucking forth the spike
 from his burnt socket mad with anguish cast
 the implement all bloody far away
 then bellowing he sounded forth the name
 of ev'ry cyclops dwelling in the caves
 around him on the windswept mountaintops 470
 they at his cry flocking from ev'ry part
 circled his den and of his ail enquired
 what grievous hurt hath caused thee polypheme
 thus yelling to alarm the peaceful ear
 of night and break our slumbers fear'st thou lest
 some mortal man drive off thy flocks or fear'st
 thyself to die by cunning or by force
 them answer'd then polypheme from his cave
 oh friends i die and outis gives the blow
 to whom with accents wing'd his friends without 480
 if no man35 harm thee but thou art alone
 and sickness feel'st it is the stroke of jove
 and thou must bear it yet invoke for aid
 thy father neptune sovereign of the floods
 so saying they went and in my heart i laugh'd
 that by the fiction only of a name
 slight stratagem i had deceived them all
 then groan'd the cyclops wrung with pain and grief
 and fumbling with stretch'd hands removed the rock
 from his cave's mouth which done he sat him down 490
 spreading his arms athwart the pass to stop
 our egress with his flocks abroad so dull
 it seems he held me and so illadvised
 i pondering what means might fittest prove
 to save from instant death if save i might
 my people and myself to ev'ry shift
 inclined and various counsels framed as one
 who strove for life conscious of woe at hand
 to me thus meditating this appear'd
 the likeliest course the rams wellthriven were 500
 thickfleeced fullsized with wool of sable hue
 these silently with osier twigs on which
 the cyclops hideous monster slept i bound
 three in one leash the intermediate rams
 bore each a man whom the exterior two
 preserved concealing him on either side
 thus each was borne by three and i at last
 the curl'd back seizing of a ram for one
 i had reserv'd far stateliest of them all
 slipp'd underneath his belly and both hands 510
 enfolding fast in his exub'rant fleece
 clung ceaseless to him as i lay supine
 we thus disposed waited with many a sigh
 the sacred dawn but when at length aris'n
 aurora dayspring's daughter rosypalm'd
 again appear'd the males of all his flocks
 rush'd forth to pasture and meantime unmilk'd
 the wethers bleated by the load distress'd
 of udders overcharged their master rack'd
 with pain intolerable handled yet 520
 the backs of all inquisitive as they stood
 but gross of intellect suspicion none
 conceiv'd of men beneath their bodies bound
 and now none left beside the ram approach'd
 with his own wool burthen'd and with myself
 whom many a fear molested polypheme
 the giant stroak'd him as he sat and said
 my darling ram why latest of the flock
 com'st thou whom never heretofore my sheep
 could leave behind but stalking at their head 530
 thou first was wont to crop the tender grass
 first to arrive at the clear stream and first
 with ready will to seek my sheepcote here
 at evening but thy practice chang'd thou com'st
 now last of all feel'st thou regret my ram
 of thy poor master's eye by a vile wretch
 bored out who overcame me first with wine
 and by a crew of vagabonds accurs'd
 followers of outis whose escape from death
 shall not be made today ah that thy heart 540
 were as my own and that distinct as i
 thou could'st articulate so should'st thou tell
 where hidden he eludes my furious wrath
 then dash'd against the floor his spatter'd brain
 should fly and i should lighter feel my harm
 from outis wretch basenamed and nothingworth
 so saying he left him to pursue the flock
 when thus drawn forth we had at length escaped
 few paces from the cavern and the court
 first quitting my own ram i loos'd my friends 550
 then turning seaward many a thriven ewe
 sharphoof'd we drove them swiftly to the ship
 thrice welcome to our faithful friends we came
 from death escaped but much they mourn'd the dead
 i suffer'd not their tears but silent shook
 my brows by signs commanding them to lift
 the sheep on board and instant plow the main
 they quick embarking on the benches sat
 well ranged and thresh'd with oars the foamy flood
 but distant now such length as a loud voice 560
 may reach i hail'd with taunts the cyclops' ear
 cyclops when thou devouredst in thy cave
 with brutal force my followers thou devour'dst
 the followers of no timid chief or base
 vengeance was sure to recompense that deed
 atrocious monster who wast not afraid
 to eat the guest shelter'd beneath thy roof
 therefore the gods have well requited thee
 i ended he exasp'rate raged the more
 and rending from its hold a mountaintop 570
 hurl'd it toward us at our vessel's stern
 down came the mass nigh sweeping in its fall
 the rudder's head the ocean at the plunge
 of that huge rock high on its refluent flood
 heav'd irresistible the ship to land
 i seizing quick our longest pole on board
 back thrust her from the coast and by a nod
 in silence given bade my companions ply
 strenuous their oars that so we might escape
 procumbent36 each obey'd and when the flood 580
 cleaving we twice that distance had obtain'd37
 again i hail'd the cyclops but my friends
 earnest dissuaded me on ev'ry side
 ah rash ulysses why with taunts provoke
 the savage more who hath this moment hurl'd
 a weapon such as heav'd the ship again
 to land where death seem'd certain to us all
 for had he heard a cry or but the voice
 of one man speaking he had all our heads
 with some sharp rock and all our timbers crush'd 590
 together such vast force is in his arm
 so they but my courageous heart remain'd
 unmoved and thus again incensed i spake
 cyclops should any mortal man inquire
 to whom thy shameful loss of sight thou ow'st
 say to ulysses citywaster chief
 laertes' son native of ithaca
 i ceas'd and with a groan thus he replied
 ah me an antient oracle i feel
 accomplish'd here abode a prophet erst 600
 a man of noblest form and in his art
 unrivall'd telemus eurymedes
 he prophesying to the cyclopsrace
 grew old among us and presaged my loss
 of sight in future by ulysses' hand
 i therefore watch'd for the arrival here
 always of some great chief for stature bulk
 and beauty prais'd and cloath'd with wond'rous might
 but nowa dwarf a thing impalpable
 a shadow overcame me first by wine 610
 then quench'd my sight come hither o my guest
 return ulysses hospitable cheer
 awaits thee and my pray'rs i will prefer
 to glorious neptune for thy prosp'rous course
 for i am neptune's offspring and the god
 is proud to be my sire he if he please
 and he alone can heal me none beside
 of pow'rs immortal or of men below
 he spake to whom i answer thus return'd
 i would that of thy life and soul amerced 620
 i could as sure dismiss thee down to hell
 as none shall heal thine eyenot even he
 so i then pray'd the cyclops to his sire
 with hands uprais'd towards the starry heav'n
 hear earthencircler neptune azurehair'd
 if i indeed am thine and if thou boast
 thyself my father grant that never more
 ulysses leveller of hostile tow'rs
 laertes' son of ithaca the fair
 behold his native home but if his fate 630
 decree him yet to see his friends his house
 his native country let him deep distress'd
 return and late all his companions lost
 indebted for a ship to foreign aid
 and let affliction meet him at his door
 he spake and ocean's sov'reign heard his pray'r
 then lifting from the shore a stone of size
 far more enormous o'er his head he whirl'd
 the rock and his immeasurable force
 exerting all dismiss'd it close behind 640
 the ship nor distant from the rudder's head
 down came the mass the ocean at the plunge
 of such a weight high on its refluent flood
 tumultuous heaved the bark well nigh to land
 but when we reach'd the isle where we had left
 our num'rous barks and where my people sat
 watching with ceaseless sorrow our return
 we thrust our vessel to the sandy shore
 then disembark'd and of the cyclops' sheep
 gave equal share to all to me alone 650
 my fellowvoyagers the ram consign'd
 in distribution my peculiar meed
 him therefore to cloudgirt saturnian jove
 i offer'd on the shore burning his thighs
 in sacrifice but jove my hallow'd rites
 reck'd not destruction purposing to all
 my barks and all my followers o'er the deep
 thus feasting largely on the shore we sat
 till eventide and quaffing gen'rous wine
 but when day fail'd and night o'ershadow'd all 660
 then on the shore we slept and when again
 aurora rosy daughter of the dawn
 look'd forth my people anxious i enjoin'd
 to climb their barks and cast the hawsers loose
 they all obedient took their seats on board
 wellranged and thresh'd with oars the foamy flood
 thus 'scaping narrowly we roam'd the deep
 with aching hearts and with diminish'd crews

 32 so the scholium interprets in this place the word hyperthialos

 33 lin�s

 34 clarke who has preserved this name in his marginal version
 contends strenuously and with great reason that outis ought not to be
 translated and in a passage which he quotes from the _acta eruditorum_
 we see much fault found with giphanius and other interpreters of homer
 for having translated it it is certain that in homer the word is
 declined not as outistinos which signifies no man but as
 outistidos making outin in the accusative consequently as a proper
 name it is sufficient that the ambiguity was such as to deceive the
 friends of the cyclops outis is said by some perhaps absurdly to have
 been a name given to ulysses on account of his having larger ears than
 common

 35 outis as a _name_ could only denote him who bore it but as a
 _noun_ it signifies _no man_ which accounts sufficiently for the
 ludicrous mistake of his brethren

 37 the seeming incongruity of this line with line 560 is reconciled by
 supposing that ulysses exerted his voice naturally loud in an
 extraordinary manner on this second occasion see clarke




 book x

 argument

 ulysses in pursuit of his narrative relates his arrival at the island
 of �olus his departure thence and the unhappy occasion of his return
 thither the monarch of the winds dismisses him at last with much
 asperity he next tells of his arrival among the l�strygonians by whom
 his whole fleet together with their crews are destroyed his own ship
 and crew excepted thence he is driven to the island of circe by her the
 half of his people are transformed into swine assisted by mercury he
 resists her enchantments himself and prevails with the goddess to
 recover them to their former shape in consequence of circe's
 instructions after having spent a complete year in her palace he
 prepares for a voyage to the infernal regions


 we came to the �olian isle there dwells
 �olus son of hippotas belov'd
 by the immortals in an isle afloat
 a brazen wall impregnable on all sides
 girds it and smooth its rocky coast ascends
 his children in his own fair palace born
 are twelve six daughters and six blooming sons
 he gave his daughters to his sons to wife
 they with their father hold perpetual feast
 and with their royal mother still supplied 10
 with dainties numberless the sounding dome
 is fill'd with sav'ry odours all the day
 and with their consorts chaste at night they sleep
 on stateliest couches with rich arras spread
 their city and their splendid courts we reach'd
 a month complete he friendly at his board
 regaled me and enquiry made minute
 of ilium's fall of the achaian fleet
 and of our voyage thence i told him all
 but now desirous to embark again 20
 i ask'd dismission home which he approved
 and well provided for my prosp'rous course
 he gave me furnish'd by a bullock slay'd
 in his ninth year a bag ev'ry rude blast
 which from its bottom turns the deep that bag
 imprison'd held for him saturnian jove
 hath officed arbiter of all the winds
 to rouse their force or calm them at his will
 he gave me them on board my bark so bound
 with silver twine that not a breath escaped 30
 then order'd gentle zephyrus to fill
 our sails propitious order vain alas
 so fatal proved the folly of my friends
 nine days continual night and day we sail'd
 and on the tenth my native land appear'd
 not far remote my ithacans i saw
 fires kindling on the coast but me with toil
 worn and with watching gentle sleep subdued
 for constant i had ruled the helm nor giv'n
 that charge to any fearful of delay 40
 then in close conference combined my crew
 each other thus bespakehe carries home
 silver and gold from �olus received
 offspring of hippotas illustrious chief
 and thus a mariner the rest harangued
 ye gods what city or what land soe'er
 ulysses visits how is he belov'd
 by all and honour'd many precious spoils
 he homeward bears from troy but we return
 we who the selfsame voyage have perform'd 50
 with empty hands now also he hath gain'd
 this pledge of friendship from the king of winds
 but comebe quicksearch we the bag and learn
 what stores of gold and silver it contains
 so he whose mischievous advice prevailed
 they loos'd the bag forth issued all the winds
 and caught by tempests o'er the billowy waste
 weeping they flew far far from ithaca
 i then awaking in my noble mind
 stood doubtful whether from my vessel's side 60
 immersed to perish in the flood or calm
 to endure my sorrows and content to live
 i calm endured them but around my head
 winding my mantle lay'd me down below
 while adverse blasts bore all my fleet again
 to the �olian isle then groan'd my people
 we disembark'd and drew fresh water there
 and my companions at their galley's sides
 all seated took repast short meal we made
 when with an herald and a chosen friend 70
 i sought once more the hall of �olus
 him banqueting with all his sons we found
 and with his spouse we ent'ring on the floor
 of his wide portal sat whom they amazed
 beheld and of our coming thus enquired
 return'd ulysses by what adverse pow'r
 repuls'd hast thou arrived we sent thee hence
 wellfitted forth to reach thy native isle
 thy palace or what place soe'er thou would'st
 so theyto whom heartbroken i replied 80
 my worthless crew have wrong'd me nor alone
 my worthless crew but sleep illtimed as much
 yet heal o friends my hurt the pow'r is yours
 so i their favour woo'd mute sat the sons
 but thus their father answer'd hencebe gone
 leave this our isle thou most obnoxious wretch
 of all mankind i should myself transgress
 receiving here and giving conduct hence
 to one detested by the gods as thou
 awayfor hated by the gods thou com'st 90
 so saying he sent me from his palace forth
 groaning profound thence therefore o'er the deep
 we still proceeded sorrowful our force
 exhausting ceaseless at the toilsome oar
 and through our own imprudence hopeless now
 of other furth'rance to our native isle
 six days we navigated day and night
 the briny flood and on the seventh reach'd
 the city erst by lamus built sublime
 proud l�strygonia with the distant gates 100
 the herdsman there driving his cattle home38
 summons the shepherd with his flocks abroad
 the sleepless there might double wages earn
 attending now the herds now tending sheep
 for the nightpastures and the pastures grazed
 by day close border both the citywalls
 to that illustrious port we came by rocks
 uninterrupted flank'd on either side
 of tow'ring height while prominent the shores
 and bold converging at the haven's mouth 110
 leave narrow pass we push'd our galleys in
 then moor'd them side by side for never surge
 there lifts its head or great or small but clear
 we found and motionless the shelter'd flood
 myself alone staying my bark without
 secured her well with hawsers to a rock
 at the land's point then climb'd the rugged steep
 and spying stood the country labours none
 of men or oxen in the land appear'd
 nor aught beside saw we but from the earth 120
 smoke rising therefore of my friends i sent
 before me two adding an herald third
 to learn what race of men that country fed
 departing they an even track pursued
 made by the waggons bringing timber down
 from the high mountains to the town below
 before the town a virgin bearing forth
 her ew'r they met daughter of him who ruled
 the l�strygonian race antiphatas
 descending from the gate she sought the fount 130
 artacia for their custom was to draw
 from that pure fountain for the city's use
 approaching they accosted her and ask'd
 what king reign'd there and over whom he reign'd
 she gave them soon to know where stood sublime
 the palace of her sire no sooner they
 the palace enter'd than within they found
 in size resembling an huge mountaintop
 a woman whom they shudder'd to behold
 she forth from council summon'd quick her spouse 140
 antiphatas who teeming came with thoughts
 of carnage and arriving seized at once
 a greecian whom next moment he devoured
 with headlong terrour the surviving two
 fled to the ships then sent antiphatas
 his voice through all the town and on all sides
 hearing that cry the l�strygonians flock'd
 numberless and in size resembling more
 the giants than mankind they from the rocks
 cast down into our fleet enormous stones 150
 a strong man's burthen each dire din arose
 of shatter'd galleys and of dying men
 whom spear'd like fishes to their home they bore
 a loathsome prey while them within the port
 they slaughter'd i the faulchion at my side
 drawn forth cut loose the hawser of my ship
 and all my crew enjoin'd with bosoms laid
 prone on their oars to fly the threaten'd woe
 they dreading instant death tugg'd resupine
 together and the galley from beneath 160
 those beetling39 rocks into the open sea
 shot gladly but the rest all perish'd there
 proceeding thence we sigh'd and roamed the waves
 glad that we lived but sorrowing for the slain
 we came to the ��an isle there dwelt
 the awful circe goddess amberhair'd
 deepskill'd in magic song sister by birth
 of the allwise ��tes them the sun
 bright luminary of the world begat
 on perse daughter of oceanus 170
 our vessel there noiseless we push'd to land
 within a spacious haven thither led
 by some celestial pow'r we disembark'd
 and on the coast two days and nights entire
 extended lay worn with long toil and each
 the victim of his heartdevouring woes
 then with my spear and with my faulchion arm'd
 i left the ship to climb with hasty steps
 an airy height thence hoping to espie
 some works of man or hear perchance a voice 180
 exalted on a rough rock's craggy point
 i stood and on the distant plain beheld
 smoke which from circe's palace through the gloom
 of trees and thickets rose that smoke discern'd
 i ponder'd next if thither i should haste
 seeking intelligence long time i mused
 but chose at last as my discreter course
 to seek the seabeach and my bark again
 and when my crew had eaten to dispatch
 before me others who should first enquire 190
 but ere i yet had reach'd my gallant bark
 some god with pity viewing me alone
 in that untrodden solitude sent forth
 an antler'd stag fullsized into my path
 his woodland pastures left he sought the stream
 for he was thirsty and already parch'd
 by the sun's heat him issuing from his haunt
 sheer through the back beneath his middle spine
 i wounded and the lance sprang forth beyond
 moaning he fell and in the dust expired 200
 then treading on his breathless trunk i pluck'd
 my weapon forth which leaving there reclined
 i tore away the osiers with my hands
 and fallows green and to a fathom's length
 twisting the gather'd twigs into a band
 bound fast the feet of my enormous prey
 and flinging him athwart my neck repair'd
 toward my sable bark propp'd on my lance
 which now to carry shoulder'd as before
 surpass'd my pow'r so bulky was the load 210
 arriving at the ship there i let fall
 my burthen and with pleasant speech and kind
 man after man addressing cheer'd my crew
 my friends we suffer much but shall not seek
 the shades ere yet our destined hour arrive
 behold a feast and we have wine on board
 pine not with needless famine rise and eat
 i spake they readily obey'd and each
 issuing at my word abroad beside
 the galley stood admiring as he lay 220
 the stag for of no common bulk was he
 at length their eyes gratified to the full
 with that glad spectacle they laved their hands
 and preparation made of noble cheer
 that day complete till set of sun we spent
 feasting deliciously without restraint
 and quaffing generous wine but when the sun
 went down and darkness overshadow'd all
 extended then on ocean's bank we lay
 and when aurora daughter of the dawn 230
 look'd rosy forth convening all my crew
 to council i arose and thus began
 my fellowvoyagers however worn
 with num'rous hardships hear for neither west
 know ye nor east where rises or where sets
 the allenlight'ning sun but let us think
 if thought perchance may profit us of which
 small hope i see for when i lately climb'd
 yon craggy rock plainly i could discern
 the land encompass'd by the boundless deep 240
 the isle is flat and in the midst i saw
 dun smoke ascending from an oaken bow'r
 so i whom hearing they all courage lost
 and at remembrance of antiphatas
 the l�strygonian and the cyclops' deeds
 ferocious feeder on the flesh of man
 mourn'd loud and wept but tears could nought avail
 then numb'ring man by man i parted them
 in equal portions and assign'd a chief
 to either band myself to these to those 250
 godlike eurylochus this done we cast
 the lots into the helmet and at once
 forth sprang the lot of bold eurylochus
 he went and with him of my people march'd
 twenty and two all weeping nor ourselves
 wept less at separation from our friends
 low in a vale but on an open spot
 they found the splendid house of circe built
 with hewn and polish'd stones compass'd she dwelt
 by lions on all sides and mountainwolves 260
 tamed by herself with drugs of noxious pow'rs
 nor were they mischievous but as my friends
 approach'd arising on their hinder feet
 paw'd them in blandishment and wagg'd the tail
 as when from feast he rises dogs around
 their master fawn accustom'd to receive
 the sop conciliatory from his hand
 around my people so those talon'd wolves
 and lions fawn'd they terrified that troop
 of savage monsters horrible beheld 270
 and now before the goddess' gates arrived
 they heard the voice of circe singing sweet
 within while busied at the loom she wove
 an ample web immortal such a work
 transparent graceful and of bright design
 as hands of goddesses alone produce
 thus then polites prince of men the friend
 highest in my esteem the rest bespake
 ye hear the voice comrades of one who weaves
 an ample web within and at her task 280
 so sweetly chaunts that all the marble floor
 reechoes human be she or divine
 i doubt but let us call that we may learn
 he ceas'd they call'd soon issuing at the sound
 the goddess open'd wide her splendid gates
 and bade them in they heedless all complied
 all save eurylochus who fear'd a snare
 she introducing them conducted each
 to a bright throne then gave them pramnian wine
 with grated cheese pure meal and honey new 290
 but medicated with her pois'nous drugs
 their food that in oblivion they might lose
 the wish of home she gave them and they drank
 when smiting each with her enchanting wand
 she shut them in her sties in head in voice
 in body and in bristles they became
 all swine yet intellected as before
 and at her hand were dieted alone
 with acorns chestnuts and the cornelfruit
 food grateful ever to the grovelling swine 300
 back flew eurylochus toward the ship
 to tell the woeful tale struggling to speak
 yet speechless there he stood his heart transfixt
 with anguish and his eyes deluged with tears
 me boding terrours occupied at length
 when gazing on him all had oft enquired
 he thus rehearsed to us the dreadful change
 renown'd ulysses as thou bad'st we went
 through yonder oaks there bosom'd in a vale
 but built conspicuous on a swelling knoll 310
 with polish'd rock we found a stately dome
 within some goddess or some woman wove
 an ample web carolling sweet the while
 they call'd aloud she issuing at the voice
 unfolded soon her splendid portals wide
 and bade them in heedless they enter'd all
 but i remain'd suspicious of a snare
 ere long the whole band vanish'd none i saw
 thenceforth though seated there long time i watch'd
 he ended i my studded faulchion huge 320
 athwart my shoulder cast and seized my bow
 then bade him lead me thither by the way
 himself had gone but with both hands my knees
 he clasp'd and in wing'd accents sad exclaim'd
 my king ah lead me not unwilling back
 but leave me here for confident i judge
 that neither thou wilt bring another thence
 nor come thyself again hastefly we swift
 with these for we at least may yet escape
 so he to whom this answer i return'd 330
 eurylochus abiding here eat thou
 and drink thy fill beside the sable bark
 i go necessity forbids my stay
 so saying i left the galley and the shore
 but ere that awful vale ent'ring i reach'd
 the palace of the sorceress a god
 met me the bearer of the golden wand
 hermes he seem'd a stripling in his prime
 his cheeks cloath'd only with their earliest down
 for youth is then most graceful fast he lock'd 340
 his hand in mine and thus familiar spake
 unhappy whither wand'ring o'er the hills
 stranger to all this region and alone
 go'st thou thy peoplethey within the walls
 are shut of circe where as swine closepent
 she keeps them comest thou to set them free
 i tell thee never wilt thou thence return
 thyself but wilt be prison'd with the rest
 yet hearkeni will disappoint her wiles
 and will preserve thee take this precious drug 350
 possessing this enter the goddess' house
 boldly for it shall save thy life from harm
 lo i reveal to thee the cruel arts
 of circe learn them she will mix for thee
 a potion and will also drug thy food
 with noxious herbs but she shall not prevail
 by all her pow'r to change thee for the force
 superior of this noble plant my gift
 shall baffle her hear still what i advise
 when she shall smite thee with her slender rod 360
 with faulchion drawn and with deaththreat'ning looks
 rush on her she will bid thee to her bed
 affrighted then beware decline not thou
 her love that she may both release thy friends
 and may with kindness entertain thyself
 but force her swear the dreaded oath of heav'n
 that she will other mischief none devise
 against thee lest she strip thee of thy might
 and quenching all thy virtue make thee vile
 so spake the argicide and from the earth 370
 that plant extracting placed it in my hand
 then taught me all its pow'rs black was the root
 milkwhite the blossom moly is its name
 in heav'n not easily by mortal man
 dug forth but all is easy to the gods
 then hermes through the islandwoods repair'd
 to heav'n and i to circe's dread abode
 in gloomy musings busied as i went
 within the vestibule arrived where dwelt
 the beauteous goddess staying there my steps 380
 i call'd aloud she heard me and at once
 issuing threw her splendid portals wide
 and bade me in i follow'd heartdistress'd
 leading me by the hand to a bright throne
 with argent studs embellish'd and beneath
 footstool'd magnificent she made me sit
 then mingling for me in a golden cup
 my bev'rage she infused a drug intent
 on mischief but when i had drunk the draught
 unchanged she smote me with her wand and said 390
 henceseek the sty there wallow with thy friends
 she spake i drawing from beside my thigh
 my faulchion keen with deathdenouncing looks
 rush'd on her she with a shrill scream of fear
 ran under my rais'd arm seized fast my knees
 and in wing'd accents plaintive thus began
 who whence thy city and thy birth declare
 amazed i see thee with that potion drench'd
 yet uninchanted never man before
 once pass'd it through his lips and liv'd the same 400
 but in thy breast a mind inhabits proof
 against all charms come theni know thee well
 thou art ulysses artificerenown'd
 of whose arrival here in his return
 from ilium hermes of the golden wand
 was ever wont to tell me sheath again
 thy sword and let us on my bed reclined
 mutual embrace that we may trust thenceforth
 each other without jealousy or fear
 the goddess spake to whom i thus replied 410
 o circe canst thou bid me meek become
 and gentle who beneath thy roof detain'st
 my fellowvoyagers transform'd to swine
 and fearing my escape invit'st thou me
 into thy bed with fraudulent pretext
 of love that there enfeebling by thy arts
 my noble spirit thou may'st make me vile
 notrust menever will i share thy bed
 till first o goddess thou consent to swear
 the dread allbinding oath that other harm 420
 against myself thou wilt imagine none
 i spake she swearing as i bade renounced
 all evil purpose and her solemn oath
 concluded i ascended next her bed
 magnificent meantime four graceful nymphs
 attended on the service of the house
 her menials from the fountains sprung and groves
 and from the sacred streams that seek the sea
 of these one cast fine linen on the thrones
 which next with purple arras rich she spread 430
 another placed before the gorgeous seats
 bright tables and set on baskets of gold
 the third an argent beaker fill'd with wine
 delicious which in golden cups she served
 the fourth brought water which she warm'd within
 an ample vase and when the simm'ring flood
 sang in the tripod led me to a bath
 and laved me with the pleasant stream profuse
 pour'd o'er my neck and body till my limbs
 refresh'd all sense of lassitude resign'd 440
 when she had bathed me and with limpid oil
 anointed me and cloathed me in a vest
 and mantle next she led me to a throne
 of royal state with silver studs emboss'd
 and footstool'd soft beneath then came a nymph
 with golden ewer charged and silver bowl
 who pour'd pure water on my hands and placed
 the polish'd board before me which with food
 various selected from her present stores
 the cat'ress spread then courteous bade me eat 450
 but me it pleas'd not with far other thoughts
 my spirit teem'd on vengeance more intent
 soon then as circe mark'd me on my seat
 fastrooted sullen nor with outstretch'd hands
 deigning to touch the banquet she approach'd
 and in wing'd accents suasive thus began
 why sits ulysses like the dumb dark thoughts
 his only food loaths he the touch of meat
 and taste of wine thou fear'st as i perceive
 some other snare but idle is that fear 460
 for i have sworn the inviolable oath
 she ceas'd to whom this answer i return'd
 how can i eat what virtuous man and just
 o circe could endure the taste of wine
 or food till he should see his prison'd friends
 once more at liberty if then thy wish
 that i should eat and drink be true produce
 my captive people let us meet again
 so i then circe bearing in her hand
 her potent rod went forth and op'ning wide 470
 the door drove out my people from the sty
 in bulk resembling brawns of the ninth year
 they stood before me she through all the herd
 proceeding with an unctuous antidote
 anointed each and at the wholesome touch
 all shed the swinish bristles by the drug
 dread circe's former magic gift produced
 restored at once to manhood they appear'd
 more vig'rous far and sightlier than before
 they knew me and with grasp affectionate 480
 hung on my hand tears follow'd but of joy
 and with loud cries the vaulted palace rang
 even the awful goddess felt herself
 compassion and approaching me began
 laertes' noble son for wiles renown'd
 hence to the shore and to thy gallant bark
 first hale her safe aground then hiding all
 your arms and treasures in the caverns come
 thyself again and hither lead thy friends
 so spake the goddess and my gen'rous mind 490
 persuaded thence repairing to the beach
 i sought my ship arrived i found my crew
 lamenting miserably and their cheeks
 with tears bedewing ceaseless at her side
 as when the calves within some village rear'd
 behold at eve the herd returning home
 from fruitful meads where they have grazed their fill
 no longer in the stalls contain'd they rush
 with many a frisk abroad and blaring oft
 with one consent all dance their dams around 500
 so they at sight of me dissolved in tears
 of rapt'rous joy and each his spirit felt
 with like affections warm'd as he had reach'd
 just then his country and his city seen
 fair ithaca where he was born and rear'd
 then in wing'd accents tender thus they spake
 noble ulysses thy appearance fills
 our soul with transports such as we should feel
 arrived in safety on our native shore
 speaksay how perish'd our unhappy friends 510
 so they to whom this answer mild i gave
 hale we our vessel first ashore and hide
 in caverns all our treasures and our arms
 then hasting hence follow me and ere long
 ye shall behold your friends beneath the roof
 of circe banqueting and drinking wine
 abundant for no dearth attends them there
 so i whom all with readiness obey'd
 all save eurylochus he sought alone
 to stay the rest and eager interposed 520
 ah whither tend we miserable men
 why covet ye this evil to go down
 to circe's palace she will change us all
 to lions wolves or swine that we may guard
 her palace by necessity constrain'd
 so some were pris'ners of the cyclops erst
 when led by rash ulysses our lost friends
 intruded needlessly into his cave
 and perish'd by the folly of their chief
 he spake whom hearing occupied i stood 530
 in selfdebate whether my faulchion keen
 forthdrawing from beside my sturdy thigh
 to tumble his lopp'd head into the dust
 although he were my kinsman in the bonds
 of close affinity but all my friends
 as with one voice thus gently interposed
 noble ulysses we will leave him here
 our vessel's guard if such be thy command
 but us lead thou to circe's dread abode
 so saying they left the galley and set forth 540
 climbing the coast nor would eurylochus
 beside the hollow bark remain but join'd
 his comrades by my dreadful menace awed
 meantime the goddess busily employ'd
 bathed and refresh'd my friends with limpid oil
 and clothed them we arriving found them all
 banqueting in the palace there they met
 these ask'd and those rehearsed the wond'rous tale
 and the recital made all wept aloud
 till the wide dome resounded then approach'd 550
 the graceful goddess and address'd me thus
 laertes' noble son for wiles renown'd
 provoke ye not each other now to tears
 i am not ignorant myself how dread
 have been your woes both on the fishy deep
 and on the land by force of hostile pow'rs
 but comeeat now and drink ye wine that so
 your freshen'd spirit may revive and ye
 courageous grow again as when ye left
 the rugged shores of ithaca your home 560
 for now through recollection day by day
 of all your pains and toils ye are become
 spiritless strengthless and the taste forget
 of pleasure such have been your num'rous woes
 she spake whose invitation kind prevail'd
 and won us to her will there then we dwelt
 the year complete fed with delicious fare
 day after day and quaffing gen'rous wine
 but when the year fulfill'd the circling hours
 their course resumed and the successive months 570
 with all their tedious days were spent my friends
 summoning me abroad thus greeted me
 sir recollect thy country if indeed
 the fates ordain thee to revisit safe
 that country and thy own glorious abode
 so they whose admonition i receiv'd
 wellpleas'd then all the day regaled we sat
 at circe's board with sav'ry viands rare
 and quaffing richest wine but when the sun
 declining darkness overshadow'd all 580
 then each within the dusky palace took
 custom'd repose and to the goddess' bed
 magnificent ascending there i urged
 my earnest suit which gracious she receiv'd
 and in wing'd accents earnest thus i spake
 o circe let us prove thy promise true
 dismiss us hence my own desires at length
 tend homeward vehement and the desires
 no less of all my friends who with complaints
 unheard by thee wear my sad heart away 590
 so i to whom the goddess in return
 laertes' noble son ulysses famed
 for deepest wisdom dwell not longer here
 thou and thy followers in my abode
 reluctant but your next must be a course
 far diff'rent hence departing ye must seek
 the dreary house of ades and of dread
 persephone there to consult the seer
 theban tiresias prophet blind but blest
 with faculties which death itself hath spared 600
 to him alone of all the dead hell's queen
 gives still to prophesy while others flit
 mere forms the shadows of what once they were
 she spake and by her words dash'd from my soul
 all courage weeping on the bed i sat
 reckless of life and of the light of day
 but when with tears and rolling to and fro
 satiate i felt relief thus i replied
 o circe with what guide shall i perform
 this voyage unperform'd by living man 610
 i spake to whom the goddess quick replied
 brave laertiades let not the fear
 to want a guide distress thee once on board
 your mast erected and your canvas white
 unfurl'd sit thou the breathing north shall waft
 thy vessel on but when ye shall have cross'd
 the broad expanse of ocean and shall reach
 the oozy shore where grow the poplar groves
 and fruitless willows wan of proserpine
 push thither through the gulphy deep thy bark 620
 and landing haste to pluto's murky abode
 there into acheron runs not alone
 dread pyriphlegethon but cocytus loud
 from styx derived there also stands a rock
 at whose broad base the roaring rivers meet
 there thrusting as i bid thy bark ashore
 o hero scoop the soil op'ning a trench
 ellbroad on ev'ry side then pour around
 libation consecrate to all the dead
 first milk with honey mixt then luscious wine 630
 then water sprinkling last meal over all
 next supplicate the unsubstantial forms
 fervently of the dead vowing to slay
 return'd to ithaca in thy own house
 an heifer barren yet fairest and best
 of all thy herds and to enrich the pile
 with delicacies such as please the shades
 but in peculiar to tiresias vow
 a sable ram noblest of all thy flocks
 when thus thou hast propitiated with pray'r 640
 all the illustrious nations of the dead
 next thou shalt sacrifice to them a ram
 and sable ewe turning the face of each
 right toward erebus and look thyself
 meantime askance toward the river's course
 souls num'rous soon of the departed dead
 will thither flock then strenuous urge thy friends
 flaying the victims which thy ruthless steel
 hath slain to burn them and to sooth by pray'r
 illustrious pluto and dread proserpine 650
 while thus is done thou seated at the foss
 faulchion in hand chace thence the airy forms
 afar nor suffer them to approach the blood
 till with tiresias thou have first conferr'd
 then glorious chief the prophet shall himself
 appear who will instruct thee and thy course
 delineate measuring from place to place
 thy whole return athwart the fishy flood
 while thus she spake the golden dawn arose
 when putting on me my attire the nymph 660
 next cloath'd herself and girding to her waist
 with an embroider'd zone her snowy robe
 graceful redundant veil'd her beauteous head
 then ranging the wide palace i aroused
 my followers standing at the side of each
 up sleep no longer let us quick depart
 for thus the goddess hath herself advised
 so i whose early summons my brave friends
 with readiness obey'd yet even thence
 i brought not all my crew there was a youth 670
 youngest of all my train elpenor one
 not much in estimation for desert
 in arms nor prompt in understanding more
 who overcharged with wine and covetous
 of cooler air high on the palaceroof
 of circe slept apart from all the rest
 awaken'd by the clamour of his friends
 newly arisen he also sprang to rise
 and in his haste forgetful where to find
 the deepdescending stairs plunged through the roof 680
 with neckbone broken from the vertebr�
 outstretch'd he lay his spirit sought the shades
 then thus to my assembling friends i spake
 ye think i doubt not of an homeward course
 but circe points me to the drear abode
 of proserpine and pluto to consult
 the spirit of tiresias theban seer
 i ended and the hearts of all alike
 felt consternation on the earth they sat
 disconsolate and plucking each his hair 690
 yet profit none of all their sorrow found
 but while we sought my galley on the beach
 with tepid tears bedewing as we went
 our cheeks meantime the goddess to the shore
 descending bound within the bark a ram
 and sable ewe passing us unperceived
 for who hath eyes that can discern a god
 going or coming if he shun the view

 argument

 ulysses relates to alcino�s his voyage to the infernal regions his
 conference there with the prophet tiresias concerning his return to
 ithaca and gives him an account of the heroes heroines and others whom
 he saw there


 arriving on the shore and launching first
 our bark into the sacred deep we set
 our mast and sails and stow'd secure on board
 the ram and ewe then weeping and with hearts
 sad and disconsolate embark'd ourselves
 and now melodious circe nymph divine
 sent after us a canvasstretching breeze
 pleasant companion of our course and we
 the decks and benches clear'd untoiling sat
 while managed gales sped swift the bark along 10
 all day with sails distended e'er the deep
 she flew and when the sun at length declined
 and twilight dim had shadow'd all the ways
 approach'd the bourn of ocean's vast profound
 the city there of the cimmerians stands
 with clouds and darkness veil'd on whom the sun
 deigns not to look with his beamdarting eye
 or when he climbs the starry arch or when
 earthward he slopes again his west'ring wheels40
 but sad night canopies the woeful race 20
 we haled the bark aground and landing there
 the ram and sable ewe journey'd beside
 the deep till we arrived where circe bade
 here perimedes' son eurylochus
 held fast the destined sacrifice while i
 scoop'd with my sword the soil op'ning a trench
 ellbroad on ev'ry side then pour'd around
 libation consecrate to all the dead
 first milk with honey mixt then luscious wine
 then water sprinkling last meal over all 30
 this done adoring the unreal forms
 and shadows of the dead i vow'd to slay
 return'd to ithaca in my own abode
 an heifer barren yet fairest and best
 of all my herds and to enrich the pile
 with delicacies such as please the shades
 but in peculiar to the theban seer
 i vow'd a sable ram largest and best
 of all my flocks when thus i had implored
 with vows and pray'r the nations of the dead 40
 piercing the victims next i turn'd them both
 to bleed into the trench then swarming came
 from erebus the shades of the deceased
 brides youths unwedded seniors long with woe
 oppress'd and tender girls yet new to grief
 came also many a warrior by the spear
 in battle pierced with armour goredistain'd
 and all the multitude around the foss
 stalk'd shrieking dreadful me pale horror seized
 i next importunate my people urged 50
 flaying the victims which myself had slain
 to burn them and to supplicate in pray'r
 illustrious pluto and dread proserpine
 then down i sat and with drawn faulchion chased
 the ghosts nor suffer'd them to approach the blood
 till with tiresias i should first confer
 the spirit first of my companion came
 elpenor for no burial honours yet
 had he received but we had left his corse
 in circe's palace tombless undeplored 60
 ourselves by pressure urged of other cares
 touch'd with compassion seeing him i wept
 and in wing'd accents brief him thus bespake
 elpenor how cam'st thou into the realms
 of darkness hast thou though on foot so far
 outstripp'd my speed who in my bark arrived
 so i to whom with tears he thus replied
 laertes' noble son for wiles renown'd
 fool'd by some d�mon and the intemp'rate bowl
 i perish'd in the house of circe there 70
 the deepdescending steps heedless i miss'd
 and fell precipitated from the roof
 with neckbone broken from the vertebr�
 outstretch'd i lay my spirit sought the shades
 but now by those whom thou hast left at home
 by thy penelope and by thy fire
 the gentle nourisher of thy infant growth
 and by thy only son telemachus
 i make my suit to thee for sure i know
 that from the house of pluto safe return'd 80
 thou shalt ere long thy gallant vessel moor
 at the ��an isle ah there arrived
 remember me leave me not undeplored
 nor uninhumed lest for my sake the gods
 in vengeance visit thee but with my arms
 what arms soe'er i left burn me and raise
 a kind memorial of me on the coast
 heap'd high with earth that an unhappy man
 may yet enjoy an unforgotten name
 thus do at my request and on my hill 90
 funereal plant the oar with which i row'd
 while yet i lived a mariner of thine
 he spake to whom thus answer i return'd
 poor youth i will perform thy whole desire
 thus we there sitting doleful converse held
 with outstretch'd faulchion i guarding the blood
 and my companion's shadowy semblance sad
 meantime discoursing me on various themes
 the soul of my departed mother next
 of anticleia came daughter of brave 100
 autolycus whom when i sought the shores
 of ilium i had living left at home
 seeing her with compassion touch'd i wept
 yet even her although it pain'd my soul
 forbad relentless to approach the blood
 till with tiresias i should first confer
 then came the spirit of the theban seer
 himself his golden sceptre in his hand
 who knew me and enquiring thus began
 why hapless chief leaving the cheerful day 110
 arriv'st thou to behold the dead and this
 unpleasant land but from the trench awhile
 receding turn thy faulchion keen away
 that i may drink the blood and tell thee truth
 he spake i thence receding deep infix'd
 my sword brightstudded in the sheath again
 the noble prophet then approaching drank
 the blood and satisfied address'd me thus
 thou seek'st a pleasant voyage home again
 renown'd ulysses but a god will make 120
 that voyage difficult for as i judge
 thou wilt not pass by neptune unperceiv'd
 whose anger follows thee for that thou hast
 deprived his son cyclops of his eye
 at length however after num'rous woes
 endur'd thou may'st attain thy native isle
 if thy own appetite thou wilt controul
 and theirs who follow thee what time thy bark
 wellbuilt shall at thrinacia's shore arrive41
 escaped from perils of the gloomy deep 130
 there shall ye find grazing the flocks and herds
 of the allseeing and allhearing sun
 which if attentive to thy safe return
 thou leave unharm'd though after num'rous woes
 ye may at length arrive in ithaca
 but if thou violate them i denounce
 destruction on thy ship and all thy band
 and though thyself escape late shalt thou reach
 thy home and hardbested42 in a strange bark
 all thy companions lost trouble beside 140
 awaits thee there for thou shalt find within
 proud suitors of thy noble wife who waste
 thy substance and with promis'd spousal gifts
 ceaseless solicit her to wed yet well
 shalt thou avenge all their injurious deeds
 that once perform'd and ev'ry suitor slain
 either by stratagem or face to face
 in thy own palace bearing as thou go'st
 a shapely oar journey till thou hast found
 a people who the sea know not nor eat 150
 food salted they trim galley crimson prow'd
 have ne'er beheld nor yet smoothshaven oar
 with which the vessel wing'd scuds o'er the waves
 well thou shalt know them this shall be the sign
 when thou shalt meet a trav'ler who shall name
 the oar on thy broad shoulder borne a van43
 there deep infixing it within the soil
 worship the king of ocean with a bull
 a ram and a lascivious boar then seek
 thy home again and sacrifice at home 160
 an hecatomb to the immortal gods
 adoring each duly and in his course
 so shalt thou die in peace a gentle death
 remote from ocean it shall find thee late
 in soft serenity of age the chief
 of a blest peoplei have told thee truth
 he spake to whom i answer thus return'd
 tiresias thou i doubt not hast reveal'd
 the ordinance of heav'n but tell me seer
 and truly i behold my mother's shade 170
 silent she sits beside the blood nor word
 nor even look vouchsafes to her own son
 how shall she learn prophet that i am her's
 so i to whom tiresias quick replied
 the course is easy learn it taught by me
 what shade soe'er by leave of thee obtain'd
 shall taste the blood that shade will tell thee truth
 the rest prohibited will all retire
 when thus the spirit of the royal seer
 had his prophetic mind reveal'd again 180
 he enter'd pluto's gates but i unmoved
 still waited till my mother's shade approach'd
 she drank the blood then knew me and in words
 wing'd with affection plaintive thus began
 my son how hast thou enter'd still alive
 this darksome region difficult it is
 for living man to view the realms of death
 broad rivers roll and awful floods between
 but chief the ocean which to pass on foot
 or without ship impossible is found 190
 hast thou long wand'ring in thy voyage home
 from ilium with thy ship and crew arrived
 ithaca and thy consort yet unseen
 she spake to whom this answer i return'd
 my mother me necessity constrain'd
 to pluto's dwelling anxious to consult
 theban tiresias for i have not yet
 approach'd achaia nor have touch'd the shore
 of ithaca but suff'ring ceaseless woe
 have roam'd since first in agamemnon's train 200
 i went to combat with the sons of troy
 but speak my mother and the truth alone
 what stroke of fate slew _thee_ fell'st thou a prey
 to some slow malady or by the shafts
 of gentle dian suddenly subdued
 speak to me also of my ancient sire
 and of telemachus whom i left at home
 possess i still unalienate and safe
 my property or hath some happier chief
 admittance free into my fortunes gain'd 210
 no hope subsisting more of my return
 the mind and purpose of my wedded wife
 declare thou also dwells she with our son
 faithful to my domestic interests
 or is she wedded to some chief of greece
 i ceas'd when thus the venerable shade
 not so she faithful still and patient dwells
 thy roof beneath but all her days and nights
 devoting sad to anguish and to tears
 thy fortunes still are thine telemachus 220
 cultivates undisturb'd thy land and sits
 at many a noble banquet such as well
 beseems the splendour of his princely state
 for all invite him at his farm retired
 thy father dwells nor to the city comes
 for aught nor bed nor furniture of bed
 furr'd cloaks or splendid arras he enjoys
 but with his servile hinds all winter sleeps
 in ashes and in dust at the hearthside
 coarsely attired again when summer comes 230
 or genial autumn on the fallen leaves
 in any nook not curious where he finds
 there stretch'd forlorn nourishing grief he weeps
 thy lot enfeebled now by num'rous years
 so perish'd i such fate i also found
 me neither the rightaiming arch'ress struck
 diana with her gentle shafts nor me
 distemper slew my limbs by slow degrees
 but sure bereaving of their little life 240
 but long regret tender solicitude
 and recollection of thy kindness past
 these my ulysses fatal proved to me
 she said i ardent wish'd to clasp the shade
 of my departed mother thrice i sprang
 toward her by desire impetuous urged
 and thrice she flitted from between my arms
 light as a passing shadow or a dream
 then pierced by keener grief in accents wing'd
 with filial earnestness i thus replied 250
 my mother why elud'st thou my attempt
 to clasp thee that ev'n here in pluto's realm
 we might to full satiety indulge
 our grief enfolded in each other's arms
 hath proserpine alas only dispatch'd
 a shadow to me to augment my woe
 then instant thus the venerable form
 ah son thou most afflicted of mankind
 on thee jove's daughter proserpine obtrudes
 no airy semblance vain but such the state 260
 and nature is of mortals once deceased
 for they nor muscle have nor flesh nor bone
 all those the spirit from the body once
 divorced the violence of fire consumes
 and like a dream the soul flies swift away
 but haste thou back to light and taught thyself
 these sacred truths hereafter teach thy spouse
 thus mutual we conferr'd then thither came
 encouraged forth by royal proserpine
 shades female num'rous all who consorts erst 270
 or daughters were of mighty chiefs renown'd
 about the sable blood frequent they swarm'd
 but i consid'ring sat how i might each
 interrogate and thus resolv'd my sword
 forth drawing from beside my sturdy thigh
 firm i prohibited the ghosts to drink
 the blood together they successive came
 each told her own distress i question'd all
 there first the highborn tyro i beheld
 she claim'd salmoneus as her sire and wife 280
 was once of cretheus son of �olus
 enamour'd of enipeus stream divine
 loveliest of all that water earth beside
 his limpid current she was wont to stray
 when ocean's god enipeus' form assumed
 within the eddywhirling river's mouth
 embraced her there while the o'erarching flood
 uplifted mountainous conceal'd the god
 and his fair human bride her virgin zone
 he loos'd and o'er her eyes sweet sleep diffused 290
 his am'rous purpose satisfied he grasp'd
 her hand affectionate and thus he said
 rejoice in this my love and when the year
 shall tend to consummation of its course
 thou shalt produce illustrious twins for love
 immortal never is unfruitful love
 rear them with all a mother's care meantime
 hence to thy home be silent name it not
 for i am neptune shaker of the shores
 so saying he plunged into the billowy deep 300
 she pregnant grown pelias and neleus bore

 he ceased the whole assembly silent sat
 charm'd into ecstacy by his discourse
 throughout the twilight hall till at the last
 areta iv'ry arm'd them thus bespake
 ph�acians how appears he in your eyes
 this stranger graceful as he is in port
 in stature noble and in mind discrete
 my guest he is but ye all share with me 410
 that honour him dismiss not therefore hence
 with haste nor from such indigence withhold
 supplies gratuitous for ye are rich
 and by kind heav'n with rare possessions blest
 the hero next echeneus spake a chief
 now ancient eldest of ph�acia's sons
 your prudent queen my friends speaks not beside
 her proper scope but as beseems her well
 her voice obey yet the effect of all
 must on alcino�s himself depend 420
 to whom alcino�s thus the king replied
 i ratify the word so shall be done
 as surely as myself shall live supreme
 o'er all ph�acia's maritime domain
 then let the guest though anxious to depart
 wait till the morrow that i may complete
 the whole donation his safe conduct home
 shall be the gen'ral care but mine in chief
 to whom dominion o'er the rest belongs
 him answer'd then ulysses everwise 430
 alcino�s prince exalted high o'er all
 ph�acia's sons should ye solicit kind
 my stay throughout the year preparing still
 my conduct home and with illustrious gifts
 enriching me the while ev'n that request
 should please me well the wealthier i return'd
 the happier my condition welcome more
 and more respectable i should appear
 in ev'ry eye to ithaca restored
 to whom alcino�s answer thus return'd 440
 ulysses viewing thee no fears we feel
 lest thou at length some false pretender prove
 or subtle hypocrite of whom no few
 disseminated o'er its face the earth
 sustains adepts in fiction and who frame
 fables where fables could be least surmised
 thy phrase well turn'd and thy ingenuous mind
 proclaim _thee_ diff'rent far who hast in strains
 musical as a poet's voice the woes
 rehears'd of all thy greecians and thy own 450
 but say and tell me true beheld'st thou there
 none of thy followers to the walls of troy
 slain in that warfare lo the night is long
 a night of utmost length nor yet the hour
 invites to sleep tell me thy wond'rous deeds
 for i could watch till sacred dawn could'st thou
 so long endure to tell me of thy toils
 then thus ulysses everwise replied
 alcino�s high exalted over all
 ph�acia's sons the time suffices yet 460
 for converse both and sleep and if thou wish
 to hear still more i shall not spare to unfold
 more pitiable woes than these sustain'd
 by my companions in the end destroy'd
 who saved from perils of disast'rous war
 at ilium perish'd yet in their return
 victims of a pernicious woman's crime48
 now when chaste proserpine had wide dispers'd
 those female shades the spirit sore distress'd
 of agamemnon atreus' son appear'd 470
 encircled by a throng he came by all
 who with himself beneath �gisthus' roof
 their fate fulfill'd perishing by the sword
 he drank the blood and knew me shrill he wail'd
 and querulous tears trickling bathed his cheeks
 and with spread palms through ardour of desire
 he sought to enfold me fast but vigour none
 or force as erst his agile limbs inform'd
 i pitymoved wept at the sight and him
 in accents wing'd by friendship thus address'd 480
 ah glorious son of atreus king of men
 what hand inflicted the allnumbing stroke
 of death on thee say didst thou perish sunk
 by howling tempests irresistible
 which neptune raised or on dry land by force
 of hostile multitudes while cutting off
 beeves from the herd or driving flocks away
 or fighting for achaia's daughters shut
 within some city's bulwarks close besieged
 i ceased when agamemnon thus replied 490
 ulysses noble chief laertes' son
 for wisdom famed i neither perish'd sunk
 by howling tempests irresistible
 which neptune raised nor on dry land received
 from hostile multitudes the fatal blow
 but me �gisthus slew my woeful death
 confed'rate with my own pernicious wife
 he plotted with a show of love sincere
 bidding me to his board where as the ox
 is slaughter'd at his crib he slaughter'd _me_ 500
 such was my dreadful death carnage ensued
 continual of my friends slain all around
 num'rous as boars brighttusk'd at nuptial feast
 or feast convivial of some wealthy chief
 thou hast already witness'd many a field
 with warriors overspread slain one by one
 but that dire scene had most thy pity moved
 for we with brimming beakers at our side
 and underneath full tables bleeding lay
 blood floated all the pavement then the cries 510
 of priam's daughter sounded in my ears
 most pitiable of all cassandra's cries
 whom clytemnestra close beside me slew
 expiring as i lay i yet essay'd
 to grasp my faulchion but the trayt'ress quick
 withdrew herself nor would vouchsafe to close
 my languid eyes or prop my drooping chin
 ev'n in the moment when i sought the shades
 so that the thing breathes not ruthless and fell
 as woman once resolv'd on such a deed 520
 detestable as my base wife contrived
 the murther of the husband of her youth
 i thought to have return'd welcome to all
 to my own children and domestic train
 but she past measure profligate hath poured
 shame on herself on women yet unborn
 and even on the virtuous of her sex
 he ceas'd to whom thus answer i return'd
 gods how severely hath the thund'rer plagued
 the house of atreus even from the first 530
 by female counsels we for helen's sake
 have num'rous died and clytemnestra framed
 while thou wast far remote this snare for thee
 so i to whom atrides thus replied
 thou therefore be not pliant overmuch
 to woman trust her not with all thy mind
 but half disclose to her and half conceal
 yet from thy consort's hand no bloody death
 my friend hast thou to fear for passing wise
 icarius' daughter is far other thoughts 540
 intelligent and other plans to frame
 her going to the wars we left a bride
 newwedded and thy boy hung at her breast
 who man himself consorts ere now with men
 a prosp'rous youth his father safe restored
 to his own ithaca shall see him soon
 and _he_ shall clasp his father in his arms
 as nature bids but me my cruel one
 indulged not with the dear delight to gaze
 on my orestes for she slew me first 550
 but listen treasure what i now impart49
 steer secret to thy native isle avoid
 notice for woman merits trust no more
 now tell me truth hear ye in whose abode
 my son resides dwells he in pylus say
 or in orchomenos or else beneath
 my brother's roof in sparta's wide domain
 for my orestes is not yet a shade
 so he to whom i answer thus return'd
 atrides ask not me whether he live 560
 or have already died i nothing know
 mere words are vanity and better spared
 thus we discoursing mutual stood and tears
 shedding disconsolate the shade meantime
 came of achilles peleus' mighty son
 patroclus also and antilochus
 appear'd with ajax for proportion just
 and stature tall pelides sole except
 distinguish'd above all achaia's sons
 the soul of swift �acides at once 570
 knew me and in wing'd accents thus began
 brave laertiades for wiles renown'd
 what mightier enterprise than all the past
 hath made thee here a guest rash as thou art
 how hast thou dared to penetrate the gloom
 of ades dwelling of the shadowy dead
 semblances only of what once they were
 he spake to whom i answ'ring thus replied
 o peleus' son achilles bravest far
 of all achaia's race i here arrived 580
 seeking tiresias from his lips to learn
 perchance how i might safe regain the coast
 of craggy ithaca for tempesttoss'd
 perpetual i have neither yet approach'd
 achaia's shore or landed on my own
 but as for thee achilles never man
 hath known felicity like thine or shall
 whom living we all honour'd as a god
 and who maintain'st here resident supreme
 controul among the dead indulge not then 590
 achilles causeless grief that thou hast died
 i ceased and answer thus instant received
 renown'd ulysses think not death a theme
 of consolation i had rather live
 the servile hind for hire and eat the bread
 of some man scantily himself sustain'd
 than sov'reign empire hold o'er all the shades
 but comespeak to me of my noble boy
 proceeds he as he promis'd brave in arms
 or shuns he war say also hast thou heard 600
 of royal peleus shares he still respect
 among his num'rous myrmidons or scorn
 in hellas and in phthia for that age
 predominates in his enfeebled limbs
 for help is none in me the glorious sun
 no longer sees me such as when in aid
 of the achaians i o'erspread the field
 of spacious troy with all their bravest slain
 oh might i vigorous as then repair50
 for one short moment to my father's house 610
 they all should tremble i would shew an arm
 such as should daunt the fiercest who presumes
 to injure _him_ or to despise his age
 achilles spake to whom i thus replied
 of noble peleus have i nothing heard
 but i will tell thee as thou bidd'st the truth
 unfeign'd of neoptolemus thy son
 for him myself on board my hollow bark
 from scyros to achaia's host convey'd
 oft as in council under ilium's walls 620
 we met he ever foremost was in speech
 nor spake erroneous nestor and myself
 except no greecian could with him compare
 oft too as we with battle hemm'd around
 troy's bulwarks from among the mingled crowd
 thy son sprang foremost into martial act
 inferior in heroic worth to none
 beneath him num'rous fell the sons of troy
 in dreadful fight nor have i pow'r to name
 distinctly all who by his glorious arm 630
 exerted in the cause of greece expired
 yet will i name eurypylus the son
 of telephus an hero whom his sword
 of life bereaved and all around him strew'd
 the plain with his cetean warriors won
 to ilium's side by bribes to women giv'n51
 save noble memnon only i beheld
 no chief at ilium beautiful as he
 again when we within the horse of wood
 framed by epe�s sat an ambush chos'n 640
 of all the bravest greeks and i in trust
 was placed to open or to keep fastclosed
 the hollow fraud then ev'ry chieftain there
 and senator of greece wiped from his cheeks
 the tears and tremors felt in ev'ry limb
 but never saw i changed to terror's hue
 _his_ ruddy cheek no tears wiped _he_ away
 but oft he press'd me to go forth his suit
 with pray'rs enforcing griping hard his hilt
 and his brassburthen'd spear and dire revenge 650
 denouncing ardent on the race of troy
 at length when we had sack'd the lofty town
 of priam laden with abundant spoils
 he safe embark'd neither by spear or shaft
 aught hurt or in close fight by faulchion's edge
 as oft in war befalls where wounds are dealt
 promiscuous at the will of fiery mars
 so i then striding large the spirit thence
 withdrew of swift �acides along
 the hoary mead pacing52 with joy elate 660
 that i had blazon'd bright his son's renown
 the other souls of men by death dismiss'd
 stood mournful by sad uttering each his woes
 the soul alone i saw standing remote
 of telamonian ajax still incensed
 that in our public contest for the arms
 worn by achilles and by thetis thrown
 into dispute my claim had strongest proved
 troy and minerva judges of the cause
 disastrous victory which i could wish 670
 not to have won since for that armour's sake
 the earth hath cover'd ajax in his form
 and martial deeds superior far to all
 the greecians peleus' matchless son except
 i seeking to appease him thus began
 o ajax son of glorious telamon
 canst thou remember even after death
 thy wrath against me kindled for the sake
 of those pernicious arms arms which the gods
 ordain'd of such dire consequence to greece 680
 which caused thy death our bulwark thee we mourn
 with grief perpetual nor the death lament
 of peleus' son achilles more than thine
 yet none is blameable jove evermore
 with bitt'rest hate pursued achaia's host
 and he ordain'd thy death hero approach
 that thou may'st hear the words with which i seek
 to sooth thee let thy long displeasure cease
 quell all resentment in thy gen'rous breast
 i spake nought answer'd he but sullen join'd 690
 his fellowghosts yet angry as he was
 i had prevail'd even on him to speak
 or had at least accosted him again
 but that my bosom teem'd with strong desire
 urgent to see yet others of the dead
 there saw i minos offspring famed of jove
 his golden sceptre in his hand he sat
 judge of the dead they pleading each in turn
 his cause some stood some sat filling the house
 whose spacious foldinggates are never closed 700
 orion next huge ghost engaged my view
 droves urging o'er the grassy mead of beasts
 which he had slain himself on the wild hills
 with strong club arm'd of everduring brass
 there also tityus on the ground i saw
 extended offspring of the glorious earth
 nine acres he o'erspread and at his side
 station'd two vultures on his liver prey'd
 scooping his entrails nor sufficed his hands
 to fray them thence for he had sought to force 710
 latona illustrious concubine of jove
 what time the goddess journey'd o'er the rocks
 of pytho into pleasant panopeus
 next suff'ring grievous torments i beheld
 tantalus in a pool he stood his chin
 wash'd by the wave thirstparch'd he seem'd but found
 nought to assuage his thirst for when he bow'd
 his hoary head ardent to quaff the flood
 vanish'd absorb'd and at his feet adust
 the soil appear'd dried instant by the gods 720
 tall trees fruitladen with inflected heads
 stoop'd to him pomegranates apples bright
 the luscious fig and unctuous olive smooth
 which when with sudden grasp he would have seized
 winds hurl'd them high into the dusky clouds
 there too the hardtask'd sisyphus i saw
 thrusting before him strenuous a vast rock53
 with hands and feet struggling he shoved the stone
 up to a hilltop but the steep wellnigh
 vanquish'd by some great force repulsed54 the mass 730
 rush'd again obstinate down to the plain
 again stretch'd prone severe he toiled the sweat
 bathed all his weary limbs and his head reek'd
 the might of hercules i next survey'd
 his semblance for himself their banquet shares
 with the immortal gods and in his arms
 enfolds neatfooted hebe daughter fair

 around him clamorous as birds the dead
 swarm'd turbulent he gloomybrow'd as night 740
 with uncased bow and arrow on the string
 peer'd terrible from side to side as one
 ever in act to shoot a dreadful belt
 he bore athwart his bosom thong'd with gold

 fierce combats battles bloodshed homicide
 the artist author of that belt none such

 book xii

 argument

 ulysses pursuing his narrative relates his return from the shades to
 circe's island the precautions given him by that goddess his escape
 from the sirens and from scylla and charybdis his arrival in sicily
 where his companions having slain and eaten the oxen of the sun are
 afterward shipwrecked and lost and concludes the whole with an account
 of his arrival alone on the mast of his vessel at the island of
 calypso


 and now borne seaward from the riverstream
 of the oceanus we plow'd again
 the spacious deep and reach'd th' ��an isle
 where daughter of the dawn aurora takes
 her choral sports and whence the sun ascends
 we there arriving thrust our bark aground
 on the smooth beach then landed and on shore
 reposed expectant of the sacred dawn
 but soon as dayspring's daughter rosypalm'd
 look'd forth again sending my friends before 10
 i bade them bring elpenor's body down
 from the abode of circe to the beach
 then on the utmost headland of the coast
 we timber fell'd and sorrowing o'er the dead
 his fun'ral rites water'd with tears profuse
 the dead consumed and with the dead his arms
 we heap'd his tomb and the sepulchral post
 erecting fix'd his shapely oar aloft
 thus punctual we perform'd nor our return
 from ades knew not circe but attired 20
 in haste ere long arrived with whom appear'd
 her female train with plenteous viands charged
 and bright wine rosyred amidst us all
 standing the beauteous goddess thus began
 ah miserable who have sought the shades
 alive while others of the human race
 die only once appointed twice to die
 cometake ye food drink wine and on the shore
 all day regale for ye shall hence again
 at dayspring o'er the deep but i will mark 30
 myself your future course nor uninform'd
 leave you in aught lest through some dire mistake
 by sea or land new mis'ries ye incur
 the goddess spake whose invitation kind
 we glad accepted thus we feasting sat
 till set of sun and quaffing richest wine
 but when the sun went down and darkness fell
 my crew beside the hawsers slept while me
 the goddess by the hand leading apart
 first bade me sit then seated opposite 40
 enquired minute of all that i had seen
 and i from first to last recounted all
 then thus the awful goddess in return
 thus far thy toils are finish'd now attend
 mark well my words of which the gods will sure
 themselves remind thee in the needful hour
 first shalt thou reach the sirens they the hearts
 enchant of all who on their coast arrive
 the wretch who unforewarn'd approaching hears
 the sirens' voice his wife and littleones 50
 ne'er fly to gratulate his glad return
 but him the sirens sitting in the meads
 charm with mellifluous song while all around
 the bones accumulated lie of men
 now putrid and the skins mould'ring away
 but pass them thou and lest thy people hear
 those warblings ere thou yet approach fill all
 their ears with wax moulded between thy palms
 but as for theethou hear them if thou wilt
 yet let thy people bind thee to the mast 60
 erect encompassing thy feet and arms
 with cordage wellsecured to the mastfoot
 so shalt thou raptur'd hear the sirens' song
 but if thou supplicate to be released
 or give such order then with added cords
 let thy companions bind thee still the more
 when thus thy people shall have safely pass'd
 the sirens by think not from me to learn
 what course thou next shalt steer two will occur
 delib'rate chuse i shall describe them both 70
 here vaulted rocks impend dash'd by the waves
 immense of amphitrite azureeyed
 the blessed gods those rocks erratic call
 birds cannot pass them safe no not the doves
 which his ambrosia bear to father jove
 but even of those doves the slipp'ry rock
 proves fatal still to one for which the god
 supplies another lest the number fail
 no ship what ship soever there arrives
 escapes them but both mariners and planks 80
 whelm'd under billows of the deep or caught
 by fiery tempests sudden disappear
 those rocks the billowcleaving bark alone
 the argo further'd by the vows of all
 pass'd safely sailing from ��ta's isle
 nor she had pass'd but surely dash'd had been
 on those huge rocks but that propitious still
 to jason juno sped her safe along
 these rocks are two one lifts his summit sharp
 high as the spacious heav'ns wrapt in dun clouds 90
 perpetual which nor autumn sees dispers'd
 nor summer for the sun shines never there
 no mortal man might climb it or descend
 though twice ten hands and twice ten feet he own'd
 for it is levigated as by art
 down scoop'd to erebus a cavern drear
 yawns in the centre of its western side
 pass it renown'd ulysses but aloof
 so far that a keen arrow smartly sent
 forth from thy bark should fail to reach the cave 100
 there scylla dwells and thence her howl is heard
 tremendous shrill her voice is as the note
 of hound newwhelp'd but hideous her aspect
 such as no mortal man nor ev'n a god
 encount'ring her should with delight survey
 her feet are twelve all forefeet six her necks
 of hideous length each clubb'd into a head
 terrific and each head with fangs is arm'd
 in triple row thick planted stored with death
 plunged to her middle in the hollow den 110
 she lurks protruding from the black abyss
 her heads with which the rav'ning monster dives
 in quest of dolphins dogfish or of prey
 more bulky such as in the roaring gulphs
 of amphitrite without end abounds
 it is no seaman's boast that e'er he slipp'd
 her cavern by unharm'd in ev'ry mouth
 she bears upcaught a mariner away
 the other rock ulysses thou shalt find
 humbler a bowshot only from the first 120
 on this a wild fig grows broadleav'd and here
 charybdis dire ingulphs the sable flood
 each day she thrice disgorges and each day
 thrice swallows it ah well forewarn'd beware
 what time she swallows that thou come not nigh
 for not himself neptune could snatch thee thence
 close passing scylla's rock shoot swift thy bark
 beyond it since the loss of six alone
 is better far than shipwreck made of all
 so circe spake to whom i thus replied 130
 tell me o goddess next and tell me true
 if chance from fell charybdis i escape
 may i not also save from scylla's force
 my people should the monster threaten them
 i said and quick the goddess in return
 unhappy can exploits and toils of war
 still please thee yield'st not to the gods themselves
 she is no mortal but a deathless pest
 impracticable savage battleproof
 defence is vain flight is thy sole resource 140
 for should'st thou linger putting on thy arms
 beside the rock beware lest darting forth
 her num'rous heads she seize with ev'ry mouth
 a greecian and with others even thee
 pass therefore swift and passing loud invoke
 cratais mother of this plague of man
 who will forbid her to assail thee more
 thou next shalt reach thrinacia there the beeves
 and fatted flocks graze num'rous of the sun
 sev'n herds as many flocks of snowy fleece 150
 fifty in each they breed not neither die
 nor are they kept by less than goddesses
 lampetia fair and ph�ethusa both
 by nymph ne�ra to hyperion borne
 them soon as she had train'd them to an age
 proportion'd to that charge their mother sent
 into thrinacia there to dwell and keep
 inviolate their father's flocks and herds
 if anxious for a safe return thou spare
 those herds and flocks though after much endured 160
 ye may at last your ithaca regain
 but should'st thou violate them i foretell
 destruction of thy ship and of thy crew
 and though thyself escape thou shalt return
 late in ill plight and all thy friends destroy'd
 she ended and the golden morning dawn'd
 then alldivine her graceful steps she turn'd
 back through the isle and at the beach arrived
 i summon'd all my followers to ascend
 the bark again and cast the hawsers loose 170
 they at my voice embarking fill'd in ranks
 the seats and rowing thresh'd the hoary flood
 and now melodious circe nymph divine
 sent after us a canvasstretching breeze
 pleasant companion of our course and we
 the decks and benches clear'd untoiling sat
 while managed gales sped swift the bark along
 then with dejected heart thus i began
 oh friends for it is needful that not one
 or two alone the admonition hear 180
 of circe beauteous prophetess divine
 to all i speak that whether we escape
 or perish all may be at least forewarn'd
 she bids us first avoid the dang'rous song
 of the sweet sirens and their flow'ry meads
 me only she permits those strains to hear
 but ye shall bind me with coercion strong
 of cordage wellsecured to the mastfoot
 and by no struggles to be loos'd of mine
 but should i supplicate to be released 190
 or give such order then with added cords
 be it your part to bind me still the more
 thus with distinct precaution i prepared
 my people rapid in her course meantime
 my gallant bark approach'd the sirens' isle
 for brisk and favourable blew the wind
 then fell the wind suddenly and serene
 a breathless calm ensued while all around
 the billows slumber'd lull'd by pow'r divine
 upsprang my people and the folded sails 200
 bestowing in the hold sat to their oars
 which with their polish'd blades whiten'd the deep
 i then with edge of steel sev'ring minute
 a waxen cake chafed it and moulded it
 between my palms ere long the ductile mass
 grew warm obedient to that ceaseless force
 and to hyperion's allpervading beams
 with that soft liniment i fill'd the ears
 of my companions man by man and they
 my feet and arms with strong coercion bound 210
 of cordage to the mastfoot well secured
 then down they sat and rowing thresh'd the brine
 but when with rapid course we had arrived
 within such distance as a voice may reach
 not unperceived by them the gliding bark
 approach'd and thus harmonious they began
 ulysses chief by ev'ry tongue extoll'd
 achaia's boast oh hither steer thy bark
 here stay thy course and listen to our lay
 these shores none passes in his sable ship 220
 till first the warblings of our voice he hear
 then happier hence and wiser he departs
 all that the greeks endured and all the ills
 inflicted by the gods on troy we know
 know all that passes on the boundless earth
 so they with voices sweet their music poured
 melodious on my ear winning with ease
 my heart's desire to listen and by signs
 i bade my people instant set me free
 but they incumbent row'd and from their seats 230
 eurylochus and perimedes sprang
 with added cords to bind me still the more
 this danger past and when the sirens' voice
 now left remote had lost its pow'r to charm
 then my companions freeing from the wax
 their ears deliver'd me from my restraint
 the island left afar soon i discern'd
 huge waves and smoke and horrid thund'rings heard
 all sat aghast forth flew at once the oars
 from ev'ry hand and with a clash the waves 240
 smote all together check'd the galley stood
 by billowsweeping oars no longer urged
 and i throughout the bark man after man
 encouraged all addressing thus my crew
 we meet not now my friends our first distress
 this evil is not greater than we found
 when the huge cyclops in his hollow den
 imprison'd us yet even thence we 'scaped
 my intrepidity and fertile thought
 opening the way and we shall recollect 250
 these dangers also in due time with joy
 come thenpursue my counsel ye your seats
 still occupying smite the furrow'd flood
 with welltimed strokes that by the will of jove
 we may escape perchance this death secure
 to thee the pilot thus i speak my words
 mark thou for at thy touch the rudder moves
 this smoke and these tumultuous waves avoid
 steer wide of both yet with an eye intent
 on yonder rock lest unaware thou hold 260
 too near a course and plunge us into harm
 so i with whose advice all quick complied
 but scylla i as yet named not that woe
 without a cure lest terrified my crew
 should all renounce their oars and crowd below
 just then forgetful of the strict command
 of circe not to arm i cloath'd me all
 in radiant armour grasp'd two quiv'ring spears
 and to the deck ascended at the prow
 expecting earliest notice there what time 270
 the rockbred scylla should annoy my friends
 but i discern'd her not nor could although
 to weariness of sight the dusky rock
 i vigilant explored thus many a groan
 heaving we navigated sad the streight
 for here stood scylla while charybdis there
 with hoarse throat deep absorb'd the briny flood
 oft as she vomited the deluge forth
 like water cauldron'd o'er a furious fire
 the whirling deep all murmur'd and the spray 280
 on both those rocky summits fell in show'rs
 but when she suck'd the salt wave down again
 then all the pool appear'd wheeling about
 within the rock rebellow'd and the sea
 drawn off into that gulph disclosed to view
 the oozy bottom us pale horror seized
 thus dreading death with fastset eyes we watch'd
 charybdis meantime scylla from the bark
 caught six away the bravest of my friends
 with eyes that moment on my ship and crew 290
 retorted i beheld the legs and arms
 of those whom she uplifted in the air
 on me they call'd my name the last last time
 pronouncing then in agony of heart
 as when from some bold point among the rocks
 the angler with his taper rod in hand
 casts forth his bait to snare the smaller fry
 he swings away remote his guarded line56
 then jerks his gasping prey forth from the deep
 so scylla them raised gasping to the rock 300
 and at her cavern's mouth devour'd them loud
 shrieking and stretching forth to me their arms
 in sign of hopeless mis'ry ne'er beheld
 these eyes in all the seas that i have roam'd
 a sight so piteous nor in all my toils
 from scylla and charybdis dire escaped
 we reach'd the noble island of the sun
 ere long where bright hyperion's beauteous herds
 broadfronted grazed and his wellbatten'd flocks
 i in the bark and on the sea the voice 310
 of oxen bellowing in hovels heard
 and of loudbleating sheep then dropp'd the word
 into my memory of the sightless seer
 theban tiresias and the caution strict
 of circe my ��an monitress
 who with such force had caution'd me to avoid
 the island of the sun joy of mankind
 thus then to my companions sad i spake
 hear ye my friends although long time distress'd
 the words prophetic of the theban seer 320
 and of ��an circe whose advice
 was oft repeated to me to avoid
 this island of the sun joy of mankind
 there said the goddess dread your heaviest woes
 pass the isle therefore scudding swift away
 i ceased they me with consternation heard
 and harshly thus eurylochus replied
 ulysses ruthless chief no toils impair
 thy strength of senseless iron thou art form'd
 who thy companions weary and o'erwatch'd 330
 forbidd'st to disembark on this fair isle
 where now at last we might with ease regale
 thou rash command'st us leaving it afar
 to roam all night the ocean's dreary waste
 but winds to ships injurious spring by night
 and how shall we escape a dreadful death
 if chance a sudden gust from south arise
 or stormy west that dash in pieces oft
 the vessel even in the gods' despight
 prepare we rather now as night enjoins 340
 our evening fare beside the sable bark
 in which at peep of day we may again
 launch forth secure into the boundless flood
 he ceas'd whom all applauded then i knew
 that sorrow by the will of adverse heav'n
 approach'd and in wing'd accents thus replied
 i suffer force eurylochus and yield
 o'erruled by numbers come then swear ye all
 a solemn oath that should we find an herd
 or num'rous flock none here shall either sheep 350
 or bullock slay by appetite profane
 seduced but shall the viands eat content
 which from immortal circe we received
 i spake they readily a solemn oath
 sware all and when their oath was fully sworn
 within a creek where a fresh fountain rose
 they moor'd the bark and issuing began
 brisk preparation of their evening cheer
 but when nor hunger now nor thirst remain'd
 unsated recollecting then their friends 360
 by scylla seized and at her cave devour'd
 they mourn'd nor ceased to mourn them till they slept
 the night's third portion come when now the stars
 had travers'd the midsky cloudgath'rer jove
 call'd forth a vehement wind with tempest charged
 menacing earth and sea with pitchy clouds
 tremendous and the night fell dark from heav'n
 but when aurora daughter of the day
 look'd rosy forth we haled drawn inland more
 our bark into a grot where nymphs were wont 370
 graceful to tread the dance or to repose
 convening there my friends i thus began
 my friends food fails us not but bread is yet
 and wine on board abstain we from the herds
 lest harm ensue for ye behold the flocks
 and herds of a most potent god the sun
 whose eye and watchful ear none may elude
 so saying i sway'd the gen'rous minds of all
 a month complete the south wind ceaseless blew
 nor other wind blew next save east and south 380
 yet they while neither food nor rosy wine
 fail'd them the herds harm'd not through fear to die
 but our provisions failing they employed
 whole days in search of food snaring with hooks
 birds fishes of what kind soe'er they might
 by famine urged i solitary roam'd
 meantime the isle seeking by pray'r to move
 some god to shew us a deliv'rance thence
 when roving thus the isle i had at length
 left all my crew remote laving my hands 390
 where shelter warm i found from the rude blast
 i supplicated ev'ry pow'r above
 but they my pray'rs answer'd with slumbers soft
 shed o'er my eyes and with pernicious art
 eurylochus the while my friends harangued
 my friends afflicted as ye are yet hear
 a fellowsuff'rer death however caused
 abhorrence moves in miserable man
 but death by famine is a fate of all
 most to be fear'd comelet us hither drive 400
 and sacrifice to the immortal pow'rs
 the best of all the oxen of the sun
 resolving thusthat soon as we shall reach
 our native ithaca we will erect
 to bright hyperion an illustrious fane
 which with magnificent and num'rous gifts
 we will enrich but should he chuse to sink
 our vessel for his stately beeves incensed
 and should with him all heav'n conspire our death
 i rather had with open mouth at once 410
 meeting the billows perish than by slow
 and pining waste here in this desert isle
 so spake eurylochus whom all approved
 then driving all the fattest of the herd
 few paces only for the sacred beeves
 grazed rarely distant from the bark they stood
 compassing them around and grasping each
 green foliage newly pluck'd from saplings tall
 for barley none in all our bark remain'd
 worshipp'd the gods in pray'r pray'r made they slew
 and flay'd them and the thighs with double fat 421
 investing spread them o'er with slices crude
 no wine had they with which to consecrate
 the blazing rites but with libation poor
 of water hallow'd the interior parts
 now when the thighs were burnt and each had shared
 his portion of the maw and when the rest
 allslash'd and scored hung roasting at the fire
 sleep in that moment suddenly my eyes
 forsaking to the shore i bent my way 430
 but ere the station of our bark i reach'd
 the sav'ry steam greeted me at the scent
 i wept aloud and to the gods exclaim'd
 oh jupiter and all ye pow'rs above
 with cruel sleep and fatal ye have lull'd
 my cares to rest such horrible offence
 meantime my rash companions have devised
 then flew longstoled lampetia to the sun
 at once with tidings of his slaughter'd beeves
 and he incensed the immortals thus address'd 440
 jove and ye everlasting pow'rs divine
 avenge me instant on the crew profane
 of laertiades ulysses' friends
 have dared to slay my beeves which i with joy
 beheld both when i climb'd the starry heav'ns
 and when to earth i sloped my "westring wheels"
 but if they yield me not amercement due
 and honourable for my loss to hell
 i will descend and give the ghosts my beams
 then thus the cloudassembler god replied 450
 sun shine thou still on the immortal pow'rs
 and on the teeming earth frail man's abode
 my candent bolts can in a moment reach
 and split their flying bark in the midsea
 these things calypso told me taught herself
 by herald hermes as she oft affirm'd
 but when descending to the shore i reach'd
 at length my bark with aspect stern and tone
 i reprimanded them yet no redress
 could frame or remedythe beeves were dead 460
 soon follow'd signs portentous sent from heav'n
 the skins all crept and on the spits the flesh
 both roast and raw bellow'd as with the voice
 of living beeves thus my devoted friends
 driving the fattest oxen of the sun
 feasted six days entire but when the sev'nth
 by mandate of saturnian jove appeared
 the storm then ceased to rage and we again
 embarking launch'd our galley rear'd the mast
 and gave our unfurl'd canvas to the wind 470
 the island left afar and other land
 appearing none but sky alone and sea
 right o'er the hollow bark saturnian jove
 hung a c�rulean cloud dark'ning the deep
 not long my vessel ran for blowing wild
 now came shrill zephyrus a stormy gust
 snapp'd sheer the shrouds on both sides backward fell
 the mast and with loose tackle strew'd the hold
 striking the pilot in the stern it crush'd
 his scull together he a diver's plunge 480
 made downward and his noble spirit fled
 meantime jove thund'ring hurl'd into the ship
 his bolts she smitten by the fires of jove
 quaked all her length with sulphur fill'd she reek'd
 and o'er her sides headlong my people plunged
 like seamews interdicted by that stroke
 of wrath divine to hope their country more
 but i the vessel still paced to and fro
 till fever'd by the boist'rous waves her sides
 forsook the keel now left to float alone 490
 snapp'd where it join'd the keel the mast had fall'n
 but fell encircled with a leathern brace
 which it retain'd binding with this the mast
 and keel together on them both i sat
 borne helpless onward by the dreadful gale
 and now the west subsided and the south
 arose instead with mis'ry charged for me
 that i might measure back my course again
 to dire charybdis all night long i drove
 and when the sun arose at scylla's rock 500
 once more and at charybdis' gulph arrived
 it was the time when she absorb'd profound
 the briny flood but by a wave upborne
 i seized the branches fast of the wildfig57
 to which batlike i clung yet where to fix
 my foot secure found not or where to ascend
 for distant lay the roots and distant shot
 the largest arms erect into the air
 o'ershadowing all charybdis therefore hard
 i clench'd the boughs till she disgorg'd again 510
 both keel and mast not undesired by me
 they came though late for at what hour the judge
 after decision made of num'rous strifes58
 between young candidates for honour leaves
 the forum for refreshment' sake at home
 then was it that the mast and keel emerged
 deliver'd to a voluntary fall
 fast by those beams i dash'd into the flood
 and seated on them both with oary palms
 impell'd them nor the sire of gods and men 520
 permitted scylla to discern me more
 else had i perish'd by her fangs at last
 nine days i floated thence and on the tenth
 dark night the gods convey'd me to the isle
 ogygia habitation of divine
 calypso by whose hospitable aid
 and assiduity my strength revived
 but wherefore this ye have already learn'd
 that hist'ry thou and thy illustrious spouse
 i told it yesterday and hate a tale 530
 once amply told then needless traced again

 argument

 ulysses having finished his narrative and received additional presents
 from the ph�acians embarks he is conveyed in his sleep to ithaca and
 in his sleep is landed on that island the ship that carried him is in
 her return transformed by neptune to a rock

 minerva meets him on the shore enables him to recollect his country
 which till enlightened by her he believed to be a country strange to
 him and they concert together the means of destroying the suitors the
 goddess then repairs to sparta to call thence telemachus and ulysses by
 her aid disguised like a beggar proceeds towards the cottage of eum�us


 he ceas'd the whole assembly silent sat
 charm'd into ecstacy with his discourse
 throughout the twilight hall then thus the king
 ulysses since beneath my brazen dome
 sublime thou hast arrived like woes i trust
 thou shalt not in thy voyage hence sustain
 by tempests tost though much to woe inured
 to you who daily in my presence quaff
 your princely meed of gen'rous wine and hear
 the sacred bard my pleasure thus i speak 10
 the robes wrought gold and all the other gifts
 to this our guest by the ph�acian chiefs
 brought hither in the sumptuous coffer lie
 but comepresent ye to the stranger each
 an ample tripod also with a vase
 of smaller size for which we will be paid
 by public impost for the charge of all
 excessive were by one alone defray'd
 so spake alcino�s and his counsel pleased
 then all retiring sought repose at home 20
 but when aurora daughter of the dawn
 look'd rosy forth each hasted to the bark
 with his illustrious present which the might
 of king alcino�s who himself her sides
 ascended safe beneath the seats bestowed
 lest it should harm or hinder while he toil'd
 in rowing some ph�acian of the crew
 the palace of alcino�s seeking next
 together they prepared a new regale
 for them in sacrifice the sacred might59 30
 of king alcino�s slew an ox to jove
 saturnian cloudgirt governor of all
 the thighs with fire prepared all glad partook
 the noble feast meantime the bard divine
 sang sweet demodocus the people's joy
 but oft ulysses to the radiant sun
 turn'd wistful eyes anxious for his decline
 nor longer now patient of dull delay
 as when some hungry swain whose sable beeves
 have through the fallow dragg'd his pond'rous plow 40
 all day the setting sun views with delight
 for supper' sake which with tir'd feet he seeks
 so welcome to ulysses' eyes appear'd
 the sunset of that eve directing then
 his speech to maritime ph�acia's sons
 but to alcino�s chiefly thus he said
 alcino�s o'er ph�acia's realm supreme
 libation made dismiss ye me in peace
 and farewell all for what i wish'd i have
 conductors hence and honourable gifts 50
 with which heav'n prosper me and may the gods
 vouchsafe to me at my return to find
 all safe my spotless consort and my friends
 may ye whom here i leave gladden your wives
 and see your children blest and may the pow'rs
 immortal with all good enrich you all
 and from calamity preserve the land
 he ended they unanimous his speech
 applauded loud and bade dismiss the guest
 who had so wisely spoken and so well 60
 then thus alcino�s to his herald spake
 pontono�s charging high the beaker bear
 to ev'ry guest beneath our roof the wine
 that pray'r preferr'd to the eternal sire
 we may dismiss our inmate to his home
 then bore pontono�s to ev'ry guest
 the brimming cup they where they sat perform'd
 libation due but the illustrious chief
 ulysses from his seat arising placed
 a massy goblet in areta's hand 70
 to whom in accents wing'd grateful he said
 farewell o queen a long farewell till age
 arrive and death the appointed lot of all
 i go but be this people and the king
 alcino�s and thy progeny thy joy
 yet many a year beneath this glorious roof
 so saying the hero through the palacegate
 issued whom by alcino�s' command
 the royal herald to his vessel led
 three maidens also of areta's train 80
 his steps attended one the robe wellbleach'd
 and tunic bore the corded coffer one
 and food the third with wine of crimson hue
 arriving where the galley rode each gave
 her charge to some brave mariner on board
 and all was safely stow'd meantime were spread
 linen and arras on the deck astern
 for his secure repose and now the chief
 himself embarking silent lay'd him down
 then ev'ry rower to his bench repair'd 90
 they drew the loosen'd cable from its hold
 in the drill'd rock and resupine at once
 with lusty strokes upturn'd the flashing waves
 _his_ eyelids soon sleep falling as a dew
 closed fast death's simular in sight the same
 she as four harness'd stallions o'er the plain
 shooting together at the scourge's stroke
 toss high their manes and rapid scour along
 so mounted she the waves while dark the flood
 roll'd after her of the resounding deep 100
 steady she ran and safe passing in speed
 the falcon swiftest of the fowls of heav'n
 with such rapidity she cut the waves
 an hero bearing like the gods above
 in wisdom one familiar long with woe
 in fight sustain'd and on the perilous flood
 though sleeping now serenely and resign'd
 to sweet oblivion of all sorrow past
 the brightest star of heav'n precursor chief
 of dayspring now arose when at the isle 110
 her voyage soon perform'd the bark arrived
 there is a port sacred in ithaca
 to phorcys hoary ancient of the deep
 form'd by converging shores prominent both
 and both abrupt which from the spacious bay
 exclude all boist'rous winds within it ships
 the port once gain'd uncabled ride secure
 an olive at the haven's head expands
 her branches wide near to a pleasant cave
 umbrageous to the nymphs devoted named 120
 the naiads in that cave beakers of stone
 and jars are seen bees lodge their honey there
 and there on slender spindles of the rock
 the nymphs of rivers weave their wond'rous robes
 perennial springs water it and it shows
 a twofold entrance ingress one affords
 to mortal man which northward looks direct
 but holier is the southern far by that
 no mortal enters but the gods alone
 familiar with that port before they push'd 130
 the vessel in she rapid plow'd the sands
 with half her keel such rowers urged her on
 descending from the wellbench'd bark ashore
 they lifted forth ulysses first with all
 his splendid couch complete then lay'd him down
 still wrapt in balmy slumber on the sands
 his treasures next by the ph�acian chiefs
 at his departure given him as the meed
 due to his wisdom at the olive's foot
 they heap'd without the road lest while he slept 140
 some passing traveller should rifle them
 then homeward thence they sped nor ocean's god
 his threats forgot denounced against divine
 ulysses but with jove thus first advised
 eternal sire i shall no longer share
 respect and reverence among the gods
 since now ph�acia's mortal race have ceas'd
 to honour me though from myself derived
 it was my purpose that by many an ill
 harass'd ulysses should have reach'd his home 150
 although to intercept him whose return
 thyself had promis'd ne'er was my intent
 but him fastsleeping swiftly o'er the waves
 they have conducted and have set him down
 in ithaca with countless gifts enrich'd
 with brass and tissued raiment and with gold
 much treasure more than he had home convey'd
 even had he arrived with all his share
 allotted to him of the spoils of troy
 to whom the cloudassembler god replied 160
 what hast thou spoken shaker of the shores
 wideruling neptune fear not thee the gods
 will ne'er despise dangerous were the deed
 to cast dishonour on a god by birth
 more ancient and more potent far than they
 but if profanely rash a mortal man
 should dare to slight thee to avenge the wrong
 some future day is ever in thy pow'r
 accomplish all thy pleasure thou art free
 him answer'd then the shaker of the shores 170
 jove cloudenthroned that pleasure i would soon
 perform as thou hast said but that i watch
 thy mind continual fearful to offend
 my purpose is now to destroy amid
 the dreary deep yon fair ph�acian bark
 return'd from safe conveyance of her freight
 so shall they waft such wand'rers home no more
 and she shall hide their city to a rock
 transform'd of mountainous o'ershadowing size
 him then jove answer'd gath'rer of the clouds 180
 perform it o my brother and the deed
 thus done shall best be donewhat time the people
 shall from the city her approach descry
 fix her to stone transform'd but still in shape
 a gallant bark near to the coast that all
 may wonder seeing her transform'd to stone
 of size to hide their city from the view
 these words once heard the shaker of the shores
 instant to scheria maritime abode
 of the ph�acians went arrived he watch'd 190
 and now the flying bark full near approach'd
 when neptune meeting her with outspread palm
 depress'd her at a stroke and she became
 deeprooted stone then neptune went his way
 ph�acia's shipennobled sons meantime
 conferring stood and thus in accents wing'd
 th' amazed spectator to his fellow spake
 ah who hath sudden check'd the vessel's course
 homeward this moment she was all in view
 thus they unconscious of the cause to whom 200
 alcino�s instructing them replied
 ye gods a prophecy now strikes my mind
 with force my father's he was wont to say
 neptune resents it that we safe conduct
 natives of ev'ry region to their home
 he also spake prophetic of a day
 when a ph�acian gallant bark return'd
 after conveyance of a stranger hence
 should perish in the dreary deep and changed
 to a huge mountain cover all the town 210
 so spake my father all whose words we see
 this day fulfill'd thus therefore act we all
 unanimous henceforth no longer bear
 the stranger home when such shall here arrive
 and we will sacrifice without delay
 twelve chosen bulls to neptune if perchance
 he will commiserate us and forbear
 to hide our town behind a mountain's height
 he spake they terrified the bulls prepared
 thus all ph�acia's senators and chiefs 220
 his altar compassing in pray'r adored
 the ocean's god meantime ulysses woke
 unconscious where stretch'd on his native soil
 he lay and knew it not longtime exiled
 for pallas progeny of jove a cloud
 drew dense around him that ere yet agnized
 by others he might wisdom learn from her
 neither to citizens nor yet to friends
 reveal'd nor even to his own espoused
 till first he should avenge complete his wrongs 230
 domestic from those suitors proud sustained
 all objects therefore in the hero's eyes
 seem'd alien footpaths long commodious ports
 heav'nclimbing rocks and trees of amplest growth
 arising fixt he stood his native soil
 contemplating till with expanded palms
 both thighs he smote and plaintive thus began
 ah me what mortal race inhabits here
 rude are they contumacious and unjust
 or hospitable and who fear the gods 240
 where now shall i secrete these num'rous stores
 where wander i myself i would that still
 ph�acians own'd them and i had arrived
 in the dominions of some other king
 magnanimous who would have entertain'd
 and sent me to my native home secure
 now neither know i where to place my wealth
 nor can i leave it here lest it become
 another's prey alas ph�acia's chiefs
 not altogether wise i deem or just 250
 who have misplaced me in another land
 promis'd to bear me to the pleasant shores
 of ithaca but have not so perform'd
 jove guardian of the suppliant's rights who all
 transgressors marks and punishes all wrong
 avenge me on the treach'rous racebut hold
 i will revise my stores so shall i know
 if they have left me here of aught despoiled
 so saying he number'd carefully the gold
 the vases tripods bright and tissued robes 260
 but nothing miss'd of all then he bewail'd
 his native isle with pensive steps and slow
 pacing the border of the billowy flood
 forlorn but while he wept pallas approach'd
 in form a shepherd stripling girlish fair
 in feature such as are the sons of kings
 a sumptuous mantle o'er his shoulders hung
 twicefolded sandals his nice feet upbore
 and a smooth javelin glitter'd in his hand
 ulysses joyful at the sight his steps 270
 turn'd brisk toward her whom he thus address'd
 sweet youth since thee of all mankind i first
 encounter in this land unknown all hail
 come not with purposes of harm to me
 these save and save me also i prefer
 to thee as to some god my pray'r and clasp
 thy knees a suppliant say and tell me true
 what land what people who inhabit here
 is this some isle delightful or a shore
 of fruitful mainland sloping to the sea 280
 then pallas thus goddess c�ruleaneyed
 stranger thou sure art simple or hast dwelt
 far distant hence if of this land thou ask
 it is not trust me of so little note
 but known to many both to those who dwell
 toward the sunrise and to others placed
 behind it distant in the dusky west
 rugged it is not yielding level course
 to the swift steed and yet no barren spot
 however small but rich in wheat and wine 290
 nor wants it rain or fertilising dew
 but pasture green to goats and beeves affords
 trees of all kinds and fountains never dry
 ithaca therefore stranger is a name
 known ev'n at troy a city by report
 at no small distance from achaia's shore
 the goddess ceased then toilenduring chief
 ulysses happy in his native land
 so taught by pallas progeny of jove
 in accents wing'd her answ'ring utter'd prompt 300
 not truth but figments to truth opposite
 for guile in him stood never at a pause
 o'er yonder flood even in spacious crete60
 i heard of ithaca where now it seems
 i have myself with these my stores arrived
 not richer stores than flying thence i left
 to my own children for from crete i fled
 for slaughter of orsilochus the swift
 son of idomeneus whom none in speed
 could equal throughout all that spacious isle 310
 his purpose was to plunder me of all
 my trojan spoils which to obtain much woe
 i had in battle and by storms endured
 for that i would not gratify his sire
 fighting beside him in the fields of troy
 but led a diff'rent band him from the field
 returning homeward with my brazen spear
 i smote in ambush waiting his return
 at the roadside with a confed'rate friend
 unwonted darkness over all the heav'ns 320
 that night prevailed nor any eye of man
 observed us but unseen i slew the youth
 no sooner then with my sharp spear of life
 i had bereft him than i sought a ship
 mann'd by renown'd ph�acians whom with gifts
 part of my spoils and by requests i won
 i bade them land me on the pylian shore
 or in fair elis by th' epeans ruled
 but they reluctant were by violent winds
 driv'n devious thence for fraud they purposed none 330
 thus through constraint we here arrived by night
 and with much difficulty push'd the ship
 into safe harbour nor was mention made
 of food by any though all needed food
 but disembark'd in haste on shore we lay
 i weary slept profound and they my goods
 forth heaving from the bark beside me placed
 the treasures on the seabeach where i slept
 then reimbarking to the populous coast
 steer'd of sidonia and me left forlorn 340
 he ceased then smiled minerva azureeyed
 and stroaked his cheek in form a woman now
 beauteous majestic in all elegant arts
 accomplish'd and with accents wing'd replied
 who passes thee in artifice wellframed
 and in imposture various need shall find
 of all his policy although a god
 canst thou not cease inventive as thou art
 and subtle from the wiles which thou hast lov'd
 since thou wast infant and from tricks of speech 350
 delusive even in thy native land
 but come dismiss we these ingenious shifts
 from our discourse in which we both excel
 for thou of all men in expedients most
 abound'st and eloquence and i throughout
 all heav'n have praise for wisdom and for art
 and know'st thou not thine athen�an aid
 pallas jove's daughter who in all thy toils
 assist thee and defend i gave thee pow'r
 t' engage the hearts of all ph�acia's sons 360
 and here arrive ev'n now counsels to frame
 discrete with thee and to conceal the stores
 giv'n to thee by the rich ph�acian chiefs
 on my suggestion at thy going thence
 i will inform thee also what distress
 and hardship under thy own palaceroof
 thou must endure which since constraint enjoins
 bear patiently and neither man apprize
 nor woman that thou hast arrived forlorn
 and vagabond but silent undergo 370
 what wrongs soever from the hands of men
 to whom ulysses everwise replied
 o goddess thou art able to elude
 wherever met the keenest eye of man
 for thou all shapes assum'st yet this i know
 certainly that i ever found thee kind
 long as achaia's heroes fought at troy
 but when the lofty tow'rs of priam laid
 in dust we reembark'd and by the will
 of heav'n achaia's fleet was scatter'd wide 380
 thenceforth o daughter wise of jove i thee
 saw not nor thy appearance in my ship
 once mark'd to rid me of my num'rous woes
 but always bearing in my breast a heart
 with anguish riv'n i roam'd till by the gods
 relieved at length and till with gracious words
 thyself didst in ph�acia's opulent land
 confirm my courage and becam'st my guide
 but i adjure thee in thy father's name
 o tell me truly for i cannot hope 390
 that i have reach'd fair ithaca i tread
 some other soil and thou affirm'st it mine
 to mock me merely and deceive oh say
 am i in ithaca in truth at home
 thus then minerva the c�ruleaneyed
 such caution in thy breast always prevails
 distrustful but i know thee eloquent
 with wisdom and with ready thought endued
 and cannot leave thee therefore thus distress'd
 for what man save ulysses newreturn'd 400
 after long wand'rings would not pant to see
 at once his home his children and his wife
 but thou preferr'st neither to know nor ask
 concerning them till some experience first
 thou make of her whose wasted youth is spent
 in barren solitude and who in tears
 ceaseless her nights and woeful days consumes
 i ne'er was ignorant but well foreknew
 that not till after loss of all thy friends
 thou should'st return but loth i was to oppose 410
 neptune my father's brother sore incensed
 for his son's sake deprived of sight by thee
 but i will give thee proofcome nowsurvey
 these marks of ithaca and be convinced
 this is the port of phorcys seaborn sage
 that the huge olive at the haven's head
 fast by it thou behold'st the pleasant cove
 umbrageous to the nymphs devoted named
 the naiads this the broadarch'd cavern is
 where thou wast wont to offer to the nymphs 420
 many a whole hecatomb and yonder stands
 the mountain neritus with forests cloath'd
 so saying the goddess scatter'd from before
 his eyes all darkness and he knew the land
 then felt ulysses hero toilinured
 transport unutterable seeing plain
 once more his native isle he kiss'd the glebe
 and with uplifted hands the nymphs ador'd
 nymphs naiads jove's own daughters i despair'd
 to see you more whom yet with happy vows 430
 i now can hail again gifts as of old
 we will hereafter at your shrines present
 if joveborn pallas huntress of the spoils
 grant life to me and manhood to my son
 then pallas blueeyed progeny of jove
 take courage trouble not thy mind with thoughts
 now needless hastedelay notfar within
 this hallow'd cave's recess place we at once
 thy precious stores that they may thine remain
 then muse together on thy wisest course 440
 so saying the goddess enter'd deep the cave
 caliginous and its secret nooks explored
 from side to side meantime ulysses brought
 all his stores into it the gold the brass
 and robes magnificent his gifts received
 from the ph�acians safe he lodg'd them all
 and pallas daughter of jove �gisarm'd
 closed fast herself the cavern with a stone
 then on the consecrated olive's root
 both seated they in consultation plann'd 450
 the deaths of those injurious suitors proud
 and pallas blueeyed goddess thus began
 laertes' noble son ulysses think
 by what means likeliest thou shalt assail
 those shameless suitors who have now controuled
 three years thy family thy matchless wife
 with language amorous and with spousal gifts
 urging importunate but she with tears
 watching thy wish'd return hope gives to all
 by messages of promise sent to each 460
 framing far other purposes the while
 then answer thus ulysses wise return'd
 ah agamemnon's miserable fate
 had surely met me in my own abode
 but for thy gracious warning pow'r divine
 come thendevise the means teach me thyself
 the way to vengeance and my soul inspire
 with daring fortitude as when we loos'd
 her radiant frontlet from the brows of troy
 would'st thou with equal zeal o pallas aid 470
 thy servant here i would encounter thrice
 an hundred enemies let me but perceive
 thy dread divinity my prompt ally
 him answer'd then pallas c�ruleaneyed
 and such i will be not unmark'd by me
 let once our time of enterprize arrive
 shalt thou assail them many as i judge
 of those proud suitors who devour thy wealth
 shall leave their brains then on thy palace floor
 but come behold i will disguise thee so 480
 that none shall know thee i will parch the skin
 on thy fair body i will cause thee shed
 thy wavy locks i will enfold thee round
 in such a kirtle as the eyes of all
 shall loath to look on and i will deform
 with blurring rheums thy eyes so vivid erst
 so shall the suitors deem thee and thy wife
 and thy own son whom thou didst leave at home
 some sordid wretch obscure but seek thou first
 thy swineherd's mansion he alike intends 490
 thy good and loves affectionate thy son
 and thy penelope thou shalt find the swain
 tending his herd they feed beneath the rock
 corax at side of arethusa's fount
 on acorns dieted nutritious food
 to them and drinking of the limpid stream
 there waiting question him of thy concerns
 while i from sparta praised for women fair
 call home thy son telemachus a guest
 with menelaus now whom to consult 500
 in spacious laced�mon he is gone
 anxious to learn if yet his father lives
 to whom ulysses everwise replied
 and why alas allknowing as thou art
 him left'st thou ignorant was it that he
 he also wand'ring wide the barren deep
 might suffer woe while these devour his wealth
 him answer'd then pallas c�ruleaneyed
 grieve thou not much for him i sent him forth
 myself that there arrived he might acquire 510
 honour and fame no suff'rings finds he there
 but in atrides' palace safe resides
 enjoying all abundance him in truth
 the suitors watch close ambush'd on the deep
 intent to slay him ere he reach his home
 but shall not as i judge till of themselves
 the earth hide some who make thee now a prey
 so saying the goddess touch'd him with a wand
 at once o'er all his agile limbs she parch'd
 the polish'd skin she wither'd to the root 520
 his wavy locks and cloath'd him with the hide
 deform'd of wrinkled age she charged with rheums
 his eyes before so vivid and a cloak
 and kirtle gave him tatter'd both and foul
 and smutch'd with smoak then casting over all
 an huge old deerskin bald with a long staff
 she furnish'd him and with a wallet patch'd
 on all sides dangling by a twisted thong
 thus all their plan adjusted diff'rent ways
 they took and she seeking ulysses' son 530
 to laced�mon's spacious realm repair'd

 to pass a similar censure on the cretans to that quoted by st

 book xiv

 argument

 ulysses arriving at the house of eum�us is hospitably entertained and
 spends the night there


 leaving the havenside he turn'd his steps
 into a rugged path which over hills
 mantled with trees led him to the abode
 by pallas mention'd of his noble friend61
 the swineherd who of all ulysses' train
 watch'd with most diligence his rural stores
 him sitting in the vestibule he found
 of his own airy lodge commodious built
 amidst a level lawn that structure neat
 eum�us in the absence of his lord 10
 had raised himself with stones from quarries hewn
 unaided by laertes or the queen
 with tangled thorns he fenced it safe around
 and with contiguous stakes riv'n from the trunks
 of solid oak blackgrain'd hemm'd it without
 twelve penns he made within all side by side
 lairs for his swine and fastimmured in each
 lay fifty pregnant females on the floor
 the males all slept without less num'rous far
 thinn'd by the princely wooers at their feasts 20
 continual for to them he ever sent
 the fattest of his saginated charge
 three hundred still and sixty brawns remained
 four mastiffs in adjoining kennels lay
 resembling wildbeasts nourish'd at the board
 of the illustrious steward of the styes
 himself sat fitting sandals to his feet
 carved from a stain'd oxhide four hinds he kept
 now busied here and there three in the penns
 were occupied meantime the fourth had sought 30
 the city whither for the suitors' use
 with no good will but by constraint he drove
 a boar that sacrificing to the gods
 th' imperious guests might on his flesh regale
 soon as those clamorous watchdogs the approach
 saw of ulysses baying loud they ran
 toward him he as ever welladvised
 squatted and let his staff fall from his hand
 yet foul indignity he had endured
 ev'n there at his own farm but that the swain 40
 following his dogs in haste sprang through the porch
 to his assistance letting fall the hide
 with chiding voice and vollied stones he soon
 drove them apart and thus his lord bespake
 old man one moment more and these my dogs
 had past doubt worried thee who should'st have proved
 so slain a source of obloquy to me
 but other pangs the gods and other woes
 to me have giv'n who here lamenting sit
 my godlike master and his fatted swine 50
 nourish for others' use while he perchance
 a wand'rer in some foreign city seeks
 fit sustenance and none obtains if still
 indeed he live and view the light of day
 but old friend follow me into the house
 that thou at least with plenteous food refresh'd
 and cheer'd with wine sufficient may'st disclose
 both who thou art and all that thou hast borne
 so saying the gen'rous swineherd introduced
 ulysses and thick bundles spread of twigs 60
 beneath him cover'd with the shaggy skin
 of a wild goat of which he made his couch
 easy and large the hero so received
 rejoiced and thus his gratitude express'd
 jove grant thee and the gods above my host
 for such beneficence thy chief desire
 to whom eum�us thou didst thus reply
 my guest i should offend treating with scorn
 the stranger though a poorer should arrive
 than ev'n thyself for all the poor that are 70
 and all the strangers are the care of jove
 little and with good will is all that lies
 within my scope no man can much expect
 from servants living in continual fear
 under young masters for the gods no doubt
 have intercepted my own lord's return
 from whom great kindness i had else received
 with such a recompense as servants gain
 from gen'rous masters house and competence
 and lovely wife from many a wooer won 80
 whose industry should have requited well
 his goodness with such blessing from the gods
 as now attends me in my present charge
 much had i therefore prosper'd had my lord
 grown old at home but he hath diedi would
 that the whole house of helen one and all
 might perish too for she hath many slain
 who like my master went glory to win
 for agamemnon in the fields of troy
 so saying he girdled quick his tunic close 90
 and issuing sought the styes thence bringing two
 of the imprison'd herd he slaughter'd both
 singed them and slash'd and spitted them and placed
 the whole wellroasted banquet spits and all
 reeking before ulysses last with flour
 he sprinkled them and filling with rich wine
 his ivy goblet to his master sat
 opposite whom inviting thus he said
 now eat my guest such as a servant may
 i set before thee neither large of growth 100
 nor fat the fattedthose the suitors eat
 fearless of heav'n and pitiless of man
 yet deeds unjust as theirs the blessed gods
 love not they honour equity and right
 even an hostile band when they invade
 a foreign shore which by consent of jove
 they plunder and with laden ships depart
 even they with terrours quake of wrath divine
 but these are wiser these must sure have learn'd
 from some true oracle my master's death 110
 who neither deign with decency to woo
 nor yet to seek their homes but boldly waste
 his substance shameless now and sparing nought
 jove ne'er hath giv'n us yet the night or day
 when with a single victim or with two
 they would content them and his empty jars
 witness how fast the squand'rers use his wine
 time was when he was rich indeed such wealth
 no hero own'd on yonder continent
 nor yet in ithaca no twenty chiefs 120
 could match with all their treasures his alone
 i tell thee their amount twelve herds of his
 the mainland graze62 as many flocks of sheep
 as many droves of swine and hirelings there
 and servants of his own seed for his use
 as many num'rous flocks of goats his goats
 not fewer than eleven num'rous flocks
 here also graze the margin of his fields
 under the eye of servants wellapproved
 and ev'ry servant ev'ry day brings home 130
 the goat of all his flock largest and best
 but as for me i have these swine in charge
 of which selected with exactest care
 from all the herd i send the prime to them
 he ceas'd meantime ulysses ate and drank
 voracious meditating mute the death
 of those proud suitors his repast at length
 concluded and his appetite sufficed
 eum�us gave him charged with wine the cup
 from which he drank himself he glad received 140
 the boon and in wing'd accents thus began
 my friend and who was he wealthy and brave
 as thou describ'st the chief who purchased thee
 thou say'st he perish'd for the glorysake
 of agamemnon name him i perchance
 may have beheld the hero none can say
 but jove and the inhabitants of heav'n
 that i ne'er saw him and may not impart
 news of him i have roam'd through many a clime
 to whom the noble swineherd thus replied 150
 alas old man no trav'ler's tale of him
 will gain his consort's credence or his son's
 for wand'rers wanting entertainment forge
 falsehoods for bread and wilfully deceive
 no wand'rer lands in ithaca but he seeks
 with feign'd intelligence my mistress' ear
 she welcomes all and while she questions each
 minutely from her lids lets fall the tear
 affectionate as well beseems a wife
 whose mate hath perish'd in a distant land 160
 thou could'st thyself no doubt my hoary friend
 would any furnish thee with decent vest
 and mantle fabricate a tale with ease
 yet sure it is that dogs and fowls long since
 his skin have stript or fishes of the deep
 have eaten him and on some distant shore
 whelm'd in deep sands his mould'ring bones are laid
 so hath he perish'd whence to all his friends
 but chiefly to myself sorrow of heart
 for such another lord gentle as he 170
 wherever sought i have no hope to find
 though i should wander even to the house
 of my own father neither yearns my heart
 so feelingly though that desiring too
 to see once more my parents and my home
 as to behold ulysses yet again
 ah stranger absent as he is his name
 fills me with rev'rence for he lov'd me much
 cared for me much and though we meet no more
 holds still an elder brother's part in me 180
 him answer'd then the hero toilinured
 my friend since his return in thy account
 is an event impossible and thy mind
 always incredulous that hope rejects
 i shall not slightly speak but with an oath
 ulysses comes again and i demand
 no more than that the boon such news deserves
 be giv'n me soon as he shall reach his home
 then give me vest and mantle fit to wear
 which ere that hour much as i need them both 190
 i neither ask nor will accept from thee
 for him whom poverty can force aside
 from truthi hate him as the gates of hell
 be jove of all in heav'n my witness first
 then this thy hospitable board and last
 the household gods of the illustrious chief
 himself ulysses to whose gates i go
 that all my words shall surely be fulfill'd
 in this same year ulysses shall arrive
 ere this month closed another month succeed 200
 he shall return and punish all who dare
 insult his consort and his noble son
 to whom eum�us thou didst thus reply
 old friend that boon thou wilt ne'er earn from me
 ulysses comes no more but thou thy wine
 drink quietly and let us find at length
 some other theme recall not this again
 to my remembrance for my soul is grieved
 oft as reminded of my honour'd lord
 let the oath rest and let ulysses come 210
 ev'n as myself and as penelope
 and as his ancient father and his son
 godlike telemachus all wish he may
 aythere i feel againnor cease to mourn
 his son telemachus who when the gods
 had giv'n him growth like a young plant and i
 well hoped that nought inferior he should prove
 in person or in mind to his own sire
 hath lost through influence human or divine
 i know not how his sober intellect 220
 and after tidings of his sire is gone
 to farfamed pylus his return meantime
 in ambush hidden the proud suitors wait
 that the whole house may perish of renown'd
 arcesias named in ithaca no more
 but whether he have fallen or 'scaped let him
 rest also whom saturnian jove protect
 but come my ancient guest now let me learn
 thy own afflictions answer me in truth
 who and whence art thou in what city born 230
 where dwell thy parents in what kind of ship
 cam'st thou the mariners why brought they thee
 to ithaca and of what land are they
 for that on foot thou found'st us not is sure
 him answer'd then ulysses everwise
 i will with truth resolve thee and if here
 within thy cottage sitting we had wine
 and food for many a day and business none
 but to regale at ease while others toiled
 i could exhaust the year complete my woes 240
 rehearsing nor at last rehearse entire
 my sorrows by the will of heav'n sustained
 i boast me sprung from ancestry renown'd
 in spacious crete son of a wealthy sire
 who other sons train'd num'rous in his house
 born of his wedded wife but he begat
 me on his purchased concubine whom yet
 dear as his other sons in wedlock born
 castor hylacides esteem'd and lov'd
 for him i boast my father him in crete 250
 while yet he liv'd all reverenc'd as a god
 so rich so prosp'rous and so blest was he
 with sons of highest praise but death the doom
 of all him bore to pluto's drear abode
 and his illustrious sons among themselves
 portion'd his goods by lot to me indeed
 they gave a dwelling and but little more
 yet for my virtuous qualities i won
 a wealthy bride for i was neither vain
 nor base forlorn as thou perceiv'st me now 260
 but thou canst guess i judge viewing the straw
 what once was in the ear ah i have borne
 much tribulation heap'd and heavy woes
 courage and phalanxbreaking might had i
 from mars and pallas at what time i drew
 planning some dread exploit an ambush forth
 of our most valiant chiefs no boding fears
 of death seized _me_ but foremost far of all
 i sprang to fight and pierced the flying foe
 such was i once in arms but household toils 270
 sustain'd for children's sake and carking cares
 t' enrich a family were not for me
 my pleasures were the gallant bark the din
 of battle the smooth spear and glitt'ring shaft
 objects of dread to others but which me
 the gods disposed to love and to enjoy
 thus diff'rent minds are diff'rently amused
 for ere achaia's fleet had sailed to troy
 nine times was i commander of an host
 embark'd against a foreign foe and found 280
 in all those enterprizes great success
 from the whole booty first what pleased me most
 chusing and sharing also much by lot
 i rapidly grew rich and had thenceforth
 among the cretans rev'rence and respect
 but when loudthund'ring jove that voyage dire
 ordain'd which loos'd the knees of many a greek
 then to idomeneus and me they gave
 the charge of all their fleet which how to avoid
 we found not so importunate the cry 290
 of the whole host impell'd us to the task
 there fought we nine long years and in the tenth
 priam's proud city pillag'd steer'd again
 our galleys homeward which the gods dispersed
 then was it that deepplanning jove devised
 for me much evil one short month no more
 i gave to joys domestic in my wife
 happy and in my babes and in my wealth
 when the desire seiz'd me with sev'ral ships
 wellrigg'd and furnish'd all with gallant crews 300
 to sail for �gypt nine i fitted forth
 to which stout mariners assembled fast
 six days the chosen partners of my voyage
 feasted to whom i num'rous victims gave
 for sacrifice and for their own regale
 embarking on the sev'nth from spacious crete
 before a clear breeze prosp'rous from the north
 we glided easily along as down
 a river's stream nor one of all my ships
 damage incurr'd but healthy and at ease 310
 we sat while gales wellmanaged urged us on
 the fifth day thence smoothflowing nile we reach'd
 and safe i moor'd in the �gyptian stream
 then charging all my mariners to keep
 strict watch for preservation of the ships
 i order'd spies into the hilltops but they
 under the impulse of a spirit rash
 and hot for quarrel the wellcultur'd fields
 pillaged of the �gyptians captive led
 their wives and little ones and slew the men 320
 soon was the city alarm'd and at the cry
 down came the citizens by dawn of day
 with horse and foot and with the gleam of arms
 filling the plain then jove with panic dread
 struck all my people none found courage more
 to stand for mischiefs swarm'd on ev'ry side
 there num'rous by the glittering spear we fell
 slaughter'd while others they conducted thence
 alive to servitude but jove himself
 my bosom with this thought inspired i would 330
 that dying i had first fulfill'd my fate
 in �gypt for new woes were yet to come
 loosing my brazen casque and slipping off
 my buckler there i left them on the field
 then cast my spear away and seeking next
 the chariot of the sov'reign clasp'd his knees
 and kiss'd them he by my submission moved
 deliver'd me and to his chariotseat
 raising convey'd me weeping to his home
 with many an ashen spear his warriors sought 340
 to slay me for they now grew fiery wroth
 but he through fear of hospitable jove
 chief punisher of wrong saved me alive
 sev'n years i there abode and much amass'd
 among the �gyptians gifted by them all
 but in the eighth revolving year arrived
 a shrewd phoenician in all fraud adept
 hungry and who had num'rous harm'd before
 by whom i also was cajoled and lured
 t' attend him to phoenicia where his house 350
 and his possessions lay there i abode
 a year complete his inmate but the days
 and months accomplish'd of the rolling year
 and the new seasons ent'ring on their course
 to lybia then on board his bark by wiles
 he won me with him partner of the freight
 profess'd but destin'd secretly to sale
 that he might profit largely by my price
 not unsuspicious yet constrain'd to go
 with this man i embark'd a cloudless gale 360
 propitious blowing from the north our ship
 ran right before it through the middle sea
 in the offing over crete but adverse jove
 destruction plann'd for them and death the while
 for crete now left afar and other land
 appearing none but sky alone and sea
 right o'er the hollow bark saturnian jove
 a cloud c�rulean hung dark'ning the deep
 then thund'ring oft he hurl'd into the bark
 his bolts she smitten by the fires of jove 370
 quaked all her length with sulphur fill'd she reek'd
 and o'er her sides precipitated plunged
 like gulls the crew forbidden by that stroke
 of wrath divine to hope their country more
 but jove himself when i had cast away
 all hope of life conducted to my arms
 the strong tall mast that i might yet escape
 around that beam i clung driving before
 the stormy blast nine days complete i drove
 and on the tenth dark night the rolling flood 380
 immense convey'd me to thesprotia's shore
 there me the hero phidon gen'rous king
 of the thesprotians freely entertained
 for his own son discov'ring me with toil
 exhausted and with cold raised me and thence
 led me humanely to his father's house
 who cherish'd me and gave me fresh attire
 there heard i of ulysses whom himself
 had entertain'd he said on his return
 to his own land he shew'd me also gold 390
 brass and bright steel elab'rate whatsoe'er
 ulysses had amass'd a store to feed
 a less illustrious family than his
 to the tenth generation so immense
 his treasures in the royal palace lay
 himself he said was to dodona gone
 there from the tow'ring oaks of jove to ask
 counsel divine if openly to land
 after long absence in his opulent realm
 of ithaca be best or in disguise 400
 to me the monarch swore in his own hall
 pouring libation that the ship was launch'd
 and the crew ready for his conduct home
 but me he first dismiss'd for as it chanced
 a ship lay there of the thesprotians bound
 to green dulichium's isle he bade the crew
 bear me to king acastus with all speed
 but them far other thoughts pleased more and thoughts
 of harm to me that i might yet be plunged
 in deeper gulphs of woe than i had known 410
 for when the billowcleaving bark had left
 the land remote framing combined a plot
 against my liberty they stripp'd my vest
 and mantle and this tatter'd raiment foul
 gave me instead which thy own eyes behold
 at eventide reaching the cultur'd coast
 of ithaca they left me bound on board
 with tackle of the bark and quitting ship
 themselves made hasty supper on the shore
 but me meantime the gods easily loos'd 420
 by their own pow'r when with wrapper vile
 around my brows sliding into the sea
 at the ship's stern i lay'd me on the flood
 with both hands oaring thence my course i swam
 till past all ken of theirs then landing where
 thick covert of luxuriant trees i mark'd
 close couchant down i lay they mutt'ring loud
 paced to and fro but deeming farther search
 unprofitable soon embark'd again
 thus baffling all their search with ease the gods 430
 conceal'd and led me thence to the abode
 of a wise man dooming me still to live
 to whom eum�us thou didst thus reply
 alas my most compassionable guest
 thou hast much moved me by this tale minute
 of thy sad wand'rings and thy num'rous woes
 but speaking of ulysses thou hast pass'd
 all credence i at least can give thee none
 why noble as thou art should'st thou invent
 palpable falsehoods as for the return 440
 of my regretted lord myself i know
 that had he not been hated by the gods
 unanimous he had in battle died
 at troy or that long doubtful war at last
 concluded in his people's arms at home
 then universal greece had raised his tomb
 and he had even for his son atchiev'd
 immortal glory but alas by beaks
 of harpies torn unseemly sight he lies
 here is my home the while i never seek 450
 the city unless summon'd by discrete
 penelope to listen to the news
 brought by some stranger whencesoe'er arrived
 then all alike inquisitive attend
 both who regret the absence of our king
 and who rejoice gratuitous to gorge
 his property but as for me no joy
 find i in list'ning after such reports
 since an �tolian cozen'd me who found
 after long wand'ring over various lands 460
 a fugitive for blood my lone retreat
 him warm i welcom'd and with open arms
 receiv'd who bold affirm'd that he had seen
 my master with idomeneus at crete
 his ships refitting shatter'd by a storm
 and that in summer with his godlike band
 he would return bringing great riches home
 or else in autumn and thou ancient guest
 forlorn since thee the gods have hither led
 seek not to gratify me with untruths 470
 and to deceive me since for no such cause
 i shall respect or love thee but alone
 by pity influenced and the fear of jove
 to whom ulysses everwise replied
 thou hast in truth a most incredulous mind
 whom even with an oath i have not moved
 or aught persuaded come thenlet us make
 in terms express a cov'nant and the gods
 who hold olympus witness to us both
 if thy own lord at this thy house arrive 480
 thou shalt dismiss me decently attired
 in vest and mantle that i may repair
 hence to dulichium whither i would go
 but if thy lord come not then gath'ring all
 thy servants headlong hurl me from a rock
 that other mendicants may fear to lie
 to whom the generous swineherd in return
 yes stranger doubtless i should high renown
 obtain for virtue among men both now
 and in all future times if having first 490
 invited thee and at my board regaled
 i next should slay thee then my pray'rs would mount
 past question swiftly to saturnian jove
 but the hour calls to supper and ere long
 the partners of my toils will come prepared
 to spread the board with no unsav'ry cheer
 thus they conferr'd and now the swains arrived
 driving their charge which fast they soon enclosed
 within their customary penns and loud
 the hubbub was of swine prison'd within 500
 then call'd the master to his rustic train
 bring ye the best that we may set him forth
 before my friend from foreign climes arrived
 with whom ourselves will also feast who find
 the brighttusk'd multitude a painful charge
 while others at no cost of theirs consume
 day after day the profit of our toils
 so saying his wood for fuel he prepared
 and dragging thither a wellfatted brawn
 of the fifth year his servants held him fast 510
 at the hearthside nor failed the master swain
 t' adore the gods for wise and good was he
 but consecration of the victim first
 himself performing cast into the fire
 the forehead bristles of the tusky boar
 then pray'd to all above that safe at length
 ulysses might regain his native home
 then lifting an huge shive that lay beside
 the fire he smote the boar and dead he fell
 next piercing him and scorching close his hair 520
 they carv'd him quickly and eum�us spread
 thin slices crude taken from ev'ry limb
 o'er all his fat then other slices cast
 sprinkling them first with meal into the fire
 the rest they slash'd and scored and roasted well
 and placed it heap'd together on the board
 then rose the good eum�us to his task
 of distribution for he understood
 the hospitable entertainer's part
 sev'nfold partition of the banquet made 530
 he gave with previous pray'r to maia's son63
 and to the nymphs one portion of the whole
 then served his present guests honouring first
 ulysses with the boar's perpetual chine
 by that distinction just his master's heart
 he gratified and thus the hero spake
 eum�us be thou as belov'd of jove
 as thou art dear to me whom though attired
 so coarsely thou hast served with such respect
 to whom eum�us thou didst thus reply 540
 eat noble stranger and refreshment take
 such as thou may'st god64 gives and god denies
 at his own will for he is lord of all
 he said and to the everlasting gods
 the firstlings sacrificed of all then made
 libation and the cup placed in the hands
 of cityspoiler laertiades
 sitting beside his own allotted share
 meantime mesaulius bread dispensed to all
 whom in the absence of his lord himself 550
 eum�us had from taphian traders bought
 with his own proper goods at no expence
 either to old laertes or the queen
 and now all stretch'd their hands toward the feast
 reeking before them and when hunger none
 felt more or thirst mesaulius clear'd the board
 then fed to full satiety in haste
 each sought his couch black came a moonless night
 and jove all night descended fast in show'rs
 with howlings of the ever wat'ry west 560
 ulysses at that sound for trial sake
 of his good host if putting off his cloak
 he would accommodate him or require
 that service for him at some other hand
 addressing thus the family began
 hear now eum�us and ye other swains
 his fellowlab'rers i shall somewhat boast
 by wine befool'd which forces ev'n the wise
 to carol loud to titter and to dance
 and words to utter oft better suppress'd 570
 but since i have begun i shall proceed
 prating my fill ah might those days return
 with all the youth and strength that i enjoy'd
 when in close ambush once at troy we lay
 ulysses menelaus and myself
 their chosen coadjutor led the band
 approaching to the city's lofty wall
 through the thick bushes and the reeds that gird
 the bulwarks down we lay flat in the marsh
 under our arms then boreas blowing loud 580
 a rueful night came on frosty and charged
 with snow that blanch'd us thick as morning rime
 and ev'ry shield with ice was crystall'd o'er
 the rest with cloaks and vests well cover'd slept
 beneath their bucklers i alone my cloak
 improvident had left behind no thought
 conceiving of a season so severe
 shield and belt therefore and nought else had i
 the night at last nigh spent and all the stars
 declining in their course with elbow thrust 590
 against ulysses' side i roused the chief
 and thus address'd him ever prompt to hear
 laertes' noble son for wiles renown'd
 i freeze to death help me or i am lost
 no cloak have i some evil d�mon sure
 beguil'd me of all prudence that i came
 thus sparely clad i shall i must expire
 so i he ready as he was in arms
 and counsel both the remedy at once
 devised and thus lowwhisp'ring answer'd me 600
 hush lest perchance some other hearhe said
 and leaning on his elbow spake aloud
 my friends all heara monitory dream
 hath reach'd me for we lie far from the ships
 haste therefore one of you with my request
 to agamemnon atreus' son our chief
 that he would reinforce us from the camp
 he spake and at the word andr�mon's son
 thoas arose who casting off his cloak
 ran thence toward the ships and folded warm 610
 within it there lay i till dawn appear'd
 oh for the vigour of such youth again
 then some good peasant here either for love
 or for respect would cloak a man like me
 whom now thus sordid in attire ye scorn
 to whom eum�us thou didst thus reply
 my ancient guest i cannot but approve
 thy narrative nor hast thou utter'd aught
 unseemly or that needs excuse no want
 of raiment therefore or of aught beside 620
 needful to solace penury like thine
 shall harm thee here yet at the peep of dawn
 gird thy own tatters to thy loins again
 for _we_ have no great store of cloaks to boast
 or change of vests but singly one for each
 but when ulysses' son shall once arrive
 he will himself with vest and mantle both
 cloath thee and send thee whither most thou would'st
 so saying he rose and nearer made his couch
 to the hearthside spreading it thick with skins 630
 of sheep and goats then lay the hero down
 o'er whom a shaggy mantle large he threw
 which ofttimes served him with a change when rough
 the winter's blast and terrible arose
 so was ulysses bedded and the youths
 slept all beside him but the masterswain
 chose not his place of rest so far remote
 from his rude charge but to the outer court
 with his nocturnal furniture repair'd
 gladd'ning ulysses' heart that one so true 640
 in his own absence kept his rural stores
 athwart his sturdy shoulders first he flung
 his faulchion keen then wrapp'd him in a cloak
 thickwoven winterproof he lifted next
 the skin of a wellthriven goat in bulk
 surpassing others and his javelin took
 sharppointed with which dogs he drove and men
 thus arm'd he sought his wonted couch beneath
 a hollow rock where the herd slept secure
 from the sharp current of the northern blast 650

 telemachus admonished by minerva takes leave of menelaus but ere he
 sails is accosted by theoclymenos a prophet of argos whom at his

 ulysses the means by which he came to ithaca telemachus arriving there

 returning then to her of all thy train
 whom thou shalt most approve the charge commit
 of thy concerns domestic till the gods
 themselves shall guide thee to a noble wife
 hear also this and mark it in the frith
 samos the rude and ithaca between
 the chief of all her suitors thy return
 in vigilant ambush wait with strong desire
 to slay thee ere thou reach thy native shore
 but shall not as i judge till the earth hide 40
 many a lewd reveller at thy expence
 yet steer thy galley from those isles afar
 and voyage make by night some guardian god
 shall save thee and shall send thee prosp'rous gales
 then soon as thou attain'st the nearest shore
 of ithaca dispatching to the town
 thy bark with all thy people seek at once
 the swineherd for eum�us is thy friend
 there sleep and send him forth into the town
 with tidings to penelope that safe 50
 thou art restored from pylus home again
 she said and sought th' olympian heights sublime
 then with his heel shaking him he awoke
 the son of nestor whom he thus address'd
 rise nestor's son pisistratus lead forth
 the steeds and yoke them we must now depart
 to whom the son of nestor thus replied
 telemachus what haste soe'er we feel
 we can by no means prudently attempt
 to drive by night and soon it will be dawn 60
 stay therefore till the hero atreus' son
 spearpractis'd menelaus shall his gifts
 place in the chariot and with kind farewell
 dismiss thee for the guest in mem'ry holds
 through life the host who treats him as a friend
 scarce had he spoken when the golden dawn
 appearing menelaus from the side
 of beauteous helen ris'n their bed approach'd
 whose coming when telemachus perceived
 cloathing himself hastily in his vest 70
 magnificent and o'er his shoulders broad
 casting his graceful mantle at the door
 he met the hero whom he thus address'd
 atrides menelaus chief renown'd
 dismiss me hence to ithaca again
 my native isle for i desire to go
 him answer'd menelaus famed in arms
 telemachus i will not long delay
 thy wish'd return i disapprove alike
 the host whose assiduity extreme 80
 distresses and whose negligence offends
 the middle course is best alike we err
 him thrusting forth whose wish is to remain
 and hind'ring the impatient to depart
 this only is true kindnessto regale
 the present guest and speed him when he would
 yet stay till thou shalt see my splendid gifts
 placed in thy chariot and till i command
 my women from our present stores to spread
 the table with a plentiful repast 90
 for both the honour of the guest demands
 and his convenience also that he eat
 sufficient ent'ring on a length of road
 but if through hellas thou wilt take thy way
 and traverse argos i will then myself
 attend thee thou shalt journey with my steeds
 beneath thy yoke and i will be thy guide
 to many a city whence we shall not go
 ungratified but shall in each receive
 some gift at least tripod or charger bright 100
 or golden chalice or a pair of mules
 to whom telemachus discrete replied
 atrides menelaus chief renown'd
 i would at once depart for guardian none
 of my possessions have i left behind
 lest while i seek my father i be lost
 myself or lose what i should grudge to spare
 which when the valiant menelaus heard
 he bade his spouse and maidens spread the board
 at once with remnants of the last regale 110
 then eteoneus came boetheus' son
 newly aris'n for nigh at hand he dwelt
 whom menelaus bade kindle the fire
 by which to dress their food and he obey'd
 he next himself his fragrant chamber sought
 not sole but by his spouse and by his son
 attended megapenthes there arrived
 where all his treasures lay atrides first
 took forth himself a goblet then consign'd
 to his son's hand an argent beaker bright 120
 meantime beside her coffers helen stood
 where lay her variegated robes fair works
 of her own hand producing one in size
 and in magnificence the chief a star
 for splendour and the lowest placed of all
 loveliest of her sex she bore it thence
 then all proceeding through the house they sought
 telemachus again whom reaching thus
 the hero of the golden locks began
 may jove the thunderer dread juno's mate 130
 grant thee telemachus such voyage home
 as thy own heart desires accept from all
 my stores selected as the richest far
 and noblest gift for finish'd beautythis
 i give thee wrought elaborate a cup
 itself all silver bound with lip of gold
 it is the work of vulcan which to me
 the hero ph�dimus imparted king
 of the sidonians when on my return
 beneath his roof i lodg'd i make it thine 140
 so saying the hero atreus' son the cup
 placed in his hands and megapenthes set
 before him next the argent beaker bright
 but lovely helen drawing nigh the robe
 presented to him whom she thus address'd
 i also give thee oh my son a gift
 which seeing thou shalt think on her whose hands
 wrought it a present on thy nuptial day
 for thy fair spouse meantime repose it safe
 in thy own mother's keeping now farewell 150
 prosp'rous and happy be thy voyage home
 she ceas'd and gave it to him who the gift
 accepted glad and in the chariotchest
 pisistratus the hero all disposed
 admiring them the while they following next
 the hero menelaus to his hall
 each on his couch or on his throne reposed
 a maiden then with golden ewer charged
 and silver bowl pour'd water on their hands
 and spread the polish'd table which with food 160
 various selected from her present stores
 the mistress of the household charge supplied
 boetheus' son stood carver and to each
 his portion gave while megapenthes son
 of glorious menelaus serv'd the cup
 then all with outstretch'd hands the feast assail'd
 and when nor hunger more nor thirst of wine
 they felt telemachus and nestor's son
 yoked the swift steeds and taking each his seat
 in the resplendent chariot drove at once 170
 right through the sounding portico abroad
 but menelaus hero amberhair'd
 a golden cup bearing with richest wine
 replete in his right hand follow'd them forth
 that not without libation first perform'd
 they might depart he stood before the steeds
 and drinking first thus courteous them bespake
 health to you both young friends and from my lips
 like greeting bear to nestor royal chief
 for he was ever as a father kind 180
 to me while the achaians warr'd at troy
 to whom telemachus discrete replied
 and doubtless so we will at our return
 we will report to him illustrious prince
 thy ev'ry word and oh i would to heav'n
 that reaching ithaca i might at home
 ulysses hail as sure as i shall hence
 depart with all benevolence by thee
 treated and rich in many a noble gift
 while thus he spake on his right hand appear'd 190
 an eagle in his talons pounced he bore
 a whiteplumed goose domestic newly ta'en
 from the housecourt ran females all and males
 clamorous after him but he the steeds
 approaching on the right sprang into air
 that sight rejoicing and with hearts reviv'd
 they view'd and thus pisistratus his speech
 amid them all to menelaus turn'd
 now menelaus think illustrious chief
 if us this omen or thyself regard 200
 while warlike menelaus musing stood
 what answer fit to frame helen meantime
 his spouse longstoled preventing him began
 hear me for i will answer as the gods
 teach me and as i think shall come to pass
 as he descending from his place of birth
 the mountains caught our pamper'd goose away
 so shall ulysses after many woes
 and wand'rings to his home restored avenge
 his wrongs or even now is at his home 210
 for all those suitors sowing seeds of woe
 to whom telemachus discrete replied
 oh grant it jove juno's highthund'ring mate
 so will i there arrived with vow and pray'r
 thee worship as thou wert thyself divine
 he said and lash'd the coursers fiery they
 and fleet sprang through the city to the plain
 all day the yoke on either side they shook
 journeying swift and now the setting sun
 to gloomy evening had resign'd the roads 220
 when they to pher� came and in the house
 of good diocles slept their lib'ral host
 whose sire orsilochus from alpheus sprang
 but when aurora daughter of the dawn
 look'd rosy from the east yoking their steeds
 they in the sumptuous chariot sat again
 forth through the vestibule they drove and through
 the sounding portico when nestor's son
 plied brisk the scourge and willing flew the steeds
 thus whirl'd along soon they approach'd the gates 230
 of pylus when telemachus his speech
 turning to his companion thus began
 how son of nestor shall i win from thee
 not promise only but performance kind
 of my request we are not bound alone
 to friendship by the friendship of our sires
 but by equality of years and this
 our journey shall unite us still the more
 bear me not i intreat thee noble friend
 beyond the ship but drop me at her side 240
 lest ancient nestor though against my will
 detain me in his palace through desire
 to feast me for i dread the least delay
 he spake then mused pisistratus how best
 he might effect the wishes of his friend
 and thus at length resolved turning his steeds
 with sudden deviation to the shore
 he sought the bark and placing in the stern
 both gold and raiment the illustrious gifts
 of menelaus thus in accents wing'd 250
 with ardour urged telemachus away
 dispatch embark summon thy crew on board
 ere my arrival notice give of thine
 to the old king for vehement i know
 his temper neither will he let thee hence
 but hasting hither will himself enforce
 thy longer stay that thou may'st not depart
 ungifted nought will fire his anger more
 so saying he to the pylian city urged
 his steeds brightmaned and at the palacegate 260
 arrived of nestor speedily meantime
 telemachus exhorted thus his crew
 my gallant friends set all your tackle climb
 the sable bark for i would now return
 he spake they heard him gladly and at once
 all fill'd the benches while his voyage he
 thus expedited and beside the stern
 to pallas sacrifice perform'd and pray'd
 a stranger born remote who had escaped
 from argos fugitive for blood a seer 270
 and of melampus' progeny approach'd
 melampus in old time in pylus dwelt
 mother of flocks alike for wealth renown'd
 and the magnificence of his abode
 he flying from the farfamed pylian king
 the mighty neleus65 migrated at length
 into another land whose wealth the while
 neleus by force possess'd a year complete
 meantime melampus in the house endured
 of phylacus imprisonment and woe 280
 and burn'd with wrath for neleus' daughter sake
 by fell erynnis kindled in his heart
 but 'scaping death he drove the lowing beeves
 from phylace to pylus well avenged
 his num'rous injuries at neleus' hands
 sustain'd and gave into his brother's arms
 king neleus' daughter fair the promis'd bride
 to argos steedrenown'd he journey'd next
 there destin'd to inhabit and to rule
 multitudes of achaians in that land 290
 he married built a palace and became
 father of two brave sons antiphates
 and mantius to antiphates was born
 the brave o�cleus from o�cleus sprang
 amphiara�s demagogue renown'd
 whom with all tenderness and as a friend
 alike the thund'rer and apollo prized
 yet reach'd he not the bounds of hoary age
 but by his mercenary consort's arts66
 persuaded met his destiny at thebes 300
 he 'gat alcm�on and amphilocus
 mantius was also father of two sons
 clytus and polyphides clytus pass'd
 from earth to heav'n and dwells among the gods
 stol'n by aurora for his beauty's sake
 but brave amphiara�s once deceased
 phoebus exalted polyphides far
 above all others in the prophet's part
 he anger'd by his father roam'd away
 to hyperesia where he dwelt renown'd 310
 throughout all lands the oracle of all
 his son named theoclymenus was he
 who now approach'd he found telemachus
 libation off'ring in his bark and pray'r
 and in wing'd accents ardent him address'd
 ah friend since sacrificing in this place
 i find thee by these sacred rites and those
 whom thou ador'st and by thy own dear life
 and by the lives of these thy mariners
 i beg true answer hide not what i ask 320
 who art thou whence where born and sprung from whom
 to whom telemachus discrete replied
 i will inform thee stranger and will solve
 thy questions with much truth i am by birth
 ithacan and ulysses was my sire
 but he hath perish'd by a woeful death
 and i believing it with these have plow'd
 the ocean hither int'rested to learn
 a father's fate long absent from his home
 then answer'd godlike theoclymenus 330
 i also am a wand'rer having slain
 a man of my own tribe brethren and friends
 num'rous had he in argos steedrenown'd
 and pow'rful are the achaians dwelling there
 from them through terrour of impending death
 i fly a banish'd man henceforth for ever
 ah save a suppliant fugitive lest death
 o'ertake me for i doubt not their pursuit
 whom thus telemachus answer'd discrete
 i shall not be assured since thou desir'st 340
 to join me chace thee from my bark away
 follow me therefore and with us partake
 in ithaca what best the land affords
 so saying he at the stranger's hand received
 his spear which on the deck he lay'd then climb'd
 himself the bark and seated in the stern
 at his own side placed theoclymenus
 they cast the hawsers loose then with loud voice
 telemachus exhorted all to hand
 the tackle whom the sailors prompt obey'd 350
 the tall mast heaving in its socket deep
 they lodg'd it and its cordage braced secure
 then straining at the halyards hoised the sail
 fair wind and blowing fresh through �ther pure
 minerva sent them that the bark might run
 her nimblest course through all the briny way
 now sank the sun and dusky ev'ning dimm'd
 the waves when driven by propitious jove
 his bark stood right for pher� thence she stretch'd
 to sacred elis where the epeans rule 360
 and through the sharp echinades he next
 steer'd her uncertain whether fate ordain'd
 his life or death surprizal or escape
 meantime ulysses and the swineherd ate
 their cottagemess and the assistant swains
 theirs also and when hunger now and thirst
 had ceased in all ulysses thus began
 proving the swineherd whether friendly still
 and anxious for his good he would intreat
 his stay or thence hasten him to the town 370
 eum�us and all ye his servants hear
 it is my purpose lest i wear thee out
 thee and thy friends to seek at early dawn
 the city there to begbut give me first
 needful instructions and a trusty guide
 who may conduct me thither there my task
 must be to roam the streets some hand humane
 perchance shall give me a small pittance there
 a little bread and a few drops to drink
 ulysses' palace i shall also seek 380
 and to discrete penelope report
 my tidings neither shall i fail to mix
 with those imperious suitors who themselves
 fullfed may spare perhaps some boon to me
 me shall they find in whatsoe'er they wish
 their ready servitor for understand
 and mark me well the herald of the skies
 hermes from whom all actions of mankind
 their grace receive and polish is my friend
 so that in menial offices i fear 390
 no rival whether i be called to heap
 the hearth with fuel or dry wood to cleave
 to roast to carve or to distribute wine
 as oft the poor are wont who serve the great
 to whom eum�us at those words displeased
 thou didst reply gods how could such a thought
 possess thee stranger surely thy resolve
 is altogether fixt to perish there
 if thou indeed hast purposed with that throng
 to mix whose riot and outrageous acts 400
 of violence echo through the vault of heav'n
 none such as thou serve _them_ their servitors
 are youths wellcloak'd wellvested sleek their heads
 and smug their countenances such alone
 are their attendants and the polish'd boards
 groan overcharg'd with bread with flesh with wine
 rest here content for neither me nor these
 thou weariest aught and when ulysses' son
 shall come he will with vest and mantle fair
 cloath thee and send thee whither most thou would'st 410
 to whom ulysses toilinured
 i wish thee o eum�us dear to jove
 as thou art dear to me for this reprieve
 vouchsafed me kind from wand'ring and from woe
 no worse condition is of mortal man
 than his who wanders for the poor man driv'n
 by woe and by misfortune homeless forth
 a thousand mis'ries day by day endures
 since thou detain'st me then and bidd'st me wait
 his coming tell me if the father still 420
 of famed ulysses live whom going hence
 he left so nearly on the verge of life
 and lives his mother or have both deceased
 already and descended to the shades
 to whom the master swineherd thus replied
 i will inform thee and with strictest truth
 of all that thou hast ask'd laertes lives
 but supplication off'ring to the gods
 ceaseless to free him from a weary life
 so deeply his longabsent son he mourns 430
 and the dear consort of his early youth
 whose death is his chief sorrow and hath brought
 old age on him or ere its date arrived
 she died of sorrow for her glorious son
 and died deplorably67 may never friend
 of mine or benefactor die as she
 while yet she liv'd dejected as she was
 i found it yet some solace to converse
 with her who rear'd me in my childish days
 together with her lovely youngestborn 440
 the princess ctimena for side by side
 we grew and i scarce honour'd less than she
 but soon as our delightful prime we both
 attain'd to samos her they sent a bride
 and were requited with rich dow'r but me
 cloath'd handsomely with tunic and with vest
 and with fair sandals furnish'd to the field
 she order'd forth yet loved me still the more
 i miss her kindness now but gracious heav'n
 prospers the work on which i here attend 450
 hence have i food and hence i drink and hence
 refresh sometimes a worthy guest like thee
 but kindness none experience i or can
 from fair penelope my mistress now
 in word or action so is the house curs'd
 with that lewd throng glad would the servants be
 might they approach their mistress and receive
 advice from her glad too to eat and drink
 and somewhat bear each to his rural home
 for perquisites are ev'ry servant's joy 460
 then answer thus ulysses wise return'd
 alas good swain eum�us how remote
 from friends and country wast thou forced to roam
 ev'n in thy infancy but tell me true
 the city where thy parents dwelt did foes
 pillage it or did else some hostile band
 surprizing thee alone on herd or flock
 attendant bear thee with them o'er the deep
 and sell thee at this hero's house who pay'd
 doubtless for _thee_ no sordid price or small 470
 to whom the master swineherd in reply
 stranger since thou art curious to be told
 my story silent listen and thy wine
 at leisure quaff the nights are longest now
 and such as time for sleep afford and time
 for pleasant conf'rence neither were it good
 that thou should'st to thy couch before thy hour
 since even sleep is hurtful in excess
 whoever here is weary and desires
 early repose let him depart to rest 480
 and at the peep of day when he hath fed
 sufficiently drive forth my master's herd
 but we with wine and a wellfurnish'd board
 supplied will solace mutually derive
 from recollection of our sufferings past
 for who hath much endured and wander'd far
 finds the recital ev'n of sorrow sweet
 now hear thy question satisfied attend
 there is an island thou hast heard perchance
 of such an isle named syria68 it is placed 490
 above ortigia and a dial owns69
 true to the tropic changes of the year
 no great extent she boasts yet is she rich
 in cattle and in flocks in wheat and wine
 no famine knows that people or disease
 noisome of all that elsewhere seize the race
 of miserable man but when old age
 steals on the citizens apollo arm'd
 with silver bow and bright diana come
 whose gentle shafts dismiss them soon to rest 500
 two cities share between them all the isle
 and both were subject to my father's sway
 ctesius ormenides a godlike chief
 it chanced that from phoenicia famed for skill
 in arts marine a vessel thither came
 by sharpers mann'd and laden deep with toys
 now in my father's family abode
 a fair phoenician tall fullsized and skill'd
 in works of elegance whom they beguiled
 while she wash'd linen on the beach beside 510
 the ship a certain mariner of those
 seduced her for all women ev'n the wise
 and sober feeble prove by love assail'd
 who was she he enquired and whence nor she
 scrupled to tell at once her father's home
 i am of sidon70 famous for her works
 in brass and steel daughter of arybas
 who rolls in affluence taphian pirates thence
 stole me returning from the field from whom
 this chief procured me at no little cost 520
 then answer thus her paramour return'd
 wilt thou not hence to sidon in our ship
 that thou may'st once more visit the abode
 of thy own wealthy parents and themselves
 for still they live and still are wealthy deem'd
 to whom the woman even that might be
 would ye ye seamen by a solemn oath
 assure me of a safe conveyance home
 then sware the mariners as she required
 and when their oath was ended thus again 530
 the woman of phoenicia them bespake
 now silence no man henceforth of you all
 accost me though he meet me on the road
 or at yon fountain lest some tattler run
 with tidings home to my old master's ear
 who with suspicion touch'd may _me_ confine
 in cruel bonds and death contrive for _you_
 but be ye close purchase your stores in haste
 and when your vessel shall be freighted full
 quick send me notice for i mean to bring 540
 what gold soever opportune i find
 and will my passage cheerfully defray
 with still another moveable i nurse
 the good man's son an urchin shrewd of age
 to scamper at my side him will i bring
 whom at some foreign market ye shall prove
 saleable at what price soe'er ye will
 so saying she to my father's house return'd
 they there abiding the whole year their ship
 with purchased goods freighted of ev'ry kind 550
 and when her lading now complete she lay
 for sea prepared their messenger arrived
 to summon down the woman to the shore
 a mariner of theirs subtle and shrewd
 then ent'ring at my father's gate produced
 a splendid collar gold with amber strung
 my mother then at home with all her maids
 handling and gazing on it with delight
 proposed to purchase it and he the nod
 significant gave unobserv'd the while 560
 to the phoenician woman and return'd
 she thus informed leading me by the hand
 went forth and finding in the vestibule
 the cups and tables which my father's guests
 had used but they were to the forum gone
 for converse with their friends assembled there
 convey'd three cups into her bosomfolds
 and bore them off whom i a thoughtless child
 accompanied at the decline of day
 when dusky evening had embrown'd the shore 570
 we stepping nimbly on soon reach'd the port
 renown'd where that phoenician vessel lay
 they shipp'd us both and all embarking cleav'd
 their liquid road by favourable gales
 jove's gift impell'd six days we day and night
 continual sailed but when saturnian jove
 now bade the sev'nth bright morn illume the skies
 then shaftarm'd dian struck the woman dead
 at once she pitch'd headlong into the bilge
 like a seacoot whence heaving her again 580
 the seamen gave her to be fishes' food
 and i survived to mourn her but the winds
 and rolling billows them bore to the coast
 of ithaca where with his proper goods
 laertes bought me by such means it chanced
 that e'er i saw the isle in which i dwell
 to whom ulysses glorious chief replied
 eum�us thou hast moved me much thy woes
 enumerating thus at large but jove
 hath neighbour'd all thy evil with this good 590
 that after num'rous sorrows thou hast reach'd
 the house of a kind master at whose hands
 thy sustenance is sure and here thou lead'st
 a tranquil life but i have late arrived
 city after city of the world explored
 thus mutual they conferr'd nor leisure found
 save for short sleep by morning soon surprized
 meantime the comrades of telemachus
 approaching land cast loose the sail and lower'd
 alert the mast then oar'd the vessel in 600
 the anchors heav'd aground71 and hawsers tied
 secure themselves forthissuing on the shore
 breakfast prepared and charged their cups with wine
 when neither hunger now nor thirst remained
 unsatisfied telemachus began
 push ye the sable bark without delay
 home to the city i will to the field
 among my shepherds and my rural works
 survey'd at eve will to the town return
 tomorrow will i set before you wine 610
 and plenteous viands wages of your toil
 to whom the godlike theoclymenus
 whither must i my son who of the chiefs
 of rugged ithaca shall harbour me
 shall i to thine and to thy mother's house
 then thus telemachus discrete replied
 i would invite thee to proceed at once
 to our abode since nought should fail thee there
 of kind reception but it were a course
 now not adviseable for i must myself 620
 be absent neither would my mother's eyes
 behold thee so unfrequent she appears
 before the suitors shunning whom she sits
 weaving continual at the palacetop
 but i will name to thee another chief
 whom thou may'st seek eurymachus the son
 renown'd of prudent polybus whom all
 the people here reverence as a god
 far noblest of them all is he and seeks
 more ardent than his rivals far to wed 630
 my mother and to fill my father's throne
 but he who dwells above jove only knows
 if some disastrous day be not ordain'd
 for them or ere those nuptials shall arrive
 while thus he spake at his right hand appear'd
 messenger of apollo on full wing
 a falcon in his pounces clench'd he bore
 a dove which rending down he pour'd her plumes
 between the galley and telemachus
 then calling him apart the prophet lock'd 640
 his hand in his and thus explain'd the sign
 not undirected by the gods his flight
 on our right hand telemachus this hawk
 hath wing'd propitious soon as i perceived
 i knew him ominousin all the isle
 no family of a more royal note
 than yours is found and yours shall still prevail
 whom thus telemachus answer'd discrete
 grant heav'n my guest that this good word of thine
 fail not and soon thou shalt such bounty share 650
 and friendship at my hands that at first sight
 whoe'er shall meet thee shall pronounce thee blest
 then to pir�us thus his friend approved
 pir�us son of clytius for of all
 my followers to the shore of pylus none
 more prompt than thou hath my desires perform'd
 now also to thy own abode conduct
 this stranger whom with hospitable care
 cherish and honour till myself arrive
 to whom pir�us answer'd spearrenown'd 660
 telemachus however long thy stay
 punctual i will attend him and no want
 of hospitality shall he find with me
 so saying he climb'd the ship then bade the crew
 embarking also cast the hawsers loose
 and each obedient to his bench repair'd
 meantime telemachus his sandals bound
 and lifted from the deck his glitt'ring spear
 then as telemachus had bidden them
 son of divine ulysses casting loose 670
 the hawsers forth they push'd into the deep
 and sought the city while with nimble pace
 proceeding thence telemachus attain'd
 the cottage soon where good eum�us slept
 the swineherd faithful to his num'rous charge

 argument

 telemachus dispatches eum�us to the city to inform penelope of his safe
 return from pylus during his absence ulysses makes himself known to his
 son the suitors having watched for telemachus in vain arrive again at
 ithaca


 it was the hour of dawn when in the cot
 kindling fresh fire ulysses and his friend
 noble eum�us dress'd their morning fare
 and sent the herdsmen with the swine abroad
 seeing telemachus the watchful dogs
 bark'd not but fawn'd around him at that sight
 and at the sound of feet which now approach'd
 ulysses in wing'd accents thus remark'd
 eum�us certain either friend of thine
 is nigh at hand or one whom well thou know'st 10
 thy dogs bark not but fawn on his approach
 obsequious and the sound of feet i hear
 scarce had he ceased when his own son himself
 stood in the vestibule upsprang at once
 eum�us wonderstruck and from his hand
 let fall the cups with which he was employ'd
 mingling rich wine to his young lord he ran
 his forehead kiss'd kiss'd his brightbeaming eyes
 and both his hands weeping profuse the while
 as when a father folds in his embrace 20
 arrived from foreign lands in the tenth year
 his darling son the offspring of his age
 his only one for whom he long hath mourn'd
 so kiss'd the noble peasant o'er and o'er
 godlike telemachus as from death escaped
 and in wing'd accents plaintive thus began
 light of my eyes thou com'st it is thyself
 sweetest telemachus i had no hope
 to see thee more once told that o'er the deep
 thou hadst departed for the pylian coast 30
 enter my precious son that i may sooth
 my soul with sight of thee from far arrived
 for seldom thou thy feeders and thy farm
 visitest in the city custom'd much
 to make abode that thou may'st witness there
 the manners of those hungry suitors proud
 to whom telemachus discrete replied
 it will be so there is great need my friend
 but here for thy sake have i now arrived
 that i may look on thee and from thy lips 40
 learn if my mother still reside at home
 or have become spouse of some other chief
 leaving untenanted ulysses' bed
 to be by noisome spiders webb'd around
 to whom the master swineherd in return
 not so she patient still as ever dwells
 beneath thy roof but all her cheerless days
 despairing wastes and all her nights in tears
 so saying eum�us at his hand received
 his brazen lance and o'er the step of stone 50
 enter'd telemachus to whom his sire
 relinquish'd soon as he appear'd his seat
 but him telemachus forbidding said
 guest keep thy seat our cottage will afford
 some other which eum�us will provide
 he ceased and he returning at the word
 reposed again then good eum�us spread
 green twigs beneath which cover'd with a fleece
 supplied ulysses' offspring with a seat
 he next disposed his dishes on the board 60
 with relicts charged of yesterday with bread
 alert he heap'd the baskets with rich wine
 his ivy cup replenish'd and a seat
 took opposite to his illustrious lord
 ulysses they toward the plenteous feast
 stretch'd forth their hands and hunger now and thirst
 both satisfied telemachus his speech
 addressing to their gen'rous host began
 whence is this guest my father how convey'd
 came he to ithaca what country boast 70
 the mariners with whom he here arrived
 for that on foot he found us not is sure
 to whom eum�us thou didst thus reply
 i will with truth answer thee o my son
 he boasts him sprung from ancestry renown'd
 in spacious crete and hath the cities seen
 of various lands by fate ordain'd to roam
 ev'n now from a thesprotian ship escaped
 he reach'd my cottagebut he is thy own
 i yield him to thee treat him as thou wilt 80
 he is thy suppliant and depends on thee
 then thus telemachus discrete replied
 thy words eum�us pain my very soul
 for what security can i afford
 to any in my house myself am young
 nor yet of strength sufficient to repel
 an offer'd insult and my mother's mind
 in doubtful balance hangs if still with me
 an inmate she shall manage my concerns
 attentive only to her absent lord 90
 and her own good report or shall espouse
 the noblest of her wooers and the best
 entitled by the splendour of his gifts
 but i will give him since i find him lodg'd
 a guest beneath thy roof tunic and cloak
 sword doubleedged and sandals for his feet
 with convoy to the country of his choice
 still if it please thee keep him here thy guest
 and i will send him raiment with supplies
 of all sorts lest he burthen thee and thine 100
 but where the suitors come there shall not he
 with my consent nor stand exposed to pride
 and petulance like theirs lest by some sneer
 they wound him and through him wound also me
 for little is it that the boldest can
 against so many numbers will prevail
 him answer'd then ulysses toilinured
 oh amiable and good since even i
 am free to answer thee i will avow
 my heart within me torn by what i hear 110
 of those injurious suitors who the house
 infest of one noble as thou appear'st
 but saysubmittest thou to their controul
 willingly or because the people sway'd
 by some response oracular incline
 against thee thou hast brothers it may chance
 slow to assist theefor a brother's aid
 is of importance in whatever cause
 for oh that i had youth as i have will
 or that renown'd ulysses were my sire 120
 or that himself might wander home again
 whereof hope yet remains then might i lose
 my head that moment by an alien's hand
 if i would fail ent'ring ulysses' gate
 to be the bane and mischief of them all
 but if alone to multitudes opposed
 i should perchance be foiled nobler it were
 with my own people under my own roof
 to perish than to witness evermore
 their unexampled deeds guests shoved aside 130
 maidens dragg'd forcibly from room to room
 casks emptied of their rich contents and them
 indulging glutt'nous appetite day by day
 enormous without measure without end
 to whom telemachus discrete replied
 stranger thy questions shall from me receive
 true answer enmity or hatred none
 subsists the people and myself between
 nor have i brothers to accuse whose aid
 is of importance in whatever cause 140
 for jove hath from of old with single heirs
 our house supplied arcesias none begat
 except laertes and laertes none
 except ulysses and ulysses me
 left here his only one and unenjoy'd
 thence comes it that our palace swarms with foes
 for all the rulers of the neighbour isles
 samos dulichium and the forestcrown'd
 zacynthus others also rulers here
 in craggy ithaca my mother seek 150
 in marriage and my household stores consume
 but neither she those nuptial rites abhorr'd
 refuses absolute nor yet consents
 to end them they my patrimony waste
 meantime and will destroy me also soon
 as i expect but heav'n disposes all
 eum�us haste my father bear with speed
 news to penelope that i am safe
 and have arrived from pylus i will wait
 till thou return and well beware that none
 hear thee beside for i have many foes
 to whom eum�us thou didst thus reply
 it is enough i understand thou speak'st
 to one intelligent but say beside
 shall i not also as i go inform
 distress'd laertes who while yet he mourn'd
 ulysses only could o'ersee the works
 and dieted among his menials oft
 as hunger prompted him but now they say
 since thy departure to the pylian shore 170
 he neither eats as he was wont nor drinks
 nor oversees his hinds but sighing sits
 and weeping wasted even to the bone
 him then telemachus answer'd discrete
 hard though it be yet to his tears and sighs
 him leave we now we cannot what we would
 for were the ordering of all events
 referr'd to our own choice our first desire
 should be to see my father's glad return
 but once thy tidings told wander not thou 180
 in quest of him but hither speed again
 rather request my mother that she send
 her household's governess without delay
 privately to him she shall best inform
 the ancient king that i have safe arrived
 he said and urged him forth who binding on
 his sandals to the city bent his way
 nor went eum�us from his home unmark'd
 by pallas who in semblance of a fair
 damsel accomplish'd in domestic arts 190
 approaching to the cottage' entrance stood
 opposite by ulysses plain discern'd
 but to his son invisible for the gods
 appear not manifest alike to all
 the mastiffs saw her also and with tone
 querulous hid themselves yet bark'd they not
 she beckon'd him abroad ulysses saw
 the sign and issuing through the outer court
 approach'd her whom the goddess thus bespake
 laertes' progeny for wiles renown'd 200
 disclose thyself to thy own son that death
 concerting and destruction to your foes
 ye may the royal city seek nor long
 shall ye my presence there desire in vain
 for i am ardent to begin the fight
 minerva spake and with her rod of gold
 touch'd him his mantle first and vest she made
 pure as newblanch'd dilating next his form
 she gave dimensions ampler to his limbs
 swarthy again his manly hue became 210
 round his full face and black his bushy chin
 the change perform'd minerva disappear'd
 and the illustrious hero turn'd again
 into the cottage wonder at that sight
 seiz'd on telemachus askance he look'd
 awestruck not unsuspicious of a god
 and in wing'd accents eager thus began
 thou art no longer whom i lately saw
 nor are thy cloaths nor is thy port the same
 thou art a god i know and dwell'st in heav'n 220
 oh smile on us that we may yield thee rites
 acceptable and present thee golden gifts
 elaborate ah spare us pow'r divine
 to whom ulysses hero toilinured
 i am no god why deem'st thou me divine
 i am thy father for whose sake thou lead'st
 a life of woe by violence oppress'd
 so saying he kiss'd his son while from his cheeks
 tears trickled tears till then perforce restrained
 telemachus for he believed him not 230
 his father yet thus wond'ring spake again
 my father said'st thou no thou art not he
 but some divinity beguiles my soul
 with mock'ries to afflict me still the more
 for never mortal man could so have wrought
 by his own pow'r some interposing god
 alone could render thee both young and old
 for old thou wast of late and foully clad
 but wear'st the semblance now of those in heav'n
 to whom ulysses everwise replied 240
 telemachus it is not well my son
 that thou should'st greet thy father with a face
 of wild astonishment and stand aghast
 ulysses save myself none comes be sure
 such as thou seest after ten thousand woes
 which i have borne i visit once again
 my native country in the twentieth year
 this wonder athen�an pallas wrought
 she cloath'd me even with what form she would
 for so she can now poor i seem and old 250
 now young again and clad in fresh attire
 the gods who dwell in yonder heav'n with ease
 dignify or debase a mortal man
 so saying he sat then threw telemachus
 his arms around his father's neck and wept
 desire intense of lamentation seized
 on both soft murmurs utt'ring each indulged
 his grief more frequent wailing than the bird
 eagle or hooknail'd vulture from whose nest
 some swain hath stol'n her yet unfeather'd young 260
 so from their eyelids they big drops distill'd
 of tend'rest grief nor had the setting sun
 cessation of their weeping seen had not
 telemachus his father thus address'd
 what ship convey'd thee to thy native shore
 my father and what country boast the crew
 for that on foot thou not arriv'dst is sure
 then thus divine ulysses toilinured
 my son i will explicit all relate
 conducted by ph�acia's maritime sons 270
 i came a race accustom'd to convey
 strangers who visit them across the deep
 me o'er the billows in a rapid bark
 borne sleeping on the shores of ithaca
 they lay'd rich gifts they gave me also brass
 gold in full bags and beautiful attire
 which warn'd from heav'n i have in caves conceal'd
 by pallas prompted hither i repair'd
 that we might plan the slaughter of our foes
 whose numbers tell me now that i may know 280
 how pow'rful certainly and who they are
 and consultation with my dauntless heart
 may hold if we be able to contend
 ourselves with all or must have aid beside
 then answer thus his son discrete return'd
 my father thy renown hath ever rung
 in thy son's ears and by report thy force
 in arms and wisdom i have oft been told
 but terribly thou speak'st amazementfixt
 i hear can two a multitude oppose 290
 and valiant warriors all for neither ten
 are they nor twenty but more num'rous far
 learn now their numbers fifty youths and two
 came from dulichium they are chosen men
 and six attendants follow in their train
 from samos twenty youths and four arrive
 zacynthus also of achaia's sons
 sends twenty more and our own island adds
 herself her twelve chief rulers medon too
 is there the herald and the bard divine 300
 with other two intendants of the board
 should we within the palace we alone
 assail them all i fear lest thy revenge
 unpleasant to thyself and deadly prove
 frustrating thy return but recollect
 think if thou canst on whose confed'rate arm
 strenuous on our behalf we may rely
 to him replied his patient father bold
 i will inform thee mark weigh well my words
 will pallas and the everlasting sire 310
 alone suffice or need we other aids
 then answer thus telemachus return'd
 good friends indeed are they whom thou hast named
 though throned above the clouds for their controul
 is universal both in earth and heav'n
 to whom ulysses toilworn chief renown'd
 not long will they from battle stand aloof
 when once within my palace in the strength
 of mars to sharp decision we shall urge
 the suitors but thyself at early dawn 320
 our mansion seek that thou may'st mingle there
 with that imperious throng me in due time
 eum�us to the city shall conduct
 in form a miserable beggar old
 but should they with dishonourable scorn
 insult me thou unmov'd my wrongs endure
 and should they even drag me by the feet
 abroad or smite me with the spear thy wrath
 refraining gently counsel them to cease
 from such extravagance but well i know 330
 that cease they will not for their hour is come
 and mark me well treasure what now i say
 deep in thy soul when pallas shall herself
 suggest the measure then shaking my brows
 i will admonish thee thou at the sign
 remove what arms soever in the hall
 remain and in the upper palace safe
 dispose them should the suitors missing them
 perchance interrogate thee then reply
 gentlyi have removed them from the smoke 340
 for they appear no more the arms which erst
 ulysses going hence to ilium left
 but smirch'd and sullied by the breath of fire
 this weightier reason thou shalt also say
 jove taught me lest intoxicate with wine
 ye should assault each other in your brawls
 shaming both feast and courtship for the view
 itself of arms incites to their abuse
 yet leave two faulchions for ourselves alone
 two spears two bucklers which with sudden force 350
 impetuous we will seize and jove allwise
 their valour shall and pallas steal away
 this word store also in remembrance deep
 if mine in truth thou art and of my blood
 then of ulysses to his home returned
 let none hear news from thee no not my sire
 laertes nor eum�us nor of all
 the menials any or ev'n penelope
 that thou and i alone may search the drift
 of our domestic women and may prove 360
 our servingmen who honours and reveres
 and who contemns us both but chiefly thee
 so gracious and so worthy to be loved
 him then thus answer'd his illustrious son
 trust me my father thou shalt soon be taught
 that i am not of drowsy mind obtuse
 but this i think not likely to avail
 or thee or me ponder it yet again
 for tedious were the task farm after farm
 to visit of those servants proving each 370
 and the proud suitors merciless devour
 meantime thy substance nor abstain from aught
 learn if thou wilt and i that course myself
 advise who slights thee of the female train
 and who is guiltless but i would not try
 from house to house the men far better proved
 hereafter if in truth by signs from heav'n
 inform'd thou hast been taught the will of jove
 thus they conferr'd the gallant bark meantime
 reach'd ithaca which from the pylian shore 380
 had brought telemachus with all his band
 within the manyfathom'd port arrived
 his lusty followers haled her far aground
 then carried thence their arms but to the house
 of clytius the illustrious gifts convey'd
 next to the royal mansion they dispatch'd
 an herald charg'd with tidings to the queen
 that her telemachus had reach'd the cot
 of good eum�us and the bark had sent
 home to the city lest the matchless dame 390
 should still deplore the absence of her son
 they then the herald and the swineherd each
 bearing like message to his mistress met
 and at the palace of the godlike chief
 arriving compass'd by the female throng
 inquisitive the herald thus began
 thy son o queen is safe ev'n now return'd
 then drawing nigh to her eum�us told
 his message also from her son received
 and his commission punctually discharged 400
 leaving the palace sought his home again
 grief seized and anguish at those tidings all
 the suitors issuing forth on the outside
 of the high wall they sat before the gate
 when polybus' son eurymachus began
 my friends his arduous task this voyage deem'd
 by us impossible in our despight
 telemachus hath atchieved haste launch we forth
 a sable bark our best which let us man
 with mariners expert who rowing forth 410
 swiftly shall summon our companions home
 scarce had he said when turning where he sat
 amphinomus beheld a bark arrived
 just then in port he saw them furling sail
 and seated with their oars in hand he laugh'd
 through pleasure at that sight and thus he spake
 our message may be spared lo they arrive
 either some god inform'd them or they saw
 themselves the vessel of telemachus
 too swiftly passing to be reach'd by theirs 420
 he spake they rising hasted to the shore
 alert they drew the sable bark aground
 and by his servant each his arms dispatch'd
 to his own home then all to council those
 assembling neither elder of the land
 nor youth allow'd to join them and the rest
 eupithes' son antino�s thus bespake
 ah how the gods have rescued him all day
 perch'd on the airy mountaintop our spies
 successive watch'd and when the sun declined 430
 we never slept on shore but all night long
 till sacred dawn arose plow'd the abyss
 hoping telemachus that we might seize
 and slay him whom some deity hath led
 in our despight safe to his home again
 but frame we yet again means to destroy
 telemachus ahlet not him escape
 for end of this our task while he survives
 none shall be found such prudence he displays
 and wisdom neither are the people now 440
 unanimous our friends as heretofore
 come thenprevent him ere he call the greeks
 to council for he will not long delay
 but will be angry doubtless and will tell
 amid them all how we in vain devised
 his death a deed which they will scarce applaud
 but will perhaps punish and drive us forth
 from our own country to a distant land
 prevent him therefore quickly in the field
 slay him or on the road so shall his wealth 450
 and his possessions on ourselves devolve
 which we will share equally but his house
 shall be the queen's and his whom she shall wed
 yet if not so inclined ye rather chuse
 that he should live and occupy entire
 his patrimony then no longer here
 assembled let us revel at his cost
 but let us all with spousal gifts produced
 from our respective treasures woo the queen
 leaving her in full freedom to espouse 460
 who proffers most and whom the fates ordain
 he ceased the assembly silent sat and mute
 then rose amphinomus amid them all
 offspring renown'd of nisus son himself
 of king aretias he had thither led
 the suitor train who from the pleasant isle
 cornclad of green dulichium had arrived
 and by his speech pleased far beyond them all
 penelope for he was just and wise
 and thus wellcounselling the rest began 470
 not i my friends far be the thought from me
 to slay telemachus it were a deed
 momentous terrible to slay a prince
 first therefore let us counsel ask of heav'n
 and if jove's oracle that course approve
 i will encourage you and will myself
 be active in his death but if the gods
 forbid it then by my advice forbear
 so spake amphinomus whom all approved
 arising then into ulysses' house 480
 they went where each his splendid seat resumed
 a novel purpose occupied meantime
 penelope she purposed to appear
 before her suitors whose design to slay
 telemachus she had from medon learn'd
 the herald for his ear had caught the sound
 toward the hall with her attendant train
 she moved and when most graceful of her sex
 where sat the suitors she arrived between
 the columns standing of the stately dome 490
 and covering with her white veil's lucid folds
 her features to antino�s thus she spake
 antino�s proud contentious evermore
 to mischief prone the people deem thee wise
 past thy compeers and in all grace of speech
 preeminent but such wast never thou
 inhuman why is it thy dark design
 to slay telemachus and why with scorn
 rejectest thou the suppliant's pray'r72 which jove
 himself hath witness'd plots please not the gods 500
 know'st not that thy own father refuge found
 here when he fled before the people's wrath
 whom he had irritated by a wrong
 which with a band of taphian robbers joined
 he offer'd to the thesprots our allies
 they would have torn his heart and would have laid
 all his delights and his possessions waste
 but my ulysses slaked the furious heat
 of their revenge whom thou requitest now
 wasting his goods soliciting his wife 510
 slaying his son and filling me with woe
 but cease i charge thee and bid cease the rest
 to whom the son of polybus replied
 eurymachusicarius' daughter wise
 take courage fair penelope and chace
 these fears unreasonable from thy mind
 the man lives not nor shall who while i live
 and faculty of sight retain shall harm
 telemachus thy son for thus i say
 and thus will i perform his blood shall stream 520
 a sable current from my lance's point
 that moment for the citywaster chief
 ulysses oft me placing on his knees
 hath fill'd my infant grasp with sav'ry food
 and giv'n me ruddy wine i therefore hold
 telemachus of all men most my friend
 nor hath he death to fear from hand of ours
 yet if the gods shall doom him die he must
 so he encouraged her who yet himself
 plotted his death she reascending sought 530
 her stately chamber and arriving there
 deplored with tears her longregretted lord
 till athen�an pallas azureeyed
 dews of soft slumber o'er her lids diffused
 and now at eventide eum�us reach'd
 ulysses and his son a yearling swine
 just slain they skilfully for food prepared
 when pallas drawing nigh smote with her wand
 ulysses at the stroke rend'ring him old
 and his apparel sordid as before 540
 lest knowing him the swain at once should seek
 penelope and let the secret forth
 then foremost him telemachus address'd
 noble eum�us thou art come what news
 bring'st from the city have the warrior band
 of suitors hopeless of their ambush reach'd
 the port again or wait they still for me
 to whom eum�us thou didst thus reply
 no time for such enquiry nor to range
 curious the streets had i but anxious wish'd 550
 to make my message known and to return
 but as it chanced a nimble herald sent
 from thy companions met me on the way
 who reach'd thy mother first yet this i know
 for this i saw passing above the town
 where they have piled a wayside hill of stones
 to mercury i beheld a gallant bark
 ent'ring the port a bark she was of ours
 the crew were num'rous and i mark'd her deep
 laden with shields and spears of double edge 560
 theirs i conjectured her and could no more
 he spake and by eum�us unperceived
 telemachus his father eyed and smiled
 their task accomplish'd and the table spread
 they ate nor any his due portion miss'd
 and hunger now and thirst both sated all
 to rest repair'd and took the gift of sleep

 argument

 telemachus returns to the city and relates to his mother the principal
 passages of his voyage ulysses conducted by eum�us arrives there also
 and enters among the suitors having been known only by his old dog
 argus who dies at his feet the curiosity of penelope being excited by
 the account which eum�us gives her of ulysses she orders him immediately
 into her presence but ulysses postpones the interview till evening when
 the suitors having left the palace there shall be no danger of
 interruption eum�us returns to his cottage


 now look'd aurora from the east abroad
 when the illustrious offspring of divine
 ulysses bound his sandals to his feet
 he seiz'd his sturdy spear match'd to his gripe
 and to the city meditating quick
 departure now the swineherd thus bespake
 father i seek the city to convince
 my mother of my safe return whose tears
 i judge and lamentation shall not cease
 till her own eyes behold me but i lay 10
 on thee this charge into the city lead
 thyself this hapless guest that he may beg
 provision there a morsel and a drop
 from such as may perchance vouchsafe the boon
 i cannot vext and harass'd as i am
 feed all and should the stranger take offence
 the worse for him plain truth is my delight
 to whom ulysses everwise replied
 nor is it my desire to be detained
 better the mendicant in cities seeks 20
 his dole vouchsafe it whosoever may
 than in the villages i am not young
 nor longer of an age that well accords
 with rural tasks nor could i all perform
 that it might please a master to command
 go then and when i shall have warm'd my limbs
 before the hearth and when the risen sun
 shall somewhat chase the cold thy servant's task
 shall be to guide me thither as thou bidd'st
 for this is a vile garb the frosty air 30
 of morning would benumb me thus attired
 and as ye say the city is remote
 he ended and telemachus in haste
 set forth his thoughts all teeming as he went
 with dire revenge soon in the palacecourts
 arriving he reclined his spear against
 a column and proceeded to the hall
 him euryclea first his nurse perceived
 while on the variegated seats she spread
 their fleecy cov'ring swift with tearful eyes 40
 she flew to him and the whole female train
 of brave ulysses swarm'd around his son
 clasping him and his forehead and his neck
 kissing affectionate then came herself
 as golden venus or diana fair
 forth from her chamber to her son's embrace
 the chaste penelope with tears she threw
 her arms around him his brightbeaming eyes
 and forehead kiss'd and with a murmur'd plaint
 maternal in wing'd accents thus began 50
 thou hast return'd light of my eyes my son
 my lov'd telemachus i had no hope
 to see thee more when once thou hadst embark'd
 for pylus privily and with no consent
 from me obtain'd news seeking of thy sire
 but haste unfold declare what thou hast seen
 to whom telemachus discrete replied
 ah mother let my sorrows rest nor me
 from death so lately 'scaped afflict anew
 but bathed and habited in fresh attire 60
 with all the maidens of thy train ascend
 to thy superior chamber there to vow
 a perfect hecatomb to all the gods
 when jove shall have avenged our num'rous wrongs
 i seek the forum there to introduce
 a guest my follower from the pylian shore
 whom sending forward with my noble band
 i bade pir�us to his own abode
 lead him and with all kindness entertain
 the stranger till i should myself arrive 70
 he spake nor flew his words useless away
 she bathed and habited in fresh attire
 vow'd a full hecatomb to all the gods
 would jove but recompense her num'rous wrongs
 then spear in hand went forth her son two dogs
 fleetfooted following him o'er all his form
 pallas diffused a dignity divine
 and ev'ry eye gazed on him as he pass'd
 the suitors throng'd him round joy on their lips
 and welcome but deep mischief in their hearts 80
 he shunning all that crowd chose to himself
 a seat where mentor sat and antiphus
 and halytherses long his father's friends
 sincere who of his voyage much enquired
 then drew pir�us nigh leading his guest
 toward the forum nor telemachus
 stood long aloof but greeted his approach
 and was accosted by pir�us thus
 sir send thy menial women to bring home
 the precious charge committed to my care 90
 thy gifts at menelaus' hands received
 to whom telemachus discrete replied
 pir�us wait for i not yet foresee
 the upshot should these haughty ones effect
 my death clandestine under my own roof
 and parcel my inheritance by lot
 i rather wish those treasures thine than theirs
 but should i with success plan for them all
 a bloody death then wing'd with joy thyself
 bring home those presents to thy joyful friend 100
 so saying he led the anxious stranger thence
 into the royal mansion where arrived
 each cast his mantle on a couch or throne
 and plung'd his feet into a polish'd bath
 there wash'd and lubricated with smooth oils
 from the attendant maidens each received
 tunic and shaggy mantle thus attired
 forth from the baths they stepp'd and sat again
 a maiden next with golden ewer charged
 and silver bowl pour'd water on their hands 110
 and spread the polish'd table which with food
 of all kinds remnants of the last regale
 the mistress of the household charge supplied
 meantime beside a column of the dome
 his mother on a couch reclining twirl'd
 her slender threads they to the furnish'd board
 stretch'd forth their hands and hunger now and thirst
 both satisfied penelope began
 telemachus i will ascend again
 and will repose me on my woeful bed 120
 for such it hath been and with tears of mine
 ceaseless bedew'd e'er since ulysses went
 with atreus' sons to troy for not a word
 thou would'st vouchsafe me till our haughty guests
 had occupied the house again of all
 that thou hast heard if aught indeed thou hast
 of thy longabsent father's wish'd return
 her answer'd then telemachus discrete
 mother at thy request i will with truth
 relate the whole at pylus shore arrived 130
 we nestor found chief of the pylian race
 receiving me in his august abode
 he entertain'd me with such welcome kind
 as a glad father shews to his own son
 longlost and newly found so nestor me
 and his illustrious offspring entertain'd
 but yet assured me that he nought had heard
 from mortal lips of my magnanimous sire
 whether alive or dead with his own steeds
 he sent me and with splendid chariot thence 140
 to spearfamed menelaus atreus' son
 there saw i helen by the gods' decree
 auth'ress of trouble both to greece and troy
 the hero menelaus then enquired
 what cause had urged me to the pleasant vale
 of laced�mon plainly i rehearsed
 the occasion and the hero thus replied
 ye gods they are ambitious of the bed
 of a brave man however base themselves
 but as it chances when the hart hath laid 150
 her fawns newyean'd and sucklings yet to rest
 in some resistless lion's den she roams
 meantime the hills and in the grassy vales
 feeds heedless but the lion to his lair
 returning soon both her and hers destroys
 so shall thy father brave ulysses them
 jove pallas and apollo oh that such
 as erst in wellbuilt lesbos where he strove
 with philomelides whom wrestling flat
 he threw when all achaia's sons rejoiced 160
 ulysses now might mingle with his foes
 short life and bitter nuptials should be theirs
 but thy enquiries neither indirect
 will i evade nor give thee false reply
 but all that from the ancient of the deep73
 i have received will utter hiding nought
 the god declared that he had seen thy sire
 in a lone island sorrowing and detain'd
 an inmate in the grotto of the nymph
 calypso wanting also means by which 170
 to reach the country of his birth again
 for neither gallant barks nor friends had he
 to speed his passage o'er the boundless waves
 so menelaus spake the spearrenown'd
 my errand thus accomplish'd i return'd
 and by the gods with gales propitious blest
 was wafted swiftly to my native shore
 he spake and tumult in his mother's heart
 so speaking raised consolatory next
 the godlike theoclymenus began 180
 consort revered of laertiades
 little the spartan knew but list to me
 for i will plainly prophesy and sure
 be jove of all in heav'n my witness first
 then this thy hospitable board and last
 the household gods of the illustrious chief
 ulysses at whose hearth i have arrived74
 that even now within his native isle
 ulysses somewhere sits or creeps obscure
 witness of these enormities and seeds 190
 sowing of dire destruction for his foes
 so sure an augury while on the deck
 reclining of the gallant bark i saw
 and with loud voice proclaim'd it to thy son
 him answer'd then penelope discrete
 grant heav'n my guest that this good word of thine
 fail not then shalt thou soon such bounty share
 and friendship at my hands that at first sight
 whoe'er shall meet thee shall pronounce thee blest
 thus they conferr'd meantime the suitors hurl'd 200
 the quoit and lance on the smooth area spread
 before ulysses' gate the custom'd scene
 of their contentions sports and clamours rude
 but when the hour of supper now approach'd
 and from the pastures on all sides the sheep
 came with their wonted drivers medon then
 for he of all the heralds pleas'd them most
 and waited at the board them thus address'd
 enough of play young princes ent'ring now
 the house prepare we sedulous our feast 210
 since in welltimed refreshment harm is none
 he spake whose admonition pleas'd at once
 all rising sought the palace there arrived
 each cast his mantle off which on his throne
 or couch he spread then brisk to slaughter fell
 of many a victim sheep and goats and brawns
 they slew all fatted and a pastur'd ox
 hast'ning the banquet nor with less dispatch
 ulysses and eum�us now prepared
 to seek the town when thus the swain began 220
 my guest since thy fixt purpose is to seek
 this day the city as my master bade
 though i in truth much rather wish thee here
 a keeper of our herds yet through respect
 and rev'rence of his orders whose reproof
 i dread for masters seldom gently chide
 i would be gone arise let us depart
 for day already is farspent and soon
 the air of eventide will chill thee more
 to whom ulysses everwise replied 230
 it is enough i understand thou speak'st
 to one intelligent let us depart
 and lead thyself the way but give me first
 if thou have one already hewn a staff
 to lean on for ye have described the road
 rugged and ofttimes dang'rous to the foot
 so saying his tatter'd wallet o'er his back
 he cast suspended by a leathern twist
 eum�us gratified him with a staff
 and forth they went leaving the cottage kept 240
 by dogs and swains he cityward his king
 led on in form a squalid beggar old
 halting and in unseemly garb attired
 but when slowtravelling the craggy way
 they now approach'd the town and had attain'd
 the marble fountain deep which with its streams
 pellucid all the citizens supplied
 ithacus had that fountain framed of old
 with neritus and polyctor over which
 a grove of waternourish'd alders hung 250
 circular on all sides while cold the rill
 ran from the rock on whose tall summit stood
 the altar of the nymphs by all who pass'd
 with sacrifice frequented still and pray'r
 melantheus son of dolius at that fount
 met them the chosen goats of ev'ry flock
 with two assistants from the field he drove
 the suitors' supper he seeing them both
 in surly accent boorish such as fired
 ulysses with resentment thus began 260
 aythis is wellthe villain leads the vile
 thus evermore the gods join like to like
 thou clumsy swineherd whither would'st conduct
 this morselhunting mendicant obscene
 defiler base of banquets many a post
 shall he rub smooth that props him while he begs
 lean alms sole object of his low pursuit
 who ne'er to sword or tripod yet aspired
 would'st thou afford him to me for a guard
 or sweeper of my stalls or to supply 270
 my kids with leaves he should on bulkier thewes
 supported stand though nourish'd but with whey
 but no such useful arts hath he acquired
 nor likes he work but rather much to extort
 from others food for his unsated maw
 but mark my prophecy for it is true
 at famed ulysses' house should he arrive
 his sides shall shatter many a footstool hurl'd
 against them by the offended princes there
 he spake and drawing nigh with his rais'd foot 280
 insolent as he was and brutish smote
 ulysses' haunch yet shook not from his path
 the firmset chief who doubtful mused awhile
 whether to rush on him and with his staff
 to slay him or uplifting him on high
 downward to dash him headlong but his wrath
 restraining calm he suffer'd the affront
 him then eum�us with indignant look
 rebuking rais'd his hands and fervent pray'd
 nymphs of the fountains progeny of jove 290
 if e'er ulysses on your altar burn'd
 the thighs of fatted lambs or kidlings grant
 this my request o let the hero soon
 conducted by some deity return
 so shall he quell that arrogance which safe
 thou now indulgest roaming day by day
 the city while bad shepherds mar the flocks
 to whom the goatherd answer thus return'd
 melantheus marvellous how rare a speech
 the subtle cur hath framed whom i will send 300
 far hence at a convenient time on board
 my bark and sell him at no little gain
 i would that he who bears the silver bow
 as sure might pierce telemachus this day
 in his own house or that the suitors might
 as that same wand'rer shall return no more
 he said and them left pacing slow along
 but soon himself at his lord's house arrived
 there ent'ring bold he with the suitors sat
 opposite to eurymachus for him 310
 he valued most the sewers his portion placed
 of meat before him and the maiden chief
 directress of the household gave him bread
 and now ulysses with the swain his friend
 approach'd when hearing the harmonious lyre
 both stood for phemius had begun his song
 he grasp'd the swineherd's hand and thus he said
 this house eum�us of ulysses seems
 passing magnificent and to be known
 with ease for his among a thousand more 320
 one pile supports another and a wall
 crested with battlements surrounds the court
 firm too the folding doors all force of man
 defy but num'rous guests as i perceive
 now feast within witness the sav'ry steam
 fastfuming upward and the sounding harp
 divine associate of the festive board
 to whom eum�us thou didst thus reply
 thou hast wellguess'd no wonder thou art quick
 on ev'ry theme but let us well forecast 330
 this business wilt thou ent'ring first thyself
 the splendid mansion with the suitors mix
 me leaving here or shall i lead the way
 while thou remain'st behind yet linger not
 lest seeing thee without some servant strike
 or drive thee hence consider which were best
 him answer'd then the patient hero bold
 it is enough i understand thou speak'st
 to one intelligent lead thou the way
 me leaving here for neither stripes nor blows 340
 to me are strange much exercised with pain
 in fight and on the deep i have long since
 learn'd patience follow next what follow may
 but to suppress the appetite i deem
 impossible the stomach is a source
 of ills to man an avaricious gulph
 destructive which to satiate ships are rigg'd
 seas travers'd and fierce battles waged remote
 thus they discoursing stood argus the while
 ulysses' dog uplifted where he lay 350
 his head and ears erect ulysses him
 had bred long since himself but rarely used
 departing first to ilium him the youths
 in other days led frequent to the chace
 of wild goat hart and hare but now he lodg'd
 a poor old castoff of his lord forlorn
 where mules and oxen had before the gate
 much ordure left with which ulysses' hinds
 should in due time manure his spacious fields
 there lay with dogdevouring vermin foul 360
 all over argus soon as he perceived
 longlost ulysses nigh down fell his ears
 clapp'd close and with his tail glad sign he gave
 of gratulation impotent to rise
 and to approach his master as of old
 ulysses noting him wiped off a tear
 unmark'd and of eum�us quick enquired
 i can but wonder seeing such a dog
 thus lodg'd eum�us beautiful in form
 he is past doubt but whether he hath been 370
 as fleet as fair i know not rather such
 perchance as masters sometimes keep to grace
 their tables nourish'd more for shew than use
 to whom eum�us thou didst thus reply
 he is the dog of one dead far remote
 but had he now such featperforming strength
 as when ulysses left him going hence
 to ilium in one moment thou shouldst mark
 astonish'd his agility and force
 he never in the sylvan deep recess 380
 the wild beast saw that 'scaped him and he track'd
 their steps infallible but he hath now
 no comfort for the master dead afar
 the heedless servants care not for his dog
 domestics missing once their lord's controul
 grow wilful and refuse their proper tasks
 for whom jove dooms to servitude he takes
 at once the half of that man's worth away
 he said and ent'ring at the portal join'd
 the suitors then his destiny released 390
 old argus soon as he had lived to see
 ulysses in the twentieth year restored
 godlike telemachus long ere the rest
 marking the swineherd's entrance with a nod
 summon'd him to approach eum�us cast
 his eye around and seeing vacant there
 the seat which the dispenser of the feast
 was wont to occupy while he supplied
 the num'rous guests planted it right before
 telemachus and at his table sat 400
 on which the herald placed for him his share
 of meat and from the baskets gave him bread
 soon after _him_ ulysses enter'd slow
 the palace like a squalid beggar old
 staffpropp'd and in loose tatters foul attired
 within the portal on the ashen sill
 he sat and seeming languid lean'd against
 a cypress pillar by the builder's art
 polish'd long since and planted at the door
 then took telemachus a loaf entire 410
 forth from the elegant basket and of flesh
 a portion large as his two hands contained
 and beck'ning close the swineherd charged him thus
 these to the stranger whom advise to ask
 some dole from ev'ry suitor bashful fear
 ill suits the mendicant by want oppress'd
 he spake eum�us went and where he sat
 arriving in wing'd accents thus began
 telemachus oh stranger sends thee these
 and counsels thee to importune for more 420
 the suitors one by one for bashful fear
 ill suits the mendicant by want oppress'd
 to whom ulysses everwise replied
 jove king of all grant ev'ry good on earth
 to kind telemachus and the complete
 accomplishment of all that he desires
 he said and with both hands outspread the mess
 receiving as he sat on his worn bag
 disposed it at his feet long as the bard
 chaunted he ate and when he ceas'd to eat 430
 then also ceas'd the bard divine to sing
 and now ensued loud clamour in the hall
 and tumult when minerva drawing nigh
 to laertiades impell'd the chief
 crusts to collect or any pittance small
 at ev'ry suitor's hand for trial's sake
 of just and unjust yet deliv'rance none
 from evil she design'd for any there
 from left to right75 his progress he began
 petitioning with outstretch'd hands the throng 440
 as one familiar with the beggar's art
 they pitying gave to him but view'd him still
 with wonder and enquiries mutual made
 who and whence was he then the goatherd rose
 melanthius and th' assembly thus address'd
 hear me ye suitors of th' illustrious queen
 this guest of whom ye ask i have beheld
 elsewhere the swineherd brought him but himself
 i know not neither who nor whence he is
 so he then thus antino�s stern rebuked 450
 the swineherd ah notorious as thou art
 why hast thou shewn this vagabond the way
 into the city are we not enough
 infested with these troublers of our feasts
 deem'st it a trifle that such numbers eat
 at thy lord's cost and hast thou therefore led
 this fellow hither found we know not where
 to whom eum�us thou didst thus reply
 antino�s though of high degree thou speak'st
 not wisely what man to another's house 460
 repairs to invite him to a feast unless
 he be of those who by profession serve
 the public prophet healer of disease
 ingenious artist or some bard divine
 whose music may exhilarate the guests
 these and such only are in ev'ry land
 call'd to the banquet none invites the poor
 who much consume and no requital yield
 but thou of all the suitors roughly treat'st
 ulysses' servants most and chiefly me 470
 yet thee i heed not while the virtuous queen
 dwells in this palace and her godlike son
 to whom telemachus discrete replied
 peace answer not verbose a man like him
 antino�s hath a tongue accustom'd much
 to tauntings and promotes them in the rest
 then turning to antino�s quick he said
 antino�s as a father for his son
 takes thought so thou for me who bidd'st me chase
 the stranger harshly hence but god forbid76 480
 impart to him i grudge not but myself
 exhort thee to it neither in this cause
 fear thou the queen or in the least regard
 whatever menial throughout all the house
 of famed ulysses ah within thy breast
 dwells no such thought thou lov'st not to impart
 to others but to gratify thyself
 to whom antino�s answer thus return'd
 highsoaring and intemp'rate in thy speech
 how hast thou said telemachus would all 490
 as much bestow on him he should not seek
 admittance here again three months to come
 so saying he seized the stool which banqueting
 he press'd with his nice feet and from beneath
 the table forth advanced it into view
 the rest all gave to him with bread and flesh
 filling his wallet and ulysses now
 returning to his threshold there to taste
 the bounty of the greeks paused in his way
 beside antino�s whom he thus address'd 500
 kind sir vouchsafe to me for thou appear'st
 not least but greatest of the achaians here
 and hast a kingly look it might become
 thee therefore above others to bestow
 so should i praise thee wheresoe'er i roam
 i also lived the happy owner once
 of such a stately mansion and have giv'n
 to num'rous wand'rers whencesoe'er they came
 all that they needed i was also served
 by many and enjoy'd all that denotes 510
 the envied owner opulent and blest
 but jove for so it pleas'd him hath reduced
 my all to nothing prompting me in league
 with rovers of the deep to sail afar
 to �gypt for my sure destruction there
 within th' �gyptian stream my barks welloar'd
 i station'd and enjoining strict my friends
 to watch them closeattendant at their side
 commanded spies into the hilltops but they
 under the impulse of a spirit rash 520
 and hot for quarrel the wellcultur'd fields
 pillaged of the �gyptians captive led
 their wives and littleones and slew the men
 ere long the loud alarm their city reach'd
 down came the citizens by dawn of day
 with horse and foot and with the gleam of arms
 filling the plain then jove with panic dread
 struck all my people none found courage more
 to stand for mischiefs swarm'd on ev'ry side
 there num'rous by the glitt'ring spear we fell 530
 slaughter'd while others they conducted thence
 alive to servitude but me they gave
 to dmetor king in cyprus jasus' son
 he entertained me liberally and thence
 this land i reach'd but poor and woebegone
 then answer thus antino�s harsh return'd
 what d�mon introduced this nuisance here
 this troubler of our feast stand yonder keep
 due distance from my table or expect
 to see an �gypt and a cyprus worse 540
 than those bold mendicant and void of shame
 thou hauntest each and inconsid'rate each
 gives to thee because gifts at other's cost
 are cheap and plentifully serv'd themselves
 they squander heedless viands not their own
 to whom ulysses while he slow retired
 gods how illib'ral with that specious form
 thou wouldst not grant the poor a grain of salt
 from thy own board who at another's fed
 so nobly canst thou not spare a crust to me 550
 he spake then raged antino�s still the more
 and in wing'd accents louring thus replied
 take such dismission now as thou deserv'st
 opprobrious hast thou dared to scoff at me
 so saying he seized his stool and on the joint
 of his right shoulder smote him firm as rock
 he stood by no such force to be displaced
 but silent shook his brows and dreadful deeds
 of vengeance ruminating sought again
 his seat the threshold where his bag fullcharged 560
 he grounded and the suitors thus address'd
 hear now ye suitors of the matchless queen
 my bosom's dictates trivial is the harm
 scarce felt if fighting for his own his sheep
 perchance or beeves a man receive a blow
 but me antino�s struck for that i ask'd
 food from him merely to appease the pangs
 of hunger source of num'rous ills to man
 if then the poor man have a god t' avenge
 his wrongs i pray to him that death may seize 570
 antino�s ere his nuptial hour arrive
 to whom antino�s answer thus return'd
 son of eupithes either seated there
 or going hence eat stranger and be still
 lest for thy insolence by hand or foot
 we drag thee forth and thou be flay'd alive
 he ceased whom all indignant heard and thus
 ev'n his own proud companions censured him
 antino�s thou didst not well to smite
 the wretched vagabond o thou art doom'd 580
 for ever if there be a god in heav'n77
 for in similitude of strangers oft
 the gods who can with ease all shapes assume
 repair to populous cities where they mark
 the outrageous and the righteous deeds of men
 so they for whose reproof he little cared
 but in his heart telemachus that blow
 resented anguishtorn yet not a tear
 he shed but silent shook his brows and mused
 terrible things penelope meantime 590
 told of the wand'rer so abused beneath
 her roof among her maidens thus exclaim'd
 so may apollo glorious archer smite
 thee also then eurynome replied
 oh might our pray'rs prevail none of them all
 should see brightcharioted aurora more
 her answer'd then penelope discrete
 nurse they are odious all for that alike
 all teem with mischief but antino�s' looks
 remind me ever of the gloom of death 600
 a stranger hath arrived who begging roams
 the house for so his penury enjoins
 the rest have giv'n him and have fill'd his bag
 with viands but antino�s hath bruised
 his shoulder with a footstool hurl'd at him
 while thus the queen conversing with her train
 in her own chamber sat ulysses made
 plenteous repast then calling to her side
 eum�us thus she signified her will
 eum�us noble friend bid now approach 610
 yon stranger i would speak with him and ask
 if he has seen ulysses or have heard
 tidings perchance of the afflicted chief
 for much a wand'rer by his garb he seems
 to whom eum�us thou didst thus reply
 were those achaians silent thou shouldst hear
 o queen a tale that would console thy heart
 three nights i housed him and within my cot
 three days detain'd him for his ship he left
 a fugitive and came direct to me 620
 but half untold his hist'ry still remains
 as when his eye one fixes on a bard
 from heav'n instructed in such themes as charm
 the ear of mortals ever as he sings
 the people press insatiable to hear
 so in my cottage seated at my side
 that stranger with his tale enchanted me
 laertes he affirms hath been his guest
 erewhile in crete where minos' race resides
 and thence he hath arrived after great loss 630
 a suppliant to the very earth abased
 he adds that in thesprotia's neighbour realm
 he of ulysses heard both that he lives
 and that he comes laden with riches home
 to whom penelope discrete replied
 haste call him i would hear myself his tale
 meantime let these or in the palace gate
 sport jocular or here their hearts are light
 for their possessions are secure _their_ wine
 none drinks or eats _their_ viands save their own 640
 while my abode day after day themselves
 haunting my beeves and sheep and fatted goats
 slay for the banquet and my casks exhaust
 extravagant whence endless waste ensues
 for no such friend as was ulysses once
 have i to expel the mischief but might he
 revisit once his native shores again
 then aided by his son he should avenge
 incontinent the wrongs which now i mourn
 then sneezed telemachus with sudden force 650
 that all the palace rang his mother laugh'd
 and in wing'd accents thus the swain bespake
 hastebid him hitherhear'st thou not the sneeze
 propitious of my son oh might it prove
 a presage of inevitable death
 to all these revellers may none escape
 now mark me well should the event his tale
 confirm at my own hands he shall receive
 mantle and tunic both for his reward
 she spake he went and where ulysses sat 660
 arriving in wing'd accents thus began
 penelope my venerable friend
 calls thee the mother of telemachus
 oppress'd by num'rous troubles she desires
 to ask thee tidings of her absent lord
 and should the event verify thy report
 thy meed shall be a boon which much thou need'st
 tunic and mantle but she gives no more
 thy sustenance thou must as now obtain78
 begging it at their hands who chuse to give 670
 then thus ulysses hero toilinured
 eum�us readily i can relate
 truth and truth only to the prudent queen
 icarius' daughter for of him i know
 much and have suff'red sorrows like his own
 but dread i feel of this imperious throng
 perverse whose riot and outrageous acts
 of violence echo through the vault of heav'n
 and even now when for no fault of mine
 yon suitor struck me as i pass'd and fill'd 680
 my flesh with pain neither telemachus
 nor any interposed to stay his arm
 now therefore let penelope although
 impatient till the sun descend postpone
 her questions then she may enquire secure
 when comes her husband and may nearer place
 my seat to the hearthside for thinly clad
 thou know'st i am whose aid i first implored
 he ceas'd at whose reply eum�us sought
 again the queen but ere he yet had pass'd 690
 the threshold thus she greeted his return
 com'st thou alone eum�us why delays
 the invited wand'rer dreads he other harm
 or sees he aught that with a bashful awe
 fills him the bashful poor are poor indeed
 to whom eum�us thou didst thus reply
 he hath well spoken none who would decline
 the rudeness of this contumelious throng
 could answer otherwise thee he entreats
 to wait till sunset and that course o queen 700
 thou shalt thyself far more commodious find
 to hold thy conf'rence with the guest alone
 then answer thus penelope return'd
 the stranger i perceive is not unwise
 whoe'er he be for on the earth are none
 proud insolent and profligate as these
 so spake the queen then all his message told
 the good eum�us to the suitors went
 again and with his head inclined toward
 telemachus lest others should his words 710
 witness in accents wing'd him thus address'd
 friend and kind master i return to keep
 my herds and to attend my rural charge
 whence we are both sustain'd keep thou meantime
 all here with vigilance but chiefly watch
 for thy own good and save _thyself_ from harm
 for num'rous here brood mischief whom the gods
 exterminate ere yet their plots prevail
 to whom telemachus discrete replied
 so be it father and thy eveningmess 720
 eaten depart tomorrow come again
 bringing fair victims hither i will keep
 i and the gods meantime all here secure
 he ended then resumed once more the swain
 his polish'd seat and both with wine and food
 now satiate to his charge return'd the court
 leaving and all the palace throng'd with guests
 they for it now was evening all alike
 turn'd jovial to the song and to the dance

 argument

 the beggar irus arrives at the palace a combat takes place between him
 and ulysses in which irus is by one blow vanquished penelope appears to
 the suitors and having reminded them of the presents which she had a
 right to expect from them receives a gift from each eurymachus
 provoked by a speech of ulysses flings a footstool at him which knocks
 down the cupbearer a general tumult is the consequence which
 continues till by the advice of telemachus seconded by amphinomus the
 suitors retire to their respective homes


 now came a public mendicant a man
 accustom'd seeking alms to roam the streets
 of ithaca one never sated yet
 with food or drink yet muscle had he none
 or strength of limb though giantbuilt in show
 arn�us was the name which at his birth
 his mother gave him but the youthful band
 of suitors whom as messenger he served
 all named him irus he arriving sought
 to drive ulysses forth from his own home 10
 and in rough accents rude him thus rebuked
 forth from the porch old man lest by the foot
 i drag thee quickly forth seest not how all
 wink on me and by signs give me command
 to drag thee hence nor is it aught but shame
 that checks me yet arise lest soon with fists
 thou force me to adjust our diff'rence
 to whom ulysses low'ring dark replied
 peace fellow neither word nor deed of mine
 wrongs thee nor feel i envy at the boon 20
 however plentiful which thou receiv'st
 the sill may hold us both thou dost not well
 to envy others thou appear'st like me
 a vagrant plenty is the gift of heav'n
 but urge me not to trial of our fists
 lest thou provoke me and i stain with blood
 thy bosom and thy lips old as i am
 so my attendance should tomorrow prove
 more tranquil here for thou should'st leave i judge
 ulysses' mansion never to return 30
 then answer'd irus kindling with disdain
 gods with what volubility of speech
 the tablehunter prates like an old hag
 collied with chimneysmutch but ah beware
 for i intend thee mischief and to dash
 with both hands ev'ry grinder from thy gums
 as men untooth a pig pilf'ring the corn
 comegird thee that all here may view the strife
 but how wilt thou oppose one young as i
 thus on the threshold of the lofty gate 40
 they wrangling chafed each other whose dispute
 the highborn youth antino�s mark'd he laugh'd
 delighted and the suitors thus address'd
 oh friends no pastime ever yet occurr'd
 pleasant as this which now the gods themselves
 afford us irus and the stranger brawl
 as they would box hastelet us urge them on
 he said at once loudlaughing all arose
 the illclad disputants they round about
 encompass'd and antino�s thus began 50
 attend ye noble suitors to my voice
 two paunches lie of goats here on the fire
 which fill'd with fat and blood we set apart
 for supper he who conquers and in force
 superior proves shall freely take the paunch
 which he prefers and shall with us thenceforth
 feast always neither will we here admit
 poor man beside to beg at our repasts
 he spake whom all approved next artful chief
 ulysses thus dissembling them address'd 60
 princes unequal is the strife between
 a young man and an old with mis'ry worn
 but hunger always counsellor of ill
 me moves to fight that many a bruise received
 i may be foil'd at last now swear ye all
 a solemn oath that none for irus' sake
 shall interposing smite me with his fist
 clandestine forcing me to yield the prize
 he ceas'd and as he bade all present swore
 a solemn oath then thus amid them all 70
 standing telemachus majestic spake
 guest if thy courage and thy manly mind
 prompt thee to banish this man hence no force
 fear thou beside for who smites thee shall find
 yet other foes to cope with i am here
 in the host's office and the royal chiefs
 eurymachus and antino�s alike
 discrete accord unanimous with me
 he ceas'd whom all approved then with his rags
 ulysses braced for decency his loins 80
 around but gave to view his brawny thighs
 proportion'd fair and stripp'd his shoulders broad
 his chest and arms robust while at his side
 dilating more the hero's limbs and more
 minerva stood the assembly with fixt eyes
 astonish'd gazed on him and looking full
 on his next friend a suitor thus remark'd
 irus shall be in irus found no more
 he hath pull'd evil on himself what thewes
 and what a haunch the senior's tatters hid 90
 so hemeantime in irus' heart arose
 horrible tumult yet his loins by force
 girding the servants dragg'd him to the fight
 pale and his flesh all quiv'ring as he came
 whose terrors thus antino�s sharp rebuked
 now wherefore liv'st and why wast ever born
 thou mountainmass of earth if such dismay
 shake thee at thought of combat with a man
 ancient as he and worn with many woes
 but mark i threaten not in vain should he 100
 o'ercome thee and in force superior prove
 to echetus thou go'st my sable bark
 shall waft thee to epirus where he reigns
 enemy of mankind of nose and ears
 he shall despoil thee with his ruthless steel
 and tearing by the roots the parts away79
 that mark thy sex shall cast them to the dogs
 he said _his_ limbs new terrors at that sound
 shook under him into the middle space
 they led him and each raised his hands on high 110
 then doubtful stood ulysses toilinured
 whether to strike him lifeless to the earth
 at once or fell him with a managed blow
 to smite with managed force at length he chose
 as wisest lest betray'd by his own strength
 he should be known with elevated fists
 both stood him irus on the shoulder struck
 but he his adversary on the neck
 pash'd close beneath his ear he split the bones
 and blood in sable streams ran from his mouth 120
 with many an hideous yell he dropp'd his teeth
 chatter'd and with his heels he drumm'd the ground
 the wooers at that sight lifting their hands
 in glad surprize laugh'd all their breath away
 then through the vestibule and right across
 the court ulysses dragg'd him by the foot
 into the portico where propping him
 against the wall and giving him his staff
 in accents wing'd he bade him thus farewell
 there seated now dogs drive and swine away 130
 nor claim thyself so base supreme controul
 o'er other guests and mendicants lest harm
 reach thee hereafter heavier still than this
 so saying his tatter'd wallet o'er his back
 he threw suspended by its leathern twist
 and tow'rd the threshold turning sat again
 they laughing ceaseless still the palacedoor
 reenter'd and him courteous thus bespake
 jove and all jove's assessors in the skies
 vouchsafe thee stranger whatsoe'er it be 140
 thy heart's desire who hast our ears reliev'd
 from that insatiate beggar's irksome tone
 soon to epirus he shall go dispatch'd
 to echetus the king pest of mankind
 so they to whose propitious words the chief
 listen'd delighted then antino�s placed
 the paunch before him and amphinomus
 two loaves selected from the rest he fill'd
 a goblet also drank to him and said
 my father hail o stranger be thy lot 150
 hereafter blest though adverse now and hard
 to whom ulysses everwise replied
 to me amphinomus endued thou seem'st
 with much discretion who art also son
 of such a sire whose fair report i know
 dulichian nysus opulent and good
 fame speaks thee his and thou appear'st a man
 judicious hear me therefore mark me well
 earth nourishes of all that breathe or creep
 no creature weak as man for while the gods 160
 grant him prosperity and health no fear
 hath he or thought that he shall ever mourn
 but when the gods with evils unforeseen
 smite him he bears them with a grudging mind
 for such as the complexion of his lot
 by the appointment of the sire of all
 such is the colour of the mind of man
 i too have been familiar in my day
 with wealth and ease but i was then selfwill'd
 and many wrong'd embolden'd by the thought 170
 of my own father's and my brethren's pow'r
 let no man therefore be unjust but each
 use modestly what gift soe'er of heav'n
 so do not these these ever bent i see
 on deeds injurious the possessions large
 consuming and dishonouring the wife
 of one who will not as i judge remain
 long absent from his home but is perchance
 ev'n at the door thee therefore may the gods
 steal hence in time ah meet not his return 180
 to his own country for they will not part
 he and the suitors without blood i think
 if once he enter at these gates again
 he ended and libation pouring quaff'd
 the generous juice then in the prince's hand
 replaced the cup he pensive and his head
 inclining low pass'd from him for his heart
 forboded ill yet 'scaped not even he
 but in the snare of pallas caught his life
 to the heroic arm and spear resign'd 190
 of brave telemachus reaching at length
 the seat whence he had ris'n he sat again
 minerva then goddess c�ruleaneyed
 prompted icarius' daughter to appear
 before the suitors so to expose the more
 their drift iniquitous and that herself
 more bright than ever in her husband's eyes
 might shine and in her son's much mirth she feign'd80
 and bursting into laughter thus began
 i wish eurynome who never felt 200
 that wish till now though i detest them all
 to appear before the suitors in whose ears
 i will admonish for his good my son
 not to associate with that lawless crew
 too much who speak him fair but foul intend
 then answer thus eurynome return'd
 my daughter wisely hast thou said and well
 go bathe thee and anoint thy face then give
 to thy dear son such counsel as thou wilt
 without reserve but shew not there thy cheeks 210
 sullied with tears for profit none accrues
 from grief like thine that never knows a change
 and he is now bearded and hath attained
 that age which thou wast wont with warmest pray'r
 to implore the gods that he might live to see
 her answer'd then penelope discrete
 persuade not me though studious of my good
 to bathe eurynome or to anoint
 my face with oil for all my charms the gods
 inhabitants of olympus then destroy'd 220
 when he embarking left me go command
 hippodamia and auton�e
 that they attend me to the hall and wait
 beside me there for decency forbids
 that i should enter to the men alone
 she ceas'd and through the house the ancient dame
 hasted to summon whom she had enjoin'd
 but pallas goddess of the azure eyes
 diffused meantime the kindly dew of sleep
 around icarius' daughter on her couch 230
 reclining soon as she reclin'd she dozed
 and yielded to soft slumber all her frame
 then that the suitors might admire her more
 the glorious goddess cloath'd her as she lay
 with beauty of the skies her lovely face
 she with ambrosia purified with such
 as cytherea chapletcrown'd employs
 herself when in the eyeensnaring dance
 she joins the graces to a statelier height
 beneath her touch and ampler size she grew 240
 and fairer than the elephantine bone
 fresh from the carver's hand these gifts conferr'd
 divine the awful deity retired
 and now loudprattling as they came arrived
 her handmaids sleep forsook her at the sound
 she wiped away a tear and thus she said
 me gentle sleep sad mourner as i am
 hath here involved o would that by a death
 as gentle chaste diana would herself
 this moment set me free that i might waste 250
 my life no longer in heartfelt regret
 of a lamented husband's various worth
 and virtue for in greece no peer had he
 she said and through her chambers' stately door
 issuing descended neither went she sole
 but with those two fair menials of her train
 arriving most majestic of her sex
 in presence of the num'rous guests beneath
 the portal of the stately dome she stood
 between her maidens with her lucid veil 260
 mantling her lovely cheeks then ev'ry knee
 trembled and ev'ry heart with am'rous heat
 dissolv'd her charms all coveting alike
 while to telemachus her son she spake
 telemachus thou art no longer wise
 as once thou wast and even when a child
 for thriven as thou art and at full size
 arrived of man so fair proportion'd too
 that ev'n a stranger looking on thy growth
 and beauty would pronounce thee nobly born 270
 yet is thy intellect still immature
 for what is this why suffer'st thou a guest
 to be abused in thy own palace how
 know'st not that if the stranger seated here
 endure vexation the disgrace is thine
 her answer'd then telemachus discrete
 i blame thee not my mother that thou feel'st
 thine anger moved yet want i not a mind
 able to mark and to discern between
 evil and good child as i lately was 280
 although i find not promptitude of thought
 sufficient always overaw'd and check'd
 by such a multitude all bent alike
 on mischief of whom none takes part with me
 but irus and the stranger have not fought
 urged by the suitors and the stranger prov'd
 victorious yesheav'n knows how much i wish
 that in the palace some some in the court
 the suitors all sat vanquish'd with their heads
 depending low and with enfeebled limbs 290
 even as that same irus while i speak
 with chin on bosom propp'd at the hallgate
 sits drunkardlike incapable to stand
 erect or to regain his proper home
 so they and now addressing to the queen
 his speech eurymachus thus interposed
 o daughter of icarius could all eyes
 throughout i�sian argos81 view thy charms
 discrete penelope more suitors still
 assembling in thy courts would banquet here 300
 from morn to eve for thou surpassest far
 in beauty stature worth all womankind
 to whom replied penelope discrete
 the gods eurymachus reduced to nought
 my virtue beauty stature when the greeks
 whom my ulysses follow'd sail'd to troy
 could he returning my domestic charge
 himself intend far better would my fame
 be so secured and wider far diffused
 but i am wretched now such storms the gods 310
 of woe have sent me when he left his home
 clasping my wrist with his right hand he said
 my love for i imagine not that all
 the warrior greeks shall safe from troy return
 since fame reports the trojans brave in fight
 skill'd in the spear mighty to draw the bow
 and nimble vaulters to the backs of steeds
 highmettled which to speediest issue bring
 the dreadful struggle of allwasting war
 i know not therefore whether heav'n intend 320
 my safe return or i must perish there
 but manage thou at home cherish as now
 while i am absent or more dearly still
 my parents and what time our son thou seest
 mature then wed wed even whom thou wilt
 and hence to a new homesuch were his words
 all which shall full accomplishment ere long
 receive the day is near when hapless i
 lost to all comfort by the will of jove
 must meet the nuptials that my soul abhors 330
 but this thought now afflicts me and my mind
 continual haunts such was not heretofore
 the suitors' custom'd practice all who chose
 to engage in competition for a wife
 wellqualitied and wellendow'd produced
 from their own herds and fatted flocks a feast
 for the bride's friends and splendid presents made
 but never ate as ye at others' cost
 she ceased then brave ulysses toilinured
 rejoiced that soothing them she sought to draw 340
 from each some gift although on other views
 and more important far himself intent
 then thus antino�s eupithes' son
 icarius' daughter wise only accept
 such gifts as we shall bring for gifts demand
 that grace nor can be decently refused
 but to our rural labours or elsewhere
 depart not we till first thy choice be made
 of the achaian chief in thy esteem
 antino�s spake whose answer all approved 350
 then each dispatch'd his herald who should bring
 his master's gift antino�s' herald first
 a mantle of surpassing beauty brought
 wide various with no fewer clasps adorn'd
 than twelve all golden and to ev'ry clasp
 was fitted opposite its eye exact
 next to eurymachus his herald bore
 a necklace of wrought gold with amber rich
 bestudded ev'ry bead bright as a sun
 two servants for eurydamas produced 360
 earpendants fashion'd with laborious art
 broad triplegemm'd of brilliant light profuse
 the herald of polyctor's son the prince
 pisander brought a collar to his lord
 a sumptuous ornament each greecian gave
 and each a gift dissimilar from all
 then loveliest of her sex turning away
 she sought her chamber whom her maidens fair
 attended charged with those illustrious gifts
 then turn'd they all to dance and pleasant song 370
 joyous expecting the approach of ev'n
 ere long the dusky evening came and them
 found sporting still then placing in the hall
 three hearths that should illumine wide the house
 they compass'd them around with fuelwood
 longseason'd and newsplit mingling the sticks
 with torches the attendant women watch'd
 and fed those fires by turns to whom himself
 their unknown sov'reign thus his speech address'd
 ye maidens of the longregretted chief 380
 ulysses to the innercourts retire
 and to your virtuous queen that following there
 your sev'ral tasks spinning and combing wool
 ye may amuse her i meantime for these
 will furnish light and should they chuse to stay
 till golden morn appear they shall not tire
 my patience aught for i can much endure
 he said they titt'ring on each other gazed
 but one melantho with the blooming cheeks
 rebuked him rudely dolius was her sire 390
 but by penelope she had been reared
 with care maternal and in infant years
 supplied with many a toy yet even she
 felt not her mistress' sorrows in her heart
 but of eurymachus enamour'd oft
 his lewd embraces met she with sharp speech
 reproachful to ulysses thus replied
 whywhat a brainsick vagabond art thou
 who neither wilt to the smith's forge retire
 for sleep nor to the public portico 400
 but here remaining with audacious prate
 disturb'st this num'rous company restrain'd
 by no respect or fear either thou art
 with wine intoxicated or perchance
 art always fool and therefore babblest now
 say art thou drunk with joy that thou hast foiled
 the beggar irus tremble lest a man
 stronger than irus suddenly arise
 who on thy temples pelting thee with blows
 far heavier than his shall drive thee hence 410
 with many a bruise and foul with thy own blood
 to whom ulysses frowning stern replied
 snarler telemachus shall be inform'd
 this moment of thy eloquent harangue
 that he may hew thee for it limb from limb
 so saying he scared the women back they flew
 into the house but each with falt'ring knees
 through dread for they believ'd his threats sincere
 he then illumin'd by the triple blaze
 watch'd close the lights busy from hearth to hearth 420
 but in his soul meantime far other thoughts
 revolved tremendous not conceived in vain
 nor pallas that they might exasp'rate more
 laertes' son permitted to abstain
 from heartcorroding bitterness of speech
 those suitors proud of whom eurymachus
 offspring of polybus while thus he jeer'd
 ulysses set the others in a roar
 hear me ye suitors of the illustrious queen
 i shall promulge my thought this man methinks 430
 not unconducted by the gods hath reach'd
 ulysses' mansion for to me the light
 of yonder torches altogether seems
 his own an emanation from his head
 which not the smallest growth of hair obscures
 he ended and the citywaster chief
 himself accosted next art thou disposed
 to serve me friend would i afford thee hire
 a labourer at my farm thou shalt not want
 sufficient wages thou may'st there collect 440
 stones for my fences and may'st plant my oaks
 for which i would supply thee all the year
 with food and cloaths and sandals for thy feet
 but thou hast learn'd less creditable arts
 nor hast a will to work preferring much
 by beggary from others to extort
 wherewith to feed thy neversated maw
 then answer thus ulysses wise return'd
 forbear eurymachus for were we match'd
 in work against each other thou and i 450
 mowing in springtime when the days are long
 i with my wellbent sickle in my hand
 thou arm'd with one as keen for trial sake
 of our ability to toil unfed
 till night grass still sufficing for the proof
 or if again it were our task to drive
 yoked oxen of the noblest breed sleekhair'd
 biglimb'd both batten'd to the full with grass
 their age and aptitude for work the same
 not soon to be fatigued and were the field 460
 in size four acres with a glebe through which
 the share might smoothly slide then should'st thou see
 how strait my furrow should be cut and true
 or should saturnian jove this day excite
 here battle or elsewhere and were i arm'd
 with two bright spears and with a shield and bore
 a brazen casque wellfitted to my brows
 me then thou should'st perceive mingling in fight
 amid the foremost chiefs nor with the crime
 of idle beggary should'st upbraid me more 470
 but thou art much a railer one whose heart
 pity moves not and seem'st a mighty man
 and valiant to thyself only because
 thou herd'st with few and those of little worth
 but should ulysses come at his own isle
 again arrived wide as these portals are
 to thee at once too narrow they should seem
 to shoot thee forth with speed enough abroad
 he ceasedthen tenfold indignation fired
 eurymachus he furrow'd deep his brow 480
 with frowns and in wing'd accents thus replied
 wretch i shall roughly handle thee anon
 who thus with fluent prate presumptuous dar'st
 disturb this num'rous company restrain'd
 by no respect or fear either thou art
 with wine intoxicated or perchance
 art always fool and therefore babblest now
 or thou art frantic haply with delight
 that thou hast foil'd yon vagabond obscure
 so saying he seized a stool but to the knees 490
 ulysses flew of the dulichian prince
 amphinomus and sat fearing incensed
 eurymachus he on his better hand
 smote full the cupbearer on the hallfloor
 loud rang the fallen beaker and himself
 lay on his back clamouring in the dust
 strait through the dusky hall tumult ensued
 among the suitors of whom thus a youth
 with eyes directed to the next exclaim'd
 would that this rambling stranger had elsewhere 500
 perish'd or ever he had here arrived
 then no such uproar had he caused as this
 this doth the beggar he it is for whom
 we wrangle thus and may despair of peace
 or pleasure more now look for strife alone
 then in the midst telemachus upstood
 majestic and the suitors thus bespake
 sirs ye are mad and can no longer eat
 or drink in peace some d�mon troubles you
 but since ye all have feasted to your homes 510
 go now and at your pleasure to your beds
 soonest were best but i thrust no man hence
 he ceased they gnawing stood their lips aghast
 with wonder that telemachus in his speech
 such boldness used then rose amphinomus
 brave son of nisus offspring of the king
 aretus and the assembly thus address'd
 my friends let none with contradiction thwart
 and rude reply words rational and just
 assault no more the stranger nor of all 520
 the servants of renown'd ulysses here
 harm any come let the cupbearer fill
 to all that due libation made to rest
 we may repair at home leaving the prince
 to accommodate beneath his father's roof
 the stranger for he is the prince's guest
 he ended whose advice none disapproved
 the hero mulius then dulichianborn
 and herald of amphinomus the cup
 filling dispensed it as he stood to all 530
 they pouring forth to the immortals quaff'd
 the luscious bev'rage and when each had made
 libation and such measure as he would
 of wine had drunk then all to rest retired

 book xix

 argument

 ulysses and telemachus remove the arms from the hall to an upperchamber
 the hero then confers with penelope to whom he gives a fictitious
 narrative of his adventures euryclea while bathing ulysses discovers
 him by a scar on his knee but he prevents her communication of that
 discovery to penelope


 they went but left the noble chief behind
 in his own house contriving by the aid
 of pallas the destruction of them all
 and thus in accents wing'd again he said
 my son we must remove and safe dispose
 all these my wellforged implements of war
 and should the suitors missing them enquire
 where are they thou shalt answer smoothly thus
 i have convey'd them from the reach of smoke
 for they appear no more the same which erst 10
 ulysses going hence to ilium left
 so smirch'd and sullied by the breath of fire
 this weightier reason thou shalt also say
 some god suggested to melest inflamed
 with wine ye wound each other in your brawls
 shaming both feast and courtship for the view
 itself of arms incites to their abuse
 he ceased and in obedience to his will
 calling the ancient euryclea forth
 his nurse telemachus enjoin'd her thus 20
 goshut the women in make fast the doors
 of their apartment while i safe dispose
 elsewhere my father's implements of war
 which during his long absence here have stood
 till smoke hath sullied them for i have been
 an infant hitherto but wiser grown
 would now remove them from the breath of fire
 then thus the gentle matron in return
 yes trulyand i wish that now at length
 thou would'st assert the privilege of thy years 30
 my son thyself assuming charge of all
 both house and stores but who shall bear the light
 since they it seems who would are all forbidden
 to whom telemachus discrete replied
 this guest for no man from my table fed
 come whence he may shall be an idler here
 he ended nor his words flew wing'd away
 but euryclea bolted every door
 then starting to the task ulysses caught
 and his illustrious son the weapons thence 40
 helmet and bossy shield and pointed spear
 while pallas from a golden lamp illumed
 the dusky way before them at that sight
 alarm'd the prince his father thus address'd
 whencewhence is this my father i behold
 a prodigy the walls of the whole house
 the arches firtree beams and pillars tall
 shine in my view as with the blaze of fire
 some pow'r celestial doubtless is within
 to whom ulysses everwise replied 50
 soft ask no questions give no vent to thought
 such is the custom of the pow'rs divine
 hence thou to bed i stay that i may yet
 both in thy mother and her maidens move
 more curiosity yesshe with tears
 shall question me of all that i have seen
 he ended and the prince at his command
 guided by flaming torches sought the couch
 where he was wont to sleep and there he slept
 on that night also waiting the approach 60
 of sacred dawn thus was ulysses left
 alone and planning sat in solitude
 by pallas' aid the slaughter of his foes
 at length dianalike or like herself
 all golden venus her apartment left
 enter'd penelope beside the hearth
 her women planted her accustom'd seat
 with silver wreathed and ivory that throne
 icmalius made artist renown'd and join'd
 a footstool to its splendid frame beneath 70
 which ever with an ample fleece they spread
 there sat discrete penelope then came
 her beautiful attendants from within
 who cleared the litter'd bread the board and cups
 from which the insolent companions drank
 they also raked the embers from the hearths
 now dim and with fresh billets piled them high
 both for illumination and for warmth
 then yet again melantho with rude speech
 opprobrious thus assail'd ulysses' ear 80
 guestwilt thou trouble us throughout the night
 ranging the house and linger'st thou a spy
 watching the women henceget thee abroad
 glad of such fare as thou hast found or soon
 with torches beaten we will thrust thee forth
 to whom ulysses frowning stern replied
 petulant woman wherefore thus incensed
 inveigh'st thou against me is it because
 i am not sleek because my garb is mean
 because i beg thanks to necessity 90
 i would not else but such as i appear
 such all who beg and all who wander are
 i also lived the happy owner once
 of such a stately mansion and have giv'n
 to num'rous wand'rers whencesoe'er they came
 all that they needed i was also served
 by many and enjoy'd all that denotes
 the envied owner opulent and blest
 but jove for so it pleas'd him hath reduced
 my all to nothing therefore well beware 100
 thou also mistress lest a day arrive
 when all these charms by which thou shin'st among
 thy sistermenials fade fear too lest her
 thou should'st perchance irritate whom thou serv'st
 and lest ulysses come of whose return
 hope yet survives but even though the chief
 have perish'd as ye think and comes no more
 consider yet his son how bright the gifts
 shine of apollo in the illustrious prince
 telemachus no woman unobserved 110
 by him can now commit a trespass here
 his days of heedless infancy are past
 he ended whom penelope discrete
 o'erhearing her attendant sharp rebuked
 shameless audacious woman known to me
 is thy great wickedness which with thy life
 thou shalt atone for thou wast well aware
 hearing it from myself that i design'd
 to ask this stranger of my absent lord
 for whose dear sake i never cease to mourn 120
 then to her household's governess she said
 bring now a seat and spread it with a fleece
 eurynome that undisturb'd the guest
 may hear and answer all that i shall ask
 she ended then the matron brought in haste
 a polish'd seat and spread it with a fleece
 on which the toilaccustom'd hero sat
 and thus the chaste penelope began
 stranger my first enquiry shall be this
 who art thou whence where born and sprung from whom 130
 then answer thus ulysses wise return'd
 o queen uncensurable by the lips
 of mortal man thy glory climbs the skies
 unrivall'd like the praise of some great king
 who o'er a num'rous people and renown'd
 presiding like a deity maintains
 justice and truth the earth under his sway
 her produce yields abundantly the trees
 fruitladen bend the lusty flocks bring forth
 the ocean teems with finny swarms beneath 140
 his just controul and all the land is blest
 me therefore question of what else thou wilt
 in thy own palace but forbear to ask
 from whom i sprang and of my native land
 lest thou reminding me of those sad themes
 augment my woes for i have much endured
 nor were it seemly in another's house
 to pass the hours in sorrow and in tears
 wearisome when indulg'd with no regard
 to time or place thy train perchance thyself 150
 would blame me and i should reproach incur
 as one teardeluged through excess of wine
 him answer'd then penelope discrete
 the immortal gods o stranger then destroy'd
 my form my grace my beauty when the greeks
 whom my ulysses follow'd sail'd to troy
 could he returning my domestic charge
 himself intend far better would my fame
 be so secured and wider far diffused
 but i am wretched now such storms of woe 160
 the gods have sent me for as many chiefs
 as hold dominion in the neighbour isles
 samos dulichium and the forestcrown'd
 zacynthus others also rulers here
 in pleasant ithaca me loth to wed
 woo ceaseless and my household stores consume
 i therefore neither guest nor suppliant heed
 nor public herald more but with regret
 of my ulysses wear my soul away
 they meantime press my nuptials which by art 170
 i still procrastinate some god the thought
 suggested to me to commence a robe
 of amplest measure and of subtlest woof
 laborious task which done i thus address'd them
 princes my suitors since the noble chief
 ulysses is no more enforce not now
 my nuptials wait till i shall finish first
 a fun'ral robe lest all my threads be marr'd
 which for the ancient hero i prepare
 laertes looking for the mournful hour 180
 when fate shall snatch him to eternal rest
 else i the censure dread of all my sex
 should he so wealthy want at last a shroud
 such was my speech they unsuspicious all
 with my request complied thenceforth all day
 i wove the ample web and by the aid
 of torches ravell'd it again at night
 three years by artifice i thus their suit
 eluded safe but when the fourth arrived
 and the same season after many moons 190
 and fleeting days return'd passing my train
 who had neglected to release the dogs
 they came surprized and reprimanded me
 thus through necessity not choice at last
 i have perform'd it in my own despight
 but no escape from marriage now remains
 nor other subterfuge for me meantime
 my parents urge my nuptials and my son
 of age to note it with disgust observes
 his wealth consumed for he is now become 200
 adult and abler than myself to rule
 the house a prince distinguish'd by the gods
 yet stranger after all speak thy descent
 say whence thou art for not of fabulous birth
 art thou nor from the oak nor from the rock
 her answer'd then ulysses everwise
 o spouse revered of laertiades
 resolv'st thou still to learn from whom i sprang
 learn then but know that thou shalt much augment
 my present grief natural to a man 210
 who hath like me long exiled from his home
 through various cities of the sons of men
 wander'd remote and num'rous woes endured
 yet though it pain me i will tell thee all
 there is a land amid the sable flood
 call'd crete fair fruitful circled by the sea
 num'rous are her inhabitants a race
 not to be summ'd and ninety towns she boasts
 diverse their language is achaians some
 and some indigenous are cydonians there 220
 crestshaking dorians and pelasgians dwell
 one city in extent the rest exceeds
 cnossus the city in which minos reign'd
 who ever at a nine years' close conferr'd
 with jove himself from him my father sprang
 the brave deucalion for deucalion's sons
 were two myself and king idomeneus
 to ilium he on board his gallant barks
 follow'd the atrid� i the youngestborn
 by my illustrious name �thon am known 230
 but he ranks foremost both in worth and years
 there i beheld ulysses and within
 my walls receiv'd him for a violent wind
 had driv'n him from malea while he sought
 the shores of troy to crete the storm his barks
 bore into the amnisus for the cave
 of ilythia known a dang'rous port
 and which with difficulty he attain'd
 he landing instant to the city went
 seeking idomeneus his friend of old 240
 as he affirm'd and one whom much he lov'd
 but _he_ was far remote ten days advanced
 perhaps eleven on his course to troy
 him therefore i conducted to my home
 where hospitably and with kindest care
 i entertain'd him for i wanted nought
 and for himself procured and for his band
 by public contribution corn and wine
 and beeves for food that all might be sufficed
 twelve days his noble greecians there abode 250
 portlock'd by boreas blowing with a force
 resistless even on the land some god
 so roused his fury but the thirteenth day
 the wind all fell and they embark'd again
 with many a fiction specious as he sat
 he thus her ear amused she at the sound
 melting with fluent tears her cheeks bedew'd
 and as the snow by zephyrus diffused
 melts on the mountain tops when eurus breathes
 and fills the channels of the running streams 260
 so melted she and down her lovely cheeks
 pour'd fast the tears him mourning as remote
 who sat beside her soft compassion touch'd
 ulysses of his consort's silent woe
 his eyes as they had been of steel or horn
 moved not yet artful he suppress'd his tears
 and she at length with overflowing grief
 satiate replied and thus enquired again
 now stranger i shall prove thee as i judge
 if thou indeed hast entertain'd in crete 270
 my spouse and his brave followers as thou say'st
 describe his raiment and himself his own
 appearance and the appearance of his friends
 then her ulysses answer'd everwise
 hard is the task o queen so long a time
 hath since elaps'd to tell thee twenty years
 have pass'd since he forsook my native isle
 yet from my best remembrance i will give
 a likeness of him such as now i may
 a double cloak thickpiled moeonian dyed 280
 the noble chief had on two fast'nings held
 the golden clasp and it display'd in front
 a wellwrought pattern with much art design'd
 an hound between his forefeet holding fast
 a dappled fawn gaped eager on his prey
 all wonder'd seeing how in lifeless gold
 express'd the dog with open mouth her throat
 attempted still and how the fawn with hoofs
 thrust trembling forward struggled to escape
 that glorious mantle much i noticed soft 290
 to touch as the dried garlick's glossy film
 such was the smoothness of it and it shone
 sunbright full many a maiden trust me view'd
 the splendid texture with admiring eyes
 but mark me now deep treasure in thy mind
 this word i know not if ulysses wore
 that cloak at home or whether of his train
 some warrior gave it to him on his way
 or else some host of his for many loved
 ulysses and with him might few compare 300
 i gave to him myself a brazen sword
 a purple cloak magnificent and vest
 of royal length and when he sought his bark
 with princely pomp dismiss'd him from the shore
 an herald also waited on the chief
 somewhat his senior him i next describe
 his back was bunch'd his visage swarthy curl'd
 his poll and he was named eurybates
 a man whom most of all his followers far
 ulysses honour'd for their minds were one 310
 he ceased she recognising all the proofs
 distinctly by ulysses named was moved
 still more to weep till with o'erflowing grief
 satiate at length she answer'd him again
 henceforth o stranger thou who hadst before
 my pity shalt my rev'rence share and love
 i folded for him with these hands the cloak
 which thou describ'st produced it when he went
 and gave it to him i that splendid clasp
 attach'd to it myself more to adorn 320
 my honour'd lord whom to his native land
 return'd secure i shall receive no more
 in such an evil hour ulysses went
 to that bad city never to be named
 to whom ulysses everwise replied
 consort revered of laertiades
 no longer let anxiety impair
 thy beauteous form nor any grief consume
 thy spirits more for thy ulysses' sake
 and yet i blame thee not a wife deprived 330
 of her first mate to whom she had produced
 fair fruit of mutual love would mourn his loss
 although he were inferior far to thine
 whom fame affirms the semblance of the gods
 but cease to mourn hear me i will relate
 a faithful tale nor will from thee withhold
 such tidings of ulysses living still
 and of his safe return as i have heard
 lately in yon neighb'ring opulent land
 of the thesprotians he returns enrich'd 340
 with many precious stores from those obtain'd
 whom he hath visited but he hath lost
 departing from thrinacia's isle his bark
 and all his lov'd companions in the deep
 for jove was adverse to him and the sun
 whose beeves his followers slew they perish'd all
 amid the billowy flood but him the keel
 bestriding of his bark the waves at length
 cast forth on the ph�acian's land a race
 allied to heav'n who rev'renced like a god 350
 thy husband honour'd him with num'rous gifts
 and willing were to have convey'd him home
 ulysses therefore had attained long since
 his native shore but that he deem'd it best
 to travel far that he might still amass
 more wealth so much ulysses all mankind
 excels in policy and hath no peer
 this information from thesprotia's king
 i gain'd from phidon to myself he swore
 libation off'ring under his own roof 360
 that both the bark was launch'd and the stout crew
 prepared that should conduct him to his home
 but me he first dismiss'd for as it chanced
 a ship lay there of the thesprotians bound
 to cornenrich'd dulichium all the wealth
 he shew'd me by the chief amass'd a store
 to feed the house of yet another prince
 to the tenth generation so immense
 his treasures were within that palace lodg'd
 himself he said was to dodona gone 370
 counsel to ask from the oracular oaks
 sublime of jove how safest he might seek
 after long exile thence his native land
 if openly were best or in disguise
 thus therefore he is safe and at his home
 wellnigh arrived nor shall his country long
 want him i swear it with a solemn oath
 first jove be witness king and lord of all
 next these domestic gods of the renown'd
 ulysses in whose royal house i sit 380
 that thou shalt see my saying all fulfill'd
 ulysses shall this selfsame year return
 this selfsame month ere yet the next begin
 him answer'd then penelope discrete
 grant heav'n my guest that this good word of thine
 fail not then soon shalt thou such bounty share
 and friendship at my hands that at first sight
 whoe'er shall meet thee shall pronounce thee blest
 but ah my soul forebodes how it will prove
 neither ulysses will return nor thou 390
 receive safe conduct hence for we have here
 none such as once ulysses was to rule
 his household with authority and to send
 with honourable convoy to his home
 the worthy guest or to regale him here
 give him the bath my maidens spread his couch
 with linen soft with fleecy gaberdines82
 and rugs of splendid hue that he may lie
 waiting wellwarm'd the golden morn's return
 attend him also at the peep of day 400
 with bath and unction that his seat resumed
 here in the palace he may be prepared
 for breakfast with telemachus and woe
 to him who shall presume to incommode
 or cause him pain that man shall be cashier'd
 hence instant burn his anger as it may
 for how my honour'd inmate shalt thou learn
 that i in wisdom oeconomic aught
 pass other women if unbathed unoiled
 illclad thou sojourn here man's life is short 410
 whoso is cruel and to cruel arts
 addict on him all men while yet he lives
 call plagues and curses down and after death
 scorn and proverbial mock'ries hunt his name
 but men humane themselves and giv'n by choice
 to offices humane from land to land
 are rumour'd honourably by their guests
 and ev'ry tongue is busy in their praise
 her answer'd then ulysses everwise
 consort revered of laertiades 420
 warm gaberdines and rugs of splendid hue
 to me have odious been since first the sight
 of crete's snowmantled mountaintops i lost
 sweeping the billows with extended oars
 no i will pass as i am wont to pass
 the sleepless night for on a sordid couch
 outstretch'd full many a night have i reposed
 till goldencharioted aurora dawn'd
 nor me the footbath pleases more my foot
 shall none of all thy ministring maidens touch 430
 unless there be some ancient matron grave
 among them who hath pangs of heart endured
 num'rous and keen as i have felt myself
 her i refuse not she may touch my feet
 him answer'd then prudent penelope
 dear guest for of all trav'llers here arrived
 from distant regions i have none received
 discrete as thou or whom i more have lov'd
 so just thy matter is and with such grace
 express'd i have an ancient maiden grave 440
 the nurse who at my hapless husband's birth
 receiv'd him in her arms and with kind care
 maternal rear'd him she shall wash thy feet
 although decrepid euryclea rise
 wash one coeval with thy lord for such
 the feet and hands it may be are become
 of my ulysses now since man beset
 with sorrow once soon wrinkled grows and old
 she said then euryclea with both hands
 cov'ring her face in tepid tears profuse 450
 dissolved and thus in mournful strains began
 alas my son trouble for thy dear sake
 distracts me jove surely of all mankind
 thee hated most though ever in thy heart
 devoutly giv'n for never mortal man
 so many thighs of fatted victims burn'd
 and chosen hecatombs produced as thou
 to jove the thund'rer him entreating still
 that he would grant thee a serene old age
 and to instruct thyself thy glorious son 460
 yet thus the god requites thee cutting off
 all hope of thy returnoh ancient sir
 him too perchance where'er he sits a guest
 beneath some foreign roof the women taunt
 as all these shameless ones have taunted thee
 fearing whose mock'ry thou forbidd'st their hands
 this office which icarius' daughter wise
 to me enjoins and which i glad perform
 yes i will wash thy feet both for her sake
 and for thy ownfor sight of thee hath raised 470
 a tempest in my mind hear now the cause
 full many a guest forlorn we entertain
 but never any have i seen whose size
 the fashion of whose foot and pitch of voice
 such likeness of ulysses show'd as thine
 to whom ulysses evershrewd replied
 such close similitude o ancient dame
 as thou observ'st between thy lord and me
 all who have seen us both have ever found
 he said then taking the resplendent vase 480
 allotted always to that use she first
 infused cold water largely then the warm
 ulysses for beside the hearth he sat
 turn'd quick his face into the shade alarm'd
 lest handling him she should at once remark
 his scar and all his stratagem unveil
 she then approaching minister'd the bath
 to her own king and at first touch discern'd
 that token by a brighttusk'd boar of old
 impress'd what time he to parnassus went 490
 to visit there autolycus and his sons
 his mother's noble sire who all mankind
 in furtive arts and fraudful oaths excell'd83
 for such endowments he by gift receiv'd
 from hermes' self to whom the thighs of kids
 he offer'd and of lambs and in return
 the watchful hermes never left his side
 autolycus arriving in the isle
 of pleasant ithaca the newborn son
 of his own daughter found whom on his knees 500
 at close of supper euryclea placed
 and thus the royal visitant address'd
 thyself autolycus devise a name
 for thy own daughter's son by num'rous pray'rs
 of thine and fervent from the gods obtained
 then answer thus autolycus return'd
 my daughter and my daughter's spouse the name
 which i shall give your boy that let him bear
 since after provocation and offence
 to numbers giv'n of either sex i come 510
 call him ulysses84 and when grown mature
 he shall parnassus visit the abode
 magnificent in which his mother dwelt
 and where my treasures lie from my own stores
 i will enrich and send him joyful home
 ulysses therefore that he might obtain
 those princely gifts went thither him arrived
 with righthand gratulation and with words
 of welcome kind autolycus received
 nor less his offspring but the mother most 520
 of his own mother clung around his neck
 amphithea she with many a fervent kiss
 his forehead press'd and his brightbeaming eyes
 then bade autolycus his noble sons
 set forth a banquet they at his command
 led in a fatted ox of the fifth year
 which slaying first they spread him carved abroad
 then scored his flesh transfixed it with the spits
 and roasting all with culinary skill
 exact gave each his portion thus they sat 530
 feasting all day and till the sun declined
 but when the sun declined and darkness fell
 each sought his couch and took the gift of sleep
 then soon as dayspring's daughter rosypalm'd
 aurora look'd abroad forth went the hounds
 and with the hounds ulysses and the youths
 sons of autolycus to chase the boar
 arrived at the parnassian mount they climb'd
 his bushy sides and to his airy heights
 ere long attain'd it was the pleasant hour 540
 when from the gentlyswelling flood profound
 the sun emerging first smote on the fields
 the hunters reach'd the valley foremost ran
 questing the hounds behind them swift the sons
 came of autolycus with whom advanced
 the illustrious prince ulysses pressing close
 the hounds and brandishing his massy spear
 there hid in thickest shades lay an huge boar
 that covert neither rough winds blowing moist
 could penetrate nor could the noonday sun 550
 smite through it or fastfalling show'rs pervade
 so thick it was and underneath the ground
 with litter of dry foliage strew'd profuse
 hunters and dogs approaching him his ear
 the sound of feet perceived upridging high
 his bristly back and glaring fire he sprang
 forth from the shrubs and in defiance stood
 near and right opposite ulysses first
 rush'd on him elevating his long spear
 ardent to wound him but preventing quick 560
 his foe the boar gash'd him above the knee
 much flesh assailing him oblique he tore
 with his rude tusk but to the hero's bone
 pierced not ulysses _his_ right shoulder reach'd
 and with a deadly thrust impell'd the point
 of his bright spear through him and far beyond
 loud yell'd the boar sank in the dust and died
 around ulysses then the busy sons
 throng'd of autolycus expert they braced
 the wound of the illustrious hunter bold 570
 with incantation staunched the sable blood
 and sought in haste their father's house again
 whence heal'd and gratified with splendid gifts
 they sent him soon rejoicing to his home
 themselves rejoicing also glad their son
 his parents saw again and of the scar
 enquired where giv'n and how he told them all
 how to parnassus with his friends he went
 sons of autolycus to hunt and how
 a boar had gash'd him with his iv'ry tusk 580
 that scar while chafing him with open palms
 the matron knew she left his foot to fall
 down dropp'd his leg into the vase the brass
 rang and o'ertilted by the sudden shock
 poured forth the water flooding wide the floor
 _her_ spirit joy at once and sorrow seized
 tears fill'd her eyes her intercepted voice
 died in her throat but to ulysses' beard
 her hand advancing thus at length she spake
 thou art himself ulysses oh my son 590
 dear to me and my master as thou art
 i knew thee not till i had touch'd the scar
 she said and to penelope her eyes
 directed all impatient to declare
 her own ulysses even then at home
 but she nor eye nor ear for aught that pass'd
 had then her fixt attention so entire
 minerva had engaged then darting forth
 his arms the hero with his righthand close
 compress'd her throat and nearer to himself 600
 drawing her with his left thus caution'd her
 why would'st thou ruin me thou gav'st me milk
 thyself from thy own breast see me return'd
 after long suff'rings in the twentieth year
 to my own land but since some god the thought
 suggesting to thee thou hast learn'd the truth
 silence lest others learn it from thy lips
 for this i say nor shall the threat be vain
 if god vouchsafe to me to overcome
 the haughty suitors when i shall inflict 610
 death on the other women of my house
 although my nurse thyself shalt also die
 him answer'd euryclea then discrete
 my son oh how could so severe a word
 escape thy lips my fortitude of mind
 thou know'st and even now shalt prove me firm
 as iron secret as the stubborn rock
 but hear and mark me well should'st thou prevail
 assisted by a pow'r divine to slay
 the haughty suitors i will then myself 620
 give thee to know of all the female train
 who have dishonour'd thee and who respect
 to whom ulysses everwise replied
 my nurse it were superfluous spare thy tongue
 that needless task i can distinguish well
 myself between them and shall know them all
 but hold thy peace hush leave it with the gods
 so he then went the ancient matron forth
 that she might serve him with a second bath
 for the whole first was spilt thus laved at length 630
 and smooth'd with oil ulysses nearer pull'd
 his seat toward the glowing hearth to enjoy
 more warmth and drew his tatters o'er the scar
 then prudent thus penelope began
 one question stranger i shall yet propound
 though brief for soon the hour of soft repose
 grateful to all and even to the sad
 whom gentle sleep forsakes not will arrive
 but heav'n to me immeasurable woe
 assignswhose sole delight is to consume 640
 my days in sighs while here retired i sit
 watching my maidens' labours and my own
 but night return'd and all to bed retired
 i press mine also yet with deep regret
 and anguish lacerated even there
 as when at spring's first entrance her sweet song
 the azurecrested nightingale renews
 daughter of pandarus within the grove's
 thick foliage perch'd she pours her echoing voice
 now deep now clear still varying the strain 650
 with which she mourns her itylus her son
 by royal zethus whom she erring slew85
 so also i by souldistressing doubts
 toss'd ever muse if i shall here remain
 a faithful guardian of my son's affairs
 my husband's bed respecting and not less
 my own fair fame or whether i shall him
 of all my suitors follow to his home
 who noblest seems and offers richest dow'r
 my son while he was infant yet and own'd 660
 an infant's mind could never give consent
 that i should wed and leave him but at length
 since he hath reached the stature of a man
 he wishes my departure hence the waste
 viewing indignant by the suitors made
 but i have dream'd hear and expound my dream
 my geese are twenty which within my walls
 i feed with sodden wheat they serve to amuse
 sometimes my sorrow from the mountains came
 an eagle huge hookbeak'd brake all their necks 670
 and slew them scatter'd on the palacefloor
 they lay and he soar'd swift into the skies
 dream only as it was i wept aloud
 till all my maidens gather'd by my voice
 arriving found me weeping still and still
 complaining that the eagle had at once
 slain all my geese but to the palaceroof
 stooping again he sat and with a voice
 of human sound forbad my tears and said
 courage o daughter of the farrenown'd 680
 icarius no vain dream thou hast beheld
 but in thy sleep a truth the slaughter'd geese
 denote thy suitors i who have appear'd
 an eagle in thy sight am yet indeed
 thy husband who have now at last return'd
 death horrid death designing for them all
 he said then waking at the voice i cast
 an anxious look around and saw my geese
 beside their tray all feeding as before
 her then ulysses answer'd everwise 690
 o queen it is not possible to miss
 thy dream's plain import since ulysses' self
 hath told thee the event thy suitors all
 must perish not one suitor shall escape
 to whom penelope discrete replied
 dreams are inexplicable o my guest
 and ofttimes mere delusions that receive
 no just accomplishment there are two gates
 through which the fleeting phantoms pass of horn
 is one and one of ivory86 such dreams 700
 as through the thinleaf'd iv'ry portal come
 sooth but perform not utt'ring empty sounds
 but such as through the polish'd horn escape
 if haply seen by any mortal eye
 prove faithful witnesses and are fulfill'd
 but through those gates my wond'rous dream i think
 came not thrice welcome were it else to me
 and to my son now mark my words attend
 this is the hated morn that from the house
 removes me of ulysses i shall fix 710
 this day the rings for trial to them all
 of archership ulysses' custom was
 to plant twelve spikes all regular arranged87
 like galleyprops and crested with a ring
 then standing far remote true in his aim
 he with his whizzing shaft would thrid them all
 this is the contest in which now i mean
 to prove the suitors him who with most ease
 shall bend the bow and shoot through all the rings
 i follow this dear mansion of my youth 720
 leaving so fair so fill'd with ev'ry good
 though still to love it even in my dreams
 her answer'd then ulysses everwise
 consort revered of laertiades
 postpone not this contention but appoint
 forthwith the trial for ulysses here
 will sure arrive ere they his polish'd bow
 long tamp'ring shall prevail to stretch the nerve
 and speed the arrow through the iron rings
 to whom penelope replied discrete 730
 would'st thou with thy sweet converse o my guest
 here sooth me still sleep ne'er should influence
 these eyes the while but always to resist
 sleep's pow'r is not for man to whom the gods
 each circumstance of his condition here
 fix universally myself will seek
 my own apartment at the palacetop
 and there will lay me down on my sad couch
 for such it hath been and with tears of mine
 ceaseless bedew'd e'er since ulysses went 740
 to that bad city never to be named
 there will i sleep but sleep thou here below
 either thyself preparing on the ground
 thy couch or on a couch by these prepared
 so saying she to her splendid chamber thence
 retired not sole but by her female train
 attended there arrived she wept her spouse
 her lov'd ulysses till minerva dropp'd
 the balm of slumber on her weary lids

 argument

 ulysses doubting whether he shall destroy or not the women servants who
 commit lewdness with the suitors resolves at length to spare them for
 the present he asks an omen from jupiter and that he would grant him
 also to hear some propitious words from the lips of one in the family
 his petitions are both answered preparation is made for the feast
 whilst the suitors sit at table pallas smites them with a horrid frenzy
 theoclymenus observing the strange effects of it prophesies their
 destruction and they deride his prophecy


 but in the vestibule the hero lay
 on a bull'shide undress'd o'er which he spread
 the fleece of many a sheep slain by the greeks
 and cover'd by the household's governess
 with a wide cloak composed himself to rest
 yet slept he not but meditating lay
 woe to his enemies meantime the train
 of women wonted to the suitors' arms
 issuing all mirth and laughter in his soul
 a tempest raised of doubts whether at once 10
 to slay or to permit them yet to give
 their lusty paramours one last embrace
 as growls the mastiff standing on the start
 for battle if a stranger's foot approach
 her cubs newwhelp'dso growl'd ulysses' heart
 while wonder fill'd him at their impious deeds
 but smiting on his breast thus he reproved
 the mutinous inhabitant within
 heart bear it worse than this thou didst endure
 when uncontroulable by force of man 20
 the cyclops thy illustrious friends devour'd
 thy patience then fail'd not till prudence found
 deliv'rance for thee on the brink of fate
 so disciplined the hero his own heart
 which tractable endured the rigorous curb
 and patient yet he turn'd from side to side
 as when some hungry swain turns oft a maw
 unctuous and sav'ry on the burning coals
 quick expediting his desired repast
 so he from side to side roll'd pond'ring deep 30
 how likeliest with success he might assail
 those shameless suitors one to many opposed
 then sudden from the skies descending came
 minerva in a female form her stand
 above his head she took and thus she spake
 why sleep'st thou not unhappiest of mankind
 thou art at home here dwells thy wife and here
 thy son a son whom all might wish their own
 then her ulysses answer'd everwise
 o goddess true is all that thou hast said 40
 but not without anxiety i muse
 how single as i am i shall assail
 those shameless suitors who frequent my courts
 daily and always their whole multitude
 this weightier theme i meditate beside
 should i with jove's concurrence and with thine
 prevail to slay them how shall i escape
 myself at last88 oh goddess weigh it well
 him answer'd then pallas c�ruleaneyed
 oh faithless man a man will in his friend 50
 confide though mortal and in valour less
 and wisdom than himself but i who keep
 thee in all difficulties am divine
 i tell thee plainly were we hemm'd around
 by fifty troops of shouting warriors bent
 to slay thee thou should'st yet securely drive
 the flocks away and cattle of them all
 but yield to sleep's soft influence for to lie
 all night thus watchful is itself distress
 fear not deliv'rance waits not far remote 60
 so saying she o'er ulysses' eyes diffused
 soft slumbers and when sleep that sooths the mind
 and nerves the limbs afresh had seized him once
 to the olympian summit swift return'd
 but his chaste spouse awoke she weeping sat
 on her soft couch and noblest of her sex
 satiate at length with tears her pray'r address'd
 first to diana of the pow'rs above
 diana awful progeny of jove
 i would that with a shaft this moment sped 70
 into my bosom thou would'st here conclude
 my mournful life or oh that as it flies
 snatching me through the pathless air a storm
 would whelm me deep in ocean's restless tide
 so when the gods their parents had destroy'd
 storms suddenly the beauteous daughters snatch'd89
 of pandarus away them left forlorn
 venus with curds with honey and with wine
 fed duly juno gave them to surpass
 all women in the charms of face and mind 80
 with graceful stature eminent the chaste
 diana bless'd them and in works of art
 illustrious pallas taught them to excel
 but when the foamsprung goddess to the skies
 a suitress went on their behalf to obtain
 blest nuptials for them from the thund'rer jove
 for jove the happiness himself appoints
 and the unhappiness of all below
 meantime the harpies ravishing away
 those virgins gave them to the furies three 90
 that they might serve them o that me the gods
 inhabiting olympus so would hide
 from human eyes for ever or brighthair'd
 diana pierce me with a shaft that while
 ulysses yet engages all my thoughts
 my days concluded i might 'scape the pain
 of gratifying some inferior chief
 this is supportable when all the day
 to sorrow giv'n the mourner sleeps at night
 for sleep when it hath once the eyelids veil'd 100
 all reminiscence blots of all alike
 both good and ill but me the gods afflict
 not seldom ev'n in dreams and at my side
 this night again one lay resembling him
 such as my own ulysses when he join'd
 achaia's warriors my exulting heart
 no airy dream believed it but a truth
 while thus she spake in orient gold enthroned
 came forth the morn ulysses as she wept
 heard plain her lamentation him that sound 110
 alarm'd he thought her present and himself
 known to her gath'ring hastily the cloak
 his cov'ring and the fleeces them he placed
 together on a throne within the hall
 but bore the bull'shide forth into the air
 then lifting high his hands to jove he pray'd
 eternal sire if over moist and dry
 ye have with goodwill sped me to my home
 after much suff'ring grant me from the lips
 of some domestic now awake to hear 120
 words of propitious omen and thyself
 vouchsafe me still some other sign abroad
 such pray'r he made and jove omniscient heard
 sudden he thunder'd from the radiant heights
 olympian glad ulysses heard the sound
 a woman next a labourer at the mill
 hard by where all the palacemills were wrought
 gave him the omen of propitious sound
 twelve maidens day by day toil'd at the mills
 meal grinding some of barley some of wheat 130
 marrow of man90 the rest their portion ground
 all slept she only from her task as yet
 ceas'd not for she was feeblest of them all
 she rested on her mill and thus pronounced
 the happy omen by her lord desired
 jove father governor of heav'n and earth
 loud thou hast thunder'd from the starry skies
 by no cloud veil'd a sign propitious giv'n
 to whom i know not but oh grant the pray'r
 of a poor bondwoman appoint their feast 140
 this day the last that in ulysses' house
 the suitors shall enjoy for whom i drudge
 with aching heart and trembling knees their meal
 grinding continual feast they here no more
 she ended and the list'ning chief received
 with equal joy both signs for well he hoped
 that he should punish soon those guilty men
 and now the other maidens in the hall
 assembling kindled on the hearth again
 th' unwearied blaze then godlike from his couch 150
 arose telemachus and freshattired
 athwart his shoulders his bright faulchion slung
 bound his fair sandals to his feet and took
 his sturdy spear pointed with glitt'ring brass
 advancing to the portal there he stood
 and euryclea thus his nurse bespake
 nurse have ye with respectful notice serv'd
 our guest or hath he found a sordid couch
 e'en where he might for prudent though she be
 my mother inattentive oft the worse 160
 treats kindly and the better sends away
 whom euryclea answer'd thus discrete
 blame not my son who merits not thy blame
 the guest sat drinking till he would no more
 and ate till question'd he repliedenough
 but when the hour of sleep call'd him to rest
 she gave commandment to her female train
 to spread his couch yet he like one forlorn
 and through despair indiff'rent to himself
 both bed and rugs refused and in the porch 170
 on skins of sheep and on an undress'd hide
 reposed where we threw cov'ring over him
 she ceas'd and grasping his brightheaded spear
 forth went the prince attended as he went
 by his fleet hounds to the assembled greeks
 in council with majestic gait he moved
 and euryclea daughter wise of ops
 pisenor's son call'd to the servingmaids
 haste ye be diligent sweep the palacefloor
 and sprinkle it then give the sumptuous seats 180
 their purple coverings let others cleanse
 with sponges all the tables wash and rince
 the beakers well and goblets richemboss'd
 run others to the fountain and bring thence
 water with speed the suitors will not long
 be absent but will early come today
 for this day is a public festival91
 so she whom all obedient heard forth went
 together twenty to the crystal fount
 while in their sev'ral provinces the rest 190
 bestirr'd them brisk at home then enter'd all
 the suitors and began cleaving the wood
 meantime the women from the fountain came
 whom soon the swineherd follow'd driving three
 his fattest brawns them in the spacious court
 he feeding left and to ulysses' side
 approaching courteously bespake the chief
 guest look the greecians on thee with respect
 at length or still disdainful as before
 then answer thus ulysses wise return'd 200
 yesand i would that vengeance from the gods
 might pay their insolence who in a house
 not theirs dominion exercise and plan
 unseemly projects shameless as they are
 thus they conferr'd and now melanthius came
 the goatherd driving with the aid of two
 his fellowswains the fattest of his goats
 to feast the suitors in the sounding porch
 the goats he tied then drawing near in terms
 reproachful thus assail'd ulysses' ear 210
 how stranger persever'st thou begging still
 to vex the suitors wilt thou not depart
 scarce shall we settle this dispute i judge
 till we have tasted each the other's fist
 thou art unreasonable thus to beg
 here alwayshave the greeks no feasts beside
 he spake to whom ulysses answer none
 return'd but shook his brows and silent framed
 terrible purposes then third approach'd
 chief o'er the herds philoetius fatted goats 220
 he for the suitors brought with which he drove
 an heifer ferrymen had pass'd them o'er
 carriers of all who on their coast arrive
 he tied them in the sounding porch then stood
 beside the swineherd to whom thus he said
 who is this guest eum�us here arrived
 so lately from what nation hath he come
 what parentage and country boasts the man
 i pity him whose figure seems to speak
 royalty in him heav'n will surely plunge 230
 the race of common wand'rers deep in woe
 if thus it destine even kings to mourn
 he ceas'd and with his right hand drawing nigh
 welcom'd ulysses whom he thus bespake
 hail venerable guest and be thy lot
 prosp'rous at least hereafter who art held
 at present in the bonds of num'rous ills
 thou jupiter of all the gods art most
 severe and spar'st not to inflict distress
 even on creatures from thyself derived92 240
 i had no sooner mark'd thee than my eyes
 swam and the sweat gush'd from me at the thought
 of dear ulysses for if yet he live
 and see the sun such tatters i suppose
 he wears a wand'rer among humankind
 but if already with the dead he dwell
 in pluto's drear abode oh then alas
 for kind ulysses who consign'd to me
 while yet a boy his cephalenian herds
 and they have now encreas'd to such a store 250
 innumerable of broadfronted beeves
 as only care like mine could have produced
 these by command of others i transport
 for their regale who neither heed his son
 nor tremble at the anger of the gods
 but long have wish'd ardently to divide
 and share the substance of our absent lord
 me therefore this thought occupies and haunts
 my mind not seldom while the heir survives
 it were no small offence to drive his herds 260
 afar and migrate to a foreign land
 yet here to dwell suff'ring oppressive wrongs
 while i attend another's beeves appears
 still less supportable and i had fled
 and i had served some other mighty chief
 long since for patience fails me to endure
 my present lot but that i cherish still
 some hope of my illfated lord's return
 to rid his palace of those lawless guests
 to whom ulysses everwise replied 270
 herdsman since neither void of sense thou seem'st
 nor yet dishonest but myself am sure
 that thou art owner of a mind discrete
 hear therefore for i swear bold i attest
 jove and this hospitable board and these
 the lares93 of the noble chief whose hearth
 protects me now that ere thy going hence
 ulysses surely shall have reach'd his home
 and thou shalt see him if thou wilt thyself
 slaying the suitors who now lord it here 280
 him answer'd then the keeper of his beeves
 oh stranger would but the saturnian king
 perform that word thou should'st be taught thyself
 eyewitness of it what an arm is mine
 eum�us also ev'ry power of heav'n
 entreated that ulysses might possess
 his home again thus mutual they conferr'd
 meantime in conf'rence close the suitors plann'd
 death for telemachus but while they sat
 consulting on their left the bird of jove 290
 an eagle soar'd grasping a tim'rous dove
 then thus amphinomus the rest bespake
 oh friends our consultation how to slay
 telemachus will never smoothly run
 to its effect but let us to the feast
 so spake amphinomus whose counsel pleased
 then all into the royal house repaired
 and on the thrones and couches throwing off
 their mantles slew the fatted goats the brawns
 the sheep fullsized and heifer of the herd 300
 the roasted entrails first they shared then fill'd
 the beakers and the swineherd placed the cups
 philoetius chief intendant of the beeves
 served all with baskets elegant of bread
 while all their cups melanthius charged with wine
 and they assail'd at once the ready feast
 meantime telemachus with forecast shrewd
 fast by the marble threshold but within
 the spacious hall his father placed to whom
 a sordid seat he gave and scanty board 310
 a portion of the entrails next he set
 before him fill'd a golden goblet high
 and thus in presence of them all began
 there seated now drink as the suitors drink
 i will myself their biting taunts forbid
 and violence this edifice is mine
 not public property my father first
 possess'd it and my right from him descends
 suitors controul your tongues nor with your hands
 offend lest contest fierce and war ensue 320
 he ceas'd they gnawing sat their lips aghast
 with wonder that telemachus in his speech
 such boldness used then spake eupithes' son
 antino�s and the assembly thus address'd
 let pass ye greeks the language of the prince
 harsh as it is and big with threats to us
 had jove permitted his orations here
 although thus eloquent ere now had ceased
 so spake antino�s whom ulysses' son
 heard unconcern'd and now the heralds came 330
 in solemn pomp conducting through the streets
 a sacred hecatomb when in the grove
 umbrageous of apollo king shaftarm'd
 the assembled greecians met the sav'ry roast
 finish'd and from the spits withdrawn each shared
 his portion of the noble feast and such
 as they enjoy'd themselves the attendants placed
 before ulysses for the hero's son
 himself telemachus had so enjoined
 but pallas that they might exasp'rate more 340
 ulysses suffer'd not the suitor chiefs
 to banquet guiltless of heartpiercing scoffs
 malign there was a certain suitor named
 ctesippus born in samos base of mind
 was he and profligate but in the wealth
 confiding of his father woo'd the wife
 of longexiled ulysses from his seat
 the haughty suitors thus that man address'd
 ye noble suitors i would speak attend
 the guest is served he hath already shared 350
 equal with us nor less the laws demand
 of hospitality for neither just
 it were nor decent that a guest received
 here by telemachus should be denied
 his portion of the feast come thenmyself
 will give to him that he may also give
 to her who laved him in the bath or else
 to whatsoever menial here he will
 so saying he from a basket near at hand
 heav'd an oxfoot and with a vig'rous arm 360
 hurl'd it ulysses gently bow'd his head
 shunning the blow but gratified his just
 resentment with a broad sardonic smile94
 of dread significance he smote the wall
 then thus telemachus rebuked the deed
 ctesippus thou art fortunate the bone
 struck not the stranger for he shunn'd the blow
 else i had surely thrust my glitt'ring lance
 right through thee then no hymen�al rites
 of thine should have employ'd thy father here 370
 but thy funereal no man therefore treat
 me with indignity within these walls
 for though of late a child i can discern
 now and distinguish between good and ill
 suffice it that we patiently endure
 to be spectators daily of our sheep
 slaughter'd our bread consumed our stores of wine
 wasted for what can one to all opposed
 come thenpersist no longer in offence
 and hostile hate of me or if ye wish 380
 to slay me pause not it were better far
 to die and i had rather much be slain
 than thus to witness your atrocious deeds
 day after day to see our guests abused
 with blows insulted and the women dragg'd
 with a licentious violence obscene
 from side to side of all this fair abode
 he said and all sat silent till at length
 thus agela�s spake diastor's son
 my friends let none with contradiction thwart 390
 and rude reply words rational and just
 assault no more the stranger nor of all
 the servants of renown'd ulysses here
 harm any my advice both to the queen
 and to telemachus shall gentle be
 may it but please them while the hope survived
 within your bosoms of the safe return
 of wise ulysses to his native isle
 so long good reason was that she should use
 delay and hold our wooing in suspence 400
 for had ulysses come that course had proved
 wisest and best but that he comes no more
 appears now manifest thou therefore prince
 seeking thy mother counsel her to wed
 the noblest and who offers richest dow'r
 that thou for thy peculiar may'st enjoy
 thy own inheritance in peace and ease
 and she departing find another home
 to whom telemachus discrete replied
 i swear by jove and by my father's woes 410
 who either hath deceased far from his home
 or lives a wand'rer that i interpose
 no hindrance to her nuptials let her wed
 who offers most and even whom she will
 but to dismiss her rudely were a deed
 unfilialthat i dare notgod forbid
 so spake telemachus then pallas struck
 the suitors with delirium wide they stretch'd
 their jaws with unspontaneous laughter loud
 their meat dripp'd blood tears fill'd their eyes and dire
 presages of approaching woe their hearts 421
 then thus the prophet theoclymenus95
 ah miserable men what curse is this
 that takes you now night wraps itself around
 your faces bodies limbs the palace shakes
 with peals of groansand oh what floods ye weep
 i see the walls and arches dappled thick
 with gore the vestibule is throng'd the court
 on all sides throng'd with apparitions grim
 of slaughter'd men sinking into the gloom 430
 of erebus the sun is blotted out
 from heav'n and midnight whelms you premature
 he said they hearing laugh'd and thus the son
 of polybus eurymachus replied
 this wand'rer from a distant shore hath left
 his wits behind hoa there conduct him hence
 into the forum since he dreams it night
 already teach him there that it is day
 then answer'd godlike theoclymenus
 i have no need eurymachus of guides 440
 to lead me hence for i have eyes and ears
 the use of both my feet and of a mind
 in no respect irrational or wild
 these shall conduct me forth for well i know
 that evil threatens you such too as none
 shall 'scape of all the suitors whose delight
 is to insult the unoffending guest
 received beneath this hospitable roof
 he said and issuing from the palace sought
 pir�us' house who gladly welcom'd him 450
 then all the suitors on each other cast
 a look significant and to provoke
 telemachus the more fleer'd at his guests
 of whom a youth thus insolent began
 no living wight telemachus had e'er
 guests such as thine witness we know not who
 this hungry vagabond whose means of life
 are none and who hath neither skill nor force
 to earn them a mere burthen on the ground
 witness the other also who upstarts 460
 a prophet suddenly take my advice
 i counsel wisely send them both on board
 some gallant bark to sicily for sale
 thus shall they somewhat profit thee at last
 so spake the suitors whom telemachus
 heard unconcern'd and silent look'd and look'd
 toward his father watching still the time
 when he should punish that licentious throng
 meantime icarius' daughter who had placed
 her splendid seat opposite heard distinct 470
 their taunting speeches they with noisy mirth
 feasted deliciously for they had slain
 many a fat victim but a sadder feast
 than soon the goddess and the warrior chief
 should furnish for them none shall ever share
 of which their crimes had furnish'd first the cause

 argument

 penelope proposes to the suitors a contest with the bow herself the
 prize they prove unable to bend the bow when ulysses having with some
 difficulty possessed himself of it manages it with the utmost ease and
 dispatches his arrow through twelve rings erected for the trial


 minerva now goddess c�ruleaneyed
 prompted icarius' daughter the discrete
 penelope with bow and rings to prove
 her suitors in ulysses' courts a game
 terrible in conclusion to them all
 first taking in her hand the brazen key
 wellforged and fitted with an iv'ry grasp
 attended by the women of her train
 she sought her inmost chamber the recess
 in which she kept the treasures of her lord 10
 his brass his gold and steel elaborate
 here lay his stubborn bow and quiver fill'd
 with num'rous shafts a fatal store that bow
 he had received and quiver from the hand
 of godlike iphitus eurytides
 whom in messenia96 in the house he met
 of brave orsilochus ulysses came
 demanding payment of arrearage due
 from all that land for a messenian fleet
 had borne from ithaca three hundred sheep 20
 with all their shepherds for which cause ere yet
 adult he voyaged to that distant shore
 deputed by his sire and by the chiefs
 of ithaca to make the just demand
 but iphitus had thither come to seek
 twelve mares and twelve mule colts which he had lost
 a search that cost him soon a bloody death
 for coming to the house of hercules
 the valiant taskperforming son of jove
 he perish'd there slain by his cruel host 30
 who heedless of heav'n's wrath and of the rights
 of his own board first fed then slaughter'd him
 for in _his_ house the mares and colts were hidden
 he therefore occupied in that concern
 meeting ulysses there gave him the bow
 which erst huge eurytus had borne and which
 himself had from his dying sire received
 ulysses in return on him bestowed
 a spear and sword pledges of future love
 and hospitality but never more 40
 they met each other at the friendly board
 for ere that hour arrived the son of jove
 slew his own guest the godlike iphitus
 thus came the bow into ulysses' hands
 which never in his gallant barks he bore
 to battle with him though he used it oft
 in times of peace but left it safely stored
 at home a dear memorial of his friend
 soon as divinest of her sex arrived
 at that same chamber with her foot she press'd 50
 the oaken threshold bright on which the hand
 of no mean architect had stretch'd the line
 who had erected also on each side
 the posts on which the splendid portals hung
 she loos'd the ring and brace then introduced
 the key and aiming at them from without97
 struck back the bolts the portals at that stroke
 sent forth a tone deep as the pastur'd bull's
 and flew wide open she ascending next
 the elevated floor on which the chests 60
 that held her own fragrant apparel stood
 with lifted hand aloft took down the bow
 in its embroider'd bowcase safe enclosed
 then sitting there she lay'd it on her knees
 weeping aloud and drew it from the case
 thus weeping over it long time she sat
 till satiate at the last with grief and tears
 descending by the palace steps she sought
 again the haughty suitors with the bow
 elastic and the quiver in her hand 70
 replete with pointed shafts a deadly store
 her maidens as she went bore after her
 a coffer fill'd with prizes by her lord
 much brass and steel and when at length she came
 loveliest of women where the suitors sat
 between the pillars of the stately dome
 pausing before her beauteous face she held
 her lucid veil and by two matrons chaste
 supported the assembly thus address'd
 ye noble suitors hear who rudely haunt 80
 this palace of a chief long absent hence
 whose substance ye have now long time consumed
 nor palliative have yet contrived or could
 save your ambition to make me a bride
 attend this game to which i call you forth
 now suitors prove yourselves with this huge bow
 of widerenown'd ulysses he who draws
 easiest the bow and who his arrow sends
 through twice six rings he takes me to his home
 and i must leave this mansion of my youth 90
 plenteous magnificent which doubtless oft
 i shall remember even in my dreams
 so saying she bade eum�us lay the bow
 before them and the twice six rings of steel
 he wept received them and obey'd nor wept
 the herdsman less seeing the bow which erst
 his lord had occupied when at their tears
 indignant thus antino�s began
 ye rural drones whose purblind eyes see not
 beyond the present hour egregious fools 100
 why weeping trouble ye the queen too much
 before afflicted for her husband lost
 either partake the banquet silently
 or else go weep abroad leaving the bow
 that stubborn test to us for none i judge
 none here shall bend this polish'd bow with ease
 since in this whole assembly i discern
 none like ulysses whom myself have seen
 and recollect though i was then a boy
 he said but in his heart meantime the hope 110
 cherish'd that he should bend himself the bow
 and pass the rings yet was he destin'd first
 of all that company to taste the steel
 of brave ulysses' shaft whom in that house
 he had so oft dishonour'd and had urged
 so oft all others to the like offence
 amidst them then the sacred might arose
 of young telemachus who thus began
 saturnian jove questionless hath deprived
 me of all reason my own mother fam'd 120
 for wisdom as she is makes known to all
 her purpose to abandon this abode
 and follow a new mate while heedless i
 trifle and laugh as i were still a child
 but come ye suitors since the prize is such
 a woman like to whom none can be found
 this day in all achaia on the shores
 of sacred pylus in the cities proud
 of argos or mycen� or even here
 in ithaca or yet within the walls 130
 of black epirus and since this yourselves
 know also wherefore should i speak her praise
 come then delay not waste not time in vain
 excuses turn not from the proof but bend
 the bow that thus the issue may be known
 i also will myself that task essay
 and should i bend the bow and pass the rings
 then shall not my illustrious mother leave
 her son forlorn forsaking this abode
 to follow a new spouse while i remain 140
 disconsolate although of age to bear
 successful as my sire the prize away
 so saying he started from his seat cast off
 his purple cloak and lay'd his sword aside
 then fix'd himself the rings furrowing the earth
 by line and op'ning one long trench for all
 and stamping close the glebe amazement seized
 all present seeing with how prompt a skill
 he executed though untaught his task
 then hasting to the portal there he stood 150
 thrice struggling he essay'd to bend the bow
 and thrice desisted hoping still to draw
 the bowstring home and shoot through all the rings98
 and now the fourth time striving with full force
 he had prevail'd to string it but his sire
 forbad his eager efforts by a sign
 then thus the royal youth to all around
 gods either i shall prove of little force
 hereafter and for manly feats unapt
 or i am yet too young and have not strength 160
 to quell the aggressor's contumely but come
 for ye have strength surpassing mine try ye
 the bow and bring this contest to an end
 he ceas'd and set the bow down on the floor
 reclining it against the shaven pannels smooth
 that lined the wall the arrow next he placed
 leaning against the bow's brightpolish'd horn
 and to the seat whence he had ris'n return'd
 then thus eupithes' son antino�s spake
 my friends come forth successive from the right99 170
 where he who ministers the cup begins
 so spake antino�s and his counsel pleased
 then first leiodes oenop's son arose
 he was their soothsayer and ever sat
 beside the beaker inmost of them all
 to him alone of all licentious deeds
 were odious and with indignation fired
 he witness'd the excesses of the rest
 he then took foremost up the shaft and bow
 and station'd at the portal strove to bend 180
 but bent it not fatiguing first his hands
 delicate and uncustom'd to the toil
 he ceased and the assembly thus bespake
 my friends i speed not let another try
 for many princes shall this bow of life
 bereave since death more eligible seems
 far more than loss of her for whom we meet
 continual here expecting still the prize
 some suitor haply at this moment hopes
 that he shall wed whom long he hath desired 190
 ulysses' wife penelope let him
 essay the bow and trial made address
 his spousal offers to some other fair
 among the longstoled princesses of greece
 this princess leaving his whose proffer'd gifts
 shall please her most and whom the fates ordain
 he said and set the bow down on the floor
 reclining it against the shaven pannels smooth
 that lined the wall the arrow next he placed
 leaning against the bow's brightpolish'd horn 200
 and to the seat whence he had ris'n return'd
 then him antino�s angry thus reproved
 what word leiodes grating to our ears
 hath scap'd thy lips i hear it with disdain
 shall this bow fatal prove to many a prince
 because thou hast thyself too feeble proved
 to bend it no thou wast not born to bend
 the unpliant bow or to direct the shaft
 but here are nobler who shall soon prevail
 he said and to melanthius gave command 210
 the goatherd hence melanthius kindle fire
 beside it place with fleeces spread a form
 of length commodious from within procure
 a large round cake of suet next with which
 when we have chafed and suppled the tough bow
 before the fire we will again essay
 to bend it and decide the doubtful strife
 he ended and melanthius kindling fire
 beside it placed with fleeces spread a form
 of length commodious next he brought a cake 220
 ample and round of suet from within
 with which they chafed the bow then tried again
 to bend but bent it not superior strength
 to theirs that task required yet two the rest
 in force surpassing made no trial yet
 antino�s and eurymachus the brave
 then went the herdsman and the swineherd forth
 together after whom the glorious chief
 himself the house left also and when all
 without the court had met with gentle speech 230
 ulysses then the faithful pair address'd
 herdsman and thou eum�us shall i keep
 a certain secret close or shall i speak
 outright my spirit prompts me and i will
 what welcome should ulysses at your hands
 receive arriving suddenly at home
 some god his guide would ye the suitors aid
 or would ye aid ulysses answer true
 then thus the chief intendant of his herds
 would jove but grant me my desire to see 240
 once more the hero and would some kind pow'r
 restore him i would shew thee soon an arm
 strenuous to serve him and a dauntless heart
 eum�us also fervently implored
 the gods in pray'r that they would render back
 ulysses to his home he then convinced
 of their unfeigning honesty began
 behold him i am he myself arrived
 after long suff'rings in the twentieth year
 i know how welcome to yourselves alone 250
 of all my train i come for i have heard
 none others praying for my safe return
 i therefore tell you truth should heav'n subdue
 the suitors under me ye shall receive
 each at my hands a bride with lands and house
 near to my own and ye shall be thenceforth
 dear friends and brothers of the prince my son
 lo also this indisputable proof
 that ye may know and trust me view it here
 it is the scar which in parnassus erst 260
 where with the sons i hunted of renown'd
 autolycus i from a boar received
 so saying he stripp'd his tatters and unveil'd
 the whole broad scar then soon as they had seen
 and surely recognized the mark each cast
 his arms around ulysses wept embraced
 and press'd him to his bosom kissing oft
 his brows and shoulders who as oft their hands
 and foreheads kiss'd nor had the setting sun
 beheld them satisfied but that himself 270
 ulysses thus admonished them and said
 cease now from tears lest any coming forth
 mark and report them to our foes within
 now to the hall again but one by one
 not all at once i foremost then yourselves
 and this shall be the sign full well i know
 that all unanimous they will oppose
 deliv'ry of the bow and shafts to me
 but thou proceeding with it to my seat
 eum�us noble friend shalt give the bow 280
 into my grasp then bid the women close
 the massy doors and should they hear a groan
 or other noise made by the princes shut
 within the hall let none set step abroad
 but all work silent be the palacedoor
 thy charge my good philoetius key it fast
 without a moment's pause and fix the brace100
 he ended and returning to the hall
 resumed his seat nor stay'd his servants long
 without but follow'd their illustrious lord 290
 eurymachus was busily employ'd
 turning the bow and chafing it before
 the sprightly blaze but after all could find
 no pow'r to bend it disappointment wrung
 a groan from his proud heart and thus he said
 alas not only for myself i grieve
 but grieve for all nor though i mourn the loss
 of such a bride mourn i that loss alone
 for lovely greecians may be found no few
 in ithaca and in the neighbour isles 300
 but should we so inferior prove at last
 to brave ulysses that no force of ours
 can bend his bow we are for ever shamed
 to whom antino�s thus eupithes' son
 not so as even thou art wellassured
 thyself eurymachus but phoebus claims
 this day his own who then on such a day
 would strive to bend it let it rather rest
 and should we leave the rings where now they stand
 i trust that none ent'ring ulysses' house 310
 will dare displace them cupbearer attend
 serve all with wine that first libation made
 we may religiously lay down the bow
 command ye too melanthius that he drive
 hither the fairest goats of all his flocks
 at dawn of day that burning first the thighs
 to the ethereal archer we may make
 new trial and decide at length the strife
 so spake antino�s and his counsel pleased
 the heralds then pour'd water on their hands 320
 while youths crown'd high the goblets which they bore
 from right to left distributing to all
 when each had made libation and had drunk
 till well sufficed then artful to effect
 his shrewd designs ulysses thus began
 hear o ye suitors of the illustrious queen
 my bosom's dictates but i shall entreat
 chiefly eurymachus and the godlike youth
 antino�s whose advice is wisely giv'n
 tamper no longer with the bow but leave 330
 the matter with the gods who shall decide
 the strife tomorrow fav'ring whom they will
 meantime grant _me_ the polish'd bow that i
 may trial make among you of my force
 if i retain it still in like degree
 as erst or whether wand'ring and defect
 of nourishment have worn it all away
 he said whom they with indignation heard
 extreme alarm'd lest he should bend the bow
 and sternly thus antino�s replied 340
 desperate vagabond ah wretch deprived
 of reason utterly art not content
 esteem'st it not distinction proud enough
 to feast with us the nobles of the land
 none robs thee of thy share thou witnessest
 our whole discourse which save thyself alone
 no needy vagrant is allow'd to hear
 thou art befool'd by wine as many have been
 widethroated drinkers unrestrain'd by rule
 wine in the mansion of the mighty chief 350
 piritho�s made the valiant centaur mad
 eurytion at the lapith�an feast101
 he drank to drunkenness and being drunk
 committed great enormities beneath
 piritho�s' roof and such as fill'd with rage
 the heroguests who therefore by his feet
 dragg'd him right through the vestibule amerced
 of nose and ears and he departed thence
 provoked to frenzy by that foul disgrace
 whence war between the human kind arose 360
 and the bold centaursbut he first incurred
 by his ebriety that mulct severe
 great evil also if thou bend the bow
 to thee i prophesy for thou shalt find
 advocate or protector none in all
 this people but we will dispatch thee hence
 incontinent on board a sable bark
 to echetus the scourge of human kind
 from whom is no escape drink then in peace
 and contest shun with younger men than thou 370
 him answer'd then penelope discrete
 antino�s neither seemly were the deed
 nor just to maim or harm whatever guest
 whom here arrived telemachus receives
 canst thou expect that should he even prove
 stronger than ye and bend the massy bow
 he will conduct me hence to his own home
 and make me his own bride no such design
 his heart conceives or hope nor let a dread
 so vain the mind of any overcloud 380
 who banquets here since it dishonours me
 so she to whom eurymachus reply'd
 offspring of polybus o matchless queen
 icarius' prudent daughter none suspects
 that thou wilt wed with him a mate so mean
 should ill become thee but we fear the tongues
 of either sex lest some achaian say
 hereafter one inferior far to us
 ah how unworthy are they to compare
 with him whose wife they seek to bend his bow 390
 pass'd all their pow'r yet this poor vagabond
 arriving from what country none can tell
 bent it with ease and shot through all the rings
 so will they speak and so shall we be shamed
 then answer thus penelope return'd
 no fair report eurymachus attends
 their names or can who riotous as ye
 the house dishonour and consume the wealth
 of such a chief why shame ye thus _yourselves_
 the guest is of athletic frame well form'd 400
 and large of limb he boasts him also sprung
 from noble ancestry come thenconsent
 give him the bow that we may see the proof
 for thus i say and thus will i perform
 sure as he bends it and apollo gives
 to him that glory tunic fair and cloak
 shall be his meed from me a javelin keen
 to guard him against men and dogs a sword
 of double edge and sandals for his feet
 and i will send him whither most he would 410
 her answer'd then prudent telemachus
 motherthe bow is mine and save myself
 no greek hath right to give it or refuse
 none who in rockbound ithaca possess
 dominion none in the steedpastured isles
 of elis if i chose to make the bow
 his own for ever should that choice controul
 but thou into the house repairing ply
 spindle and loom thy province and enjoin
 diligence to thy maidens for the bow 420
 is man's concern alone and shall be mine
 especially since i am master here
 she heard astonish'd and the prudent speech
 reposing of her son deep in her heart
 withdrew then mounting with her female train
 to her superior chamber there she wept
 her lost ulysses till minerva bathed
 with balmy dews of sleep her weary lids
 and now the noble swineherd bore the bow
 toward ulysses but with one voice all 430
 the suitors clamorous reproved the deed
 of whom a youth thus insolent exclaim'd
 thou clumsy swineherd whither bear'st the bow
 delirious wretch the hounds that thou hast train'd
 shall eat thee at thy solitary home
 ere long let but apollo prove at last
 propitious to us and the pow'rs of heav'n
 so they whom hearing he replaced the bow
 where erst it stood terrified at the sound
 of such loud menaces on the other side 440
 telemachus as loud assail'd his ear
 friend forward with the bow or soon repent
 that thou obey'dst the many i will else
 with huge stones drive thee younger as i am
 back to the field my strength surpasses thine
 i would to heav'n that i in force excell'd
 as far and prowess every suitor here
 so would i soon give rude dismission hence
 to some who live but to imagine harm
 he ceased whose words the suitors laughing heard 450
 and for their sake in part their wrath resign'd
 against telemachus then through the hall
 eum�us bore and to ulysses' hand
 consign'd the bow next summoning abroad
 the ancient nurse he gave her thus in charge
 it is the pleasure of telemachus
 sage euryclea that thou key secure
 the doors and should you hear perchance a groan
 or other noise made by the princes shut
 within the hall let none look curious forth 460
 but each in quietness pursue her work
 so he nor flew his words useless away
 but she incontinent shut fast the doors
 then noiseless sprang philoetius forth who closed
 the portals also of the palacecourt
 a shiprope of �gyptian reed it chanced
 lay in the vestibule with that he braced
 the doors securely and reentring fill'd
 again his seat but watchful eyed his lord
 he now assaying with his hand the bow 470
 made curious trial of it ev'ry way
 and turn'd it on all sides lest haply worms
 had in its master's absence drill'd the horn
 then thus a suitor to his next remark'd
 he hath an eye methinks exactly skill'd
 in bows and steals them or perhaps at home
 hath such himself or feels a strong desire
 to make them so inquisitive the rogue
 adept in mischief shifts it to and fro
 to whom another insolent replied 480
 i wish him like prosperity in all
 his efforts as attends his effort made
 on this same bow which he shall never bend
 so they but when the wary hero wise
 had made his hand familiar with the bow
 poising it and examiningat once
 as when in harp and song adept a bard
 unlab'ring strains the chord to a new lyre
 the twisted entrails of a sheep below
 with fingers nice inserting and above 490
 with such facility ulysses bent
 his own huge bow and with his right hand play'd
 the nerve which in its quick vibration sang
 clear as the swallow's voice keen anguish seized
 the suitors wan grew ev'ry cheek and jove
 gave him his rolling thunder for a sign
 that omen granted to him by the son
 of wily saturn with delight he heard
 he took a shaft that at the tableside
 lay ready drawn but in his quiver's womb 500
 the rest yet slept by those achaians proud
 to be ere long experienced true he lodg'd
 the arrow on the centre of the bow
 and occupying still his seat drew home
 nerve and notch'd arrowhead with stedfast sight
 he aimed and sent it right through all the rings
 from first to last the steelcharged weapon flew
 issuing beyond and to his son he spake
 thou need'st not blush young prince to have received
 a guest like me neither my arrow swerved 510
 nor labour'd i long time to draw the bow
 my strength is unimpair'd not such as these
 in scorn affirm it but the waning day
 calls us to supper after which succeeds102

 with all that heightens and adorns the feast

 at once the son of the illustrious chief

 arm'd bright for battle at his father's side 520

 there be a passage either in ancient or modern tragedy so truly

 going to begin the slaughter




 book xxii

 argument

 ulysses with some little assistance from telemachus eum�us and
 philoetius slays all the suitors and twelve of the female servants
 who had allowed themselves an illicit intercourse with them are hanged
 melanthius also is punished with miserable mutilation


 then girding up his rags ulysses sprang
 with bow and fullcharged quiver to the door
 loose on the broad stone at his feet he pour'd
 his arrows and the suitors thus bespake
 this prize though difficult hath been atchieved
 now for another mark which never man
 struck yet but i will strike it if i may
 and if apollo make that glory mine
 he said and at antino�s aimed direct
 a bitter shaft he purposing to drink 10
 both hands advanced toward the golden cup
 twinear'd nor aught suspected death so nigh
 for who at the full banquet could suspect
 that any single guest however brave
 should plan his death and execute the blow
 yet him ulysses with an arrow pierced
 full in the throat and through his neck behind
 started the glitt'ring point aslant he droop'd
 down fell the goblet through his nostrils flew
 the spouted blood and spurning with his foot 20
 the board he spread his viands in the dust
 confusion when they saw antino�s fall'n
 seized all the suitors from the thrones they sprang
 flew ev'ry way and on all sides explored
 the palacewalls but neither sturdy lance
 as erst nor buckler could they there discern
 then furious to ulysses thus they spake
 thy arrow stranger was illaimed a man
 is no just mark thou never shalt dispute
 prize more inevitable death is thine 30
 for thou hast slain a prince noblest of all
 in ithaca and shalt be vultures' food
 various their judgments were but none believed
 that he had slain him wittingly nor saw
 th' infatuate men fate hov'ring o'er them all
 then thus ulysses louring dark replied
 o dogs not fearing aught my safe return
 from ilium ye have shorn my substance close
 lain with my women forcibly and sought
 while yet i lived to make my consort yours 40
 heedless of the inhabitants of heav'n
 alike and of the just revenge of man
 but death is on the wing death for you all
 he said their cheeks all faded at the sound
 and each with sharpen'd eyes search'd ev'ry nook
 for an escape from his impending doom
 till thus alone eurymachus replied
 if thou indeed art he the mighty chief
 of ithaca return'd thou hast rehears'd
 with truth the crimes committed by the greeks 50
 frequent both in thy house and in thy field
 but he already who was cause of all
 lies slain antino�s he thy palace fill'd
 with outrage not solicitous so much
 to win the fair penelope but thoughts
 far diff'rent framing which saturnian jove
 hath baffled all to rule himself supreme
 in noble ithaca when he had kill'd
 by an insidious stratagem thy son
 but he is slain now therefore spare thy own 60
 thy people public reparation due
 shall sure be thine and to appease thy wrath
 for all the waste that eating drinking here
 we have committed we will yield thee each
 full twenty beeves gold paying thee beside
 and brass till joy shall fill thee at the sight
 however just thine anger was before
 to whom ulysses frowning stern replied
 eurymachus would ye contribute each
 his whole inheritance and other sums 70
 still add beside ye should not even so
 these hands of mine bribe to abstain from blood
 till ev'ry suitor suffer for his wrong
 ye have your choice fight with me or escape
 whoever may the terrours of his fate
 but ye all perish if my thought be true
 he ended they with trembling knees and hearts
 all heard whom thus eurymachus address'd
 to your defence my friends for respite none
 will he to his victorious hands afford 80
 but arm'd with bow and quiver will dispatch
 shafts from the door till he have slain us all
 therefore to armsdraw each his swordoppose
 the tables to his shafts and all at once
 rush on him that dislodging him at least
 from portal and from threshold we may give
 the city on all sides a loud alarm
 so shall this archer soon have shot his last
 thus saying he drew his brazen faulchion keen
 of double edge and with a dreadful cry 90
 sprang on him but ulysses with a shaft
 in that same moment through his bosom driv'n
 transfix'd his liver and down dropp'd his sword
 he staggering around his table fell
 convolv'd in agonies and overturn'd
 both food and wine his forehead smote the floor
 woe fill'd his heart and spurning with his heels
 his vacant seat he shook it till he died
 then with his faulchion drawn amphinomus
 advanced to drive ulysses from the door 100
 and fierce was his assault but from behind
 telemachus between his shoulders fix'd
 a brazen lance and urged it through his breast
 full on his front with hideous sound he fell
 leaving the weapon planted in his spine
 back flew telemachus lest had he stood
 drawing it forth some enemy perchance
 should either pierce him with a sudden thrust
 oblique or hew him with a downright edge
 swift therefore to his father's side he ran 110
 whom reaching in wing'd accents thus he said
 my father i will now bring thee a shield
 an helmet and two spears i will enclose
 myself in armour also and will give
 both to the herdsmen and eum�us arms
 expedient now and needful for us all
 to whom ulysses everwise replied
 run fetch them while i yet have arrows left
 lest single i be justled from the door
 he said and at his word forth went the prince 120
 seeking the chamber where he had secured
 the armour thence he took four shields eight spears
 with four haircrested helmets charged with which
 he hasted to his father's side again
 and arming first himself furnish'd with arms
 his two attendants then all clad alike
 in splendid brass beside the dauntless chief
 ulysses his auxiliars firm they stood
 he while a single arrow unemploy'd
 lay at his foot rightaiming ever pierced 130
 some suitor through and heaps on heaps they fell
 but when his arrows fail'd the royal chief
 his bow reclining at the portal's side
 against the palacewall he slung himself
 a fourfold buckler on his arm he fix'd
 a casque whose crest wav'd awful o'er his brows
 on his illustrious head and fill'd his gripe
 with two stout spears wellheaded both with brass
 there was a certain postern in the wall103
 at the gateside the customary pass 140
 into a narrow street but barr'd secure
 ulysses bade his faithful swineherd watch
 that egress station'd near it for it own'd
 one sole approach then agela�s loud
 exhorting all the suitors thus exclaim'd
 oh friends will none ascending to the door
 of yonder postern summon to our aid
 the populace and spread a wide alarm
 so shall this archer soon have shot his last
 to whom the keeper of the goats replied 150
 melanthius agela�s prince renown'd
 that may not be the postern and the gate104
 neighbour too near each other and to force
 the narrow egress were a vain attempt
 one valiant man might thence repulse us all
 but comemyself will furnish you with arms
 fetch'd from above for there as i suppose
 and not elsewhere ulysses and his son
 have hidden them and there they shall be found
 so spake melanthius and ascending sought 160
 ulysses' chambers through the winding stairs
 and gall'ries of the house twelve bucklers thence
 he took as many spears and helmets bright
 as many shagg'd with hair then swift return'd
 and gave them to his friends trembled the heart
 of brave ulysses and his knees at sight
 of his opposers putting armour on
 and shaking each his spear arduous indeed
 now seem'd his task and in wing'd accents brief
 thus to his son telemachus he spake 170
 either some woman of our train contrives
 hard battle for us furnishing with arms
 the suitors or melanthius arms them all
 him answer'd then telemachus discrete
 father this fault was mine and be it charged
 on none beside i left the chamberdoor
 unbarr'd which more attentive than myself
 their spy perceived but haste eum�us shut
 the chamberdoor observing well the while
 if any women of our train have done 180
 this deed or whether as i more suspect
 melanthius dolius' son have giv'n them arms
 thus mutual they conferr'd meantime again
 melanthius to the chamber flew in quest
 of other arms eum�us as he went
 mark'd him and to ulysses' thus he spake
 laertes' noble son for wiles renown'd
 behold the traytor whom ourselves supposed
 seeks yet again the chamber tell me plain
 shall i should i superior prove in force 190
 slay him or shall i drag him thence to thee
 that he may suffer at thy hands the doom
 due to his treasons perpetrated oft
 against thee here even in thy own house
 then answer thus ulysses shrewd return'd
 i with telemachus will here immew
 the lordly suitors close rage as they may
 ye two the while bind fast melanthius' hands
 and feet behind his back then cast him bound
 into the chamber and the door secured 200
 pass underneath his arms a double chain
 and by a pillar's top weigh him aloft
 till he approach the rafters there to endure
 living long time the mis'ries he hath earned
 he spake they prompt obey'd together both
 they sought the chamber whom the wretch within
 heard not exploring ev'ry nook for arms
 they watching stood the door from which at length
 forth came melanthius bearing in one hand
 a casque and in the other a broad shield 210
 timeworn and chapp'd with drought which in his youth
 warlike laertes had been wont to bear
 long time neglected it had lain till age
 had loosed the sutures of its bands at once
 both springing on him seized and drew him in
 forcibly by his locks then cast him down
 prone on the pavement trembling at his fate
 with painful stricture of the cord his hands
 they bound and feet together at his back
 as their illustrious master had enjoined 220
 then weigh'd him with a double chain aloft
 by a tall pillar to the palaceroof
 and thus deriding him eum�us spake
 now good melanthius on that fleecy bed
 reclined as well befits thee thou wilt watch
 all night nor when the golden dawn forsakes
 the ocean stream will she escape thine eye
 but thou wilt duly to the palace drive
 the fattest goats a banquet for thy friends
 so saying he left him in his dreadful sling 230
 then arming both and barring fast the door
 they sought brave laertiades again
 and now courageous at the portal stood
 those four by numbers in the interior house
 opposed of adversaries fierce in arms
 when pallas in the form and with the voice
 approach'd of mentor whom laertes' son
 beheld and joyful at the sight exclaim'd
 help mentor helpnow recollect a friend
 and benefactor born when thou wast born 240
 so he not unsuspicious that he saw
 pallas the heroine of heav'n meantime
 the suitors fill'd with menaces the dome
 and agela�s first damastor's son
 in accents harsh rebuked the goddess thus
 beware oh mentor that he lure thee not
 to oppose the suitors and to aid himself
 for thus will we ulysses and his son
 both slain in vengeance of thy purpos'd deeds
 against us we will slay _thee_ next and thou 250
 with thy own head shalt satisfy the wrong
 your force thus quell'd in battle all thy wealth
 whether in house or field mingled with his
 we will confiscate neither will we leave
 or son of thine or daughter in thy house
 alive nor shall thy virtuous consort more
 within the walls of ithaca be seen
 he ended and his words with wrath inflamed
 minerva's heart the more incensed she turn'd
 towards ulysses whom she thus reproved 260
 thou neither own'st the courage nor the force
 ulysses now which nine whole years thou showd'st
 at ilium waging battle obstinate
 for highborn helen and in horrid fight
 destroying multitudes till thy advice
 at last lay'd priam's bulwark'd city low
 why in possession of thy proper home
 and substance mourn'st thou want of pow'r t'oppose
 the suitors stand beside me mark my deeds
 and thou shalt own mentor alcimides 270
 a valiant friend and mindful of thy love
 she spake nor made she victory as yet
 entire his own proving the valour first
 both of the sire and of his glorious son
 but springing in a swallow's form aloft
 perch'd on a rafter of the splendid roof
 then agela�s animated loud
 the suitors whom eurynomus also roused
 amphimedon and demoptolemus
 and polyctorides pisander named 280
 and polybus the brave for noblest far
 of all the suitorchiefs who now survived
 and fought for life were these the bow had quell'd
 and shafts in quick succession sent the rest
 then agela�s thus harangued them all
 we soon shall tame o friends this warrior's might
 whom mentor after all his airy vaunts
 hath left and at the portal now remain
 themselves alone dismiss not therefore all
 your spears together but with six alone 290
 assail them first jove willing we shall pierce
 ulysses and subduing him shall slay
 with ease the rest their force is safely scorn'd
 he ceas'd and as he bade six hurl'd the spear
 together but minerva gave them all
 a devious flight one struck a column one
 the planks of the broad portal and a third105
 flung right his ashen beam pond'rous with brass
 against the wall then ev'ry suitor's spear
 eluded thus ulysses gave the word 300
 now friends i counsel you that ye dismiss
 your spears at _them_ who not content with past
 enormities thirst also for our blood
 he said and with unerring aim all threw
 their glitt'ring spears ulysses on the ground
 stretch'd demoptolemus euryades
 fell by telemachus the swineherd slew
 elatus and the keeper of the beeves
 pisander in one moment all alike
 lay grinding with their teeth the dusty floor 310
 back flew the suitors to the farthest wall
 on whom those valiant four advancing each
 recover'd quick his weapon from the dead
 then hurl'd the desp'rate suitors yet again
 their glitt'ring spears but pallas gave to each
 a frustrate course one struck a column one
 the planks of the broad portal and a third
 flung full his ashen beam against the wall
 yet pierced amphimedon the prince's wrist
 but slightly a skinwound and o'er his shield 320
 ctesippus reach'd the shoulder of the good
 eum�us but his glancing weapon swift
 o'erflew the mark and fell and now the four
 ulysses dauntless hero and his friends
 all hurl'd their spears together in return
 himself ulysses citywaster chief
 wounded eurydamas ulysses' son
 amphimedon the swineherd polybus
 and in his breast the keeper of the beeves
 ctesippus glorying over whom he cried 330
 oh son of polytherses whose delight
 hath been to taunt and jeer never again
 boast foolishly but to the gods commit
 thy tongue since they are mightier far than thou
 take thisa compensation for thy pledge
 of hospitality the huge oxhoof
 which while he roam'd the palace begging alms
 ulysses at thy bounteous hand received
 so gloried he then grasping still his spear
 ulysses pierced damastor's son and next 340
 telemachus enforcing his long beam
 sheer through his bowels and his back transpierced
 leiocritus he prostrate smote the floor
 then pallas from the lofty roof held forth
 her hostconfounding �gis o'er their heads
 with'ring their souls with fear they through the hall
 fled scatter'd as an herd which rapidwing'd
 the gadfly dissipates infester fell
 of beeves when vernal suns shine hot and long
 but as when bowbeak'd vultures crookedclaw'd106 350
 stoop from the mountains on the smaller fowl
 terrified at the toils that spread the plain
 the flocks take wing they darting from above
 strike seize and slay resistance or escape
 is none the fowler's heart leaps with delight
 so they pursuing through the spacious hall
 the suitors smote them on all sides their heads
 sounded beneath the sword with hideous groans
 the palace rang and the floor foamed with blood
 then flew leiodes to ulysses' knees 360
 which clasping in wing'd accents thus he cried
 i clasp thy knees ulysses oh respect
 my suit and spare me never have i word
 injurious spoken or injurious deed
 attempted 'gainst the women of thy house
 but others so transgressing oft forbad
 yet they abstain'd not and a dreadful fate
 due to their wickedness have therefore found
 but i their soothsayer alone must fall
 though unoffending such is the return 370
 by mortals made for benefits received
 to whom ulysses louring dark replied
 is that thy boast hast thou indeed for these
 the seer's high office fill'd then doubtless oft
 thy pray'r hath been that distant far might prove
 the day delectable of my return
 and that my consort might thy own become
 to bear thee children wherefore thee i doom
 to a dire death which thou shalt not avoid
 so saying he caught the faulchion from the floor 380
 which agela�s had let fall and smote
 leiodes while he kneel'd athwart his neck
 so suddenly that ere his tongue had ceased
 to plead for life his head was in the dust
 but phemius son of terpius bard divine
 who through compulsion with his song regaled
 the suitors a like dreadful death escaped
 fast by the postern harp in hand he stood
 doubtful if issuing he should take his seat
 beside the altar of herc�an jove107 390
 where oft ulysses offer'd and his sire
 fat thighs of beeves or whether he should haste
 an earnest suppliant to embrace his knees
 that course at length most pleased him then between
 the beaker and an argentstudded throne
 he grounded his sweet lyre and seizing fast
 the hero's knees him suppliant thus address'd
 i clasp thy knees ulysses oh respect
 my suit and spare me thou shalt not escape
 regret thyself hereafter if thou slay 400
 me charmer of the woes of gods and men
 selftaught am i and treasure in my mind
 themes of all argument from heav'n inspired
 and i can sing to thee as to a god
 ah then behead me not put ev'n the wish
 far from thee for thy own beloved son
 can witness that not drawn by choice or driv'n
 by stress of want resorting to thine house
 i have regaled these revellers so oft
 but under force of mightier far than i 410
 so he whose words soon as the sacred might
 heard of telemachus approaching quick
 his father thus humane he interposed
 hold harm not with the vengeful faulchion's edge
 this blameless man and we will also spare
 medon the herald who hath ever been
 a watchful guardian of my boyish years
 unless philoetius have already slain him
 or else eum�us or thyself perchance
 unconscious in the tumult of our foes 420
 he spake whom medon hearing for he lay
 beneath a throne and in a newstript hide
 enfolded trembling with the dread of death
 sprang from his hidingplace and casting off
 the skin flew to telemachus embraced
 his knees and in wing'd accents thus exclaim'd
 prince i am hereoh pity me repress
 thine own and pacify thy father's wrath
 that he destroy not me through fierce revenge
 of their iniquities who have consumed 430
 his wealth and in their folly scorn'd his son
 to whom ulysses everwise replied
 smiling complacent fear not my own son
 hath pleaded for thee therefore taught thyself
 that truth teach others the superior worth
 of benefits with injuries compared
 but go ye forth thou and the sacred bard
 that ye may sit distant in yonder court
 from all this carnage while i give command
 myself concerning it to those within 440
 he ceas'd they going forth took each his seat
 beside jove's altar but with careful looks
 suspicious dreading without cease the sword
 meantime ulysses search'd his hall in quest
 of living foes if any still survived
 unpunish'd but he found them all alike
 welt'ring in dust and blood num'rous they lay
 like fishes when they strew the sinuous shore
 of ocean from the grey gulph drawn aground
 in nets of many a mesh they on the sands 450
 lie spread athirst for the salt wave till hot
 the gazing sun dries all their life away
 so lay the suitors heap'd and thus at length
 the prudent chief gave order to his son
 telemachus bid euryclea come
 quickly the nurse to whom i would impart
 the purpose which now occupies me most
 he said obedient to his sire the prince
 smote on the door and summon'd loud the nurse
 arise thou ancient governess of all 460
 our female menials and come forth attend
 my father he hath somewhat for thine ear
 so he nor flew his words useless away
 for throwing wide the portal forth she came
 and by telemachus conducted found
 ere long ulysses amid all the slain
 with blood defiled and dust dread he appear'd
 as from the pastur'd ox newlydevoured
 the lion stalking back his ample chest
 with gory drops and his broad cheeks are hung 470
 tremendous spectacle such seem'd the chief
 bloodstain'd all over she the carnage spread
 on all sides seeing and the pools of blood
 felt impulse forcible to publish loud
 that wond'rous triumph but her lord repress'd
 the shout of rapture ere it burst abroad
 and in wing'd accents thus his will enforced
 silent exult o ancient matron dear
 shout not be still unholy is the voice
 of loud thanksgiving over slaughter'd men 480
 their own atrocious deeds and the gods' will
 have slain all these for whether noble guest
 arrived or base they scoff'd at all alike
 and for their wickedness have therefore died
 but say of my domestic women who
 have scorn'd me and whom find'st thou innocent
 to whom good euryclea thus replied
 my son i will declare the truth thou keep'st
 female domestics fifty in thy house
 whom we have made intelligent to comb 490
 the fleece and to perform whatever task
 of these twice six have overpass'd the bounds
 of modesty respecting neither me
 nor yet the queen and thy own son adult
 so lately no permission had from her
 to regulate the women of her train
 but i am gone i fly with what hath pass'd
 to the queen's ear who nought suspects so sound
 she sleeps by some divinity composed
 then answer thus ulysses wise returned 500
 hush and disturb her not go summon first
 those wantons who have long deserved to die
 he ceas'd then issued forth the ancient dame
 to summon those bad women and meantime
 calling his son philoetius and eum�us
 ulysses in wing'd accents thus began
 bestir ye and remove the dead command
 those women also to your help then cleanse
 with bibulous sponges and with water all
 the seats and tables when ye shall have thus 510
 set all in order lead those women forth
 and in the centre of the spacious court
 between the scull'ry and the outerwall
 smite them with your broad faulchions till they lose
 in death the mem'ry of their secret loves
 indulged with wretches lawless as themselves
 he ended and the damsels came at once
 all forth lamenting and with tepid tears
 show'ring the ground with mutual labour first
 bearing the bodies forth into the court 520
 they lodged them in the portico meantime
 ulysses stern enjoin'd them haste and urged
 by sad necessity they bore all out
 with sponges and with water next they cleansed
 the thrones and tables while telemachus
 beesom'd the floor eum�us in that work
 aiding him and the keeper of the beeves
 and those twelve damsels bearing forth the soil
 thus order giv'n to all within they next
 led forth the women whom they shut between 530
 the scull'ry and the outerwall in close
 durance from which no pris'ner could escape
 and thus telemachus discrete began
 an honourable death is not for these
 by my advice who have so often heap'd
 reproach on mine and on my mother's head
 and held lewd commerce with the suitortrain
 he said and noosing a strong galleyrope
 to an huge column led the cord around
 the spacious dome suspended so aloft 540
 that none with quiv'ring feet might reach the floor
 as when a flight of doves ent'ring the copse
 or broadwing'd thrushes strike against the net
 within ill rest entangled there they find
 so they suspended by the neck expired
 all in one line together death abhorr'd
 with restless feet awhile they beat the air
 then ceas'd and now through vestibule and hall
 they led melanthius forth with ruthless steel
 they pared away his ears and nose pluck'd forth 550
 his parts of shame destin'd to feed the dogs
 and still indignant lopp'd his hands and feet
 then laving each his feet and hands they sought
 again ulysses all their work was done
 and thus the chief to euryclea spake
 bring blastaverting sulphur nurse bring fire
 that i may fumigate my walls then bid
 penelope with her attendants down
 and summon all the women of her train
 but euryclea thus his nurse replied 560
 my son thou hast well said yet will i first
 serve thee with vest and mantle stand not here
 in thy own palace cloath'd with tatters foul
 and beggarlyshe will abhor the sight
 then answer thus ulysses wise return'd
 not so bring fire for fumigation first
 he said nor euryclea his lov'd nurse
 longer delay'd but sulphur brought and fire
 when he with purifying steams himself
 visited ev'ry part the banquetroom 570
 the vestibule the court ranging meantime
 his house magnificent the matron call'd
 the women to attend their lord in haste
 and they attended bearing each a torch
 then gather'd they around him all sincere
 welcoming his return with close embrace
 enfolding him each kiss'd his brows and each
 his shoulders and his hands lock'd fast in hers
 he irresistible the impulse felt
 to sigh and weep well recognizing all 580

 book xxiii

 argument

 ulysses with some difficulty convinces penelope of his identity who at
 length overcome by force of evidence receives him to her arms with
 transport he entertains her with a recital of his adventures and in his
 narration the principal events of the poem are recapitulated in the
 morning ulysses telemachus the herdsman and the swineherd depart into
 the country


 and now with exultation loud the nurse
 again ascended eager to apprize
 the queen of her ulysses' safe return
 joy braced her knees with nimbleness of youth
 she stepp'd and at her ear her thus bespake
 arise penelope dear daughter see
 with thy own eyes thy daily wish fulfill'd
 ulysses is arrived hath reach'd at last
 his native home and all those suitors proud
 hath slaughter'd who his family distress'd 10
 his substance wasted and controul'd his son
 to whom penelope discrete replied
 dear nurse the gods have surely ta'en away
 thy judgment they transform the wise to fools
 and fools conduct to wisdom and have marr'd
 thy intellect who wast discrete before
 why wilt thou mock me wretched as i am
 with tales extravagant and why disturb
 those slumbers sweet that seal'd so fast mine eyes
 for such sweet slumbers have i never known 20
 since my ulysses on his voyage sail'd
 to that bad city never to be named
 down instant to thy place againbegone
 for had another of my maidens dared
 disturb my sleep with tidings wild as these
 i had dismiss'd her down into the house
 more roughly but thine age excuses _thee_
 to whom the venerable matron thus
 i mock thee not my child nohe is come
 himself ulysses even as i say 30
 that stranger object of the scorn of all
 telemachus well knew his sire arrived
 but prudently conceal'd the tidings so
 to insure the more the suitors' punishment
 so euryclea she transported heard
 and springing from the bed wrapp'd in her arms
 the ancient woman shedding tears of joy
 and in wing'd accents ardent thus replied
 ah then dear nurse inform me tell me true
 hath he indeed arriv'd as thou declar'st 40
 how dared he to assail alone that band
 of shameless ones for ever swarming here
 then euryclea thus matron belov'd
 i nothing saw or knew but only heard
 groans of the wounded in th' interior house
 we trembling sat and ev'ry door was fast
 thus all remain'd till by his father sent
 thy own son call'd me forth going i found
 ulysses compass'd by the slaughter'd dead
 they cover'd wide the pavement heaps on heaps 50
 it would have cheer'd thy heart to have beheld
 thy husband lionlike with crimson stains
 of slaughter and of dust all dappled o'er
 heap'd in the portal at this moment lie
 their bodies and he fumigates meantime
 the house with sulphur and with flames of fire
 and hath himself sent me to bid thee down
 follow me then that ye may give your hearts
 to gladness both for ye have much endured
 but the event so long your soul's desire 60
 is come himself hath to his household gods
 alive return'd thee and his son he finds
 unharm'd and at your home nor hath he left
 unpunish'd one of all his enemies
 her answer'd then penelope discrete
 ah dearest nurse indulge not to excess
 this dang'rous triumph thou art well apprized
 how welcome his appearance here would prove
 to all but chief to me and to his son
 fruit of our love but these things are not so 70
 some god resentful of their evil deeds
 and of their biting contumely severe
 hath slain those proud for whether noble guest
 arrived or base alike they scoff'd at all
 and for their wickedness have therefore died
 but my ulysses distant far i know
 from greece hath perish'd and returns no more
 to whom thus euryclea nurse belov'd
 what word my daughter had escaped thy lips
 who thus affirm'st thy husband now within 80
 and at his own hearthside for ever lost
 canst thou be thus incredulous hear again
 i give thee yet proof past dispute his scar
 imprinted by a wildboar's iv'ry tusk
 laving him i remark'd it and desired
 myself to tell thee but he everwise
 compressing with both hands my lips forbad
 come follow me my life shall be the pledge
 if i deceive thee kill me as thou wilt
 to whom penelope discrete replied 90
 ah dearest nurse sagacious as thou art
 thou little know'st to scan the counsels wise
 of the eternal gods but let us seek
 my son however that i may behold
 the suitors dead and him by whom they died
 so saying she left her chamber musing much
 in her descent whether to interrogate
 her lord apart or whether to imprint
 at once his hands with kisses and his brows
 o'erpassing light the portalstep of stone 100
 she enter'd he sat opposite illumed
 by the hearth's sprightly blaze and close before
 a pillar of the dome waiting with eyes
 downcast till viewing him his noble spouse
 should speak to him but she sat silent long
 her faculties in mute amazement held
 by turns she riveted her eyes on his
 and seeing him so foul attired by turns
 she recognized him not then spake her son
 telemachus and her silence thus reprov'd 110
 my mother ah my hapless and my most
 obdurate mother wherefore thus aloof
 shunn'st thou my father neither at his side
 sitting affectionate nor utt'ring word
 another wife lives not who could endure
 such distance from her husband newreturn'd
 to his own country in the twentieth year
 after much hardship but thy heart is still
 as ever less impressible than stone
 to whom penelope discrete replied 120
 i am all wonder o my son my soul
 is stunn'd within me pow'r to speak to him
 or to interrogate him have i none
 or ev'n to look on him but if indeed
 he be ulysses and have reach'd his home
 i shall believe it soon by proof convinced
 of signs known only to himself and me
 she said then smiled the hero toilinured
 and in wing'd accents thus spake to his son
 leave thou telemachus thy mother here 130
 to sift and prove me she will know me soon
 more certainly she sees me illattired
 and squalid now therefore she shews me scorn
 and no belief hath yet that i am he
 but we have need thou and myself of deep
 deliberation if a man have slain
 one only citizen who leaves behind
 few interested to avenge his death
 yet flying he forsakes both friends and home
 but we have slain the noblest princes far 140
 of ithaca on whom our city most
 depended therefore i advise thee think
 him prudent then answer'd telemachus
 be that thy care my father for report
 proclaims _thee_ shrewdest of mankind with whom
 in ingenuity may none compare
 lead thou to follow thee shall be our part
 with prompt alacrity nor shall i judge
 courage be wanting to our utmost force
 thus then replied ulysses everwise 150
 to me the safest counsel and the best
 seems this first wash yourselves and put ye on
 your tunics bid ye next the maidens take
 their best attire and let the bard divine
 harping melodious play a sportive dance
 that whether passenger or neighbour near
 all may imagine nuptials held within
 so shall not loud report that we have slain
 all those alarm the city till we gain
 our woods and fields where once arriv'd such plans 160
 we will devise as jove shall deign to inspire
 he spake and all obedient in the bath
 first laved themselves then put their tunics on
 the damsels also dress'd and the sweet bard
 harping melodious kindled strong desire
 in all of jocund song and graceful dance
 the palace under all its vaulted roof
 remurmur'd to the feet of sportive youths
 and cinctured maidens while no few abroad
 hearing such revelry within remark'd 170
 the queen with many wooers weds at last
 ah fickle and unworthy fair too frail
 always to keep inviolate the house
 of her first lord and wait for his return
 so spake the people but they little knew
 what had befall'n eurynome meantime
 with bath and unction serv'd the illustrious chief
 ulysses and he saw himself attired
 royally once again in his own house
 then pallas over all his features shed 180
 superior beauty dignified his form
 with added amplitude and pour'd his curls
 like hyacinthine flow'rs down from his brows
 as when some artist by minerva made
 and vulcan wise to execute all tasks
 ingenious borders silver with a wreath
 of gold accomplishing a graceful work
 such grace the goddess o'er his ample chest
 copious diffused and o'er his manly brows
 he godlike stepping from the bath resumed 190
 his former seat magnificent and sat
 opposite to the queen to whom he said
 penelope the gods to thee have giv'n
 of all thy sex the most obdurate heart
 another wife lives not who could endure
 such distance from her husband newreturn'd
 to his own country in the twentieth year
 after such hardship but prepare me nurse
 a bed for solitary i must sleep
 since she is iron and feels not for me 200
 him answer'd then prudent penelope
 i neither magnify thee sir nor yet
 depreciate thee nor is my wonder such
 as hurries me at once into thy arms
 though my remembrance perfectly retains
 such as he was ulysses when he sail'd
 on board his bark from ithacago nurse
 prepare his bed but not within the walls
 of his own chamber built with his own hands
 spread it without and spread it well with warm 210
 mantles with fleeces and with richest rugs
 so spake she proving him108 and not untouch'd
 with anger at that word thus he replied
 penelope that order grates my ear
 who hath displaced my bed the task were hard
 e'en to an artist other than a god
 none might with ease remove it as for man
 it might defy the stoutest in his prime
 of youth to heave it to a different spot
 for in that bed elaborate a sign 220
 a special sign consists i was myself
 the artificer i fashion'd it alone
 within the court a leafy olive grew
 lofty luxuriant pillarlike in girth
 around this tree i built with massy stones
 cemented close my chamber roof'd it o'er
 and hung the glutinated portals on
 i lopp'd the ample foliage and the boughs
 and sev'ring near the root its solid bole
 smooth'd all the rugged stump with skilful hand 230
 and wrought it to a pedestal well squared
 and modell'd by the line i wimbled next
 the frame throughout and from the olivestump
 beginning fashion'd the whole bed above
 till all was finish'd plated o'er with gold
 with silver and with ivory and beneath
 close interlaced with purple cordage strong
 such sign i give thee but if still it stand
 unmoved or if some other sev'ring sheer
 the olive from its bottom have displaced 240
 my bedthat matter is best known to thee
 he ceas'd she conscious of the sign so plain
 giv'n by ulysses heard with flutt'ring heart
 and fault'ring knees that proof weeping she ran
 direct toward him threw her arms around
 the hero kiss'd his forehead and replied
 ah my ulysses pardon mefrown not
 thou who at other times hast ever shewn
 superior wisdom all our griefs have flow'd
 from the gods' will they envied us the bliss 250
 of undivided union sweet enjoy'd
 through life from early youth to latest age
 no be not angry now pardon the fault
 that i embraced thee not as soon as seen
 for horror hath not ceased to overwhelm
 my soul lest some false alien should perchance
 beguile me for our house draws num'rous such
 jove's daughter argive helen ne'er had given
 free entertainment to a stranger's love
 had she foreknown that the heroic sons 260
 of greece would bring her to her home again
 but heav'n incited her to that offence
 who never else had even in her thought
 harbour'd the foul enormity from which
 originated even our distress
 but now since evident thou hast described
 our bed which never mortal yet beheld
 ourselves except and actoris my own
 attendant giv'n me when i left my home
 by good icarius and who kept the door 270
 though hard to be convinced at last i yield
 so saying she awaken'd in his soul
 pity and grief and folding in his arms
 his blameless consort beautiful he wept
 welcome as land appears to those who swim
 whose gallant bark neptune with rolling waves
 and stormy winds hath sunk in the wide sea
 a mariner or two perchance escape
 the foamy flood and swimming reach the land
 weary indeed and with incrusted brine 280
 all rough but oh how glad to climb the coast
 so welcome in her eyes ulysses seem'd
 around whose neck winding her snowy arms
 she clung as she would loose him never more
 thus had they wept till rosyfinger'd morn
 had found them weeping but minerva check'd
 night's almost finish'd course and held meantime
 the golden dawn close pris'ner in the deep
 forbidding her to lead her coursers forth
 lampus and pha�ton that furnish light 290
 to all the earth and join them to the yoke
 then thus ulysses to penelope
 my love we have not yet attain'd the close
 of all our sufferings but unmeasured toil
 arduous remains which i must still atchieve
 for so the spirit of the theban seer
 inform'd me on that day when to enquire
 of mine and of my people's safe return
 i journey'd down to pluto's drear abode
 but let us hence to bed there to enjoy 300
 tranquil repose my love make no delay
 him answer'd then prudent penelope
 thou shalt to bed at whatsoever time
 thy soul desires since the immortal gods
 give thee to me and to thy home again
 but thou hast spoken from the seer of thebes
 of arduous toils yet unperform'd declare
 what toils thou wilt disclose them as i judge
 hereafter and why not disclose them now
 to whom ulysses everwise replied 310
 ah conversant with woe why would'st thou learn
 that tale but i will tell it thee at large
 thou wilt not hear with joy nor shall myself
 with joy rehearse it for he bade me seek
 city after city bearing as i go
 a shapely oar till i shall find at length
 a people who the sea know not nor eat
 food salted they trim galley crimsonprow'd
 have ne'er beheld nor yet smoothshaven oar
 with which the vessel wing'd scuds o'er the waves 320
 he gave me also this authentic sign
 which i will tell thee in what place soe'er
 i chance to meet a trav'ler who shall name
 the oar on my broad shoulder borne a van109
 he bade me planting it on the same spot
 worship the king of ocean with a bull
 a ram and a lascivious boar then seek
 my home again and sacrifice at home
 an hecatomb to the immortal gods
 inhabitants of the expanse above 330
 so shall i die at length the gentlest death
 remote from ocean it shall find me late
 in soft serenity of age the chief
 of a blest peoplethus he prophesied
 him answer'd then penelope discrete
 if heav'n appoint thee in old age a lot
 more tranquil hope thence springs of thy escape
 some future day from all thy threaten'd woes
 such was their mutual conf'rence sweet meantime
 eurynome and euryclea dress'd 340
 their bed by light of the clear torch and when
 dispatchful they had spread it broad and deep
 the ancient nurse to her own bed retired
 then came eurynome to whom in trust
 the chambers appertain'd and with a torch
 conducted them to rest she introduced
 the happy pair and went transported they
 to rites connubial intermitted long
 and now recover'd gave themselves again110
 meantime the prince the herdsman and the good 350
 eum�us giving rest each to his feet
 ceased from the dance they made the women cease
 also and to their sev'ral chambers all
 within the twilight edifice repair'd
 at length with conjugal endearment both
 satiate ulysses tasted and his spouse
 the sweets of mutual converse she rehearsed
 noblest of women all her num'rous woes
 beneath that roof sustain'd while she beheld
 the profligacy of the suitorthrong 360
 who in their wooing had consumed his herds
 and fatted flocks and drawn his vessels dry
 while brave ulysses in his turn to her
 related his successes and escapes
 and his afflictions also he told her all
 she listen'd charm'd nor slumber on his eyes
 fell once or ere he had rehearsed the whole
 beginning he discoursed how at the first
 he conquer'd in ciconia and thence reach'd
 the fruitful shores of the lotophagi 370
 the cyclops' deeds he told her next and how
 he well avenged on him his slaughter'd friends
 whom pitiless the monster had devour'd
 how to the isle of �olus he came
 who welcom'd him and safe dismiss'd him thence
 although not destin'd to regain so soon
 his native land for o'er the fishy deep
 loud tempests snatch'd him sighing back again
 how also at telepylus he arrived
 town of the l�strygonians who destroyed 380
 his ships with all their mariners his own
 except who in his sable bark escaped
 of guileful circe too he spake deepskill'd
 in various artifice and how he reach'd
 with sails and oars the squalid realms of death
 desirous to consult the prophet there
 theban tiresias and how there he view'd
 all his companions and the mother bland
 who bare him nourisher of his infant years
 how next he heard the sirens in one strain 390
 all chiming sweet and how he reach'd the rocks
 erratic scylla and charybdis dire
 which none secure from injury may pass
 then how the partners of his voyage slew
 the sun's own beeves and how the thund'rer jove
 hurl'd down his smoky bolts into his bark
 depriving him at once of all his crew
 whose dreadful fate he yet himself escaped
 how to ogygia's isle he came where dwelt
 the nymph calypso who enamour'd wish'd 400
 to espouse him and within her spacious grot
 detain'd and fed and promis'd him a life
 exempt for ever from the sap of age
 but him moved not how also he arrived
 after much toil on the ph�acian coast
 where ev'ry heart revered him as a god
 and whence enriching him with brass and gold
 and costly raiment first they sent him home
 at this last word oblivious slumber sweet
 fell on him dissipating all his cares 410
 meantime minerva goddess azureeyed
 on other thoughts intent soon as she deem'd
 ulysses with connubial joys sufficed
 and with sweet sleep at once from ocean rous'd
 the goldenaxled chariot of the morn
 to illumine earth then from his fleecy couch
 the hero sprang and thus his spouse enjoined
 oh consort dear already we have striv'n
 against our lot till wearied with the toil
 my painful absence thou with ceaseless tears 420
 deploring and myself in deep distress
 withheld reluctant from my native shores
 by jove and by the other pow'rs of heav'n
 but since we have in this delightful bed
 met once again watch thou and keep secure
 all my domestic treasures and ere long
 i will replace my num'rous sheep destroy'd
 by those imperious suitors and the greeks
 shall add yet others till my folds be fill'd
 but to the woodlands go i nowto see 430
 my noble father who for my sake mourns
 continual as for thee my love although
 i know thee wise i give thee thus in charge
 the sun no sooner shall ascend than fame
 shall wide divulge the deed that i have done
 slaying the suitors under my own roof
 thou therefore with thy maidens sit retired
 in thy own chamber at the palacetop
 nor question ask nor curious look abroad
 he said and cov'ring with his radiant arms 440
 his shoulders called telemachus he roused
 eum�us and the herdsman too and bade
 all take their martial weapons in their hand
 not disobedient they as he enjoin'd
 put armour on and issued from the gates
 ulysses at their head the earth was now
 enlighten'd but minerva them in haste
 led forth into the fields unseen by all


 footnotes

 108 the proof consisted in thisthat the bed being attached to the
 stump of an olive tree still rooted was immovable and ulysses having
 made it himself no person present he must needs be apprized of the
 impossibility of her orders if he were indeed ulysses accordingly this
 demonstration of his identity satisfies all her scruples

 argument

 mercury conducts the souls of the suitors down to ades ulysses discovers
 himself to laertes and quells by the aid of minerva an insurrection of
 the people resenting the death of the suitors


 and now cyllenian hermes summon'd forth
 the spirits of the suitors waving wide
 the golden wand of pow'r to seal all eyes
 in slumber and to ope them wide again
 he drove them gibb'ring down into the shades111
 as when the bats within some hallow'd cave
 flit squeaking all around for if but one
 fall from the rock the rest all follow him
 in such connexion mutual they adhere
 so after bounteous mercury the ghosts 10
 troop'd downward gibb'ring all the dreary way111
 the ocean's flood and the leucadian rock
 the sun's gate also and the land of dreams
 they pass'd whence next into the meads they came
 of asphodel by shadowy forms possess'd
 simulars of the dead they found the souls
 of brave pelides there and of his friend
 patroclus of antilochus renown'd
 and of the mightier ajax for his form
 and bulk achilles sole except of all 20
 the sons of the achaians most admired
 these waited on achilles then appear'd
 the mournful ghost of agamemnon son
 of atreus compass'd by the ghosts of all
 who shared his fate beneath �gisthus' roof
 and him the ghost of peleus' son bespake
 atrides of all heroes we esteem'd
 thee dearest to the gods for that thy sway
 extended over such a glorious host
 at ilium scene of sorrow to the greeks 30
 but fate whose ruthless force none may escape
 of all who breathe pursued thee from the first
 thou should'st have perish'd full of honour full
 of royalty at troy so all the greeks
 had rais'd thy tomb and thou hadst then bequeath'd
 great glory to thy son but fate ordain'd
 a death oh how deplorable for thee
 to whom atrides' spirit thus replied
 blest son of peleus semblance of the gods
 at ilium far from argos fall'n for whom 40
 contending many a trojan many a chief
 of greece died also while in eddies whelm'd
 of dust thy vastness spread the plain112 nor thee
 the chariot aught or steed could int'rest more
 all day we waged the battle nor at last
 desisted but for tempests sent from jove
 at length we bore into the greecian fleet
 thy body from the field there first we cleansed
 with tepid baths and oil'd thy shapely corse
 then placed thee on thy bier while many a greek 50
 around thee wept and shore his locks for thee
 thy mother also hearing of thy death
 with her immortal nymphs from the abyss
 arose and came terrible was the sound
 on the salt flood a panic seized the greeks
 and ev'ry warrior had return'd on board
 that moment had not nestor ancient chief
 illumed by long experience interposed
 his counsels ever wisest wisest proved
 then also and he thus address'd the host 60
 sons of achaia fly not stay ye greeks
 thetis arrives with her immortal nymphs
 from the abyss to visit her dead son
 so he and by his admonition stay'd
 the greeks fled not then all around thee stood
 the daughters of the ancient of the deep
 mourning disconsolate with heav'nly robes
 they clothed thy corse and all the muses nine
 deplored thee in full choir with sweetest tones
 responsive nor one greecian hadst thou seen 70
 dryeyed such grief the muses moved in all
 full sev'nteen days we day and night deplored
 thy death both gods in heav'n and men below
 but on the eighteenth day we gave thy corse
 its burning and fat sheep around thee slew
 num'rous with many a pastur'd ox moonhorn'd
 we burn'd thee clothed in vesture of the gods
 with honey and with oil feeding the flames
 abundant while achaia's heroes arm'd
 both horse and foot encompassing thy pile 80
 clash'd on their shields and deaf'ning was the din
 but when the fires of vulcan had at length
 consumed thee at the dawn we stored thy bones
 in unguent and in undiluted wine
 for thetis gave to us a golden vase
 twinear'd which she profess'd to have received
 from bacchus work divine of vulcan's hand
 within that vase achilles treasured lie
 thine and the bones of thy departed friend
 patroclus but a sep'rate urn we gave 90
 to those of brave antilochus who most
 of all thy friends at ilium shared thy love
 and thy respect thy friend patroclus slain
 around both urns we piled a noble tomb
 we warriors of the sacred argive host
 on a tall promontory shooting far
 into the spacious hellespont that all
 who live and who shall yet be born may view
 thy record even from the distant waves
 then by permission from the gods obtain'd 100
 to the achaian chiefs in circus met
 thetis appointed games i have beheld
 the burial rites of many an hero bold
 when on the death of some great chief the youths
 girding their loins anticipate the prize
 but sight of those with wonder fill'd me most
 so glorious past all others were the games
 by silverfooted thetis giv'n for thee
 for thou wast ever favour'd of the gods
 thus hast thou not achilles although dead 110
 foregone thy glory but thy fair report
 is universal among all mankind
 but as for me what recompense had i
 my warfare closed for whom at my return
 jove framed such dire destruction by the hands
 of fell �gisthus and my murth'ress wife
 thus mutual they conferr'd meantime approach'd
 swift messenger of heav'n the argicide
 conducting thither all the shades of those
 slain by ulysses at that sight amazed 120
 both moved toward them agamemnon's shade
 knew well amphimedon for he had been
 erewhile his father's guest in ithaca
 and thus the spirit of atreus' son began
 amphimedon by what disastrous chance
 cooevals as ye seem and of an air
 distinguish'd all descend ye to the deeps
 for not the chosen youths of a whole town
 should form a nobler band perish'd ye sunk
 amid vast billows and rude tempests raised 130
 by neptune's pow'r or on dry land through force
 of hostile multitudes while cutting off
 beeves from the herd or driving flocks away
 or fighting for your city and your wives
 resolve me i was once a guest of yours
 remember'st not what time at your abode
 with godlike menelaus i arrived
 that we might win ulysses with his fleet
 to follow us to troy scarce we prevail'd
 at last to gain the citywaster chief 140
 and after all consumed a whole month more
 the wide sea traversing from side to side
 to whom the spirit of amphimedon
 illustrious agamemnon king of men
 all this i bear in mind and will rehearse
 the manner of our most disastrous end
 believing brave ulysses lost we woo'd
 meantime his wife she our detested suit
 would neither ratify nor yet refuse
 but planning for us a tremendous death 150
 this novel stratagem at last devised
 beginning in her own recess a web
 of slend'rest thread and of a length and breadth
 unusual thus the suitors she address'd
 princes my suitors since the noble chief
 ulysses is no more enforce not yet
 my nuptials wait till i shall finish first
 a fun'ral robe lest all my threads decay
 which for the ancient hero i prepare
 laertes looking for the mournful hour 160
 when fate shall snatch him to eternal rest
 else i the censure dread of all my sex
 should he so wealthy want at last a shroud
 so spake the queen we unsuspicious all
 with her request complied thenceforth all day
 she wove the ample web and by the aid
 of torches ravell'd it again at night
 three years she thus by artifice our suit
 eluded safe but when the fourth arrived
 and the same season after many moons 170
 and fleeting days return'd a damsel then
 of her attendants conscious of the fraud
 reveal'd it and we found her pulling loose
 the splendid web thus through constraint at length
 she finish'd it and in her own despight
 but when the queen produced at length her work
 finish'd newblanch'd bright as the sun or moon
 then came ulysses by some adverse god
 conducted to a cottage on the verge
 of his own fields in which his swineherd dwells 180
 there also the illustrious hero's son
 arrived soon after in his sable bark
 from sandy pylus borne they plotting both
 a dreadful death for all the suitors sought
 our glorious city but ulysses last
 and first telemachus the father came
 conducted by his swineherd and attired
 in tatters foul a mendicant he seem'd
 timeworn and halted on a staff so clad
 and ent'ring on the sudden he escaped 190
 all knowledge even of our eldest there
 and we reviled and smote him he although
 beneath his own roof smitten and reproach'd
 with patience suffer'd it awhile but roused
 by inspiration of jove �gisarm'd
 at length in concert with his son convey'd
 to his own chamber his resplendent arms
 there lodg'd them safe and barr'd the massy doors
 then in his subtlety he bade the queen
 a contest institute with bow and rings 200
 between the hapless suitors whence ensued
 slaughter to all no suitor there had pow'r
 to overcome the stubborn bow that mock'd
 all our attempts and when the weapon huge
 at length was offer'd to ulysses' hands
 with clamour'd menaces we bade the swain
 withhold it from him plead he as he might
 telemachus alone with loud command
 bade give it him and the illustrious chief
 receiving in his hand the bow with ease 210
 bent it and sped a shaft through all the rings
 then springing to the portal steps he pour'd
 the arrows forth peer'd terrible around
 pierced king antino�s and aiming sure
 his deadly darts pierced others after him
 till in one common carnage heap'd we lay
 some god as plain appear'd vouchsafed them aid
 such ardour urged them and with such dispatch
 they slew us on all sides hideous were heard
 the groans of dying men fell'd to the earth 220
 with headstrokes rude and the floor swam with blood
 such royal agamemnon was the fate
 by which we perish'd all whose bodies lie
 unburied still and in ulysses' house
 for tidings none have yet our friends alarm'd
 and kindred who might cleanse from sable gore
 our clotted wounds and mourn us on the bier
 which are the rightful privilege of the dead
 him answer'd then the shade of atreus' son
 oh happy offspring of laertes shrewd 230
 ulysses matchless valour thou hast shewn
 recov'ring thus thy wife nor less appears
 the virtue of icarius' daughter wise
 the chaste penelope so faithful found
 to her ulysses husband of her youth
 his glory by superior merit earn'd
 shall never die and the immortal gods
 shall make penelope a theme of song
 delightful in the ears of all mankind
 not such was clytemnestra daughter vile 240
 of tyndarus she shed her husband's blood
 and shall be chronicled in song a wife
 of hateful memory by whose offence
 even the virtuous of her sex are shamed
 thus they beneath the vaulted roof obscure
 of pluto's house conferring mutual stood
 meantime descending from the citygates
 ulysses by his son and by his swains
 follow'd arrived at the delightful farm
 which old laertes had with strenuous toil 250
 himself long since acquired there stood his house
 encompass'd by a bow'r in which the hinds
 who served and pleased him ate and sat and slept
 an ancient woman a sicilian dwelt
 there also who in that sequester'd spot
 attended diligent her aged lord
 then thus ulysses to his followers spake
 haste now and ent'ring slay ye of the swine
 the best for our regale myself the while
 will prove my father if his eye hath still 260
 discernment of me or if absence long
 have worn the knowledge of me from his mind
 he said and gave into his servants' care
 his arms they swift proceeded to the house
 and to the fruitful grove himself as swift
 to prove his father down he went at once
 into the spacious gardenplot but found
 nor dolius there nor any of his sons
 or servants they were occupied elsewhere
 and with the ancient hind himself employ'd 270
 collecting thorns with which to fence the grove
 in that umbrageous spot he found alone
 laertes with his hoe clearing a plant
 sordid his tunic was with many a patch
 mended unseemly leathern were his greaves
 thongtied and also patch'd a frail defence
 against sharp thorns while gloves secured his hands
 from briarpoints and on his head he bore
 a goatskin casque nourishing hopeless woe
 no sooner then the hero toilinured 280
 saw him ageworn and wretched than he paused
 beneath a lofty peartree's shade to weep
 there standing much he mused whether at once
 kissing and clasping in his arms his sire
 to tell him all by what means he had reach'd
 his native country or to prove him first
 at length he chose as his best course with words
 of seeming strangeness to accost his ear
 and with that purpose moved direct toward him
 he stooping low loosen'd the earth around 290
 a gardenplant when his illustrious son
 now standing close beside him thus began
 old sir thou art no novice in these toils
 of culture but thy garden thrives i mark
 in all thy ground no plant fig olive vine
 peartree or flow'rbed suff'ring through neglect
 but let it not offend thee if i say
 that thou neglect'st thyself at the same time
 oppress'd with age sunparch'd and illattired
 not for thy inactivity methinks 300
 thy master slights thee thus nor speaks thy form
 or thy surpassing stature servile aught
 in thee but thou resemblest more a king
 yesthou resemblest one who bathed and fed
 should softly sleep such is the claim of age
 but tell me truefor whom labourest thou
 and whose this garden answer me beside
 for i would learn have i indeed arrived
 in ithaca as one whom here i met
 ev'n now assured me but who seem'd a man 310
 not overwise refusing both to hear
 my questions and to answer when i ask'd
 concerning one in other days my guest
 and friend if he have still his being here
 or have deceas'd and journey'd to the shades
 for i will tell thee therefore mark long since
 a stranger reach'd my house in my own land
 whom i with hospitality receiv'd
 nor ever sojourn'd foreigner with me
 whom i lov'd more he was by birth he said 320
 ithacan and laertes claim'd his sire
 son of arcesias introducing him
 beneath my roof i entertain'd him well
 and proved by gifts his welcome at my board
 i gave him seven talents of wrought gold
 a goblet argent all with flow'rs emboss'd
 twelve single cloaks twelve carpets mantles twelve
 of brightest lustre with as many vests
 and added four fair damsels whom he chose
 himself well born and well accomplish'd all 330
 then thus his ancient sire weeping replied
 stranger thou hast in truth attain'd the isle
 of thy enquiry but it is possess'd
 by a rude race and lawless vain alas
 were all thy num'rous gifts yet hadst thou found
 him living here in ithaca with gifts
 reciprocated he had sent thee hence
 requiting honourably in his turn
 thy hospitality but give me quick
 answer and true how many have been the years 340
 since thy reception of that hapless guest
 my son for mine my own dear son was he
 but him far distant both from friends and home
 either the fishes of the unknown deep
 have eaten or wild beasts and fowls of prey
 nor i or she who bare him was ordain'd
 to bathe his shrouded body with our tears
 nor his chaste wife welldow'r'd penelope
 to close her husband's eyes and to deplore
 his doom which is the privilege of the dead 350
 but tell me also thou for i would learn
 who art thou whence where born and sprung from whom
 the bark in which thou and thy godlike friends
 arrived where is she anchor'd on our coast
 or cam'st thou only passenger on board
 another's bark who landed thee and went
 to whom ulysses everwise replied
 i will with all simplicity relate
 what thou hast ask'd of alybas am i
 where in much state i dwell son of the rich 360
 apheidas royal polypemon's son
 and i am named eperitus by storms
 driven from sicily i have arrived
 and yonder on the margin of the field
 that skirts your city i have moor'd my bark
 five years have pass'd since thy ulysses left
 unhappy chief my country yet the birds
 at his departure hovered on the right
 and in that sign rejoicing i dismiss'd
 him thence rejoicing also for we hoped 370
 to mix in social intercourse again
 and to exchange once more pledges of love
 he spake then sorrow as a sable cloud
 involved laertes gath'ring with both hands
 the dust he pour'd it on his rev'rend head
 with many a piteous groan ulysses' heart
 commotion felt and his stretch'd nostrils throbb'd
 with agony closepent while fixt he eyed
 his father with a sudden force he sprang
 toward him clasp'd and kiss'd him and exclaim'd 380
 my father i am he thou seest thy son
 absent these twenty years at last return'd
 but bid thy sorrow cease suspend henceforth
 all lamentation for i tell thee true
 and the occasion bids me briefly tell thee
 i have slain all the suitors at my home
 and all their taunts and injuries avenged
 then answer thus laertes quick return'd
 if thou hast come again and art indeed
 my son ulysses give me then the proof 390
 indubitable that i may believe
 to whom ulysses everwise replied
 view first the scar which with his iv'ry tusk
 a wild boar gave me when at thy command
 and at my mother's to autolycus
 her father on parnassus i repair'd
 seeking the gifts which while a guest of yours
 he promis'd should be mine accept beside
 this proof i will enum'rate all the trees
 which walking with thee in this cultured spot 400
 boy then i begg'd and thou confirm'dst my own
 we paced between them and thou mad'st me learn
 the name of each thou gav'st me thirteen pears113
 ten apples113 thirty figs113 and fifty ranks
 didst promise me of vines their alleys all
 corncropp'd between there oft as sent from jove
 the influences of the year descend
 grapes of all hues and flavours clust'ring hang
 he said laertes conscious of the proofs
 indubitable by ulysses giv'n 410
 with fault'ring knees and fault'ring heart both arms
 around him threw the hero toilinured
 drew to his bosom close his fainting sire
 who breath recov'ring and his scatter'd pow'rs
 of intellect at length thus spake aloud
 ye gods oh then your residence is still
 on the olympian heights if punishment
 at last hath seized on those flagitious men
 but terrour shakes me lest incensed ere long
 all ithaca flock hither and dispatch 420
 swift messengers with these dread tidings charged
 to ev'ry cephallenian state around
 him answer'd then ulysses everwise
 courage fear nought but let us to the house
 beside the garden whither i have sent
 telemachus the herdsman and the good
 eum�us to prepare us quick repast
 so they conferr'd and to laertes' house
 pass'd on together there arrived they found
 those three preparing now their plenteous feast 430
 and mingling sable wine then by the hands
 of his sicilian matron the old king
 was bathed anointed and attired afresh
 and pallas drawing nigh dilated more
 his limbs and gave his whole majestic form
 encrease of amplitude he left the bath
 his son amazed as he had seen a god
 alighted newly from the skies exclaim'd
 my father doubtless some immortal pow'r
 hath clothed thy form with dignity divine 440
 then thus replied his venerable sire
 jove pallas phoebus oh that i possess'd
 such vigour now as when in arms i took
 nericus continental city fair
 with my brave cephallenians oh that such
 and arm'd as then i yesterday had stood
 beside thee in thy palace combating
 those suitors proud then had i strew'd the floor
 with num'rous slain to thy exceeding joy
 such was their conference and now the task 450
 of preparation ended and the feast
 set forth on couches and on thrones they sat
 and ranged in order due took each his share
 then ancient dolius and with him his sons
 arrived toilworn by the sicilian dame
 summon'd their cat'ress and their father's kind
 attendant ever in his eve of life
 they seeing and recalling soon to mind
 ulysses in the middle mansion stood
 wond'ring when thus ulysses with a voice 460
 of some reproof but gentle them bespake
 old servant sit and eat banishing fear
 and mute amazement for although provoked
 by appetite we have long time abstain'd
 expecting ev'ry moment thy return
 he said then dolius with expanded arms
 sprang right toward ulysses seized his hand
 kiss'd it and in wing'd accents thus replied
 oh master ever dear since thee the gods
 themselves in answer to our warm desires 470
 have unexpectedly at length restored
 hail and be happy and heav'n make thee such
 but say and truly knows the prudent queen
 already thy return or shall we send
 ourselves an herald with the joyful news
 to whom ulysses everwise replied
 my ancient friend thou may'st release thy mind
 from that solicitude she knows it well
 so he then dolius to his glossy seat
 return'd and all his sons gath'ring around 480
 ulysses welcom'd him and grasp'd his hand
 then sat beside their father thus beneath
 laertes' roof they joyful took repast
 but fame with rapid haste the city roam'd
 in ev'ry part promulging in all ears
 the suitors' horrid fate no sooner heard
 the multitude that tale than one and all
 groaning they met and murmuring before
 ulysses' gates bringing the bodies forth
 they buried each his friend but gave the dead 490
 of other cities to be ferried home
 by fishermen on board their rapid barks
 all hasted then to council sorrow wrung
 their hearts and the assembly now convened
 arising first eupithes spake for grief
 sat heavy on his soul grief for the loss
 of his antino�s by ulysses slain
 foremost of all whom mourning thus he said
 my friends no trivial fruits the greecians reap
 of this man's doings _those_ he took with him 500
 on board his barks a num'rous train and bold
 then lost his barks lost all his num'rous train
 and _these_ our noblest slew at his return
 come thereforeere he yet escape by flight
 to pylus or to noble elis realm
 of the epeans follow him else shame
 attends us and indelible reproach
 if we avenge not on these men the blood
 of our own sons and brothers farewell then
 all that makes life desirable my wish 510
 henceforth shall be to mingle with the shades
 oh then pursue and seize them ere they fly
 thus he with tears and pity moved in all
 then medon and the sacred bard whom sleep
 had lately left arriving from the house
 of laertiades approach'd amid
 the throng they stood all wonder'd seeing them
 and medon prudent senior thus began
 hear me my countrymen ulysses plann'd
 with no disapprobation of the gods 520
 the deed that ye deplore i saw myself
 a pow'r immortal at the hero's side
 in semblance just of mentor now the god
 in front apparent led him on and now
 from side to side of all the palace urged
 to flight the suitors heaps on heaps they fell
 he said then terrour wan seiz'd ev'ry cheek
 and halitherses hero old the son
 of mastor who alone among them all
 knew past and future prudent thus began 530
 now o ye men of ithaca my words
 attentive hear by your own fault my friends
 this deed hath been perform'd for when myself
 and noble mentor counsell'd you to check
 the sin and folly of your sons ye would not
 great was their wickedness and flagrant wrong
 they wrought the wealth devouring and the wife
 dishonouring of an illustrious chief
 whom they deem'd destined never to return
 but hear my counsel go not lest ye draw 540
 disaster down and woe on your own heads
 he ended then with boist'rous roar although
 part kept their seats upsprang the multitude
 for halitherses pleased them not they chose
 eupithes' counsel rather all at once
 to arms they flew and clad in dazzling brass
 before the city form'd their dense array
 leader infatuate at their head appear'd
 eupithes hoping to avenge his son
 antino�s but was himself ordain'd 550
 to meet his doom and to return no more
 then thus minerva to saturnian jove
 oh father son of saturn jove supreme
 declare the purpose hidden in thy breast
 wilt thou that this hostility proceed
 or wilt thou grant them amity again
 to whom the cloudassembler god replied
 why asks my daughter didst thou not design
 thyself that brave ulysses coming home
 should slay those profligates act as thou wilt 560
 but thus i counsel since the noble chief
 hath slain the suitors now let peace ensue
 oathbound and reign ulysses evermore
 the slaughter of their brethren and their sons
 to strike from their remembrance shall be ours
 let mutual amity as at the first
 unite them and let wealth and peace abound
 so saying he animated to her task
 minerva prompt before and from the heights
 olympian down to ithaca she flew 570
 meantime ulysses for their hunger now
 and thirst were sated thus address'd his hinds
 look ye abroad lest haply they approach
 he said and at his word forth went a son
 of dolius at the gate he stood and thence
 beholding all that multitude at hand
 in accents wing'd thus to ulysses spake
 they comethey are already arrivedarm all
 then all arising put their armour on
 ulysses with his three and the six sons 580
 of dolius dolius also with the rest
 arm'd and laertes although silverhair'd
 warriors perforce when all were clad alike
 in radiant armour throwing wide the gates
 they sallied and ulysses led the way
 then jove's own daughter pallas in the form
 and with the voice of mentor came in view
 whom seeing laertiades rejoiced
 and thus telemachus his son bespake
 now oh my son thou shalt observe untold 590
 by me where fight the bravest oh shame not
 thine ancestry who have in all the earth
 proof given of valour in all ages past
 to whom telemachus discrete replied
 my father if thou wish that spectacle
 thou shalt behold thy son as thou hast said
 in nought dishonouring his noble race
 then was laertes joyful and exclaim'd
 what sun hath ris'n today114 oh blessed gods
 my son and grandson emulous dispute 600
 the prize of glory and my soul exults
 he ended and minerva drawing nigh
 to the old king thus counsell'd him oh friend
 whom most i love son of arcesias pray'r
 preferring to the virgin azureeyed
 and to her father jove delay not shake
 thy lance in air and give it instant flight
 so saying the goddess nerved his arm anew
 he sought in pray'r the daughter dread of jove
 and brandishing it hurl'd his lance it struck 610
 eupithes pierced his helmet brazencheek'd
 that stay'd it not but forth it sprang beyond
 and with loud clangor of his arms he fell
 then flew ulysses and his noble son
 with faulchion and with spear of double edge
 to the assault and of them all had left
 none living none had to his home return'd
 but that jove's virgin daughter with a voice
 of loud authority thus quell'd them all
 peace o ye men of ithaca while yet 620
 the field remains undeluged with your blood
 so she and fear at once paled ev'ry cheek
 all trembled at the voice divine their arms
 escaping from the grasp fell to the earth
 and covetous of longer life each fled
 back to the city then ulysses sent
 his voice abroad and with an eagle's force
 sprang on the people but saturnian jove
 cast down incontinent his smouldring bolt
 at pallas' feet and thus the goddess spake 630
 laertes' noble son for wiles renown'd
 forbear abstain from slaughter lest thyself
 incur the anger of high thund'ring jove
 so pallas whom ulysses glad obey'd
 then faithful covenants of peace between
 both sides ensued ratified in the sight
 of pallas progeny of jove who seem'd
 in voice and form the mentor known to all
